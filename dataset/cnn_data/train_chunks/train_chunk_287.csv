"(CNN) -- A second woman in Southern California is alleging sexual abuse by a teacher who resigned last week after being confronted by another alleged female victim on a YouTube video, she said Thursday. The second alleged victim filed a complaint this week accusing the Val Verde Unified School District of negligence when the girl, then a 14-year-old middle schooler, was allegedly sexually abused by the teacher during the 2009-2010 school year, the complaint said. The woman, who appeared at a press conference with her attorney on Thursday, is now 18 years old. ""This should have never happened, and I don't wish this upon anybody. My mother was the first victim by convincing my mother that she would do great in my life, and she turned my thinking that, that all I need was her,"" the woman told reporters. ""There was a lot of manipulation in the time. This should (have) never happened if the district would (have) done their job,"" she added. The claim seeks unspecified monetary damages and charges that the school district ""knew about (the teacher's) propensity to sexually abuse and/or sexually harass students before the claimant was injured and damaged by being sexually molested."" Officials with the school district, based in Perris, about 65 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, declined to comment on the allegations. ""We are not making any comments but we did receive a claim. We are cooperating with authorities,"" said Chris Wynn, chief of security. The girl has also filed a complaint against the nearby Riverside Unified School District for ""negligently"" providing ""positive information"" about the teacher when she applied for a job with Val Verde. The teacher once worked for the Riverside school system. Riverside school officials acknowledged the claim. ""We did receive the claim, but we are not commenting,"" said spokeswoman Jacquie Paul. The teacher has not responded to CNN's phone and e-mail requests for comment. The educator resigned Friday from her most recent job as an administrator with the Alhambra Unified School District after a woman, now 28, posted a YouTube video in which she accused the educator of abusing her at age 12. The video features the alleged victim on camera and the teacher's voice on a phone. In the video, the teacher can be heard acknowledging the abuse. In that case, police have launched an investigation, but the statute of limitations may be an issue, Riverside Police Lt. Guy Toussaint said. It all depends on what the investigation reveals and what crimes may have occurred. On Thursday, the Riverside Police Department confirmed a second alleged victim in its investigation into the educator. ""On January 17, RPD started our initial investigation from the YouTube video. During the investigation during some point a second victim came forward and the detectives are now looking into the second victim's allegations. And at this point it's an ongoing investigation,"" said Lt. Val Graham of Riverside Police Department. The alleged second victim's attorney, Luis A. Carrillo of South Pasadena, said he and the girl will speak with Riverside police on Friday to file a formal complaint about the alleged sexual abuse. ""We are cooperating with the investigation and that's why she can't speak about the details about what happened,"" Carrillo said. ""Something good has to come out of something bad, and that's why we want changes, positive changes in the law."" The first alleged victim said the abuse took place ""off and on"" between the ages of 12 and 18. She said she didn't come forward as a teenager because the teacher had brainwashed her. ""She told me that my family didn't love me. She told me that nobody cared about me and that she was the only one that loved me and the only one that was there for me,"" she said. ""She made me believe that she was my only friend, and that I could trust her."" She said she didn't want a physical relationship, but the teacher threatened her multiple times. ""She said that she would kill herself if I ever left. And I believed that,"" she said.","Second alleged victim accuses teacher of sexually abusing her in middle school .

"(CNN) -- Soon after the great white shark chomped into his torso, Steven Robles thought everything was over. ""I really thought that that might be it. I thought I might be dying,"" he said. Instead, the long-distance swimmer is recovering from the wounds -- but might never return to the water. The trauma of the attack is still too vivid. On Saturday, a 7-foot-long shark near Manhattan Beach, California, became agitated by a fisherman's hook. It apparently took out its frustration on Robles, who was swimming nearby. ""We saw each other. It did a sharp left turn and then it lunged right at me, didn't even hesitate,"" Robles said. ""I could feel the vibration of this entire shark gnawing into my skin,"" he said. ""You could feel the whole body shaking as it's digging into my torso."" The burning sensation of the bite is hard to forget. ""The bite mark's like a jellyfish sting that just keeps penetrating deeper and deeper into the bone,"" Robles said. ""It was terrifying."" He grabbed the shark's nose with his hand and tried to pry him off. Fortunately, the shark left on his own and darted away. A witness's cell phone video posted by CNN affiliate KTLA showed Robles screaming loudly as fellow swimmers tried to help him to shore. Witnesses on the pier screamed that the shark was still close by. All the swimmers in the water made it to shore safely. Human remains found in search for woman 'taken' by large shark . Police closed down the Manhattan Beach Pier, and it will remain closed until Tuesday. While shark attacks are rare, they have increased at a steady rate since 1900 ""with each decade having more attacks than the previous,"" according to the International Shark Attack File based in Gainesville, Florida. But the ISAF says there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks on humans in 2013 -- the lowest number of global attacks since 2009, when 67 attacks occurred. The group emphasized that an increasing number of shark attacks doesn't mean the rate of attacks is increasing. ISAF research shows people are spending more time at sea, which increases the interactions between humans and sharks. Robles said even though he thought he might be dying, his survival instincts kicked in. ""My life was just a half a second from ending, and I had to fight for my life,"" he said. Just before the attack, Robles said he was planning another long-distance swim. But now he says he might never swim in the open water again. One-ton shark headed to Texas coast .

"(EW.com ) -- Marvel's got a new star (or five) in its roster: Guardians of the Galaxy launched to an estimated $94 million this weekend in 4,080 theaters, setting a new record for an August debut. (The previous winner was 2007's The Bourne Ultimatum, with $69.3 million.) That's the third biggest opening of 2014 so far, behind Transformers: Age of Extinction ($100 million) and Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($95 million). It's also the seventh best opening in history for a non-sequel (or sixth if you count Marvel's The Avengers as a mega-sequel), outpacing other superhero series debuts such as 2011's Thor ($65.7 million) and 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger ($65.1 million). One more fun stat: Guardians is Marvel's ninth (!) consecutive No. 1 movie, a streak that reaches back to Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012), which debuted at No. 3. Guardians was a $170 million gamble for Marvel that featured unfamiliar characters and an untested lead actor, Parks and Rec favorite Chris Pratt, who stars with Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. But a marketing campaign that highlighted the movie's outer-space action and sarcastic, Iron Man-esque tone (not to mention Pratt's newly sculpted physique) drew early buzz, and the movie's release brought a wave of critical praise: Guardians scored a great 92 percent from reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes and an A- from EW's Chris Nashawaty, who called it ""a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery."" With an A CinemaScore, the PG-13 adventure looks likely to perform well in the coming weeks—and Marvel recently announced that a sequel is already in the works. The movie also earned $66.4 million overseas, bringing its global gross to a stellar $160.4 million. The weekend's other new wide release, the James Brown biopic Get On Up, earned an estimated $14 million, coming in at third place. Directed by Tate Taylor (The Help) and starring Chadwick Boseman (42), the musical drama reportedly cost $30 million and received generally favorable reviews from critics, though EW's Nashawaty noted that it plays too ""safe"" for a biopic about the Godfather of Soul. With an A CinemaScore, the movie could have legs. The film may also be opening too early to get the big-time awards attention that helped past music biopics like Ray, which opened to $20 million on its way to $75.3 million in 2004, or the genre's all-time champ, 2005's Walk the Line, which bowed to $22.3 million and ultimately grossed $119.5 million. Get On Up didn't have the box office moves to unseat Lucy in the No. 2 spot. The Luc Besson action pic, starring Scarlett Johansson as a super-intelligent avenger (not to be confused with the super-intelligent Avenger she plays in the Marvelverse), grossed $18.3 million this weekend, bringing its two-week domestic haul to $79.6 million — a hugely impressive performance for a first-time character without a book, comic, or TV series behind her. In fourth place, Hercules bulked up another $10.7 million in its second weekend, contributing to a $52.4 million total for the Dwayne Johnson vehicle. And Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, now in its fourth weekend, earned an estimated $8.7 million, bringing its domestic cume to $189.3 million — the eighth best of 2014 so far. 1. Guardians of the Galaxy -- $94 million (new) 2. Lucy -- $18.3 million ($79.6 million total) 3. Get On Up -- $14 million (new) 4. Hercules — $10.7 million ($52.3 million total) 5. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes-- $8.7 million Friday ($189.3 million total) In the specialty market, two critical darlings raised their theater counts with promising results: The Philip Seymour Hoffman thriller A Most Wanted Man expanded into 729 theaters, earning $3.3 million for a total of $7.1 million, while Richard Linklater's time-spanning opus Boyhood grew to 311 theaters and earned $2.52 million this weekend, bringing its total to $7.57 million.

"(CNN) -- For 460 days, they held her captive. They beat her, sexually assaulted her, kept her locked in a pitch-black room with chains around her ankles. And yet, Amanda Lindhout says she forgives her abductors. ""When one human can create suffering or another, it always comes from a place of their own suffering,"" she says. And the men who took her hostage -- some no more than 14 years old -- had endured a ""great deal of suffering"" in their own lives, she says. Lindhout, a Canadian freelance journalist, was 27 when she arrived in Mogadishu, Somalia, in August 2008. Three days in, she and her crew were ambushed in their car by young men brandishing AK-47s. They took Lindhout, her photographer Nigel Brennan, their drivers and fixer. The drivers and fixer that had accompanied Lindhout were released after a few months. She and her photojournalist Nigel Brennan were held for a total of 15. Lindhout's story of survival, detailed in a book last year, has now been picked up by a Hollywood studio for a movie starring Academy Award nominated actress Rooney Mara. ""I spent 460 days in captivity,"" Amanda told CNN. Fungus grew on her skin. Her hair fell out in clumps. She had abcessed teeth. A sobbing call to Omni TV during her captivity showed her desperation. ""I don't want to die here and I'm afraid I'll die of a disease if I don't get help soon,"" she said in the call. Lindhout and Brennan were released in November 2009 after their families paid a $600,000 ransom. In her story of survival, ""A House In The Sky,"" Lindhout talked about the courage it took to survive. ""I really discovered the strength of the human spirit that is alive in all of us,"" she said. Lindhout's harrowing story prompted Mara to spend a weekend with her. Now Mara, best known for her work in ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" and ""Side Effects,"" Mara plans to star in a film optioned by Annapurna Pictures -- the production company behind blockbusters, such as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""American Hustle."" Lindhout is working to change the country where she once lost her freedom. Shortly after her release, she began an organization to empower women and children in Somalia. The Global Enrichment Foundation (GEF) provides development for Somalis through education, medical care and food aid. Lindhout says the organization is working to change the environment the children of Somalia grow up in, so that the cycle of violence ends. Somalia is one of the poorest nations on the planet, and often touted as ""the most dangerous country in the world."" The foundation's goal, Lindhout says, is to bring growth -- and peace.","Lindhout was abducted three days after arriving in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- From an explosion of social games and iPhone apps to the rise of motion controls, cloud computing and retro revivals, 2010 has been a year of surprises and revelations for gaming enthusiasts. But it's also been a generous one to PC and home console owners, with dozens of gob-smacking titles available for almost every system. Between the launch of long-awaited epics such as ""Gran Turismo 5"" and ""BioShock 2,"" and the return of heavyweights such as ""NBA Jam"" and ""GoldenEye 007,"" choosing the year's top 10 titles is a Herculean task. It's doubly so when you consider how subjective every player's list is, with one man's ""World of Warcraft: Cataclysm"" another's ""Fallout: New Vegas."" That said, here are the 10 games that most captured my attention this year, whether through technical innovation or sheer thumb-waggling goodness. Which ones make your own personal best list? Be sure to write in and let us know in the comments section below. 1. ""Heavy Rain"" (Sony, PlayStation 3) -- An interactive thriller that raises the bar for adventure gaming by injecting genuine choice and emotion into its suspenseful nonlinear narrative. It features storytelling that's every bit as gripping and cinematic as anything Hollywood produces. 2. ""Red Dead Redemption"" (Rockstar Games, PlayStation 3/Xbox 360) -- The game industry's equivalent of a Spaghetti Western, this sprawling open-world tale of outlaw justice wows with its atmospheric setting, wealth of play styles and gritty take on gunslinger culture. 3. ""Super Mario Galaxy 2"" (Nintendo, Wii) -- The cartoon Italian stallion rides high again, bounding about 3-D candy-colored worlds collecting coins, swiping power-ups and using dinosaur pal Yoshi's prehensile tongue to battle enemies. This is his best platform-hopping escapade since ""Super Mario 64."" 4. ""Mass Effect 2"" (Electronic Arts, PC/Xbox 360) -- An entire galaxy's worth of colorful characters, clever dialogue and gripping plotlines await in this futuristic role-playing odyssey, whose tale skillfully straddles the line between detailed stat-crunching and action-packed gunplay. 5. ""Rock Band 3"" (MTV Games, PlayStation 3/Xbox 360/Wii) -- A high note for even the critically acclaimed music game franchise, this installment outdoes itself by introducing keyboards, more realistic instrument play and countless ways to live out your MTV fantasies. 6. ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" (Activision, PC/PlayStation 3/Xbox 360/Wii) -- Rewinds the best-selling first-person shooter series to the Cold War era, ratchets up the pyrotechnics and, most importantly, offers months of trigger-mashing replay value by providing millions of willing online victims. 7. ""FIFA 11"" (EA Sports, PC/PlayStation 2/PlayStation3/PSP/Xbox 360) -- Brings home the virtual World Cup with its lifelike athletes, simple yet deep design mechanics and spirited online play, making it a fast, fun and surprisingly accessible choice, however comfortable you are in cleats. 8. ""God of War 3"" (Sony, PlayStation 3) -- Say what you will about its bucketfuls of blood, histrionic rage and penchant for melodrama, but this gory Greek tragedy delivers some of the most brutal button-mashing mayhem ever seen on home consoles. 9. ""StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty"" (Blizzard, PC) -- Roughly 12 years in the making and so big it had to be split into three parts, this futuristic real-time strategy epic stunned critics by actually living up to the hype. In an age of kinder, gentler social and casual titles, it also underscored hardcore PC gaming's continued relevance and appeal. 10. ""Halo: Reach"" (Microsoft, Xbox 360) -- Despite sticking to the by-now-familiar sci-fi run-n-gun formula, this sequel offered massive, multitiered stages and a raft of endlessly entertaining online multiplayer modes to ensure you'll be ventilating squealing aliens well into 2011.","CNN gaming contributor Scott Steinberg offers his favorite video games of the year .

"(Wired) -- When Apple CEO Tim Cook took the stage at the All Things Digital Conference Tuesday night, he wasn't just answering questions from Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher — he was also dropping hints about the future of Apple's product roadmap. Sure, a lot of his answers just regurgitated the same pat, familiar themes we've heard from Cook and other Apple executives: The iPad is taking the world by storm. The iPhone's doing great. The iPod has been the gateway drug for a new generation of Apple and Mac users. But even Tim Cook can't completely stick to the script. During his interview, he teased a few interesting tidbits — which we present here along with analysis on what his words actually mean. Siri should improve in the near future . Last week a former Apple employee reportedly said that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs would have ""lost his mind"" over Siri, and that employees are embarrassed by the virtual assistant. But luckily for Apple, any embarrassment should soon abate. ""There's more that [Siri] can do, and we have a lot of people working on this,"" Cook said. ""And I think you will be really pleased with some of the things you'll see over the coming months on this. We have some cool ideas about what Siri can do. We have a lot going on on this."" Clearly, Apple wants to evolve Siri, and lift its current ""beta"" status. A recent study may have found that 66 percent of iPhone 4S users are either ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with Siri, but Apple has still been hit with a class-action suit from users who feel Siri was deceptively advertised. In a final, non-beta version of Siri, Apple's virtual assistant would be better equipped to parse the nuances of human dialog. We should be able to talk to Siri as if she were an actual assistant. If a query needs clarification, she should be able to ask you much more specific questions to determine exactly what you need. Romney iPhone app misspells 'America' to Web's delight . Siri's capabilities should also expand via new database partnerships. Yelp and Wolfram|Alpha are great wealths of information, but Siri needs even more sources of human intelligence. In the original Siri iOS app, you could make OpenTable restaurant reservations using Siri. I would expect this and similar functionality to return. You should also be able to use Siri to post tweets, and eventually Facebook status updates as well (other virtual assistant apps already do this). I would imagine that Apple will eventually open up Siri to third-party developers, so they could incorporate her voice recognition, dictation, and search features within their own apps, making Siri useful and ubiquitous system-wide. IBM worries iPhone's Siri has loose lips . Apple's leaving wearables to third parties . Don't expect Apple to debut a headset or wrist-worn iDevice any time soon. Apple hasn't bought into the wearable fad, illustrated most notably by the Nike Fuel Band and Pebble Smartwatch. On the topic of wearables, Cook said: . ""I have on a Nike Fuel Band. I think there are some cool things that can be done. I think it is an interesting area. The question is, Can it change somebody's behavior? The book hasn't been written on that yet."" Of course, Apple does promote the iPod nano as a watch replacement, so it's not like the company is completely ignoring the trend. But, for now, it looks like Apple won't be releasing any trendy wearable gadgets to jump on the bandwagon — and, in fact, there's no need to. Developing new hardware, especially in the relatively immature wearable space, takes a lot of time, money, and intellectual resources. So Apple has much more to gain by letting other manufacturers make wearable accessories — which inevitably hook into Apple's existing ecosystem via iOS apps. Apple reaps the benefit of increased iDevice purchases and upgrades, and even takes a 30 percent cut of any paid app that a wearable computing manufacturer might sell. Expect Facebook-Apple collaboration . Historically, Apple and Facebook haven't always seen eye-to-eye — a collaboration between Facebook and Apple reportedly failed prior to the release of Apple's Ping social network, and Facebook has since cozied up with Microsoft on its Windows Phone platform. Nonetheless, it doesn't look like past conflicts are preventing Apple and Facebook from working together in the future. ""I think the relationship is very solid,"" Cook said of Apple's relationship with Facebook. ""We have great respect for them. I think we can do more with them. Just stay tuned on this one."" Just stay tuned? Cook might as well just have told us, ""Yes, Facebook and Apple are teaming up right now."" iOS already features deep Twitter integration, and significant Facebook integration is a glaring omission. It's not a stretch to think iOS 6 could yield greater Facebook integration like what the OS already provides for Twitter (indeed, code in an iOS 5 beta hinted at just such a thing). Perhaps we'll find out more during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in a few weeks' time. Or perhaps we'll have to wait until the next iPhone is announced, likely in October. Whatever the case, we have to assume that Cook wants to see Facebook tools integrated throughout the mobile OS. Apple is deeply interested in the TV space . Apple is widely rumored to be working on its own TV set, which many consumers are eager to get their hands on. Cook is still playing coy about the subject, but more than ever before it sounds like Apple is actively exploring the TV space. ""This is an area of intense interest for us,"" Cook said about the Apple TV set-top box, the company's current living-room content solution. ""We are going to keep pulling the string and see where this takes us."" Could it take Apple to a full-fledged television set? Cook wouldn't directly say. Instead, he commented on Apple's strategy upon entering a new product area: ""We would look not just at this area, but other areas, and ask, Can we control the key technology? Can we make a significant contribution far beyond what others have done in this area? Can we make a product that we all want? ... Those are all the things we would ask about any new product category."" Cook didn't answer his own questions, but we can. Can Apple control the key technology? Yes. Apple already dominates manufacturing in a number of overseas factories. It's a master of supply-chain control. There should be little doubt that Apple can control the key technology, both on the manufacturing side, and the patents-software side. Can Apple make a significant contribution to the TV space? Yes. Through a dedicated, TV-optimized version of Siri and a smart TV UI based on trademark Apple simplicity and aesthetics, Apple could advance the state of TV usability. Can Apple make a TV we all want? Yes. As we reported above, consumers are excited by the prospect of an Apple-branded HD television. Come on, Tim! The questions you posed are softballs. You've basically announced that an iTV is all but inevitable. No more lost iPhones? ""We're going to double down on secrecy on products,"" Cook said. ""But, on other things — supplier responsibility, environmental issues, etc., Apple will be the most transparent company."" In a one-year period, Apple reportedly lost two iPhones: an iPhone 4 prototype in the spring of 2010 that made its way onto Gizmodo, and an iPhone 4S prototype that never made it into the public eye. And just this week, 9to5 Mac scored some images of what could be the next iPhone. For a company that likes to keep upcoming product information under lock and key, such mishaps are monumental. Perhaps Apple will implement a new or different product testing program — one that doesn't involve its beta testers drinking at bars? Joking aside, keeping multiple thousands of Foxconn workers from pulling out their own cameras and sending a few shots to the press for a quick buck would be a huge endeavor. Apple's next lines of defense might involve much more sophisticated device tagging, and elaborate sting operations, using deliberate bits of misinformation to smoke out moles who are giving up secrets. Ping's days are numbered . ""We tried Ping and I think the customer voted and said this isn't something that I want to put a lot of energy into,"" Cook said. ""Will we kill it? I don't know, I'll look at it."" The first day Ping came out, we were excited to check it out and join the music-centric social network. Unfortunately, it just didn't stick, and Apple's aware of that. Rather than make a big announcement about its demise, we'd hazard that Apple will likely quietly put it to pasture some time in the next year or two.

"(CNN) -- Eight people in China have been indicted for their roles in an attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday, citing local authorities. Authorities in the restive Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in western China accused the suspects of organizing, leading and participating as a terrorist group and endangering public security. The people were indicted Friday. The eight are to stand trial in Urumqi, the capital of the region, where Chinese authorities have cracked down on violence involving Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The Tiananmen incident occurred October 28, when a vehicle drove through security barriers into a crowd in the square. It crashed into a pedestrian bridge in front of the Forbidden City and burst into flames. The attack killed five people, including three in the vehicle, and wounded 40 others. Not along after that attack, one Islamic militant group called the strike a ""jihadi operation"" and warned of more violence to come. In a speech posted online, Abdullah Mansour, the leader of the Turkestan Islamic Party, said those who carried out the attack were ""mujahideen,"" the SITE Intelligence group said in a report. East Turkestan is the name used by many Uyghur groups to refer to Xinjiang. Chinese authorities accuse Uyghurs of carrying out the Beijing attack and have cranked up efforts to thwart violence after two recent high-profile strikes in the Xinjiang region. Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 injured when men armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming in March. The following month, an attack on a train station in Urumqi left three dead, including the attackers, and an attack on an Urumqi market this month killed at least 39. In response, police in Xinjiang launched a crackdown on extremist groups, arresting 200 suspects and seizing hundreds of explosive devices, Chinese state media reported this week. The state's anti-terrorist force has been beefed up in Xinjiang and security tightened across the country. On Wednesday, a Chinese court sentenced 55 people on terrorism charges before thousands of onlookers in a stadium in Xinjiang. The trial was held in a stadium in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture before about 7,000 spectators, according to reports. The accused were found guilty by the Higher People's Court of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of charges including intentional homicide, separatism and organizing, leading and participating in terrorist activities. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. Uyghurs are said to have faced widespread discrimination, including in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","There are long-festering grievances among the Uyghur people .

"(CNN)  -- The public will get the other side of the story of the South Carolina governor sex scandal sooner, as the governor's estranged wife Jenny Sanford's memoir publishing date has been moved up. Sanford's book,  ""Staying True,"" will now hit bookstores on February 5 instead of the original April release date, the book's publisher, Ballantine Books, announced Tuesday. Sanford landed the book deal in September, a few months after her husband, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, admitted having an affair with an Argentine woman. In December, Jenny Sanford released a statement,saying she was filing for divorce ""after many unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation."" According to a synopsis of the book on the publisher's Web site, her memoir ""reveals the private ordeal behind her very public betrayal -- and offers inspiration for anyone struggling to keep faith during life's most trying times."" ""She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told,"" the synopsis reads. After the governor made a nationally televised admission about his affair, there were calls for Sanford's resignation and investigations by media organizations and the state Ethics Commission into whether he tapped taxpayer resources for personal use. In November, the ethics panel charged Sanford with 37 violations of the state ethics code. The commission will hear arguments involving those civil charges some time this year. CNN's Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","Jenny Sanford's book,  ""Staying True,"" will hit bookstores on February 5 .

"(CNN) -- On July 13, 2013, a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon Martin. The former neighborhood watchman never denied fatally shooting the unarmed teen, but he said he did so because he feared for his life. The intensely watched murder trial inspired passionate debate about race relations in America, gun laws, profiling and self-defense, and a good deal more. Here's where some of the key players are one year after the verdict. George Zimmerman . Zimmerman has popped up a few times post-verdict. Just days after his acquittal, he helped rescue of a family of four from an overturned SUV. His wife, Shellie, filed for divorce in September, citing irreconcilable differences -- and in November, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault for a domestic dispute with his girlfriend. Prosecutors dropped the case in December after Zimmerman's girlfriend recanted part of her story. Since then, he says, he has turned to painting as a ""creative"" way to express himself, and that he would like to pursue a legal career. In the meantime, he remains unemployed, and the nearly $500,000 raised online for his defense is at a near zero balance. The U.S. Department of Justice investigation into whether Zimmerman violated Martin's rights is still ongoing. Bids for George Zimmerman artwork top $100,000 . Zimmerman's parents sue Roseanne Barr over tweets . Judge Debra Nelson . Nelson is still serving as a circuit judge in Seminole County, Florida. She had taken the Zimmerman case near the end of her one-year rotation in the criminal courts. After presiding over the high-profile trial, she went back to handling civil cases. Ironically, she presided at the related case Zimmerman v. NBC. She ruled recently that Zimmerman was not entitled to any money from the network, effectively dismissing his allegations that NBC portrayed him as racist by selective news editing. As of July 1, Nelson is back for another turn in criminal courts. Benjamin Crump . The colorful attorney who represented Trayvon Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, has been busy, taking on several high-profile cases spanning the nation. Crump regularly speaks at conferences on race relations and is currently representing the family of Robbie Tolan, a former baseball player shot in Texas by a police officer in 2008. The case was dismissed in 2012 by a federal appeals court, but in May, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled the court failed to consider the Tolan family's accounts. Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin . Trayvon Martin's parents have been actively engaged in working to change ""stand your ground"" laws and speaking to groups and conventions around the country about ethnic profiling and prevention of violent crimes. Fulton and Martin are heavily involved in a foundation they established in their son's name, which provides stipends to families who have lost children to gun violence. Angela Corey . The tough-talking prosecutor continues to take on high-profile cases as the state attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida. In February, her office argued a case against Michael Dunn, accused of shooting at four teens in a vehicle after complaining about the volume of their music. Jordan Davis, 17, was killed. Trial results were mixed: Jurors found Dunn guilty on three counts of attempted second-degree murder, but deadlocked on the first-degree murder charge for Davis' death. Dunn's retrial is expected to begin in September, after which he will be sentenced for his previous convictions. Mark O'Mara . The defense lawyer was inundated with calls after his victory defending the man who was once described as ""the most hated man in America."" O'Mara, who does not currently represent George Zimmerman, is now flush with new business and is a current CNN legal contributor. Of the approximately $2.5 million legal fees racked up over the course of the trial, O'Mara and co-counsel Don West each received a single payment of approximately 2.4% of the total costs -- or about $30,000 each. There is no expectation of further payments. Bill Lee . The ousted former Sanford, Florida, police chief, who took the brunt of criticism about how the initial investigation in the shooting was conducted, is now working as a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Orlando Regional Operations Center Public Integrity Squad. As an investigator, he looks into alleged misconduct of public officials, including in-custody deaths and officer-involved shootings. Lee is no longer a supervisor, but FDLE colleagues say he is a ""tremendous asset"" to the team. Rachel Jeantel . The bombshell prosecution witness, who captivated trial-watchers, graduated from an alternative high school in Miami in May. A cadre of supporters took Jeantel, 20, under their collective wings after she was subjected to scathing public criticism over her appearance, demeanor and speech during the trial. After Jeantel appeared on CNN last July, popular morning radio talk show host Tom Joyner offered financial assistance to pay her way through college. Jeantel says she's interested in pursuing a postsecondary degree and is weighing whether she wants to attend college or go to fashion school. Jurors . To date, little is known about the mainly faceless jurors who deliberated for more than 16 hours before rendering George Zimmerman's fate. Five white women and one black Hispanic woman were on the main panel; four alternate jurors, two men and two women, were also selected. Juror B29 told ABC she believed Zimmerman ""got away with murder"" but that she had to ""grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence."" Alternate juror E54 told WOFL he ""supported the verdict."" Juror B37, the first juror to speak, told CNN that Zimmerman was ""justified in shooting Trayvon Martin"" but that he ""had good in his heart, he just went overboard."" She initially planned to write a book about her experience but withdrew after major backlash against her comments.","Zimmerman found not guilty in death of Travyon Martin on July 13, 2013 .

"(CNN) -- You might have heard the World Cup is about to start. Turn on any television set in any country and it won't be long before you're being bombarded by a relentless stream of World Cup adverts as manufacturers seek to cash in on football's greatest sporting event, which is held every four years. ""There seems to be a new one every day, it's relentless,"" M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment CEO Steve Martin told CNN, reflecting on the advertising drive. ""It seems every time you turn on the TV there's a World Cup advert,"" added Martin. ""It's called the World Cup for a reason and it tends to cut across all countries and all markets. ""The danger for a lot of brands jumping on the bandwagon is they're not part of it, but I think there's a very savvy audience now that knows who's jumping on the bandwagon and who isn't."" Here is CNN's guide to 10 World Cup-related adverts. 10. Adidas' $84 million advert replicates a Hollywood movie trailer with the likes of Argentina's Lionel Messi and Uruguay's Luis Suarez filmed in a range of locations from the Copacabana beach to a German forest. Messi and co. are depicted preparing for the World Cup, before they eventually arrive in Brazil and take to the field for a game of football. ""I don't think the bigger companies (like Adidas) shy away from making more touching adverts (than just a game of football), but I just think because they are pure football brands, pure sports brands, they have to take an approach that falls in line with that, while doing so in an entertaining way,"" said Martin. 9. British broadcaster BBC's inspiration derives from Toy Story, with its short film showing four football figures -- one voiced by England great Gary Lineker -- escaping from a toy box and attempting to reach the World Cup in Brazil. Divided into separate installments, the ad attempts to reawaken that little child in all of us that struggles to sleep at night due to the sheer anticipation and excitement as the greatest show on earth edges ever closer. ""There's nothing bigger than the World Cup, it transcends everything and all audiences,"" Martin says. ""I think it's an opportunity for brands to be part of that conversation to get the very big audiences."" 8. The majority of advertising campaigns look to please as many people as possible with the aim of convincing them that their brand is the be-all and end-all. Puma, however, has gone for a more confrontational approach. ""El Fantasma del 50 ya esta en Brasil"" -- ""The 1950 Ghost is in Brazil"" -- plays on the host's darkest sporting hour when they failed to win the 1950 World Cup, with Uruguay winning the event. In less than a minute, a Uruguayan ghost manages to frighten half of Rio de Janeiro, and in the process adds further fuel to an already heated rivalry. Strong stuff, but has Puma succeeded in alienating Brazil's 200 million inhabitants? 7. Supporters adore their players and the players themselves have a mutual love for their fans -- or so we are led to believe. ING Belgium's three-minute film depicts the Red Devils' squad messing about -- think Eden Hazard on triangle and Kevin Mirallas on cowbells -- and generally having a whale of a time with their fans. The advert's payoff comes in the shape of Mousa Dembele and Jan Vertonghen playing a practical joke on Vincent Kompany. 6. Conjured up on a similarly-grand scale to the Adidas offering, Nike treats us to a game of football played out by a bunch of very good players. Sound familiar? The match starts off as a kickabout between friends, before morphing into the more familiar game taking place in front of thousands of screaming fans. Cristiano Ronaldo's girlfriend and the Incredible Hulk are on hand to inject some humor. ""It's become this great on-pitch battle, the battle of the brands around the World Cup and everybody looks forward to it from a brand perspective,"" said Martin. ""It's really interesting territory as everybody almost can't wait to see what's around the corner from all the brands."" said Martin. 5. The beautiful thing about the beautiful game is that it can be played by anyone, anywhere, as long of course, you have a ball. Fast food company McDonald's has picked up the theme for its World Cup offering, showing -- in various locations around the world -- people from all walks of life presenting their footballing tricks to the camera. So rather than allowing the usual big-name players to take all the glory, we have the likes of a young boy, an old man and a woman in high heels playing the starring roles. What's more, there's not a single Big Mac in sight. 4. Nike and Adidas may battle it out each year for the title of who can produce the biggest football advert on the grandest of scales, but they now have a new challenger -- Beats by Dre. You could be forgiven for thinking you had stumbled upon a Brazilian cinematic thriller as this advert -- entitled ""The Game Before The Game""-- gets underway. Brazil star Neymar's father opens proceedings by handing down some advice to his son on the eve of the World Cup, while we are treated to some jaw-dropping shots of Rio de Janeiro. With the big kickoff fast approaching, players and fans alike are shown preparing in a brooding film that suggests half the battle of a football match is won in the head. ""You expect it from the big brands, but I think we're going to see some more clever and more imaginative work coming out over the next few weeks,"" said Martin. ""More and more companies are now getting involved."" 3. Chilean beer Cristal goes for the horror genre in its advertising campaign. With Chile up against it in Brazil 2014's ""Group of Death"" -- also featuring Spain, Netherlands and Australia -- Cristal tries to offer the nation a helping hand. Over three different adverts, an opposing supporter is given the creeps in the comforts of their own homes, before the slogan ""Chile is scary"" appears. Assuming that Chile will advance to the knockout stages, a fourth advert has been created, with fans of such nations from England to Japan the next to be started up. 2. Mobile phone company Movistar goes one step further than ING Belgium in attempting to break down that barrier between players and supporters. Spain stars Xabi Alonso, Andres Iniesta, Santi Cazorla, Pepe Reina and Juanfran are all given a makeover to disguise themselves before they go off to work with ordinary people in a range of differing professions. We see Iniesta working in a restaurant kitchen, Alonso helping out at a hospital and Santi Cazorla working as a gardener in a film made as a tribute to the population of Spain. Backed with the motto ""we will make an effort for you,"" Real Madrid's Alonso touchingly shaves an aging man in hospital. ""I like the idea a lot, and it's a clear example of getting it spot-on,"" said Martin. ""You can get it spot on like this one, or it can easily be a hit-and-miss. The ones that are more creative and have a bit more of a storyline to them are more real."" 1. The miners of the 2010 Copiapo mining accident are Banco de Chile's inspiration for its offering as ""Los 32"" -- a member of the original ""Los 33"" was actually Bolivian -- rally the troops ahead of the World Cup. Miners' spokesman Mario Sepulveda offers a rousing call to arms and urges his compatriots not to fear Chile's ""Group of Death."" Pathos is added with images of the miners' time trapped underground and their eventual rescue, not to mention an epic soundtrack and setting. ""You've got to be smart, you've got to be creative and you've got to be able to tap into people's passions in a credible way (when making an advert), as opposed to just throwing ideas and content out there which can turn you off very quickly,"" said Martin. ""But do it right and you can make people buy into it and make them feel very emotional about the content that they've seen, like this advert does. ""What's nice about the Chilean advert is it adds real emotion and a human touch to things that aren't fantasy land, while it remains pretty grounded. And as a result it gives you goose pimples when you watch it."" Read more in our Flipboard World Cup Glories magazine .","Television screens filled with World Cup adverts .

"Washington (CNN) -- The speech President Barack Obama plans to deliver on his Middle East policy has not yet been written, said a senior administration official, but ""it will likely reference"" the death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of U.S. Navy SEALs. When asked if the long-planned speech had now taken on greater significance, the official acknowledged that getting bin Laden did offer ""a new al Qaeda narrative."" Another senior administration official said the president is likely to make the point that ""popular movements in the region demanding greater freedom and opportunity represent a thorough rejection of the message of al-Qaeda and bin Laden."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the first to make mention of the speech last month. At Wednesday's press briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president would deliver the speech ""in the relatively near future."" Another top aide told CNN ""it could happen before the Europe trip."" Obama is scheduled to depart May 22 on a six-day trip to Poland, Ireland, England and France. Unlike his Cairo speech in June 2009 that focused on winning the hearts and minds of the Muslim world, this one is expected to deal with regional flashpoints -- from the anti-government uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""I think it's a speech to a broader audience than just the Arab world,"" Carney said.","Middle East talk could happen before May 22 trip, official says .

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old woman who handled ducks in northern China has died in Beijing from bird flu, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Nantong of Jiangsu province, China, last month, where the H5N1 virus was discovered. The woman, Huang Yanqing, died Monday morning after she was admitted to hospital on December 27, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. Huang had been in close contact with ducks at a market in Hebei Province, which neighbors Beijing, on December 19. She bought nine ducks from the market and cleaned the dead fowl before giving them to some relatives and friends, Xinhua reported. Only Huang fell ill, though she had close contact with 116 people, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. Zhao Qingchao, an official with the local government in Langfang City where the market is located, told Xinhua that they have taken steps to detect the source of the deadly virus. No other cases of the H5N1 avian influenza have been reported from the same area, Xinhua reported. Authorities have disinfected and isolated the woman's home, and officials met in Beijing on Monday about the case, but the market is still selling ducks, Xinhua reported. H5N1 has led to 248 deaths worldwide since 2003, including 21 in China, according to the WHO.","The woman died Monday after she was admitted to hospital on December 27 .

"(CNN) -- An 18-year-old Florida student is set to return to class Wednesday after he says he was suspended when school officials learned of his pornographic online photos and videos. Robert Marucci, a senior at Cocoa High School in Cocoa, Florida, told CNN affiliate WKMG that he picked up his X-rated gig to help his mom pay the bills. His mom, Melyssa Lieb, said when students discovered the explicit material online, her son became a target. ""He was bullied, he was threatened."" Then, according to Lieb, her son was suspended, because the principal didn't approve of his after-school activities. Lieb told CNN affiliate WPLG, ""I think that it is Dr. (Stephanie) Soliven's morals and her personal beliefs and I don't think that this is anybody's business except for my son's. The children at the school found (the porn), and she didn't do anything to stop it."" According to WPLG, Lieb said the principal told her, ""He was expelled due to his explicit lifestyle career."" Brevard County Schools spokeswoman Michelle Irwin disputed the mother's account, saying that although a campus monitor overheard the chatter surrounding Marucci and his work, Marucci wasn't suspended as a result of his explicit videos. Instead he was suspended because of an investigation of the teen and ""possible threats"" he made, she said. Irwin told CNN Tuesday that Soliven, the principal, never had a conversation with Marucci's mother indicating her disapproval of his lifestyle and only offered resources to the teen in support of his ""alternative lifestyle."" After a four-day suspension, school administrators cleared Marucci of any suspicion Monday, and he will be allowed to return to school Wednesday, according to Irwin. Irwin also said that she wasn't aware of any bullying of Marucci and that the student never filed any formal bullying complaints. Irwin told CNN that the school district would never suspend a student for any legal career they pursue outside of school hours, saying if Marucci was ""a drug dealer for instance, that would be a different story."" A Facebook group created in support of Marucci has a little more than 500 members. Dozens of students were involved in a walkout on Friday, protesting the teen's suspension.

"(CNN) -- World number one Serena Williams won her first ever Cincinnati Open, and her 62nd career WTA title, by brushing aside Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 6-1. Williams needed just 62 minutes to dispatch her Serbian rival and win her second title in a month. The victory was the perfect preparation for the season's final major, the US Open, which begins in eight days time. ""It was such a great week,"" Williams said after the victory, before praising Ivanovic's performance. ""She was playing so hard, hitting so many winners."" Poor season . It has, by her own high standards, been a below par season for Williams. She hasn't made it to a final of a single major so far this season. And whilst her five titles this year -- in Miami, Brisbane, Stanford, Rome and now Cincinnati -- could be considered a good eight month's work for almost any other player, Williams is held, both by herself and her peers, to a higher standard. Yet Cincinnati was something of a return to form. She won nine of the last ten games, pounding 12 aces and 26 winners along the way. ""I just kind of close my eyes and serve,"" Williams said. ""When you think about it too much you get kind of crazy."" Sweet 18? Williams will hope that her first Cincinnati title is a good omen before the US Open. She turns 33 this year and is desperate to win another major singles title. If she accomplishes that in New York, she'll tie with Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who have both won 18 majors, and will be just four behind Steffi Graf who holds the record with 22. Federer 80-up . Later on Sunday Roger Federer won his sixth Cincinnati Open, and an incredible 80th career title, after beating Spain's David Ferrer 6-3, 1-6. 6-2. After taking the first set it looked like the evergreen Federer would easily close out for the championship. But Ferrer hit back in the second set 6-1 before Federer showed his fighting spirit again and took the third. It was a sensational victory for the oldest player currently in the world top 25. He will now be heading to the US Open full of confidence after reaching the final in his past four tournaments including Wimbledon.","Serena Williams beats Ana Ivanovic in the Cincinnati Open .

"(CNN) -- With about 150 million active users, the mobile photo-sharing app Instagram has become a popular way for people to document their lives. It lends itself particularly well to travel, when even the most reluctant photographer can be tempted to take a few pictures. The most Instagrammed places in the world last year included an airport, amusement parks and a Las Vegas casino. CNN journalist and avid Instagram user Jethro Mullen has racked up nearly 800,000 followers on the app. Here are his tips for getting the best out of your phone camera when you travel. 1. Get high . Everything looks better, or at least different, when seen from above. Viewing platforms, sky bars, cable car rides and overhead walkways are great for expansive perspectives. If you're shooting through a window, get your lens as close to the glass as possible to reduce unwanted light reflections. 2. Learn from locals . Nobody knows a place better than the people who live there. You can discover photogenic spots in the places you're going to visit through hashtags, geotags and the feeds of local Instagram users. When I visited Atlanta last year, a photographer I knew through Instagram pointed me in the direction of the colorful staircase you can see in photo no. 2 above. 3. Be on the look out when you're on the move . Don't tune out while in transit. Architecture and human activity at airports and rail stations often provide rich photo opportunities. And the views from planes, trains and automobiles can be compelling. Window seats offer great shots. Flights from southern China to Europe can provide majestic views of mountains on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, for example. 4. Get lost . Avoid hopping from landmark to landmark. Some of the most satisfying and memorable pictures from a trip can be those you stumble upon when exploring a less frequented area. Take some wrong turns, wander, see what you find. 5. Pack some extras . A number of gadgets allow you to get more out of your phone camera. Lens attachments, like the Olloclip, provide fisheye, wide-angle and macro options. Flexible tripods, like the GorillaPod, allow you to set up long-exposure shots using apps like Average Camera Pro and Slow Shutter Cam. Make sure you check any gear you buy is compatible with your make and model of phone. 6. Use the right apps . Native Instagram filters can undoubtedly jazz up a run-of-the-mill image. But their effects can be heavy, bludgeoning subtler elements of a photo. Editing apps like Snapseed, Afterlight (both of which I used in photo no. 6 above) and VSCO Cam allow you to tinker in a gentler manner with brightness, saturation, contrast and other aspects. I edit nearly every Instagram I take using these tools. 7. Embrace bad weather . Rain can put a dampener on a vacation, but it creates a range of appealing subjects for pictures: puddle reflections, colorful umbrellas, raindrops on windows. What's more, the sky can be at its most dynamic before and after stormy weather. To optimize puddle shots, turn your phone upside down so the lens is closer to the water's surface. 8. Plan your sunrises and sunsets . Think about where you want to be for the often rewarding light conditions at the start and end of the day. Consider how the sunlight is likely to interact with the surroundings, like trees, buildings or water. Apps like Sun Seeker can tell you the sun's predicted path through the sky. 9. Look up . In outdoor areas where your surroundings feel cramped or cluttered, try tilting your head back and seeing what lies above. In cities, clusters of skyscrapers or geometrically arranged facades work well. Natural surroundings, like forests of tall trees, can also be eye-catching. Jethro Mullen is the newsdesk editor for CNN Digital in Hong Kong, and a popular Instagrammer.","CNN's Jethro Mullen gained nearly 800,000 Instagram followers .

"(CNN) -- The Illinois Supreme Court's recent decision to permit the televising of trials in the state's circuit courts brings to mind another question of television in a court: the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will soon hear oral argument -- the fascinating, highly informative back-and-forth between the justices and the lawyers before them -- in a monumental case that will determine the constitutionality of the government's new health care plan. Everyone is interested. C-SPAN has asked the justices for permission to televise the extraordinary five-and-a-half hours of oral argument (most cases get just one hour) scheduled for March 26 through 28. But the Supreme Court, despite numerous requests and even proposed congressional action extending over several decades, has never permitted television. The justices fear the presence of cameras would tarnish the court's dignified proceedings. But bear in mind that the Supreme Court doesn't try cases, so there's no danger of uncorking sensational trials like those of O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony or Michael Jackson's doctor. That's not the issue. Chief Justice John Roberts told the annual conference of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals last June that he worries how cameras might affect both lawyers and judges. He was asked, ""Do you worry that judges might ask even more questions?"" ""I do,"" he replied emphatically. He added, a bit defensively: ""We are the most transparent branch of government."" He also questioned whether televising congressional sessions has enhanced them. In fact, there's lots of experience to point to, and the precedents are clear: television would not impair the Supreme Court's dignity or its proceedings. Two-thirds of the state supreme courts admit cameras to their oral arguments. Two federal appellate courts have allowed them. They're standard in the Supreme Court of Canada. Most of these courts have welcomed cameras for years without adverse consequences, effectively dispelling the vague worries of the justices in Washington. The Illinois Supreme Court, for example, began experimenting with TV cameras as early as 1983, according to its press secretary, Joseph R. Tybor. It now provides its own videos of oral arguments and posts them daily. It's routine and unobtrusive. Three small, silent cameras mounted in the Springfield courtroom are operated remotely by state employees in the basement of the court building. Similarly, New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, first authorized TV coverage in 1987, and since 2009 all oral arguments have been covered and posted in the court's archive, according to Gary Spencer, the court's public information officer. Coverage is provided by just two small cameras mounted on window sills at the sides of the court room, operated remotely from a studio in the basement. ""Our experience,"" Spencer said, ""is that it has not caused any problems. The more the public can learn about what leads to a decision, the more willing they are to accept it."" When the Supreme Court of Arkansas was considering television coverage, one of its justices, Robert L. Brown, undertook his own survey and found that ""state supreme courts have blazed a significant technological trail."" He wrote, in 2007, in the Journal of Appellate Practice and Process: ""The public's response, according to those state supreme courts that provide those video broadcasts, borders on the exuberant. . . [N]o state that currently provides video of its oral arguments cites grandstanding as a problem."" Justice Brown quoted the then chief justice of the California Supreme Court, Ronald M. George, as telling him that its videos provided ""the best P.R. you can imagine."" Arkansas two years ago became the 34th state supreme court to admit cameras. Judge Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain of the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco commented in the Journal of Appellate Practice and Process about his court's long experience on-camera that both judges and lawyers ""have acted with the civility and decorum appropriate to a federal appellate courtroom, by and large resisting the temptation to play to the television audience. . . My own experience with cameras in the courtroom has been overwhelmingly positive."" In Canada the proceedings of the nation's Supreme Court have been televised since the mid-1990s. Four fixed cameras, mounted high on the walls of the courtroom in Ottawa, face the bench and the counsel's podium. When a judge asks a question, she pushes a button that both opens her microphone and focuses a camera on her. ""Our judges are proud of it,"" said Andres Garin, executive legal officer of the Supreme Court of Canada. ""There's no downside. It has not been disruptive. There's no playing to the camera."" Of course, if the U.S. Supreme Court should allow television, but then finds that its presence is deleterious, the justices could always reverse their own decision. They've done it before. Americans visiting Washington stand in line for hours to see the Supreme Court in action, but there's limited space inside the ornate courtroom. However, it should be noted that the court has taken recent steps to better inform the public: it publishes transcripts of each oral argument later that same day, and each Friday it releases audio recordings of all oral arguments that week. Still, the justices should welcome television coverage, not only of the coming health care case, but of all their oral arguments. Even in this digital age of 24/7 access to almost everything, television news still reaches more people. A survey reported in January by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found that ""television remains the most widely used source for national and international news -- 66% of Americans say it is their main source of news."" TV coverage would greatly enhance public understanding of the court and its work. If the justices decide soon, unobtrusive cameras can be mounted in the courtroom in time for the historic health care oral argument in March. Then they'll be available for future cases as well.

"(CNN) -- Valentino Rossi will have to do it the hard way if he is to mark his 300th MotoGP with victory in front of his adoring home fans at Mugello. Rossi could only manage 10th fastest on his Yamaha in final qualifying, way off the pace set by the reigning world champion Marc Marquez of Spain Saturday. A lap of one minute 47.270 seconds lap gave Marquez his sixth straight pole of the 2014 campaign as he bids for his sixth successive victory for the all-conquering Repsol Honda works team. But for the 35-year-old MotoGP legend Rossi there was bitter disappointment after a mistake in tire choice left him uncompetitive. ""It was the wrong decision, I felt really bad with the softer front and I was unable to improve my lap time. ""It's a great shame, because I had a good potential and could have started on the front, my pace is good with the bike, but it's like this. Tomorrow from the fourth row everything will be harder and more difficult,"" added the Italian. Nine-time world champion Rossi has returned to form this season and chased Marquez home in the latest round in Le Mans in France, but the whole field has struggled to match the defending title holder this season. Home rider Andrea Iannone came within 0.18 seconds of snatching pole from Marquez, with Spain's two-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo on a Yamaha third fastest. Marquez's teammate Dani Pedrosa -- the lap record holder at Mugello -- was fourth best ahead of another Spaniard, Pol Espargaro of ~Yamaha. The two Ducati's of Cal Crutchlow of Great Britain and Italian Andrea Dovizioso were sixth and eighth with another Briton, Bradley Smith, in seventh. But all eyes at the circuit in Tuscany will be on the remarkable Rossi to see if he can turn a series of second places to Marquez this season into his first victory to mark his milestone.","Marc Marquez takes pole for Italian MotoGP .

"(CNN) -- Six months ago, Malala Yousafzai was lying in a hospital bed, recovering from a Taliban attack in which she was shot point-blank in the head and neck. The shooting was meant to silence, once and for all, the outspoken Pakistani teenager who had dared to defy the Taliban's ban against girls in school. But it backfired: Instead of silencing the 15-year-old, the attack only made her voice more powerful. Malala's story has raised global awareness of girls' education, a cause she has championed for years. And now that she's out of the hospital and back in school, she is determined to keep fighting for equality. She will be speaking at the United Nations this summer, and her memoir is set to be published later this year. ""God has given me this new life,"" she said in February, her first public statement since the shooting. ""I want to serve the people. I want every girl, every child, to be educated."" Worldwide, there are 66 million girls out of school, according to UNESCO -- many more than boys, who don't have to face the same discrimination and obstacles that girls do in some countries. After hearing of Malala's shooting, however, more people have become aware of the disparity and joined her fight. Three million people across the world signed the ""I am Malala"" petition to demand universal girls' education. World leaders and celebrities such as Madonna and Angelina Jolie have voiced their support and helped raise money for the cause. And in Pakistan, there have been rallies and calls for change. ""It seems that Malala's courage has awoken Pakistan's silent majority who are no longer prepared to tolerate the threats and intimidations of the Pakistan Taliban,"" said former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a U.N. special envoy for global education. Malala's crusade started years before the shooting, when she started writing a blog for the BBC about life in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley. Her father, Ziauddin, continued to operated a school there despite a Taliban edict that girls in the region are banned from getting an education. In her blog, Malala talked openly about the challenges and fears and threats her family faced. At first, she wrote anonymously, but she eventually became a public figure, giving on-camera interviews with CNN and other news outlets. ""I have the right of education,"" she said in a 2011 interview with CNN. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" The media attention drew the ire of the Taliban, which says it was behind Malala's shooting in October. She was riding home in a van with some of her schoolmates when masked men stopped the vehicle and demanded to know which one of them was Malala. When Malala was identified, the men opened fire on her and two other girls, both of whom also survived their injuries. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" a Taliban spokesman said after the shooting. Malala was critically injured in the attack, but she suffered no permanent brain injuries. She underwent several successful surgeries in Pakistan and the United Kingdom, where she now lives after her father was given a job with the Pakistani Consulate. In March, she went back to school for the first time since the attack, attending an all-girls high school in Birmingham, England. And while she recovers from her injuries, she is continuing to raise awareness and money for education. Last month, she announced a $45,000 grant to a fund that was set up in her name -- and the first to benefit will be girls from the Swat Valley. ""We are going to educate 40 girls, and I invite all of you to support the Malala Fund,"" Malala said in a video that was played at the Women in the World summit in New York. ""Let us turn the education of 40 girls into 40 million girls."" Jolie, a U.N. special envoy, will be donating $200,000 to the Malala Fund, according to Women in the World. The fund was set up by the Vital Voices Global Partnership, a nongovernmental organization founded in 1997 by Hillary Clinton. ""In parts of the Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan and Africa, intimidation and violence are the daily reality of life for many girls who want to go to school and the many educators who want to teach them,"" Brown wrote in a recent op-ed for CNN.com. ""Even today, five months after Malala's shooting in the Swat Valley, her school friends remain in fear of violence simply for attempting to return to school."" On July 12, her 16th birthday, Malala will speak to the United Nations about the issue. Since her shooting, she has become the face of girls' education, a global symbol. She has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and last year she was selected as a runner-up for Time magazine's Person of the Year. ""She is the daughter of the whole world,"" her father told CNN. ""The world owns her."" More: Girl Rising .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's leadership as secretary of state regarding the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram could become at least as serious an issue as her decisions surrounding the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Much of the attention Thursday was on the announcement that the House will create a select committee to investigate Benghazi, but the same day, Daily Beast reporter Josh Rogin revealed details about her time as secretary of state that raise significant questions about her broader record on issues of terrorism. Rogin reported that from 2011 through early 2013, the Clinton State Department repeatedly rejected efforts to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization. In recent weeks, the group has exploded onto the world stage by kidnapping more than 250 girls at a Nigerian boarding school. It is so clearly and vividly a terrorist organization that it seems indefensible that the State Department would have refused to designate it as such. A thorough investigation of the decision process that protected Boko Haram from 2011 until late 2013 could be devastating. Now that Boko Haram has attracted worldwide attention for its vicious assault on young girls, political leaders, including the former secretary of state, are rushing to issue emotionally powerful but practically meaningless statements. Hillary Clinton tweeted: ""Access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls. We must stand up to terrorism. #BringBackOurGirls"" Clinton's tweet contrasts vividly with her failure to stand up to terrorism in 2011 by calling Boko Haram what it was. The requests to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization were serious and came from very responsible authorities. As Josh Rogin reported: . ""What Clinton didn't mention was that her own State Department refused to place Boko Haram on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011, after the group bombed the UN headquarters in Abuja. The refusal came despite the urging of the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and over a dozen Senators and Congressmen. ""'The one thing she could have done, the one tool she had at her disposal, she didn't use. And nobody can say she wasn't urged to do it. It's gross hypocrisy,' said a former senior U.S. official who was involved in the debate. 'The FBI, the CIA, and the Justice Department really wanted Boko Haram designated, they wanted the authorities that would provide to go after them, and they voiced that repeatedly to elected officials.' ""In May 2012, then-Justice Department official Lisa Monaco (now at the White House) wrote to the State Department to urge Clinton to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization. The following month, Gen. Carter Ham, the chief of U.S. Africa Command, said that Boko Haram provided a 'safe haven' for al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and was likely sharing explosives and funds with the group. And yet, Hillary Clinton's State Department still declined to place Boko Haram on its official terrorist roster."" The protection of Boko Haram from designation as a terrorist organization is even more unbelievable when you read the description of the group's activities in the American Foreign Policy Council's World Almanac of Islamism. Consider the following highlights: . -- Boko Haram means ""Western education is sinful."" -- The initial Boko Haram organization grew to an estimated 280,000 followers. In 2009 there was a huge fight with the Nigerian Army and over 1,000 followers and the founder were killed. -- A revitalized Boko Haram launched an attack on Bauchi prison on September 7, 2010. -- Since then they have carried out over 600 attacks, killing more than 3,800 people. -- Boko Haram's orientation can be discerned in its support for Taliban-like, extremist Sharia law and its designation of its original encampment in northern Nigeria as ""Afghanistan."" -- The Nigerian terrorists have allied with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and a number of transnational terrorist groups. -- On Christmas Day in 2011, Boko Haram staged church bombings. -- Boko Haram has deep ties with extremists in Saudi Arabia. Supposedly dozens have been trained in Afghanistan. Given these facts, it is amazing that Clinton's State Department refused to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization, since clearly it was engaged in terrorist activities. Why would the department she led not call a terrorist group a terrorist group when it was in her power to do so, and, as Rogin reports, the FBI, CIA, Justice Department, and many members of both the House and Senate were urging her to do just that? Rogin reports that some U.S. officials, and possibly the Nigerian government, opposed the listing because, among other reasons, they thought it might give the group more publicity. But this is a fairly weak rationale. For one thing, Boko Haram seems to have managed the publicity part on its own. And despite designating three individuals associated with Boko Haram as terrorists in June 2012, by refusing to list the organization, the State Department was denying the FBI, CIA, and Justice Department the tools they were seeking to use against the group as a whole and anyone linked to it. It is a potentially devastating addition to a record as secretary of state that included a number of decisions favoring the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (after abandoning a longtime U.S. ally there), as well as appeasing a virulently anti-American regime in Iran -- moves that have not turned out so well, to say the least. Now the Boko Haram decision raises a whole new set of questions. How could the Clinton State Department reject naming Boko Haram as a terrorist group? Who was involved in blocking Boko Haram's terrorist designation? Are any of the so-called experts who were totally wrong still at the State Department? Did Clinton have anything to do with refusing to designate Boko Haram? If not, was she even aware of the controversy? Shouldn't she certainly have been aware, considering the number of federal agencies and members of Congress that were asking her to designate the organization? These questions about Clinton's record are potentially even more serious than the questions about Benghazi. As Congressman Patrick Meehan, who chairs the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, told Rogin, by failing to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization in 2011, ""We lost two years of increased scrutiny. The kind of support that is taking place now would have been in place two years ago."" In light of the recent events in Nigeria, former Secretary Clinton and other key State Department officials owe the American people some answers about their decisions.","Newt Gingrich: Hillary Clinton could be questioned on Boko Haram as on Benghazi .

"(CNN) -- News that a 14-year-old Pakistani girl was gunned down by the Taliban simply because she wanted to go to school has sparked a wave of protests and condemnation across the world. As she fights for her life in hospital, Malala Yousafzai is being adopted as every child's sister and every parent's daughter. Wearing ""I am Malala"" t-shirts, young people in Pakistan are not only challenging the Taliban's brutality and dogma, they're boldly affirming the right of every child to education. 'I Am Malala' -- a chorus across of support across the world . The protests reveal a generation no longer willing to tolerate the gap between the promise of opportunity for all and the reality for millions of boys and girls shut out from even the most basic of primary schooling. Indeed, they are doing more to assert their right to education than the leaders who promised to deliver it. If there is one idea that has been pre-eminent in the modern world, it is that every child should have the opportunity through schooling to rise as far as their talents can take them. For decades we have assumed the inevitability of the forward march of education, the inexorable year-on-year, continent-by-continent progress towards universal education. But if there is one reality that exposes our failure to deliver, it is that there are 61 million young children like Malala who will not go to school today or any other day. Written off at five and six years old, they will never be able to bridge the gap between what they are and what they have in themselves to become. The Malalas you'll never meet . New figures to be published by UNESCO on Tuesday will show that birth and background -- where you come from and who you were born to -- matters far more in deciding your child's prospects than talent and merit, and that for millions of children educational opportunity is a hollow promise. Fifteen million children under 14 who should be at school are working full time around the world. Every year, ten million girls leave education to become child brides and never return to school. Millions more are trafficked. And the UNESCO report will highlight the shameful neglect of 28 million refugee girls and boys, displaced children living in the camp tents and shacks of broken down regimes and conflict zones with no teachers or schoolbooks. In some areas of the world, such as in Africa and the Indian subcontinent, progress is not just stalling but is sliding backwards. By current global trends education for all will be a distant dream until at least 2064. Photos: Pakistanis pray for recovery . When I visited South Sudan, the newest country in the world where there are more than 100,000 girls aged between 14 and 16, only 400 are at school. As these girls and others become connected globally -- through the Internet and other ways -- while still denied education locally, their impatience at their fate will grow. The absence of genuine educational opportunity for millions has become, in the words of former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, ""the civil rights issue of our generation."" I have never believed that the wealthy must do badly for the poor to do well. Such a politics of envy holds no attractions. When, however, the advantages of birth and background account for 80% of global inequality, we cannot sit back and do nothing. The way forward is to invest in education to bridge the opportunity gap. Too often we allow girls to be excluded from school without much complaint, and we continue to tolerate child labor and child marriage. Meanwhile in the West, we are willing to pay upwards of $100,000 to school our children when much of the world invests just $400 per child -- 250 times less. Learn more about how you can help at CNN Impact Your World . We have one chance left to deliver by 2015 our Millennium Development Goal promise that every young child will go to school. A new initiative, Education First, launched last month by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, is bringing together every U.N. and World Bank institution concerned with education to work with governments to deliver new school places and train new teachers. The idea is that each country prepares a national plan setting out its exact teacher needs and school-building and financing requirements for achieving this 2015 target of universal schooling. At the core of each plan should be strategies for policing an end to child labor, enforcing laws against child marriage, and clamping down on discrimination against girls. Money set aside for more investment in teachers and training should extend to meeting the needs of the most marginalized -- 18 million blind and disabled boys and girls, as well as rural girls from poor households. A joint summit between the international agencies and governments, to be held in April in Washington, should agree how to overcome obstacles to delivery with precise plans, timetables and budgets. But can the education of a child in a poor country be seen as a worthwhile investment for a citizen of a rich country? Today just $3 billion of global aid goes to education, amounting to a meager, shameful $13.50 per child in Africa -- hardly enough to finance a textbook, far less a teacher or a school. By 2015, even that alarmingly small amount of aid will not be rising but falling. No parent I know would conclude that the 25 cents a week we offered the developing world in educational aid per child is generous. The outpouring of public support for Malala -- and for a child's right to an education -- tells me that we can persuade not only governments but the public to give more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gordon Brown.","Malala Yousafzai was shot by Taliban simply because she wanted to go to school .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- -- Discount air carrier Southwest Airlines flew thousands of passengers on aircraft that federal inspectors said were ""unsafe"" as recently as last March, according to detailed congressional documents obtained by CNN. Congressional documents show Southwest flew thousands of passengers on aircraft deemed ""unsafe"" by inspectors. Documents submitted by Federal Aviation Administration inspectors to congressional investigators allege the airline flew at least 117 of its planes in violation of mandatory safety checks. In some cases, the documents say, the planes flew for 30 months after government inspection deadlines had passed and should have been grounded until the inspections could be completed. The planes were ""not airworthy,"" according to congressional air safety investigators. On Thursday, the FAA initiated actions to seek a $10.2 million civil penalty against Southwest for allegedly operating 46 airplanes without conducting mandatory checks for fuselage cracking. ""The FAA is taking action against Southwest Airlines for a failing to follow rules that are designed to protect passengers and crew,"" Nicholas A. Sabatini, the FAA's associate administrator for aviation safety, said in a written statement. Calling it ""one of the worst safety violations"" he has ever seen, Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minnesota, is expected to call a hearing as soon as possible to ask why the airline put its passengers in danger. But Southwest Airlines -- which carried more passengers in the United States than any other airline last year -- said there was never a flight safety issue. ""The FAA penalty is related to one of many routine and redundant inspections on our aircraft fleet involving an extremely small area in one of the many overlapping inspections. These inspections were designed to detect early signs of skin cracking,"" the airline said in a statement Thursday evening. ""Southwest Airlines discovered the missed inspection area, disclosed it to the FAA, and promptly reinspected all potentially affected aircraft in March 2007. The FAA approved our actions and considered the matter closed as of April 2007."" The airline said it understood the FAA's concerns and was anxious to work with the agency. The documents obtained by CNN allege that some management officials at the FAA, the agency responsible for commercial air safety, knew the planes were flying ""unsafely"" and did nothing about it.  CNN's Drew Griffin uncovers 'troubling information' » . ""The result of inspection failures, and enforcement failure, has meant that aircraft have flown unsafe, unairworthy, and at risk of lives,"" Oberstar told CNN. He said both FAA managers and the airline may also have broken the law as well as threatened the safety of Southwest passengers. The documents were prepared by two FAA safety inspectors who have requested whistle-blower status from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which is headed by Oberstar. The two inspectors have been subpoenaed to testify before the committee. The nation's ""Whistle-Blower Protection Program"" protects federal employees from being fired or retaliated against by their employer. The inspectors say FAA managers knew about the lapse in safety at Southwest, but decided to allow the airline to conduct the safety checks on a slower schedule because taking ""aircraft out of service would have disrupted Southwest Airlines' flight schedule."" According to statements made by one of the FAA inspectors seeking whistle-blower status, a manager at the FAA ""permitted the operation of these unsafe aircraft in a matter that would provide relief"" to the airline, even though customers were on board. Laura Brown, an FAA spokeswoman, told CNN that the administration has taken action and that a supervisor who was in charge of overseeing Southwest is ""no longer in a supervisory position."" The FAA's announcement that it would seek civil penalties against Southwest came after news of the congressional reports became public.  Watch passengers react to the violations » . The safety inspections ignored or delayed by the airline were mandated after two fatal crashes and one fatal incident, all involving Boeing's 737, the only type of airplane Southwest flies. In 1994, a US Air Boeing 737 crashed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 132 people. Three years earlier, a United Airlines Boeing 737 crashed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, killing 25 people. Investigators blamed both crashes on problems in the planes' rudder control system, leading the FAA to demand regular checks of the 737's rudder system. Documents provided to CNN show 70 Southwest jets were allowed to fly past the deadline for the mandatory rudder inspections. The documents also show 47 more Southwest jets kept flying after missing deadlines for inspections for cracks in the planes' fuselage, or ""skin."" The long-term, mandatory checks for fuselage cracks were required after the cabin of an Aloha Airlines 737 tore apart in mid-air in 1988, killing a flight attendant. That incident, which opened much of the top of the plane during flight, was attributed to cracks in the plane's fuselage that grew wider as the plane underwent pressure changes during flight. An FAA inspector at a Southwest Airlines maintenance facility spotted a fuselage crack on one of the airline's 737s last year, according to the congressional documents. He notified the airline and then began looking through safety records, discovering dozens of planes that had missed mandatory inspection deadlines. According to the inspector's statement in congressional documents: ""Southwest Airlines at the time of discovery did not take immediate, corrective action as required to address this unsafe condition and continued to fly the affected aircraft with paying passengers."" In a news release Thursday afternoon, the FAA said Southwest operated 46 Boeing 737s on nearly 60,000 flights between June 2006 and March 2007 while failing to comply with an FAA directive that requires repeated checks of fuselage areas to detect fatigue cracking. The FAA alleges that after Southwest discovered it had failed to comply, it continued to operate the same planes on an additional 1,451 flights. The airline later found that six of the 46 planes had fatigue cracks, the FAA said. ""We expect the airline industry to fully comply with all FAA directives and take corrective action,"" the FAA's Sabatini said in the statement. Southwest has 30 days to respond to the agency. The documents show Southwest voluntarily disclosed some of the missed inspections last spring. Earlier, Southwest told The Wall Street Journal it did not expect any civil penalties to be imposed because of the self-disclosure. But, even after the airline's disclosure, FAA inspectors assert that planes continued to fly, in some cases for more than a week, before inspections were complete. The airline ""did not take immediate, corrective action,"" according to the congressional documents obtained by CNN. ""That is wrong,"" said Oberstar. ""When an aircraft is flying out of compliance with airworthiness directives, it is to be shut down and brought in for maintenance inspection. That's the law."" Southwest Airlines has never had a catastrophic crash. Federal investigators determined a 2005 incident at Midway airport in Chicago that killed one person on the ground was the result of pilot error, as was a 2000 incident at Burbank airport in California that seriously injured two passengers.

"(CNN) -- What on Earth would drive a man to swim in Arctic waters wearing nothing but Speedos, goggles and a cap? Lewis Pugh braves the icy water off the arctic archipelogo of Svalbard. For Lewis Pugh, it was a love of the environment and a passionate desire to save the Arctic from global warming. His 1 km swim (0.62 of a mile) in 2007 made him the first person to complete a long-distance swim at the North Pole -- the purpose, to highlight the fact that it was possible to swim for a kilometer in a place that should be solid ice. Pugh, now aged 39, is a former maritime lawyer who abandoned his practice six years ago to become a full-time environmentalist and adventurer. Since then he has become the first person to complete long-distance swims in all five of the world's oceans and has become the world's leading cold water swimmer. Born in England and brought up in South Africa, Pugh sees himself in the mould of pioneering adventurers like Sir Edmund Hillary, fearlessly braving waters no one else would dare swim. But rather than just aiming for a place in the history books, his motivation is to publicize the environmental damage he has witnessed on his swims. In 2006, to raise awareness about global warming and that year's drought in England, Pugh swam the entire length of the River Thames -- all except the first 26 miles, which had already dried up. He took a break from the 200-mile journey to call in at No. 10 Downing Street, where he discussed climate change with Tony Blair. The next year, Pugh became the first person to swim the 87 mile-width of the Maldives. The 10-day swim was Pugh's way of raising awareness of how climate change is threatening to submerge low-lying islands. But he is best known for his North Pole adventure. His Arctic swim lasted 19 minutes in temperatures of around minus 2 degrees Celsius. Were any normal person to fall into waters that cold they would be in serious trouble. Pugh's long-time coach Professor Tim Noakes told CNN, ""People usually drown very quickly on exposure to cold water because they start to hyperventilate and when you hyperventilate you can't coordinate. They inhale water and they can't coordinate their swimming. Most people can't even go 20 meters if they are exposed to ice-cold water."" But Pugh has developed a unique mechanism for overcoming freezing conditions. He is apparently able to increase his body temperature by will power alone. In a process that Noakes has dubbed ""anticipatory thermogenesis"", Pugh can raise his body temperature to a feverish 38.4 C, some 1.5 degrees above normal body temperature. Noakes first noted this extraordinary ability during a training session. Before entering the water, Pugh cast his mind back to a traumatic parachuting accident he witnessed when he was a soldier in the British army, reliving the event in detail. Noakes recorded an increase in Pugh's body temperature and over the next fortnight, as Pugh was exposed to more cold-water swims, he was able to increase his temperature even further, peaking at 38.4 C. These days, before Pugh braves sub-zero waters he listens to U.S.rapper Eminem, gets himself into an aggressive state of mind and drives up his internal temperature. Once he hits the water, it's all about mental strength. Noakes told CNN ""The moment you dive into cold water your temperature drops and the brain sends a message to get out of the water. The first thing Pugh has to do is control that response. What happens is that I become his brain, so he says 'fine, as long as Dr Noakes allows me to swim, it's safe and I must just ignore what my brain is telling me.'"" Achieving that level of willpower doesn't come easily. While Pugh does an hour of cold-water swimming a day, he devotes four hours a day to mind training. His technique is to visualize his swim from beginning to end. ""I can taste salt water in my mouth. I can hear the sounds of the engines, of Tim Noakes screaming at me. I can feel ice burning my skin, I can smell the sea air. I absolutely live that moment. I have swum the North Pole hundreds of times in my mind,"" he told CNN. If the Arctic swim was intended to highlight shrinking polar ice caps, Pugh acknowledges that there's still plenty of work to do on that front and he now speaks on environmental issues all over the world. In 2008 Pugh founded the Polar Defense Project with the aim of protecting the Arctic and of encouraging world leaders to take action to stop climate change. As well the risk of polar melting, Pugh sees an Arctic treaty as essential to prevent the exploitation of the North Pole for oil and gas. As Pugh put it after completing his Arctic swim, ""I'm relieved that it's over. Now the real work begins.""","Lewis Pugh was the first man to complete a long-distance swim in the Arctic .

"(CNN) -- A tsunami warning has been issued for the western coastal areas of the United States and Canada after a massive earthquake struck off the coast of Japan. The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center early Friday issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas along the United States and Canadian west coasts. The tsunami warning includes coastal areas of California and Oregon from Point Conception to the Oregon-Washington border. It also includes coastal areas of Alaska from Amchitka Pass to Attu. Tsunami warnings were issued Friday for at least 20 countries and numerous Pacific islands, including Japan, coastal Russia and the Marcus Islands, the Northern Marianas, Wake Island, Taiwan and Guam. Authorities in the U.S. territory of Guam said a tsunami could hit the island as early as 7:09 p.m. (4:09 a.m. ET). Sirens sounded in Hawaii around 10 p.m. Thursday (3 a.m. ET), warning residents they could expect tsunami waves five hours later. People along coastal areas are urged to evacuate, emergency officials warned. The tsunami could cause damage ""along coastlines of all islands in the state of Hawaii,"" warned the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in a bulletin issued at 9:31 p.m. Thursday local Hawaiian time. ""Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property."" Waves are expected to hit Hawaii around 3 a.m. Friday local time. List of countries threatened by tsunami . Tsunamis are a series of long ocean waves that can last five to 15 minutes and cause extensive flooding in coastal areas. A succession of waves can hit -- often the highest not being the first, said CNN International meteorologist Ivan Cabrera. A tsunami is sweeping across the Pacific Ocean after an 8.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the northeastern coast of Honshu Island, Japan. Japan's NHK showed footage of cars, boats and buildings -- some of them ablaze -- being swept inland in Miyagi Prefecture. The temblor is the largest earthquake since the 9.0 earthquake struck the Banda Aceh area of Indonesia on December 26, 2004, causing a massive tsunami that killed tens of thousands in more than a dozen countries around the Indian Ocean. Tsunami waves can travel at speeds of 800 kilometers (497 miles) per hour. The earthquake, initially reported as a 7.8 earthquake, was upgraded to an 8.8 quake. The epicenter was 373 kilometers (231 miles) away from the capital, Tokyo, the United States Geological Survey said, and 24 kilometers deep -- a relatively shallow depth. ""When you jump a magnitude from 7 to 8, it's not 10 times stronger, it's a 1000 times stronger,"" said Cabrera. ""With an 8.8 earthquake that shallow, that close to shore, there will be more than one tsunami."" Earthquake magnitudes: What do they mean? The quake struck about 2:40 p.m. local time Friday in Tokyo, interrupting a sunny spring afternoon. ""You could tell this was different, instantly ... you literally couldn't stand on your feet the ground was shaking so hard,"" said Matt Alt, who lives on the west side of Tokyo. ""We have earthquakes from time to time, but we never feel anything like the literal magnitude of this quake."" Fires were reported around Tokyo, and a large fire at a Chiba Prefecture oil refinery northeast of Tokyo sent billowing black smoke into the sky, NHK reported. Indian Ocean tsunami killed about 250,000 people in 14 countries. That tsunami, which washed away entire communities, caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations.","NEW Warnings for the coastal areas along the United States and Canadian west coasts .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has a new heroine and a new cause -- a girl's right to education -- and after Friday's announcements from the Pakistani government that they will adopt new measures to get every child into school by end 2015, that cause has a timetable and a deadline for delivery. Everywhere you go in Pakistan you find people talking animatedly about the 15-year-old girl, Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban last month. A rickshaw touring the streets of Islamabad has a slogan posted on it: ""Malala for education and peace."" Go to the local girls' school and every girl seems to have written either a poem or a song, a letter or a card to Malala. Listen to the politicians and every speech is laced with references to the courage of Malala. Meet civil society organizations and they will tell you that the audience for their educational demands has risen markedly over the last few weeks. It seems that Malala's courage has awoken Pakistan's silent majority who are no longer prepared to tolerate the threats and intimidations of the Pakistan Taliban. Your messages to Malala . Can Pakistan convert its momentary desire to speak out in support of Malala into a long term commitment to getting its three million girls and five million children into school? Can the politicians, long-criticized for a failure to deliver, find the teachers, the classrooms and the reading materials to give millions of children a basic education? This is what I talked about with Pakistan's leaders. Meeting President Asif Ali Zardari, and in front of a 500-strong audience, many of them from the Swat Valley where Malala was shot, I presented petitions already signed by more than one million people in the international community in honor of Malala and her cause. These signatures were complemented with another one million signatures collected by Pakistani civil society's One Million Signature Campaign to demand free and compulsory education. Another 100,000 signatures from out-of-school Pakistani children are the start of yet another one million-strong petition, this time from the children themselves demanding their right to school. A $1,000,000 bounty in Malala case . The president and I agreed on a series of deadlines in a plan to ensure all of Pakistan's five million out-of-school children have the opportunity to go to school. Pakistan on Friday asked to join the Accelerated Millennium Development Goal Framework process that will allow the country to assess its current education plans, strategies and obstacles to delivery in consultation with international organizations and then work together to contribute to Pakistan's dream of education for all. A deadline for the final draft of this accelerated plan is set for April 2013 when the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, President of the World Bank Jim Kim and myself, alongside the heads of major international agencies such as UNESCO, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA and the Global Partnership for Education, will meet in Washington with the Ministers of Education and Finance of Pakistan. The aim is to match international and domestic support for realizing the 2015 goal. Suspect's sister apologizes . Five months of intensive in-country work with the Pakistan government, civil authorities and foundations, as well as international organizations, lie ahead to ensure a detailed, budgeted plan. I have suggested to the president that he consider involving all educational groups from civil society interested in achieving the universal goal in the processes. Today there is new hope for the three million girls denied their right to schooling and a new chance to ensure the right to education for all. Pakistan and the international community are united in their goals. We now must deliver. But a more active, more engaged and more determined Pakistani people can ensure that education for all is no longer a slogan but a reality.","Schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, shot by Taliban, inspires Pakistan to education-for-all goal .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Cordless tools . Your life may be safer and more comfortable because of inventions that came from space research. As long as NASA was going to the trouble of sending Apollo astronauts to the moon, it figured it might as well equip them with drills and ask them to dig up rock samples when they got there. But realizing that a 239,000-mile extension cord would be impractical, NASA teamed up with Black & Decker to develop tools that featured rechargeable batteries and special low-power consumption motors, which should make your DustBuster seem a lot more impressive. 2. Smoke detectors . In the 1970s, NASA partnered with Honeywell Corp. to create a device that would detect smoke and toxic gases in Skylab, America's first space station. The result was the first ionization smoke detector, using a minute amount of the radioactive isotope Americium-241. This led to the 1979 introduction of inexpensive photoelectric detection devices, which go off when smoke (or sometimes a hot, steamy shower) blocks the light beam. To date, smoke detectors have saved countless lives here on Earth, but they're especially useful in space, where running outside to wait for the fire truck isn't an option. 3. Enriched baby food . NASA-sponsored research has also helped make major improvements to commercially available baby food, and we're not talking about freeze-dried strained peas. While testing the potential of algae as a food supply for long-duration space travel, a Maryland-based biosciences company discovered an algae additive that contains two fatty acids closely resembling those found in human breast milk. The company now uses it to make an enriched infant formula called Formulaid, thought to be essential for babies' visual and mental development. 4. New-age pavement . When you buy a new set of tires, the old ones have to go somewhere, right? Most of them end up in huge, flammable tire dumps, which may hold millions of old tires, each one containing about a quart of oil in the rubber. If a dump catches fire, however, it can burn with a thick, toxic smoke for weeks on end. But today, old tires are being put to good use. NASA's experience in fuel-related cryogenics helped develop processes to freeze the tires to below -200 degrees Fahrenheit so that they crumble, separating the rubber from other materials and producing what's called ""crumb."" This waste is recycled into several new products, including an ingredient used to pave highways, which means your new radial tires may someday be rolling over your old ones. 5. Those cool ear thermometers . Any parent knows you don't take a baby's temperature by sticking a glass thermometer in its mouth, but inserting it the other way isn't much fun, either. And what about the incapacitated patient who can't even say ""aaah""? The Diatek Corp. of California wanted a safer way to take a person's temperature, and who better to turn to than NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the place with over 30 years of experience using infrared sensors to remotely observe celestial bodies? Together, they developed a fast and accurate thermometer that, when its disposable probe cover (to prevent cross-infection) is inserted into the ear canal, detects infrared radiation from the eardrum and gives a digital readout in less than two seconds. 6. Fast-acting dental braces . Do your old-fashioned braces set off airport metal detectors? Save yourself embarrassing strip searches by getting new ones. Many orthodontists now use ceramic braces that are bonded to the teeth and strung together with a thin, light wire made of NiTinol (nickel-titanium), an alloy brought to you compliments of NASA. Because of its amazing ability to maintain its original shape, NiTi (as it's known in the industry) provides space satellites with the ability to spring open after being cramped and contorted inside a rocket. But don't think its capabilities are limited to space. When used in dental appliances, NiTi exerts a continuous force against the teeth to move in the right direction, eliminating the need for wire tightening, thus reducing a patient's overall time in braces ... and much of the pain. 7. Protective paint . What do the Statue of Liberty, a gigantic Buddha in Hong Kong and the Golden Gate Bridge all have in common? They're protected by the American space program ... sort of. In the late 1980s, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center began a research program to develop coatings for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to shield the launch structures from salt-air corrosion, rocket exhaust and thermal stress. Applications of this material proved ideal for protecting structures like bridges, antenna towers and the occasional big Buddha. 8. (Better) cardiac pacemakers . Pacemakers have come a long way since their invention in 1950. Far from the large, external contraptions used early on, modern pacemakers can self-adjust in most cases and even activate themselves when needed. But one of the most significant advances in pacemaker technology came in the 1970s, with the help of a NASA-developed system of communication called bi-directional telemetry, originally used to communicate with satellites. Siemens-Pacesetter, Inc. teamed with NASA to develop a similar telemetry system, which not only allows doctors to make changes to the unit's function over time, but also updates them on how the device is interacting with the patient -- all without picking up a scalpel. 9. Scratch-resistant glasses . Thanks to NASA technology, plastic lenses for glasses last up to 10 times longer than they used to. That's because its Ames Research Center created a scratch-resistant (read: extremely hard) coating to protect equipment from getting beaten up by space debris. Later, the Foster Grant Corp. acquired the license for the coating method and used it in their plastic sunglasses, which matched the hardness of glass lenses, but were much lighter. Among other uses, it's now employed in most eyewear and industrial face shields. 10. Oh-so comfy sneaker insoles . Can't run a five-minute mile? Don't blame your sneakers. If they're relatively new, they're probably giving you quite a bit of help already. In the 1970s, many shoe manufacturers began replacing their standard foam rubber insoles with a new, highly shock-absorbent material -- one giant step for tennis shoes. The new kicks were padded with ""viscoelastic"" bubbles that conformed to your foot and then returned to their normal shape when you took the shoes off. Turns out, they got the idea (and the technology) from NASA, which had developed the material to better cushion astronauts during blastoff. And one pop culture killer . Despite popular theory, NASA did NOT invent Tang orange breakfast drink for the astronauts. It was introduced in 1957 by General Foods and was on grocery store shelves for years before NASA decided it worked well in space. E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is unlikely to close by the Obama administration's deadline of January 2010, two senior administration officials said late Friday. U.S. military personnel walk a road at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in July. They cited legal complications for the delay, but said they were still optimistic about shutting the detention facility for terrorism suspects soon. The announcement represents a blow to the president, who signed an executive order and set the deadline with great fanfare during his first week in office. During a signing ceremony at the White House on January 22, Obama reaffirmed his inauguration pledge that the United States does not have ""to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals."" The president said he was issuing the order to close the prison camp in order to ""restore the standards of due process and the core constitutional values that have made this country great even in the midst of war, even in dealing with terrorism."" The delay may provide fodder for Republicans such as former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has argued that shutting the Guantanamo prison would make the United States less safe. He said Obama should have had a detailed plan in place before signing the order. ""Even White House officials are now acknowledging that there is still no alternative that will keep Americans as safe as housing detainees at that secure facility off our shores,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a written statement. ""Americans and a bipartisan majority in Congress will continue to reject any effort to close Guantanamo until there is a plan that keeps Americans as safe or safer than keeping detainees in the secure detention center,"" McConnell's statement said. At its peak, the Guantanamo prison population exceeded 750, all men. More than 500 have been released, most into the custody of other countries. The senior administration officials insisted the White House is making progress in finding third-party countries to accept the remaining detainees. Approximately 2,200 staff members work there, from all branches of the U.S. military plus civilian employees.","U.S. detention center won't close by Obama deadline, senior officials say .

"(CNN) -- Forensic tests on a woman found hanging from a tree in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have so far failed to find evidence of rape, a local police chief said. More tests are being done, amid claims from the woman's family that she was gang-raped and murdered by five men, including her brother-in-law. The alleged attack comes just weeks after the bodies of two cousins, aged 14 and 15, were founding hanging from a mango tree in the Budaun district of the same state. Of the five suspects arrested, police say three have confessed to the rape, but not murder. Woman found in tree . In the latest case, the 42-year-old woman was found hanging from a tree in the Bahraich district. Her family told police she went missing around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night, and her body was found Wednesday morning, Bahraich district police chief, Happy Guptan, said. ""We are not commenting how it all happened until our investigation is complete,"" Guptan told CNN. Calls for strong political action to change attitudes and stop rape in India have grown louder since December 2012, when a student was gang-raped and murdered by attackers on a moving bus. The 23-year-old's horrific injuries made headlines and started a national debate about how many rapes were happening and why. Call to stop 'politicizing rape' In his first address to parliament as Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi addressed the issue on Wednesday, warning lawmakers against ""politicizing rape."" ""I appeal to our political leaders that we should not carry out psychological analysis of rape ... Is it correct to make a statement always? Why can't we just keep quiet. Respect and security for women should be the topmost priority of the entire people,"" he said. His comments came after observers seized on statements made by Babulal Gaur, the home minister of Madhya Pradesh, that rape was a ""social crime"" -- ""sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong."" Other politicians were also accused of trivializing the crime with comments including an observation that rapes ""happen accidentally,"" while another suggested ""boys make mistakes."" In a veiled reference to those comments last week, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: ""We say no to the dismissive, destructive attitude of 'boys will be boys'. Together, we can empower more people to understand that violence against women degrades us all."" Ban made the comments while launching a video campaign on ending sexual violence through gender equality. READ MORE: Grief, fear, blame in Indian village .

"(CNN) -- Although Shawn Kinmartin flies planes for a sky diving service, he hadn't done any sky diving himself. But on Saturday he didn't have a choice. The 21-year-old's Cessna had been seriously damaged when a sky diver jumped out and hit a key piece of the aircraft, Kinmartin explained on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday morning. To have a shot at survival, he'd have to jump. But before the heart-pumping moment, Kinmartin tried to steady his plane, cruising at 11,500 feet over eastern Missouri and southern Illinois. A fellow pilot flew up in another plane to help assess the damage. The pilot checked out Kinmartin's plane and signaled to him that the tail was badly bent. Hopes of an emergency landing at an airport in Festus, Missouri, about 35 miles south of St. Louis, were dashed. ""We realized that I wouldn't be able to perform the landing,"" Kinmartin recalled. Plus, he said, there was a car show at the airport and the runway was too short. The decision to jump made, Kinmartin pointed the aircraft in the direction of Illinois farmland -- the least populated area possible -- and jumped, pulling the cord on the parachute pack he was already wearing. Kinmartin watched his plane crash as he floated 1,500 feet into a soybean field. There were no injuries, according to CNN affiliate KSDK .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Rapper Lil Wayne's ""just resting"" two days after suffering a seizure that sent him to a Los Angeles hospital and triggered media reports that he was near death. Details about the Grammy-winning and multiplatinum-selling hip hop artist's medical problem have been few, but it appears the reports of his demise were exaggerated. ""He's good, just resting,"" said a close friend who visited the rapper at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Saturday night. Lil Wayne fans around the world were stunned by the reports. Twitter lit up with rumors, spreading fears of the worst for Wayne's outcome, but a Tweet in his name attempted to calm the tempest. ""I'm good everybody,"" read a message from Lil Wayne's Twitter account Friday evening. ""Thnx for the prayers and love."" There was no weeping for ""Weezy,"" as he's known among his friends, in the hallway near his hospital room Friday night. They talked more about a Twitter feud that erupted Friday between rappers Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka than about Lil Wayne's condition. Fellow rapper Drake was one of several of Lil Wayne's Young Money record label mates who have visited him since Friday night. Young Money publicist Sarah Cunningham acknowledged Friday that Lil Wayne had had a seizure, but members of the New Orleans artist's camp have shot down reports that he was near death. ""Dont believe the nonsense about comas and tubes to breathe ... that's false!!"" tweeted Mack Maine, the president of Lil Wayne's Young Money label, around 5:20 p.m. (8:20 p.m. ET) Friday. Maine didn't offer much detail, though he did say that he and Lil Wayne had been watching the Syracuse University Orange play the Georgetown Hoyas in the Big East men's basketball tournament. ""Wayne is alive and well!"" the record label president wrote on Twitter. The rapper's independent publicist, Kia Selby, said only, ""Lil Wayne is doing well."" She strongly denied reports he was in a medically induced coma, as reported by TMZ. Born Dwayne Carter, Lil Wayne is one of the rap world's most successful artists. He won best rap album for ""Tha Carter III"" at the 2008 Grammy awards and took home three more Grammys the next year. Beyond winning over critics, he's also been a commercial success. Last September, Billboard reported the rapper had tallied 109 hits on its Hot 100, surpassing the record previously held by Elvis Presley. But he's also run into trouble outside the studio and off stage. Lil Wayne was arrested in 2007 outside New York City's Beacon Theater after police said they found a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. He pleaded guilty to felony gun charges and spending eight months at New York's Rikers Island jail.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Rescue workers struggled to clear rubble and bodies Wednesday from the streets of Haiti's ""flattened"" capital, where a government official said the death toll from Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake may exceed 100,000. Thousands of injured people waited for care outside badly damaged hospitals, while an unknown number remained trapped inside collapsed buildings. Basic services like water and electricity were out, and Haitian President Rene Preval said his government needs help clearing streets so rescuers can reach some of the hardest-hit areas. ""We need medicine. We need medical help in general,"" Preval told CNN. ""Some of the hospitals, they collapsed."" People were digging though the rubble of leveled buildings with their hands Wednesday, looking for survivors or bodies, CNN's Anderson Cooper reported from Port-au-Prince. Other CNN correspondents in Port-au-Prince and its suburbs reported whole blocks of collapsed buildings, with dozens of bodies piled in the streets. Impact Your World: How you can help . Video images captured just moments after the temblor show dust-covered survivors rushing through the streets, yelling in terror. Others trapped in buildings are seen punching out debris and bricks, and shouting for help and trying to squeeze themselves out through cracks in the structures. Port-au-Prince ""is flattened,"" said Haiti's consul general to the U.N., Felix Augustin, who said he believed more than 100,000 people were dead. But Preval said other estimates ranged from 30,000 to 50,000. ""It's too early to give a number,"" Preval said. Hear the prime minister describe the situation . The 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck shortly before 5 p.m. Tuesday, centered about 10 miles (15 kilometers) southwest of Port-au-Prince, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It could be felt strongly in eastern Cuba, more than 200 miles away. The earthquake's power matched that of several nuclear bombs, said Roger Searle, a professor of geophysics in the Earth Sciences Department at Durham University in England. He said the combination of its magnitude and geographical shallowness made it particularly dangerous. About 3 million people -- one-third of Haiti's population -- were affected by the quake, the Red Cross said. About 10 million people most likely felt shaking from the earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey said. AC360 Blog: Anderson outside Haiti's National Cathedral . As night fell over the island Wednesday, gunshots sounded off in Port-au-Prince. Screams and wails could be heard with each aftershock. Some people who still had homes refused to go inside, fearing collapse. Scores huddled together in parks and sidewalks, trying to get rest. Though planes carrying aid began arriving Wednesday, humanitarian groups struggled to get the supplies to victims due to the poor roads and debris. There was no clear system for clearing debris, removing bodies and treating the injured, officials and journalists reported. ""Simply getting through the streets to collect the dead bodies is seemingly an impossible task,"" CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta reported from the capital, where shooting could be heard in the background. ""There's hardly any heavy machinery to try and dig through the rubble -- people are doing it by hand. ""The hospitals themselves -- the destination of those patients who might survive -- they're nonexistent or have a terrible infrastructure,"" Gupta said. Haiti native and ""Heroes"" cast member Jimmy Jean-Louis was searching for his elderly parents in Haiti on Wednesday. He said the Haitian government is not up to addressing the overwhelming nature of the disaster. ""Just as an example ... we had one school that collapsed -- one school, and we were unable to take care of that,"" he said, referring to a November 2008 incident that killed 90 people in Petionville, Haiti. ""This year, we have the entire city [of Port-au-Prince] that collapsed, including the major points such as hospitals, hotels and even the presidential palace."" Former President Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, appealed to the public to support programs that will provide food, water, shelter and medical supplies to the impoverished country. ""The most important thing you can do is not to send those supplies, but to send cash"" to relief agencies, Clinton said. Governments and agencies across the globe geared up to help, including rescue teams from China, Iceland and France, Haiti's onetime colonial ruler; aid flights and 3 million euros ($4.35 million) from Spain; doctors from Cuba; and a field hospital from Russia. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the United Nations plans to release $10 million in aid immediately, while the World Bank pledged another $100 million Wednesday afternoon. President Obama promised a ""swift, coordinated and aggressive"" response from the United States. ""The reports and images that we've seen of collapsed hospitals, crumbled homes and men and women carrying their injured neighbors through the streets are truly heart-wrenching,"" Obama said. Watch survivors describe what they saw . Clinton also urged international leaders to fulfill their previous donor commitments to Haiti. ""Most countries are way behind on fulfilling it. ... If you can provide any emergency help, if you can give us helicopters or basic medical supplies -- we need that,"" Clinton said. The U.S. military is working to get ground and air assessments of the damage, with Coast Guard cutters, airplanes and choppers deploying to the scene, and Navy ships preparing to leave. Are you there? Submit an iReport . Two Coast Guard crews of C-130 Hercules fixed-wing aircraft were evacuating nearly 140 U.S. personnel to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Nine critically injured peopled were taken to the U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Numerous relief organizations were already working in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, when the quake struck Tuesday afternoon. Aid groups scrambled to help in the aftermath of the quake, but were struggling with the same problems as ordinary Haitians. In a small clinic in Port-au-Prince, doctors were overwhelmed with the causalities coming in. Bodies and bleeding wounded seemed to cover every inch of the clinic. A woman with a broken leg sat on the floor next to the body of a dead toddler who was covered by a sheet. She'd been waiting for treatment since Tuesday. A CNN crew at the clinic counted at least 13 other adult bodies piled outside. Others were still alive, leaning on walls, lying on floors in despair. None of the three aid centers run by Doctors Without Borders was operable Wednesday, the group said. The organization was focusing on re-establishing surgical capacity so it could deal with the crushed limbs and head wounds it is seeing. The earthquake sheared huge slabs of concrete off structures and pancaked scores of buildings, trapping people inside those buildings, and knocking down phone and power lines. ""One woman, I could only see her head and the rest of her body was trapped under a block wall,"" said Jonathan de la Durantaye, who drove through Port-au-Prince after the quake. ""I think she was dead. She had blood coming out of her eyes and nose and ears."" The headquarters of the U.N. mission in Haiti, a peacekeeping and police force established after the 2004 ouster of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, collapsed during the quake, leaving leaving about 150 members unaccounted for, U.N. officials in New York said Wednesday. At least 10 survivors were pulled from rubble at the U.N. mission, according to former President Clinton. The top two civilian officials at the U.N. mission, Special Representative Hedi Annabi and his deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa, were believed trapped in the rubble of the hotel that housed the world body's headquarters, their fates unknown, said Alain Le Roy, the undersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations. The Brazilian-led mission has about 9,000 troops, police and civilian staff in Haiti, about a third of whom were in Port-au-Prince. At least 16 peacekeepers, including 11 Brazilians, three Jordanians, one Argentine and one Chadian, were reported dead Wednesday afternoon, U.N. officials said. Also among the dead was Joseph Serge Miot, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Port-au-Prince, according to the official Vatican newspaper. The archbishop was buried beneath rubble along with 100 priests and aspiring priests attending a religious conference, Papal Nuncio Bernardito Auza told the Vatican's Fides news agency. ""There were priests and nuns in the street. ... Everywhere, you heard cries from beneath the rubble,"" Auza said. Authorities braced for civil disturbances. Edmond Mulet, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, told CNN that the 95-year-old, badly overcrowded National Penitentiary in the capital, collapsed and the inmates escaped, prompting worries about looting by escapees. Obama urged Americans trying to locate family members in Haiti to telephone the State Department at 1-888-407-4747. Are you looking for loved ones? The presidential palace in Port-au-Prince was in ruins. Preval, Haiti's president, said he did not know where he was going to sleep Wednesday night.

"Washington (CNN) -- After several weeks of indecision, the Obama administration has decided against closing 149 contractor-run air traffic control towers due to sweeping budget cuts. The decision by the Transportation Department brought a ""sigh of relief"" from small- and medium-sized airports nationwide that would have been impacted by the closures. Those towers employ some 900 controllers and the airports employ a range of other workers. The decision follows action by Congress two weeks ago granting transportation planners budget flexibility for working around the consequences of mandatory budget cuts throughout the government. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air traffic services, was required to slash $253 million from its accounts this fiscal year. Friday's announcement completes a near total reversal of plans by the Transportation Department to impose draconian austerity measures on FAA programs in response to the sweeping cuts known as sequester. They took effect on March 1 following inaction by Congress on deficit reduction. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said prior to sequester that the FAA would have to furlough all 47,000 FAA employees on a rotating basis. The agency would also be forced to close low-activity control towers, and cut the overnight shifts at many more to meet the budget targets through September 30. But when controller furloughs in April were blamed for causing widespread flight delays, aviation industry and other pressure mounted on Congress to grant the Transportation Department new budget powers to ease the impact of sequestration. The controller furloughs ended after that was done and the FAA this week said it would not shut down certain control towers during overnight hours. On Friday, the Transportation Department restored funding to contract-run towers as well as other programs. Towers that were on the chopping block operate with contractors, acting under FAA supervision. The DOT and FAA insisted in February that the cuts would not endanger the flying public, but opponents disagreed. ""In the end common sense prevailed over politics,"" Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, said in a statement. Opponents demonstrated ""that there are more responsible ways to cut spending than by compromising safety."" The decision also was applauded by aviation interests. ""We're very pleased,"" said J. Spencer Dickerson, executive director of the U.S. Contract Tower Association. Controllers were happy to learn their jobs have been spared, airports were ""ecstatic"" the towers would remain open and communities breathed ""a sigh of relief,"" he said. Dickerson said he believes the administration was swayed by two letters, one signed by 41 senators and one by 83 House members, urging the DOT and FAA to keep the towers open. ""As you know, sequestration isn't a one-year deal. So we will continue to be at this. But at least right now, the towers being able to stay open until the end of September is terrific,"" Dickerson said.","FAA reverses course after Congress grants flexibility for dealing with budget cuts .

"New York (CNN) -- Shannon Morgan identifies as an atheist and wants the world, or at least the car behind her, to know it. But the state of New Jersey says no. Morgan, of Leesburg, is suing the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission for rejecting her request for a vanity license plate reading ""8THEIST,"" according to a formal complaint filed Thursday with the district court. But the commission nixed her request, saying the message ""may carry connotations offensive to good taste and decency,"" according to the complaint. An Americans United for Separation of Church and State legal team is now helping her sue the commission claiming Morgan's First Amendment rights were violated. ""The state of New Jersey is favoring religion while disparaging nonbelief,"" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of the group. ""It simply has no right to do that."" Morgan claims that she was denied a license plate for ""8THEIST"" but approved for one that read ""BAPTIST"" and that this ""expresses a preference for theistic religious beliefs, over non-theistic beliefs"" according to the complaint. This case is all too familiar to another New Jersey native, David Silverman, who had to petition for a vanity license plate announcing his atheistic views. After he was initially rejected for a plate reading, ""ATHE1ST,"" Silverman filed a formal complaint with the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission. He says that within three days, a supervisor at the commission issued him the plate. ""The word 'atheist,' in my opinion, is not objectionable,"" Silverman, who is president of American Atheists, told CNN. ""It's not a bad word and shouldn't be regarded as a bad word."" He takes issue with the process, saying that it's problematic that atheists have to jump through hoops only to be denied, then have to appeal before their license plates get approved.

Thousands waved the Santa Cruz region's green-and-white flags in the streets as council members of the Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni and Pando districts made the public announcement. The officials displayed a green-bound document containing a set of statutes paving the way to a permanent separation from the Bolivian government. Council representatives vowed to legitimize the so-called autonomy statutes through a referendum that would legally separate the natural-gas rich districts from President Evo Morales' government. The move also aims to separate the states from Bolivia's new constitution, which calls for, among other things, a heavier taxation on the four regions to help finance more social programs. ""The statutes will be ratified,"" said Oscar Ortiz, Santa Cruz senator. ""With a public referendum, the people of our region will legitimize their will."" About 35 percent of Bolivia's 9.5 million people live in the four states, according to The Associated Press. In the meantime, Bolivian network ATV showed what appeared to be armed, pro-government protesters creating blockades around the town of Yapacani, on the outskirts of Santa Cruz. Some indigenous pro-Morales groups claim Bolivia's richer, white-ruled Eastern regions want to control the country's natural resources. Bolivia has South America's second-largest natural gas reserves, behind Venezuela. Most of it is produced in the Eastern regions. Watch Bolivian leader speak out » . In the capital city La Paz on Saturday, Morales addressed thousands of flag-waving supporters in the Plaza Murillo, defending the new constitution and lashing out against what he called the racist policies of Bolivia's elite. ""They must give back the money they took from us,"" he told a cheering crowd, which included members of the Quechua and Aymara tribes. ""We will retroactively investigate all the big fortunes, and the corrupt are now trembling with fear."" Morales also cautioned those who he said want a ""a division, a coup d'etat,"" the AP reported. ""We won't permit Bolivia to be divided,"" he warned. Morales -- who belongs to the Aymara indigenous group -- nationalized the country's oil and natural gas reserves when he took power in 2006, creating what became known as the ""gas wars."" Running on a platform of redistribution of wealth among Bolivia's poor, Morales has defied countries such as Brazil and the United States for the exploration of Bolivia's natural reserves. He has also protested the country's racial divide. ""Bolivia is a nation among nations,"" he said Saturday, referring to the diversity of Indian nations whose traditions date back centuries. ""We are not a country of blue-eyed, green-eyed folks only. It's a plurinational country made of dark-skinned and white-skinned. This new constitution will unite us."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's women's team walked off the pitch prior to their Olympic football clash with Colombia after the flag of archrival South Korea was mistakenly shown on Hampden Park's big screen. The team left the pitch in Glasgow shortly before the scheduled kick off at 7.45 pm local time after a South Korean flag appeared next to profiles of their players. They eventually returned to start the match over an hour later, as London Games organizers were forced to issue a hasty apology. ""Today ahead of the women's football match at Hampden Park, the South Korean flag was shown on a big screen video package instead of the North Korean flag,"" a statement released to CNN read. Is the Olympics worth more than Google? ""Clearly this is a mistake, we will apologize to the team and the national Olympic committee and steps will be taken to ensure this does not happen again."" The delayed kick off didn't seem to affect North Korea when the game eventually got underway as they recorded a 2-0 win. It marked a controversial start to Olympic competition for London before Friday's opening ceremony officially kicks off the 2012 Games. Earlier, Team GB's women's team gave the host nation a rousing start to the festivities with a 1-0 victory over New Zealand. In front of a crowd of around 25,000 fans at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff -- the biggest attendance for a women's international match in Britain -- Stephanie Houghton scored the only goal of the game. It was the first time a female football team from Great Britain has ever competed in the Olympics, coming 62 years after a men's team from the UK last played. In Wednesday's other matches, defending champions Team USA got off to a winning start after beating France 4-2 at a sparsely populated Hampden Park in Glasgow. Current FIFA Women's World Cup holders Japan won their opening match by beating Canada 2-1 at the Ricoh Arena, Brazil thumped Cameroon 5-0 and Sweden beat South Africa 4-1. Bright sunshine in the Welsh capital greeted the first spectators to witness an Olympic event under the London 2012 banner, as Team GB kicked off what was billed as ""day-2"" of the Games. Despite large sections of the vast Millennium Stadium being empty the match attracted 25,000 fans, many more than the 14,505 that saw Wales play Russia in a World Cup qualifier back in 2010. After a bright start from New Zealand, Team GB took control of the game, but after spurning numerous chances they had to wait for Houghton to break the deadlock on 64 minutes with a well struck free kick. And they were thankful to goalkeeper Karen Bardsley to deny Sarah Gregorius after a mix-up in Team GB's defense offered the Football Fearns a glorious late chance to equalize. The Olympics: 4 billion people; 4 billion reasons to watch . After the game Houghton, who plays for Arsenal Ladies, told the host broadcaster: ""It was something special, and I'm sure my family are really proud. I don't think it will sink in for a while. I'm just glad it got us the win. ""The win was brilliant. We needed three points and we got them. We worked very hard as a team under hard conditions."" In Scotland, Team USA made a sluggish start to the defense of the gold they won in Beijing, falling 2-0 down to France after just 13 minutes. But goals from Abby Wambach, Carli Lloyd and a double from Alex Morgan ensured three points for Team USA. Elsewhere, Japan -- the current FIFA Women's World Cup holders -- beat Canada 2-1, thanks to goals from Nahomi Kawasumi and Aya Miyama at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. Thursday sees the start of the men's football competition, with Team GB taking on Senegal at Manchester United's Old Trafford home. The other fixtures are as follows: Honduras vs. Morocco, Spain vs. Japan, Mexico vs. South Korea, Gabon vs. Switzerland, United Arab Emirates vs. Uruguay, Egypt vs. Brazil and Belarus vs. New Zealand.","North Korean women's team walk off pitch prior to their Olympic clash with Colombia .

"(CNN) -- Wednesday night's CNN debate lands at a critical moment in the Republican race. This season, each debate has set the tone for the primary to follow. Newt Gingrich's savaging of the media helped propel him to victory in South Carolina. Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida. The current uncertainty about the race, and the extraordinary elasticity in the polls, is partly due to the fact that we haven't had a debate for a whole month. It's important, then, for each of the candidates to make a powerful impression in this last confrontation before Arizona and Michigan vote on February 28. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism. Same old, same old. But we might see something new from Mitt Romney: a glimmer of humanity. The latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset. A week ago, polls put Santorum as much as 10 points ahead in the Great Lakes State. But now they call it a statistical dead heat between him and Romney. So it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate. This is Rick's natural style -- he gets a thrill out of counting the flaws of his opponents. But Santorum also probably recognizes that the only way he'll win Michigan is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about Romney's conservatism. That's what he's been doing in the western part of the state all this week, where he has hit out repeatedly at Romney's ""well-oiled weathervane"" stance on issues like abortion and Iran. One thing Santorum doesn't particularly need to do in the debate is make voters like him: They already do. According to Public Policy Polling, he has a favorability rating among Michiganders of 67%. Santorum's enduring popularity is partly thanks to the fact that Romney hasn't been spending his money on an excessive number of attack ads, as he did in Florida. Instead, Romney has been working hard on his own favorability rating in Michigan, which has crept up from 49% to 55%. Hitherto, Mitt has suffered from the ""weirdo factor"" -- the sense that he's not quite like you and me. The press has given a lot of coverage to the Mormon practice of giving ""proxy baptisms"" to deceased nonbelievers, something that Romney admits he has done, but not ""recently."" This has been compounded by the strange tale of Romney's dog, Seamus, who Mitt once drove to Canada strapped to the roof of his car. Poor Seamus apparently lost bowel control en route and ran away on arrival. Googlers have tried to turn ""Romney"" into a verb that means ""to soil oneself with fear."" Here's an example of it used in a sentence: ""Every time I think of Newt Gingrich being elected president, I Romney uncontrollably."" But Mitt has been countering the ""weirdo factor"" with a series of ads and personal appearances in Michigan that emphasize his local roots and his concern for the auto industry in a state beset by tragic levels of unemployment. This is the strategy that we can expect him to take in Wednesday's debate: folksy and populist. There will be a lot about how great American cars are, Mitt's experience as a businessman, Obama's relative incompetence and Romney's Michigan childhood. Whether it will work is a matter of judgment. On the campaign trail, Romney's idea of soaring rhetoric usually involves singing highlights from ""America the Beautiful."" Efforts to appear humble are frequently undermined by an ironic statement (remember the $10,000 bet?), and intimate stories about his father are so formulaic they sound as if he learned them by rote. The only way Romney could break the spell of his own emptiness would be to crash sobbing into the arms of Ellen DeGeneres. But if Romney's reinvention as a human being does pay off, it will be because Republicans desperately want it to work. Republicans still tell pollsters that they think Mitt is the most electable candidate. If they could only be convinced that he is as conservative as they -- or at least as human -- they would probably fall in behind him. A bit of passion and compassion in Wednesday's debate could be all the excuse wavering Republicans need to back a winner. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"LAGUNA DE BAY, Philippines (CNN) -- Water is a lifeline for the farmers and fishermen who live along Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines. The rich ecosystem also serves as a reservoir to catch floodwaters to save Manila, on its western shore, from drowning. People use a canoe to cross floodwaters in Manila's Laguna de Bay neighborhood. But water became the Philippines' biggest enemy last week as Typhoon Parma dumped as much as 36 inches of rain in some parts of this nation of islands, compounding misery in areas already flooded by earlier storm Ketsana. Fears of disease are rising. So are the tempers of residents, who blame the government for doing too little too late. Parma made landfall Saturday in Cagayan Province in the northern Philippines, with maximum sustained winds measured at approximately 148 kph (92 mph). The Philippines National Disaster Coordinating Council reported that the storm affected more than 338,000 people, displaced 85,000 and killed at least 16. Tuesday morning, Parma, known locally as Pepeng, was still hovering off the northwestern coast of the Philippines with wind gusts up to 135 kph (84 mph). Its predecessor, Ketsana, affected more than 3.9 million people, displaced more than 335,000 (many of whom remain in shelters) and left 295 dead. It swallowed homes and buses, and dumped more rain on Manila than it has seen in 40 years, leaving 80 percent of the bustling capital submerged. The water -- rancid, stagnant, infested -- has now been standing for 10 days. Read about the fate of a farming community in Cagayan . As many as 2 million homes are partly submerged in metropolitan Manila, according to the government. People wade through the murky stuff in flip-flops or bare feet. They use tractors, boats and makeshift barges to navigate the main thoroughfare. Wooden furniture stands soaked, on the verge of rotting. Valuables like stereo systems sit atop chairs and tables, and families have been sleeping on elevated beds. Garbage is clogging the city's aged drainage and sewage systems.  Watch Manila residents battle floodwaters » . Manila generates 6,700 tons of trash a day, estimates the Asian Development Bank. Much of it is dumped on the streets or illegally into waterways, all of it under water now. Children play -- some with water guns -- in it, as though it were the neighborhood swimming pool. Fears of water-borne disease have permeated the area. ""All the children have diarrhea,"" said resident Jojo Gadista, who, like everyone else, has floodwater inside his house. ""I don't know how to fix the situation."" Parma is forecast to remain almost stationary over the next 24 hours. That means more rain will surely fall in the northern Philippines. Scattered storms are forecast for Manila. The government offered a grim prognostication. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, who is in charge of relief operations, said the water may not fully recede until Christmas. ""That is why we have to work to try and dredge things and try to clean up,"" he said. But many poor families are desperate to get their lives back. Hundreds of people waited at a bridge for government boats. Some were there all night. They were promised food at 10 in the morning. At 4 p.m., they were still waiting. They stretched their arms when a private relief truck stopped to hand out to each person two packages of noodles, a bottle of drinking water, a canned good, rice and coffee -- donations from wealthy Filipinos. Teodoro said many people in cities and towns around Laguna de Bay opted not to evacuate; that it was a challenge to ensure their safety. ""They really will not leave their most valuable worldly possessions,"" he said. When you are poor, it is hard to leave the only thing you have, Gadista said. ""This is where our livelihood is. We can't leave this place."" This place, where normally, water is a godsend.

"(CNN) -- The last of the teams to play their opening match take the pitch, and Brazil and Mexico meet in a battle of the Group A leaders. The last time we saw Algeria, they were stunned by Landon Donovan at South Africa in 2010. They take on Group H favorites Belgium in the first match of the day. After Brazil and Mexico scrap, Russia meets South Korea in the other Group H match. Here's what to look forward to during Tuesday's matches at the World Cup: . Hulk hurts . Against Croatia, Brazilian midfielder Hulk was replaced in the second half by Bernard. During practice Sunday, Hulk was stung by a leg injury and sat out most of the workout. So will Hulk have to take the bench? And will Mexico's Javier Hernandez again play a reserve role? It appears that way. And remember, if either team wins, it will have six points and that likely puts them in the knockout round. New verse, same as the first . Mexico and Brazil meet in Fortaleza, just like last year in the Confederations Cup. That match was also the teams' second group match and it was also played in mid-June. Brazil comfortably won that contest 2-0 and Neymar was man of the match. Brazil will have to play with more passion to have a similar result against a confident Mexican team. Belgian youth . Belgium is one of those opponents that make you say, ""No problem,"" then they go out and beat you 2-0. They are tough on defense and they have some of the best young players in Europe. Some clubs in Belgium are taking in some serious coin because many of their young stars move to England to play. In 2012, a Belgian newspaper totaled the transfer fees and estimated Belgium's top 11 players were third in the world in such payments. Heading the wrong way . South Korea has lost five of its last seven international matches, including a 2-1 loss to Tuesday's opponent, Russia, in November. On the other hand, Russia hasn't lost since August. But Russia is missing injured captain Roman Shirokov and the weather will be much warmer than what their players -- all of whom play domestically -- are used to for game conditions. Reason to love: Algeria . Probably the only team whose national anthem was written in blood, at least that's how the story goes. The words were written in 1956 by Moufdi Zakaria, who was imprisoned in Algiers. Legend has it that he had no pencils or paper so he wrote on the walls of his cell with his blood.","One of Brazil's stars may have to sit out after a practice injury .

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- Sen. Edward Kennedy declared there was ""new hope"" for the nation in his surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention, while Michelle Obama addressed critics of her patriotism and stressed her love for the country. Sen. Edward Kennedy makes a surprise speech before a roaring crowd at the convention. ""Nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight,"" Kennedy told an arena of teary-eyed delegates as he pledged to see Barack Obama to the White House and his own return to the Senate floor. Before the convention, the ailing liberal icon had made only one public appearance since undergoing surgery for a brain tumor on June 2. Before his remarks, his niece, Caroline Kennedy, introduced a video that paid tribute to his life and the causes he has fought for throughout his more than 45-year tenure in the Senate.  Watch highlights from the opening night » . The reception Kennedy got was reminiscent of the reception that his brother, Robert, got in 1964 when he addressed the convention after their brother John was assassinated, said Bill Schneider, a CNN senior political analyst. The crowd was perhaps a little sentimental, Schneider said because ""they're very aware that it may be the last major speech he ever gives. They're hopeful it's not -- but fearful it might be.""  Watch Kennedy's words fire up delegates » . Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said Kennedy's speech would be ""one of the highlights of the evening if not the entire Democratic convention,"" and CNN contributor James Carville called it ""the most emotional thing I have ever seen."" ""I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican -- you're going to be moved by that,"" he said. The Democratic convention culminates Thursday when Obama formally accepts his party's nomination. Obama, the junior senator from Illinois, will become the first African-American to lead a major party ticket. His wife of nearly 16 years, Michelle Obama, told the packed convention center stories from when she and Obama first met. The woman known as ""the rock"" in the Obama family also introduced herself as a sister, a mother and a ""wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president."" ""This is the first time most Americans are getting any sense of who Michelle Obama really is. She's a very poised and accomplished speaker, a real professional,"" Schneider said. Obama said her ""piece of the American Dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me,"" and praised both Sens. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden for opening up opportunities for others.  Check out photos from the first day of the convention » . ""All of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just won't do -- that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be. ""That is the thread that connects our hearts. That is the thread that runs through my journey and Barack's journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight, where the current of history meets this new tide of hope. ""That is why I love this country,"" she said before the cheering audience. The potential first lady caused controversy earlier in the campaign season when she said she was really proud of the United States for the ""first time"" in her adult life. Those comments were replayed in attack ads from Republicans. Craig Robinson, Michelle Obama's brother, spoke briefly before his sister took the stage. ""I don't want to just introduce my sister, I want to introduce you to my sister. The girl I grew up with. The poised young woman I saw her grow in to. The compassionate mother, aunt and sister-in-law she is. The passionate voice for women and children she has become. And the type of first lady she will be,"" he said before sharing memories from their childhood. Barack Obama addressed the delegates in a short message via satellite at the conclusion of his wife's speech. ""Now you know why I asked her out so many times, even though she said no. You want a persistent president,"" he joked. Obama's two daughters, Sasha and Malia, grabbed the mic to give their father a quick ""hello."" Obama watched his wife's speech from Kansas City, Missouri, where he is scheduled to campaign Tuesday.  Watch as Obama watches his wife's speech » . Monday night's theme was ""One Nation."" Other speakers included Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. Former Republican Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, who endorsed Obama and recommended Republican Rep. Chuck Hagel as a vice presidential candidate, also addressed the opening night of the convention. iReport.com: Share your reaction to convention speeches . While Kennedy and Michelle Obama earned rave reviews, analysts said the hours leading up to their appearances were largely uneventful. ""If this party has a message, it's done a hell of a job of hiding it,"" said Carville, who was a strategist for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. Bill Bennett, a political analyst for CNN who served in Republican administrations, said it was ""stunning"" how little substance was offered up in the first two hours of the convention. ""Having worked on the choreography of these before, you need to grab people's attention with a message early on ... not to let these sort of hours get frittered away,"" he said. Tuesday's lineup will likely be dramatic, as Hillary Clinton delivers the headline speech. Clinton and Obama battled it out in their protracted primary season, and questions still linger over whether her supporters are ready to rally behind her formal rival. Wednesday night features an address from former President Bill Clinton, as well as a speech from Joe Biden, the newly tapped vice presidential candidate. Going into the start of the back-to-back conventions, Obama and presumptive Republican nominee John McCain were tied in the race for the White House, according to a new poll. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday night -- after Obama announced Biden as his running mate, 47 percent of those questioned are backing Obama, with an equal amount supporting McCain. The poll was conducted on Saturday and Sunday, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all voters.","Michelle Obama makes case for husband, closing convention's first night .

"(CNN) -- Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle vetoed a civil unions bill Tuesday that would have given same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples, saying the issue needs to be put to a referendum. ""I am vetoing this bill because I have become convinced that this issue is of such significant societal importance that it deserves to be decided directly by all the people of Hawaii,"" Lingle said. ""The subject of this legislation has touched the hearts and minds of our citizens as no other social issue of our day. It would be a mistake to allow a decision of this magnitude to be made by one individual or a small group of elected officials."" Gay rights group decried Lingle's decision. ""Today was the first time a civil unions bill passed both Houses in Hawaii by solid margins and was on the Governor's desk for signing,"" Jo-Ann Adams, chair of the GLBT Caucus of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, said in a statement. ""With such broad support from the legislators, who are the elected officials closest to the public, and the consistent results of the professional polls showing broad support for civil unions as a civil rights issue, we are deeply disappointed that the Governor ignored the will of the people and vetoed the bill. "" Another group, Equality Hawaii, said the fight for equal rights will continue. ""Today is a sad day for the thousands of Hawaii families who remain second class citizens,"" said Alan Spector, legislative affairs co-chair for Equality Hawaii. The governor said she understands why supporters of the bill are upset by her decision. ""This is a decision that should not be made by one person sitting in her office or by members of the Majority Party behind closed doors in a legislative caucus, but by all the people of Hawaii behind the curtain of the voting booth,"" Lingle said in a statement. ""And while some will disagree with my decision to veto this bill, I hope most will agree that the flawed process legislators used does not reflect the dignity this issue deserves, and that a vote by all the people of Hawaii is the best and fairest way to address an issue that elicits such deeply felt emotion by those both for and against."" When the bill passed in April, civil union supporters cheered in the Capitol rotunda. But Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona said at the time lawmakers shouldn't have approved the measure. ""If the legislature wanted to establish the equivalent of same-sex marriage, they should have put it on the ballot for the people to decide,"" he said then. Some religious groups had urged the governor to veto the legislation. ""We need you to mount a campaign to flood the governor's office with requests to veto the bill,"" Larry Silva, Catholic bishop of Honolulu, wrote on the diocese of Honolulu's website at the time. Five U.S. states and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Hawaii would join New Jersey in allowing civil unions. Three states -- Rhode Island, New York, and Maryland -- recognize same-sex marriages from other states, according to the conference. California recognizes same-sex marriages performed during six months in 2008 after its Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry and before the passage of Proposition 8, which overturned the court's decision.","NEW: Lingle says issue needs to be put to a vote of the people .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's foreign minister said Tuesday he wants five Somali pirates captured alive during the rescue of a hijacked ship last week to be put on trial in South Korea. ""It's a given that we deal with pirates who have caused damage to our people and attack our military, and along those lines we are seriously weighing the possibility of bringing the pirates to our country,"" Kim Sung-Hwan said. The vessel, Samho Jewelry, was hijacked in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Oman earlier this month. South Koreans rescued 21 sailors, killed eight pirates and captured five others, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The captain of the 11,500-ton ship was shot in the stomach during the rescue, but no other crew member was hurt. Kim said the captain has undergone a first round of surgery and is recovering. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has praised the bold rescue and said the U.S. military assisted in the operation. Kim defended the military's action to save South Koreans. ""I cannot agree to criticisms against our carrying out a military mission in order to rescue our people from those who have threatened their lives and safety,"" he said. Ten minutes before the South Korean navy opened fire, the navy made an announcment on a loud speaker to the crew of the Samho Jewelry: . ""Very shortly, the navy will attempt to rescue you,"" the navy declared. ""Evacuate to a safe place and do not come outside."" The order was made in Korean -- not likely understood by the Somali pirates -- and is thought to have helped save South Korean lives.","Kim Sung-hwan says possibility being considered of bringing pirates to South Korea .

"(CNN) -- Evangelist Oral Roberts, founder of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and Oral Roberts University, died Tuesday from complications of pneumonia in Newport Beach, California, his spokeswoman said. He was 91. Roberts' son, Richard, and daughter Roberta were at his side, spokeswoman Melany Ethridge said in a statement. Roberts was hospitalized Monday following a fall on Saturday, in which he suffered broken bones, Ethridge said earlier, adding he was being treated for pneumonia. There will be a private interment, the statement said. Arrangements for a public memorial service in Tulsa, Oklahoma, are pending. ""Oral Roberts was a man of God, and a great friend in ministry,"" the Rev. Billy Graham said in a statement Tuesday. ""I loved him as a brother. We had many quiet conversations over the years."" Granville Oral Roberts was born into poverty in Bebee, Oklahoma, on January 24, 1918, according to a brief biography released by Ethridge. His Christian ministry began with what he described as his own miracle healing of tuberculosis at age 17. Roberts pastored churches in Oklahoma and Georgia and preached at revivals around the country while studying at Oklahoma Baptist University and Phillips University in Oklahoma, according to the biography. In 1947, he founded the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association in Tulsa, ""and began conducting crusades across America and around the world, attracting crowds of thousands -- many who were sick and dying and in search of healing,"" the biography said. ""Through the years, he conducted more than 300 crusades on six continents"" and ""laid hands"" on an estimated 2 million people, according to association officials. In 1954, he brought television cameras into services, providing what he liked to call a ""front-row seat to miracles"" to viewers, the biography said. He later began a television program, initially called ""Oral Roberts Presents."" The ministry's daily program, now called ""The Place for Miracles,"" can be seen on more than 100 television stations, multiple cable and satellite networks and the Internet, Ethridge said. ""If God had not in his sovereign will raised up the ministry of Oral Roberts, the entire charismatic movement might not have occurred,"" said Jack Hayford, president of the California-based International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, in the statement. ""Oral shook the landscape with the inescapable reality and practicality of Jesus' whole ministry. His teaching and concepts were foundational to the renewal that swept through the whole church."" Roberts founded the Abundant Life Prayer Group in 1958 ""to address the around-the-clock needs of those suffering and requesting prayer,"" according to the biography. Today, prayer partners at Abundant Life continue to receive calls 24 hours a day. The group has received more than 23 million phone calls for prayer, the biography said. Oral Roberts University was founded in 1963, built on 500 acres in Tulsa and dedicated four years later by Graham, according to the biography. Graduate schools including medicine, nursing, dentistry, law, education and theology were later added. Roberts served as school president until 1993 but remained a chancellor until his death. He remained involved in his evangelistic association as much as his health allowed, Ethridge said Monday. His son, Richard Roberts, currently serves as president. In 1977, Roberts said he had a vision of a 900-foot-tall Jesus, who told him to found the City of Faith Medical and Research Center. The biography said the center was aimed at ""merging the healing power of medicine and prayer."" In 1986, Roberts announced that God would ""call him home"" unless he raised $8 million to send medical missionaries from the center -- an announcement that was widely publicized. He wound up raising $9.1 million, but the center closed in 1989. However, the biography said, it left ""a lasting impact on the understanding by many medical professionals of the importance of treating the whole person -- body, mind and spirit."" In addition, Roberts wrote more than 130 books, the biography said. ""His book 'The Miracle of Seed Faith' has more than 8 million copies in circulation. This book's key principles -- God is your source, sow your seed out of your need, and expect a miracle harvest -- formed a fundamental part of Roberts' ministry and legacy,"" the biography said. Before his death, Roberts said, ""After I'm gone, others will have to judge how well I've obeyed God's command not to be an echo but to be a voice like Jesus,"" the statement said. ""As far as my own conviction is concerned, I've tried to be that voice with every fiber of my being, regardless of the cost."" Responding to news of Roberts' death, Graham said Tuesday: ""Just three weeks ago, I was privileged to talk to Oral on the telephone. During the short conversation, he said to me that he was near the end of his life's journey. I look forward to the day that I will see Oral and Evelyn Roberts again in heaven -- our eternal home."" Roberts wife, Evelyn, died in 2005 after the couple had been married more than 66 years. Roberts is survived by his son and daughter and their spouses, along with 12 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren, Ethridge said.","NEW: Roberts ""a man of God, and a great friend in ministry,"" the Rev.

"(CNN) -- A disputed maritime border. Long-standing tensions. And Tuesday, a sharp escalation of hostilities. North and South Korea fired at each other for about an hour on an island that sits off a disputed border. The deadly skirmish raised fears of war between the two rival nations, once again spiking tension in the entire region. How did the latest hostilities begin? South Korea said North Korea fired artillery Tuesday toward the border between the two nations. Two South Korean marines were killed and 18 soldiers and civilians were wounded. South Korea had been conducting maritime military drills, which the North called ""war maneuvers."" The North accused the South of ""reckless military provocation"" for firing dozens of shells inside North Korean territory around the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. Plumes of smoke billowed from the island of 1,300 people but it was not immediately clear how much damage was incurred. Many residents were fleeing to the South Korean port of Incheon. Why did this happen? Tension has been running particularly high in the Korean peninsula after the March 26 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan. Tuesday's incident, however, is one of the most serious that has occurred in recent years. The hostilities come as North Korea is undergoing transition -- the ailing and reclusive leader Kim Jong Il is believed to be in the process of transferring power to his son Kim Jong Un. Some analysts believe upcoming internal changes have prompted North Korea to flex its military muscle in recent days. Tuesday's violence was also preceded by the revelation of a North Korean uranium enrichment program. Has this happened before? Yes, Yeonpyeong Island has come under attack before. Last January, South Korea reported that the North had fired shells that fell in waters north of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean maritime border. North Korea wants that border redrawn farther south. Over the past six decades, small-scale skirmishes have flared repeatedly along both land and sea borders as each state aims to reunify the peninsula according to its own terms and system of government. Deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999, 2002 and 2009. What is the history of conflict? After Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea became a divided nation, the capitalist South supported by the United States and its Western allies and the communist North an ally of the Soviet Union. Cold War tensions erupted into war 1950, devastating the peninsula and taking the lives of as many as 2 million people. The fighting ended with a truce, not a treaty, and settled little. Technically, the two Koreas are still at war. Besides the border skirmishes, other incidents also have proved provocative. In 1968, North Korea dispatched commandos in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate South Korea's president. In 1983, a bombing linked to Pyongyang killed 17 high-level South Korean officials on a visit to Myanmar. In 1987, the North was accused of bombing a South Korean airliner. What happened with the Cheonan? South Korea said a North Korean torpedo last March sent the warship Cheonan to the bottom of the Yellow Sea off the Seoul-controlled island of Baengnyeong. The sinking, also in the border area, killed 46 South Korean sailors. South Korea was outraged by the incident. North Korea vehemently denied any responsibility, even after an international investigating team blamed North Korea. The United Nations Security Council statement condemned the attack but stopped short of placing blame on the North. Will the two nations go to war? South Korea put its military on high alert following Tuesday's exchange of fire. But whether that will translate into further military action is impossible to predict. Events in the past few months suggested a slight thawing of icy relations. North and South Korea had begun discussions on the possible resumption of reunions of family members separated by the Korean War, and North Korea has requested military talks. In early September, the South offered food aid to the impoverished North for the first time in three years. Given the closed nature of North Korean politics, it's hard to tell what changes the new leadership of Kim Jong Un will entail or whether re-engagement is on the table. Another wild card is the influence of China; some South Koreans fear a Chinese takeover in the event of a North Korean collapse. Some analysts viewed Tuesday's exchange as North Korea flexing its military muscle in the light of its leadership transition. Others said it was related to the nuclear issue. How will nuclear talks be affected? Washington accuses Pyongyang of running a secret uranium-based nuclear program. The United States, along with the two Koreas, Russia, Japan and China, have been involved in what is called the Six Party Talks. But those talks have been slow, arduous and in limbo since 2008. And after the revelation of the North Korean uranium enrichment facility a few days ago, the resumption of talks seemed to be in jeopardy. Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. special envoy on North Korean denuclearization, said Tuesday's hostilities will prove a further obstacle. Choi Jin-wook, senior researcher at the Korea Institute of National Unification, said the North is ""frustrated with Washington's response to their uranium program, and they think that Washington has almost given up on negotiations with North Korea."" ""I think they realize they can't expect anything from Washington or Seoul for several months, so I think they made the provocation,"" Choi said. Journalist Andrew Salmon contributed to this report.","Tension has been high since the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan .
A changing situation inside North Korea and the nuclear issue may also be factors, analysts say .
Yeonpyeong Island also was at the center of a skirmish in January ."
"(CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods apologized Wednesday for ""transgressions"" that let his family down -- the same day a gossip magazine published a report alleging he had an affair. ""I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves,"" he said in a statement on his official Web site. Woods did not admit to an affair and offered no details about the ""transgressions"" in his statement. ""I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behavior and personal failings behind closed doors with my family. Those feelings should be shared by us alone."" Read Woods' statement . US Weekly magazine printed a report Wednesday alleging that Woods had an affair with Jaimee Grubbs, whom it identified as a 24-year-old cocktail waitress. The magazine also published what it says is a voice mail message from Woods to Grubbs. ""Hey, it's Tiger,"" a man says in the recording. ""I need you to do me a huge favor. Can you please take your name off your phone? My wife went through my phone and may be calling you. ""So if you can, please take your name off that. ... What do you call it? Just have it as a number on the voice mail. Just have it as your telephone number. That's it, OK? You got to do this for me. Huge. Quickly. All right. Bye."" CNN could not independently confirm that the voice on the recording was Woods. Attention has been focused on Woods since he crashed his SUV outside his Florida home last week. Investigators say he crashed the vehicle into a fire hydrant and tree. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck, and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. What do you think about the whole Tiger saga? Woods' attorney, Mark Nejame, declined to comment on reports of an affair Tuesday night, saying he was hired to represent Woods in the traffic case. The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that it cited Woods for careless driving -- the golfer paid a $164 fine -- and closed its investigation. The golfer said Wednesday that he was ""dismayed to realize the full extent of what tabloid scrutiny really means"" for him, his wife, model Elin Nordegren, and their children -- a 2-year old daughter, Sam, and a 9-month old son, Charlie. ""For the last week, my family and I have been hounded to expose intimate details of our personal lives. The stories in particular that physical violence played any role in the car accident were utterly false and malicious. Elin has always done more to support our family and shown more grace than anyone could possibly expect. "" The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open titles. Grubbs is the second woman to be romantically linked to Woods through news reports this week. The National Enquirer reported a few days before Woods' crash that the golfer was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess -- an assertion the hostess vigorously denied Tuesday, according to The New York Post. The woman said a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the supermarket tabloid and that ""not a word of it is true."" See what people are saying . George Merlis, president of Experience Media Consulting Group in Los Angeles, California, said Woods should have said more after last week's accident. ""I think he needed to get out in front of the story very early on, because if you don't get out in front of something like this, you give free rein to speculation,"" he said. Asked whether the allegations might scare off Woods' sponsors, Merlis said, ""If I were a businessman contemplating doing a really expensive endorsement deal with him, I would think twice."" Nike, Gatorade, Gillette and other sponsors said Wednesday they would continue their relationships with Woods.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hours after declaring a state of emergency Saturday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ordered troops to take a television station's equipment and put a popular opposition leader under house arrest. President Pervez Musharraf explains his actions in a televised address Saturday. Musharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Court's chief justice for the second time. On Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party was arrested, along with 10 aides, The Associated Press reported. Hashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported. The country is at a critical and dangerous juncture -- threatened by rising tensions and spreading terrorism, Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation after declaring martial law. As Pakistani police patrolled the streets of the capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were ""for the good of Pakistan.""  Watch Musharraf's speech » . There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country. The Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said. Shortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time Chaudhry was removed from his post. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated.  See a timeline of upheaval in Pakistan » . Musharraf complained in his speech that the media -- which he made independent -- have not been supportive, but have reported ""negative"" news. Early Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000,  said Talat Hussain, director of news and current affairs for AAJ.  Watch a former Pakistani P.M. call the developments in his country 'disturbing' » . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who is in Turkey for a conference with Iraq and neighboring nations -- said The United States doesn't support any extra-constitutional measures taken by Musharraf. ""The situation is just unfolding,"" Rice said. ""But anything that takes Pakistan off the democratic path, off the path of civilian rule is a step backward, and it's highly regrettable."" A senior Pakistani official said the emergency declaration will be ""short-lived,"" and will be followed by an interim government. Martial law is only a way to restore law and order, he said. Mahmud Ali Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, agreed. ""I can assure you, he will move on the part of democracy that is promised ... and you will see that happen shortly."" Musharraf was re-elected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official, because the Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader. The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later. Some speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf. Musharraf has said repeatedly he will step down as military leader before the next term begins on November 15 and has promised to hold parliamentary elections by January 15. Meanwhile, popular opposition leader Imran Khan said early Sunday that police surrounded his house in Lahore, barged in and told him he was under house arrest. Musharraf also had Khan placed under house arrest during a government crackdown in March 2006. Asked about Musharraf's actions Saturday, Khan said, ""We are going to oppose this in every way."" ""None of us accept ... this whole drama about emergency."" Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto -- who arrived in Karachi Saturday from Dubai, where she had gone to visit her family -- described a ""wave of disappointment"" at Musharraf's actions.  Watch crowds surround Bhutto upon her arrival » . Bhutto -- who returned to Pakistan last month after several years in exile -- wants to lift her Pakistan People's Party to victory in January's parliamentary election in the hope she can have a third term as prime minister. The nation's political atmosphere has been tense for months, with Pakistani leaders in August considering  a state of emergency because of the growing security threats in the country's lawless tribal regions. But Musharraf, influenced in part by Rice, held off on the move.  Watch a report on the volatile situation in Pakistan » . Musharraf, who led the 1999 coup as Pakistan's army chief, has seen his power erode since the failed effort to oust Chaudhry.

"(CNN) -- South Korea launched an investigation Tuesday into reports of toxic chemicals being dumped at a former U.S. military base, the Defense Ministry said. The tests follow allegations of American soldiers burying chemicals on Korean soil. The first tests are being carried out by a joint military, government and civilian task force at the site of what was Camp Mercer, west of Seoul. ""Soil and underground water will be taken in the areas where toxic chemicals were allegedly buried,"" said the statement from the South Korean Defense Ministry. Once testing is finished, the government will decide on how to test more than 80 other sites -- all former bases. The alarm was raised this month when a U.S. veteran alleged barrels of the toxic herbicide Agent Orange were buried at an American base in South Korea in the late 1970s. Two of his fellow soldiers corroborated his story about Camp Carroll, about 185 miles (300 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Seoul. ""We've been working very closely with the Korean government since we had the initial claims,"" said Lt. Gen. John Johnson, who is heading the Camp Carroll Task Force. ""If we get evidence that there is a risk to health, we are going to fix it."" A joint U.S.- South Korean investigation is being conducted at Camp Carroll to test the validity of allegations. The U.S. military sprayed Agent Orange from planes onto jungles in Vietnam to kill vegetation in an effort to expose guerrilla fighters. Exposure to the chemical has been blamed for a wide variety of ailments, including certain forms of cancer and nerve disorders. It has also been linked to birth defects, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Journalist Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.","U.S. and South Korea teams are searching for chemicals at former military bases .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's spokesman listed Wednesday specific steps the Egyptian government needs to take to satisfy the demands of protesters convulsing the country. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called for expanding he negotiations with opposition groups, lifting the state of emergency and making constitutional changes to bring about democratic elections. ""We think more has to be done, and more importantly, I think the people of Egypt think more has to be done,"" Gibbs told reporters. In a sign of increasing tension between the United States and Egypt over the demonstrations that began January 25, Egypt's foreign minister said in a U.S. television interview that the Obama administration should back off from pushing President Hosni Mubarak to speed up the reform process. ""When you speak about prompt, immediate, now,"" Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told PBS ""NewsHour,"" it is ""as if you are imposing on a great country like Egypt, a great friend that has always maintained the best of relationship with the United States, you are imposing your will on him."" Aboul Gheit said the U.S. government should ""better understand the Egyptian sensitivities and better encourage the Egyptians to move forward and to do what is required -- that is my advice to you."" In particular, he rejected the call for lifting the state of emergency that has been in place for three decades, saying the special security powers were needed now that thousands of prisoners had been freed during the chaos of the demonstrations. ""How can you ask me to sort of disband that emergency law while I'm in difficulty?"" Aboul Gheit said. ""Give me time, allow me to have control to stabilize the nation, to stabilize the state and then we would look into the issue."" At the same time, Aboul Gheit called the situation in Egypt ""an upheaval that is transforming Egypt from one era to a new era,"" and insisted that Mubarak and his new vice president, Omar Suleiman, have embarked on an irreversible path of reforms sought by the demonstrators and the United States. He compared his government's situation to being ""in a boat in the midst of the Nile (river) moving from one bank to the other,"" adding: ""Give us the time to row and to go with the current and see how we will reach that point."" Gibbs, however, said it was the people of Egypt who needed to see concrete steps toward the changes they seek, and that the Obama administration was merely expressing the reality of the situation. ""I think it is clear that what the government has so far put forward has yet to meet the minimum threshold of the people of Egypt,"" Gibbs said, later adding: ""I think if there's some notion on the government side that you can put the genie back in this bottle, I think that's gone a long time ago."" Asked about past warnings that the United States could withhold some or all of the more than $1 billion in annual military aid to Egypt, Gibbs said any decision would be based on the response of the Egyptian government to the demonstrations. ""We are watching quite closely to see what those responses are, and the response of the government will determine what that aid looks like,"" Gibbs said. He repeated U.S. opposition to any kind of violent crackdown on the protesters, indicating that could be a litmus test for a decision to withhold aid. On Tuesday, Vice President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Suleiman to push for more progress, according to a White House statement. Biden urged ""that the transition produce immediate, irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people,"" according to the White House statement. The two vice presidents discussed ""restraining the Ministry of Interior's conduct by immediately ending the arrests, harassment, beating and detention of journalists, and political and civil society activists, and by allowing freedom of assembly and expression; immediately rescinding the emergency law; broadening participation in the national dialogue to include a wide range of opposition members; and inviting the opposition as a partner in jointly developing a road map and timetable for transition."" ""These steps, and a clear policy of no reprisals, are what the broad opposition is calling for and what the government is saying it is prepared to accept,"" the statement said. ""Vice President Biden expressed the belief that the demands of the broad opposition can be met through meaningful negotiations with the government."" Also on Tuesday, Gibbs made a point of directly criticizing the Egyptian government for continuing detentions, beatings and harassment of journalists and rights activists. ""The government has got to stop arresting protesters and journalists, harassment, beatings, detentions of reporters, of activists, of those involved in civil society,"" Gibbs said. Previously, he and other U.S. officials, including Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, called for a halt to the crackdown on journalists and activists without directly saying that the Egyptian government was responsible. Gibbs also labeled as ""particularly unhelpful"" the comment by Suleiman in an interview with ABC that Egypt lacks the necessary ""culture of democracy"" for the changes demanded by protesters, such as freedom of speech and the right to organize opposition parties. A senior administration official, speaking with CNN on condition of not being identified because of the sensitivity of a rapidly changing political situation in Cairo, acknowledged Tuesday that ""there is some sort of level of frustration here."" Overall, though, the Obama administration has been careful to call for democratic reforms in Egypt while also trying to maintain stability in a key Middle Eastern ally that is a vital Arab partner to Israel through the Camp David Accords of 1978. Gibbs repeated the U.S. call for an orderly transition in Egypt from the repressive rule of the past three decades under Mubarak to a multiparty democracy through free and fair elections. Mubarak has insisted he will remain in power through the end of his term in September instead of ceding to demands for his immediate ouster by the protesters and opposition figures. Suleiman also says Mubarak must remain in power until the next election for the transition to be orderly.

"(CNN) -- Events continue to unfold at a rapid pace in Ferguson, Missouri. The city has been in turmoil since August 9, when white city police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Protesters and law enforcement officers have clashed in the streets for several nights. Here are the latest developments for Wednesday: . Officer Wilson's backers confronted . Two supporters of Darren Wilson took to the streets of Ferguson on Wednesday evening, saying they wanted to express their views just like those calling for Wilson's arrest. They quickly had company, as dozens of Brown family backers quickly converged on them -- some of them angrily confronting them. The commotion ended quickly, however, when police came and took the two Wilson backers away. Soon thereafter, strong thunderstorms rolled through the area and put a damper on the protests. Officer suspended after threatening protester . A police officer was ""relieved of duty and suspended indefinitely"" Wednesday after pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at a ""peaceful"" protester in Ferguson, St. Louis County police said. Video showed the officer using vulgarity to threaten a protester, as the pointed his rifle at the protester. The officer -- from nearby St. Ann, one of many communities who have contributed officers to the force charged with keeping the peace in Ferguson -- was soon thereafter led away by a St. Louis County police sergeant. Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who is heading security in Ferguson, said he was ""disturbed"" by the video, adding that the officer's actions ""disrespect"" those officers who have shown restraint over the past two weeks. Attorney General Holder visits Ferguson . The nation's top federal law enforcement official, Eric Holder, paid a visit Wednesday to Ferguson -- talking with community leaders, students, and the parents of Michael Brown. The U.S. Justice Department, which Holder heads, is conducting a civil rights investigation into Brown's shooting. Dozens of FBI agents have interviewed witnesses. Authorities would have to prove some element of ""racial hostility"" to convict Wilson on a civil rights charge, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin notes. Holder met with and complimented Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, and also addressed students at a local community college. Holder he talked about his own experiences as a black man dealing with racial profiling as he told those in the crowd, ""I understand that mistrust"" of police. Prosecutor: Grand jury won't be done for months . St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that his office would begin presenting its case on this matter to a grand jury on Wednesday. But the end is still far off: McCulloch estimated his office won't be done presenting evidence until mid-October. Many Brown family supporters have asked that McCulloch be taken off the case, with St. Louis Alderman Antonio French saying that his ""relationship with the African-American community has not been good for a long time."" Yet McCulloch has shown no sign of leaving his post. Gov. Jay Nixon could decide to appoint a special prosecutor in his place, but he hasn't given any indication he'll do so. In fact, McCulloch went on the offensive after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon tried to deflect calls for the prosecutor's ouster by saying it was up to the prosecutor to recuse himself. PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENTS: . Violence but no looting, no tear gas . As midnight approached late Tuesday, it looked like protesters and police had managed to pull off a night of peace, but officers donned riot gear and formed a line in front of local businesses, commanding a crowd in a parking lot to clear out. A bottle flew at the officers, setting off a powder keg of tensions, with police sprinting after and arresting people and more bottles flying at them -- some plastic, some glass. Highway patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told journalists that ""criminals"" had also thrown urine on police. Riot police presence ballooned, dogs and pepper spray came out briefly, and officers arrested 47 people. Two guns were confiscated from a car. But gone were the tear gas, rubber bullets, and Molotov cocktails that had marred protests overnight Monday. Michael Brown's family: . Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told NBC's ""Today"" show that the only way to end the unrest is ""justice"" -- which her family and their supporters have repeatedly tied to the arrest of the police officer who killed Brown. ""Justice will bring peace, I believe,"" McSpadden said. The family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, also announced that Brown's funeral will be held Monday. The police officer: . Darren Wilson, 28, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is on paid administrative leave. If he returns to duty, he would have to undergo two psychological evaluations, authorities said. Wilson has garnered more and more public support in recent days. That includes a rally held for him in St. Louis and a fundraising effort that had raised more than $36,000 from nearly 1,000 people as of Tuesday. School closures: . The situation remains so unstable that the Ferguson-Florissant School District said it is canceling classes for the rest of the week. Two nearby districts -- Jennings and Riverview Gardens -- opted to remain closed again Tuesday as well, according to CNN affiliate KMOV. In light of the closure, the Ferguson-Florissant School District is offering food assistance -- in the form of sack lunches -- to children and teenagers at five elementary schools between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee chose Pyeongchang, South Korea, Wednesday to host the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. The other two bid cities were Munich, Germany, and Annecy, France. Pyeongchang narrowly failed in its bids for 2010 and 2014, losing by three votes to Vancouver, Canada, for last year's event and by four votes to Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 event. South Korea has never hosted the Winter Games, though the capital city of Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. France has hosted three editions of the Winter Olympics, most recently in 1992 in Albertville. Munich would have been the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The city attracted the Summer Games in 1972. Representatives from the three cities made their cases to committee members in Durban, South Africa Wednesday. The proposed date for the festival of sport to begin is February 9, 2018. The Games will take place across 13 venues, with six of those to be constructed of the next seven years. Pyeongchang will become the first Asian city outside of Japan to play host to the Winter Games and hopes to become a center for Winter sports once the event is over. The delegation representing Pyeongchang included Lee Myung-Bak, president of South Korea, 2010 figure skating gold medalist Kim Yu-Na and the former governor of Gangwon province -- where the city is located -- Kim Jin-Seun.","Pyeongchang has been chosen as the host for the 2018 Winter Olympics .

"Seoul (CNN) -- South Korea plans to intensify the review of its social networking sites and smart phone applications to combat a surge in ""illegal and harmful"" information, government officials said. The Korea Communications Standards Commission said it will reshuffle departments to make way for a review team that will oversee new media content. Review of Internet content has been in place since 2008, but the commission said the move will boost effectiveness and meet growing demands. Social media users and civic groups decried the Thursday announcement, saying it clamps down on freedom of expression. ""This is an authoritarian and anachronistic abuse of power that strips people of their freedom of expression and political freedom by blocking their eyes and ears,"" one of South Korea's largest civic organizations, People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, said in a news release. Critics say the government is using the new measure to clamp down on opposition voices with the upcoming general and presidential elections next year. ""It's to block out any voices calling on people to participate in the presidential elections next year,"" Twitter user bbohea929 wrote. Another user, csoaea, said ""it feels like we've gone back 30 years."" The number of illegal and harmful postings on social networking sites has increased rapidly since 2008 and is expected to grow, according to the government's standards commission. Cases deemed illegal for obscenity last year and this year were 41 and 45 respectively, while those violating national security jumped from 28 to 159, according to the commission. The commission vowed to limit its scope to obscene content deemed inappropriate for minors and that which violates the law. However, the legal boundaries are ambiguous and include defamation, national security and inciting fear, a major concern for critics. The standards commission called the concerns ""groundless"" and said the new process will not influence the formation of public sentiment in the cyber world.","Review of Internet content has been in place since 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Koh JaeYoul may not work at a powerful South Korean media outlet, but the might of his 140 character tweets is considered one of this highly wired country's most influential. Koh is better known by his 72,000 twitter followers as Dogsul, or 'straight talk' in Korean. According to twitoast, Dogsul is one of South Korea's top 10 power twitterers. One of his consistent discussions lately has been the South Korean government's approach to social media users. ""South Korea is competing with North Korea in trying to control the public,"" Koh says. As we talk, Koh tweets a question to his followers, asking what they think about South Korean President Lee Myung Bak's moves against netizens. The responses vary, from comparisons to China's attempts to control speech on the web, to allegations that the administration is trying to hide information from its citizens. ""People are angry,"" Koh says. The anger stems from a number of incidents, including recent indictments against 19 people. The government charged the 19 defendants with sending false text messages under a 50-year-old telecommunications law that states spreading lies with the intent of harming the public interest is punishable by law. The text messages were sent in the wake of North Korea's November 23rd attack on the south's Yeonpyeong Island, which killed two South Korean marines and two civilians. The government says the 19 defendants sent text messages stating that South Korea had declared war and the military was mobilizing. Yesterday, South Korea's Constitutional Court, which has jurisdiction over constitutional review of statutes, complaints and disputes, ruled that the telecommunications law was unconstitutional. The court found the term ""public interest"" too ""unclear and abstract,"" according to the court. The case before the Constitutional Court was brought by a blogger who in 2009, posted a warning online that the country's foreign reserves would be drained soon because of the government's irresponsible foreign exchange rate policies during the global economic slowdown. The government indicted him with spreading false information online, under the telecommunications law. Now that the court has ruled the law unconstitutional, legal watchers are predicting the 19 indicted texters will see their indictments reversed. The ruling comes as President Lee Myung-bak is stepping up his rhetoric and pushing for a united public opinion from his citizens against Pyongyang. In his weekly radio address, Lee said, ""To this end, we need to stand together united as one. There can be no difference between you and me when it comes to national security because our lives and the survival of the nation depend on it."" Referring to the North wanting the South's citizens to question the government, Lee said, ""They are focusing on trying to pull us apart. For this reason, we need to achieve national unity before taking strong military countermeasures. If we show the North Koreans how steadfastly united we are, they will not dare challenge us. Their intentions will be thwarted. They always have their eyes open to take advantage of any opportunity if they detect any divisiveness in our minds and thoughts."" But Koh says the Lee administration should harness, not fight social media users. ""Whether public opinion is divided or undivided is not the issue,"" Koh says. ""What's important is whether issues are being fully discussed. Government isn't always right. There should be more communication.""","""South Korea is competing with North Korea in trying to control the public,"" social media user says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)  -- Massive downpours in South Korea -- the heaviest rains in a century -- are blamed for 51 deaths, the country's Central Disaster Relief Agency reported Friday. One person is also missing, the agency said. Conditions improved Friday morning when the Seoul Gimpo International Airport reported light rain and mist with overcast skies, according to the U.S. National Weather Service's international weather conditions website. On Thursday, rain fell in some areas around Seoul at a rate of 50 millimeters an hour (two inches an hour). The most recent numbers released by the Central Disaster Relief Agency indicated that much of the death toll comes from landslides triggered by the rain. In Chuncheon, 13 people were killed by landslides, while 16 were killed by the same phenomenon in Seoul. Another 18 died in Gyeonggi province. Five neighborhoods on the outskirts of Seoul had been under evacuation orders Thursday. But officials were able to restore electricity to many thousands of homes that had lost power. Earlier, there were 116,000 homes without power, said the agency. Thursday, that number stood at 800. Earlier, the agency warned that hundreds of families had lost their homes. The weather caused major traffic disruptions across portions of the country as well. South Korea typically experiences a rainy season during the summer.","Rain falling at a rate of two inches an hour in some areas .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of serial sex attacks in Tulsa was identified Thursday, fours days after crashing his car into a light pole while fleeing the scene of one of his alleged assaults, authorities said. The suspect, Demond Campbell, 30, was presented with charges related to seven sexual assaults even though he was in critical condition and unresponsive in a hospital since his car wreck Sunday, Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan said Thursday. Campbell was identified as a suspect in the sex attacks after an analysis of a ""tremendous amount of absolutely miraculous evidence collection and crime scene investigation,"" Jordan said. Though the suspect had no criminal record in Tulsa, Jordan said, he turned up in a Google search of his name by police. It was a report of his car crash. The speeding car he was traveling in struck a light pole on an interstate early Sunday morning about 10 minutes after one of his alleged sexual assaults, Jordan said. Campbell, who was not wearing a seat belt, suffered severe head injuries. ""He has not been responsive at all,"" Jordan said. Campbell was released from prison in late April after convictions in Oklahoma City for attempted robbery, attempted kidnapping and robbery, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, Jordan said. He was imprisoned in 2007. The spate of sexual assaults and lack of clues had left residents on edge and looking out for anything unusual. ""I hope this gives them some peace,"" Jordan said of the victims and community at large. Authorities said the suspect typically broke into homes from the back, either through a window or door. He tended to be covered, and attacked when it was dark. Victims provided diverse descriptions of the suspect, ranging from a light-skinned black or Hispanic man to a tan white man. There were eight cases of sexual assault in Tulsa in the last month and authorities linked them because of specific actions and statements the suspect made in the attacks. But police now say one of the eight assaults is still under investigation and may not be connected, CNN affiliate KOKI reported. The victims were between 56 and 78 years old, except for one, who was 29. Campbell's record includes arrests in 2002 for armed robbery, in 2005 for attempted assault on a woman, and in 2006 on a warrant for assault and battery, KOKI reported. In 2006, he was convicted for attempted battery. Jordan said investigators were checking with police in Oklahoma City to see whether Campbell was involved in additional crimes. No other arrests were expected in connection with the seven attacks, he said. Jordan said prosecutors were preparing formal charges in the cases -- some of which involved alleged sexual battery, others alleged rapes. Alabama catches suspect in serial sex crime cold case .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A cyber attack Friday morning hit 40 South Korean websites, including those of several government agencies and major banks, the country's internet security agency said. The government detected the first wave of the attack Thursday. It was coordinated from outside South Korea using ""zombie"" computers -- computers which have downloaded malicious codes -- to target designated websites, slow them down or paralyze their operation, the internet security agency said. Infected computers directed a giant traffic surge to targeted websites. That's called a DDoS attack, short for distributed denial-of-service -- and it's hard for most sites to defend against. By Friday, South Korea's leading security software company had developed a free anti-virus program to treat infected computers. Software company AhnLab said it developed the anti-virus program after receiving reports of the attack from the South Korean government Thursday. The company warned that another attack would hit websites at 6:30 p.m. Friday. Targeted sites include South Korea's presidential office, the foreign ministry, the defense ministry and main banking websites, according to a statement issued by AhnLab. No severe damage has been reported so far, but the government said it was monitoring the attack. During a similar attack in 2009, 17 South Korean websites were hit over a three-day period.","Officials say the attack is being coordinated from outside South Korea .

"(CNN) -- In the face of North Korean threats, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak stepped up his nationalist push, urging countrymen in a radio address ""to stand together, united as one."" ""There can be no difference between you and me when it comes to national security, because our lives and the survival of the nation depend on it,"" Lee said Monday. The remarks marked the latest in the war of words between the communist North and free-enterprise South, which split after Japan's defeat in World War II. Over the past six decades, small-scale skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders, including deadly naval clashes along the demarcation line in 1999, 2002 and 2009. The situation, if anything, has worsened in recent months -- stirred by the sinking of a South Korean warship and deadly shelling of a border island. While there previously had been movement toward reconciliation, recent events have sparked demonstrations calling for Seoul to be bolder and more defiant. Lee referenced such attacks as ""provocations against us without the slightest hesitation"" in his Sunday address, saying they proved that, ""if we merely let the North have its own way, national security and peace cannot be guaranteed."" The president said that Seoul had ""thus far shown patience, time and again (as it) struggled to maintain peace."" Even so, he said that now was the time for South Koreans to rally as one -- and not to back down in the face of Pyongyang's threats or actions. ""If we show the North Koreans how steadfastly united we are, they will not dare challenge us,"" said Lee. Just last Thursday, North Korea threatened to launch a ""sacred war"" after South Korea completed large military exercises near the volatile inter-Korean border. ""The revolutionary armed forces of the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) are getting fully prepared to launch a sacred war of justice of Korean style based on the nuclear deterrent at anytime necessary,"" North Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Chun said, according to the state-run KCNA news agency. ""The South Korean puppet forces perpetrated such grave military provocation as renewing their shelling against the DPRK during their recent exercises for a war of aggression in the West Sea of Korea,"" Kim said. ""This indicates that the enemy's scenario for aggression aimed at the start of another Korean War, has reached the phase of its implementation."" The long-planned South Korean exercises, billed as the largest land and air winter drills, were conducted in Pocheon just 15 miles from the North Korean border. More than 800 military personnel, fighter jets and anti-tank missiles took part in the exercise, which also involved more than 100 types of weapons. Tensions have been running high since the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan last March, killing 46 sailors. South Korea and the international community blamed the North for the Cheonan incident, but Pyongyang denied the accusations. Then, last month, North Korea said the South's navy fired into Northern waters and in retaliation, it shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans. South Korea said its Navy was simply holding drills and conducted similar naval exercises again on Monday, drawing threats from Pyongyang that it would attack again. But that did not happen.","President Lee Myung-bak tells South Koreans ""we need to stand together""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea said Thursday it will have to consider the North's motivation in calling for unconditional peace talks before agreeing to them. ""We have always emphasized that sincerity from the North is important in inter-Korean talks and relations. Related ministries are currently reviewing the context and motivations behind the recent proposal,"" foreign ministry spokesman Kim Young-sun said in a regular briefing to press members Thursday. On Wednesday, the North Korean government issued a statement saying that the only way to mend the frayed relationship between the two neighbors is to open a dialogue. ""We are ready to meet anyone, anytime and anywhere, letting bygones be bygones, if he or she is willing to hand-in-hand with us,"" the statement said.""Dialogue and negotiations cannot be properly conducted nor can they make smooth progress ... when mud-slinging and provocative acts against each other are allowed."" Full coverage of the Koreas conflict . In response, the South Korean foreign ministry said Thursday that the north should follow up its words with action. ""I'm speaking in terms of principles. Given North Korea's recent provocations, and also the fact that it revealed its uranium enrichment program, going against expectations the international community has for its denuclearization, I'm simply saying that it's necessary to assess Pyongyang's true motivations by looking at specific actions,"" the spokesman said. Tensions have been running high between North and South Korea ever since the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan last March, killing 46 sailors. South Korea and the international community blamed the North for the sinking, but Pyongyang has denied the accusations. In November, North Korea said the South's navy fired into Northern waters and, in retaliation, it shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans. Since then, the North has called for better ties with South Korea, urging dialogue and cooperation this year, and asking the South to end its military exercises. South Korea's president said in a televised New Year's address that North Korea needs to work toward peace with deeds. ""I remind the North that the path toward peace is yet open. The door for dialogue is still open. If the North exhibits sincerity, we have both the will and the plan to drastically enhance economic cooperation together with the international community,"" South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said.","S.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Scientists have found what they described this week as the earliest oil paintings ever discovered. Afghan murals show oil painting was going on for centuries earlier in Asia than Europe. Murals found on cave walls in Afghanistan prove that painting with oil had been going on in Asia for centuries before artists used the technique in Europe, scientists said this week. Until now, art historians believed that oil painting started in Europe in the 15th century. Scientists found the murals in a network of caves where monks lived and prayed in the Afghan region of Bamiyan, according to a statement on the Web site of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, where the ancient paintings were analyzed. Until 2001, two colossal 6th-century statues of Buddhas stood at the mouth of the caves. Then the Taliban, which then ruled Afghanistan, blew up the statues on the grounds that they were un-Islamic. The action drew international condemnation. Inside the caves, scientists found murals painted in the 7th century. They show images of Buddha in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures. In 12 of 50 caves, the murals were painted using drying oils -- perhaps from walnuts and poppy seeds -- the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility said. Its findings on the age of the oil paintings were published this week in The Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry. ""This is the earliest clear example of oil paintings in the world,"" said Yoko Taniguchi, leader of the team of scientists. Bamiyan, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Kabul, was once a thriving center of commerce and Buddhism. The paintings, scientists say, were probably the work of artists who traveled along the Silk Road, the ancient trade route between China, across Central Asia's desert to the West. The Taliban used dozens of explosives to demolish the Buddha statues in Bamiyan. Museums and governments around the world had hoped to save the two Buddhas, the earliest of which is thought to have been carved into sandstone cliffs in the third century A.D. At heights of 53 meters and 36 meters, the statues were the tallest standing Buddhas in the world. Later in 2001, U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Now, the United Nations cultural agency, UNESCO, is trying to restore the bigger of the two statues. The task could take years.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea proposed on Wednesday holding working-level talks with North Korea on February 11, the unification ministry said. The meeting would take place at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, and is aimed at paving the way for higher-level military talks. The South will demand that Pyongyang take responsibility for last year's military provocations and promise not to carry out any more attacks, the unification ministry said. The ministry said this month that it had reopened communication channels with North Korea in the border area of Panmunjom. The date and venue for the preliminary talks were communicated via a military line there, Yonhap reported. It was the first time in eight months the two sides reopened the hot line. North Korea cut it off May 26 to protest Seoul's response to the March sinking of a South Korean naval ship. South Korea has blamed North Korea for the attack, which killed 46 sailors. Pyongyang denies any involvement in the sinking of the Cheonan. Tensions rose again in November, when North Korea shelled South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. North Korea said the strike was in response to the South's navy firing into Northern waters. South Korea also proposed separate high-level talks with North Korea to discuss the issue of denuclearization, a request the North has not responded to, the unification ministry said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Navy captain who produced profanity- and slur-laden videos while second in charge of the USS Enterprise will be permanently relieved of his command of the ship, a top Navy commander said Tuesday. The Navy will also investigate the role other senior officers played in the video scandal, Adm. John Harvey, commander of the U.S. Fleet Forces Command, said. ""While Capt. Honors' performance as commanding officer of USS Enterprise has been without incident, his profound lack of good judgment and professionalism while previously serving as executive officer on Enterprise calls into question his character and completely undermines his credibility to continue to serve effectively in command,"" Harvey said, reading from a prepared statement. He did not take questions. Honors will be replaced by Capt. Dee Mewbourne, a former aircraft carrier commander who currently serves as chief of staff for the Navy Cyber Forces, Harvey said. Honors has been reassigned to administrative duties with the Naval Air Force Atlantic command, Harvey said. Excerpts from the videos and descriptions of their content were first published Saturday by The Virginian-Pilot newspaper in Norfolk, Virginia. The videos on the paper's website, reviewed by CNN, feature a man identified by two Navy officials and The Virginian-Pilot as Honors, who at the time was the executive officer, or second in command, of the aircraft carrier. He recently took command of the carrier, winning one of the most coveted assignments in the U.S. Navy, which has only 11 aircraft carriers. Navy spokesman Cmdr. Chris Sims said the videos, which were shown to the crew of the Enterprise while on deployment supporting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and 2007, are ""inappropriate."" Honors is shown cursing along with other members of his staff in an attempt to demonstrate humor, according to the videos. There are also anti-gay slurs, simulated sex acts, and what appear to be two female sailors in a shower together. The investigation was ordered Friday by Harvey, the four-star head of the Navy's Fleet Forces Command, after the videos were detailed in The Virginian-Pilot. The paper also posted a link to some of the material, but edited it so that expletives were censored and some identities of junior Navy crew were disguised. ""After personally reviewing the videos created while serving as executive officer, I have lost confidence in Capt. Honors' ability to lead effectively, and he is being held accountable for poor judgment and the inappropriate actions demonstrated in the videos that were created while he served as executive officer on Enterprise,"" Harvey said. Harvey said that investigators will continue to examine the circumstances surrounding the production and distribution of the videos, which were shown to the Enterprise's 6,000-member crew over a two-year stretch. He said the investigation will look at ""the actions of other senior officers who knew of the videos and the actions they took in response."" The Pentagon said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates knows about the bawdy videos but is leaving the fate of Honors up to senior Navy leaders. ""The Navy leadership is fully capable of handling this issue and taking appropriate action. It is not something that requires the secretary of defense,"" Col. Dave Lapan, Pentagon spokesman, told an off-camera question-and-answer session. ""I don't know if the secretary has been briefed on it. I know he is aware of it,"" Lapan said. He said Gates was not involved in the decision-making process over whether Honors would remain in command of the Enterprise. CNN left a message for Honors on Saturday. The Virginian-Pilot said he did not respond to requests for comment. The Navy issued a statement Saturday, saying, in part, ""production of videos, like the ones produced four to five years ago on USS Enterprise and now being written about in the Virginian-Pilot, were not acceptable then and are still not acceptable in today's Navy. The Navy does not endorse or condone these kinds of actions."" The statement also said, ""U.S. Fleet Forces Command has initiated an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the production of these videos; however, it would be inappropriate to comment any further on the specifics of the investigation."" But the Saturday statement was an about-face from the initial military statement to the newspaper. In that statement, the Navy said the videos were ""not created with the intent to offend anyone. The videos were intended to be humorous skits focusing the crew's attention on specific issues such as port visits, traffic safety, water conservation, ship cleanliness, etc."" Sims said senior officers had not yet seen the videos when they issued the first statement. It was after viewing them that the investigation was ordered, he said. When the videos first came to light the ""leadership"" of the Enterprise was ""directed"" to make certain future videos were appropriate, the Navy said. Sims said he was not aware if Honors was ever reprimanded. In the videos, Honors repeatedly jokes that his superior officers were unaware of the content of the videos and ""they should absolutely not be held accountable."" The Virginian-Pilot says the videos were shown over the ship's internal broadcast system. Lapan, while trying to avoid commenting directly on the Honors episode, defended how the military identifies and punishes inappropriate behavior. ""While incidents like this, allegations like this draw a lot of attention, they are still relatively few and far between in terms of the millions of service members in service doing the right thing. And we have processes in place throughout the military services to handle actions that are inappropriate or rise to higher levels,"" he said. ""There are always going to be people who do things they shouldn't be doing and those people will be held accountable. The system works,"" Lapan said. The Enterprise videos, which include slurs against gays and lesbians, coincide with Defense Department preparations to implement last month's congressional repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that banned homosexuals from serving openly in the military. ""Those types of comments were inappropriate before the law was repealed,"" Lapan said. ""There's a service culture across all the services of treating everyone with dignity and respect, and inappropriate comments aren't acceptable at one point of time and unacceptable several months later because there has been a change in the law,"" he added. CNN's Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","NEW: Navy investigators will look at the role other officers played in the video scandal .

But he hit back with two breaks of his own to take control and with it the first set. Three breaks of service in the second set saw him take a stranglehold on the match and the third set followed a similar pattern. Serving for the coveted team title, he made no mistake and completed victory with a decisive smash.

"Washington (CNN) -- A year ago, President Barack Obama was under fire. Today, he is being feted. In just 12 months, the 51-year-old lawyer and former U.S. senator raised by a single mother went from a beleaguered candidate for re-election -- his record and signature health care law under daily attack by Republican rivals -- to being the first Democrat to win more than 50% of a presidential vote twice since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Now the nation's first African-American president is CNN's Most Intriguing Person of 2012, as voted on by readers of CNN.com, five days after being named TIME's Person of the Year. Second most intriguing: Malala Yousufzai: The girl the Taliban wanted dead . Explaining Time's choice, Executive Editor Richard Stengel cited Obama ""for finding and forging a new majority, for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking, amid great adversity, to create a more perfect union."" Time: 2012 Person of the Year . Such accolades and results seemed improbable a year ago when Obama's approval rating hovered in the low 40s while unemployment was 8.5%. History showed that it was rare, if not unprecedented, for an incumbent to win re-election with such figures. In December 2011, Obama's signature health care reform law faced a Supreme Court challenge and unrelenting criticism from Republicans, especially conservatives who depicted it as a socialism-inspired government takeover of almost 20% of the U.S. economy. In addition, a fierce political battle with congressional Republicans over taxes and spending dominated headlines that month. It was the latest in a series of fiscal showdowns that already caused an unprecedented downgrade in the U.S. credit rating earlier in the year. Despite ordering the mission that took out Osama bin Laden in May 2011 and welcoming home the last combat troops from Iraq seven months later, the president faced questions from some critics about his plan to end Afghanistan combat operations in 2014. Bin Laden killing caps decade-long manhunt . Meanwhile, the upcoming election primary season focused attention on the Republican presidential race, spiced by frequent debates that gave candidates ample opportunity to tee off on Obama's record. His detractors labeled him a failure and said he was over his head, unable to understand the still sluggish economy recovering from recession, let alone how to strengthen it. A year later, Obama has parlayed his bad hand into a jackpot result. Obama takes key battlegrounds to win re-election . The economy, which had just started to hint at consistent recovery toward the end of 2011, continued to strengthen incrementally through 2012, with the unemployment rate falling to 7.7% in November. CNNMoney: Unemployment rate falls to lowest level since 2008 . Such steady, albeit slow growth provided cover for Obama against the Republican attack line that his push for stimulus spending in response to the recession he inherited amounted to wasted money and failed policy. While buffeted at times by Europe's deficit and currency woes, an overall perception of growing economic stability was a major reason Obama defeated GOP challenger Mitt Romney in November by more than 4 million votes. Perhaps equally beneficial was the Supreme Court's June ruling that the Affordable Care Act didn't violate the Constitution, ending a litany of legal challenges and giving the controversial measure an important public affirmation. While Romney campaigned on repealing the health care law if elected, the Supreme Court decision strengthened Obama's ability to tout the benefits of the reforms to avoid the issue becoming an election liability. Supreme Court on health care: How justices voted . The president also made foreign policy a campaign strength over Romney, a former governor with little experience on international issues. Obama touted the bin Laden mission and how he kept his 2008 campaign pledge to end the Iraq War while also starting to wind down the U.S. military role in Afghanistan. During the final months of the election campaign, Obama also recovered the message and personal style that catapulted him to his historic victory four years earlier. Shouting himself hoarse at times on the trail, he cast himself as the champion of equal opportunity and closing a widening wealth gap in the country. His campaign also benefited from key policy moves by the president. The administration halted deportations of some children of illegal immigrants, ensuring overwhelming support from the growing Hispanic-American community that proved vital on Election Day. An earlier step to end the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that barred openly gay and lesbian people from military service as well his eventual support for same-sex marriage boosted his standing with younger Americans -- another key demographic. Obama announces he supports same-sex marriage . As the end of his first term approached, Obama's approval rating topped 50%, and polls showed the public consistently favoring his approach on deficit reduction over Republican positions. ""This one's more satisfying than '08,"" he told top aides on Election Night, according to the Time cover story on his being named Person of the Year. ""It wasn't just about what I was going to do as president. It's what I've done.""","President Barack Obama's year of triumph ends with accolade from CNN.com readers .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The chief nuclear envoys of North and South Korea agreed Friday to try to resume six-party talks as soon as possible, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said. Wi Sung-lac, the chief negotiator for the South in six-party talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program, met with the North's Ri Yong-ho on the sidelines of the regional forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Bali, Indonesia. The South Korean Foreign Ministry described the meeting as ""productive."" The two-hour session was the first such direct meeting on nuclear issues between the two nations since six-party talks broke down in 2008, when North Korea pulled out of the multi-nation nuclear disarmament initiative. Representatives of the other nations involved in the six-party talks -- the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia -- are also in Bali. Relations between North and South Korea have been more difficult since the sinking of a South Korean warship Cheonan 15 months ago and the shelling of South Korea's Yeongpyong Island last November. South Korea acknowledged last month having held a secret meeting with its neighbour in May, which it said was aimed at persuading it to apologize for those attacks, in which 50 South Koreans died. North Korea denies sinking the warship. The North Korean National Defence Commission said the South had asked for a series of summits at the secret meeting.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's national police chief resigned Monday amid criticism over authorities' handling of an emergency call from a woman who was later found murdered. Cho Hyun-oh, commissioner of the National Police Agency, issued an apology, acknowledging ""police incompetence and carelessness."" A woman in her 20s called police the night of April 1, saying she was being raped, according to authorities in the city of Suwon, south of Seoul. She gave police details as to her whereabouts, using a nearby school and playground as landmarks. Suwon police said the woman's seven-minute phone call to authorities was tracked, but the police operator who took the call did not tell police at the scene the woman reported being inside a house. As a result, police only checked outside areas and did not search homes in the area. By the time authorities located the woman, she had been murdered. A man has been arrested in connection with her death. The woman's body was found at the home of the murder suspect, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Cho also said he regrets attempts at a police cover-up. Authorities initially claimed they dispatched more officers to the scene than they actually had, and said the victim's phone call lasted only seconds. Six family members of the victim met Monday with Cho and other police officials to protest police handling of the case, Yonhap reported. ""I pray for the victim's soul, express my condolences to her family and ask for forgiveness,"" Cho told reporters in a press conference, Yonhap said. ""I blame myself deeply and express my heartfelt apology for the carelessness of the police and the horrendous results it led to, as well as for causing disappointment to the people through the police's attempt to cover up (the case) and their lies.""","Cho Hyun-oh acknowledges police bungled an emergency call .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. House of Representatives voted Thursday to extend three provisions of the Patriot Act and Intelligence Reform bill that are due to expire next month. The bill, which extends the provisions for another three months, passed in a 279-143 vote.  Republicans overwhelmingly backed the extensions, while a majority of Democrats were opposed. The measure now goes to President Barack Obama's desk to be signed into law. A similar measure extending the provisions for a longer period of time failed last week by a vote of 277-148 -- seven votes shy of the 284 needed to pass under a House rule requiring a two-thirds majority. Thursday's House vote required only a simple majority.  The Senate approved the final version of the measure earlier this week. One of the three provisions, Section 206 of the Patriot Act, provides for roving wiretap surveillance of targets who try to thwart Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance. Without such roving wiretap authority, investigators would be forced to seek a new court order each time they need to change the location, phone or computer that needs to be monitored. Another provision, Section 215, allows the FBI to apply to the FISA court to issue orders granting the government access to any tangible items in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases. The third provision, Section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004, closes a loophole that could allow individual terrorists not affiliated with specific organizations to slip through the cracks of FISA surveillance. Law enforcement officials refer to it as the ""lone wolf"" provision. Legislators opposed to the extensions claim the provisions -- particularly related to wiretapping --  are intrusive and unconstitutional.  Supporters argue they are a critical component of U.S. anti-terror operations. The White House has indicated it would have preferred a longer extension of the three provisions, through 2013.","The U.S. House has voted to extend three provisions in the Patriot Act .

"Yeonpyeong Island, South Korea (CNN) -- Amid South Korean plans to hold live-fire military drills this week and North Korean threats of retaliation, many residents of Yeonpyeong Island are evacuating, afraid of being caught in the middle. Villagers streamed onto what they believed was the last ferry to Incheon, South Korea, on Sunday, carrying what belongings they could. Some were holding their children as others helped the elderly. ""I'm leaving because they said the drills are tomorrow,"" said Kim Ok Jin, 66. Kim said the island was once a good place to live and she does not want to leave. ""Of course I'm angry,"" she said. ""But that's not going to change anything."" See more of CNN.com's special coverage of the Koreas . Many Yeonpyeong residents are evacuating for a second time. This time, however, they have warning. On November 23, they had none before North Korea began shelling the island. Two civilians and two South Korean Marines died in the attack. The South Korean military said Thursday that its drills will take place in the seas southwest of Yeonpyeong Island between December 18 and 21, but bad weather forced a delay Saturday. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported the drills will take place Monday or Tuesday in the Yellow Sea off the island. As villagers departed, few signs of life remained on the island -- only military trucks patrolling and waiting for possible North Korean retaliation for the drills. Not everyone on Yeonpyeong, however, was leaving. Song Young Ok said she has not been told to stop selling tickets for the ferry off the island, and doesn't know when the military drills will take place. Song said she is planning to stay put, holed up along with others in a military bunker. She said she doesn't know why it has to be this way -- if South Korea carries out the drills, North Korea has threatened to retaliate even more strongly. South Korea's insistence on conducting the drills is picking a fight, she said. Others were more optimistic. ""It's OK,"" said ferry passenger Lee Chun Nyeo, 83. ""The soldiers need to do (the exercises), right?"" Yeonpyeong is located just south of the Northern Limit Line, the line drawn in 1953 by the United Nations just after the Korean War. The U.N. drew the line three nautical miles from the North Korean coast and put five islands close to the coast under South Korean control. That was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. But in the absence of a full peace agreement, the Northern Limit Line remains in place. North Korea has suggested an alternative line, but South Korea has resisted, as it would bring the North's maritime boundary close to Incheon, a main port. Waters in the Yellow Sea are important for fishing and crab. For North Korean fishermen especially, the blue crab season between June and September is an important source of income. Crabs have a habit of migrating south during that time, so the water is sometimes crowded with boats from both countries, as well as vessels from China. However, the Yellow Sea has seen armed clashes in the past few years, the most serious of them in 1999 and 2002. China and Russia have asked South Korea to reconsider holding the drills. Russia called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Sunday. CNN's Tim Lister contributed to this report.","Residents of Yeonpyeong Island are caught in the middle of Korean tensions .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Nine North Koreans defected to the South by boat over the weekend, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday. The group made the border crossing Saturday in the Yellow Sea off the west of the Korean peninsula, according to the JCS. The nine defectors made the journey in an engineless boat and are being questioned by South Korean authorities about their motives and their route, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. The development comes four months after a group of 31 North Koreans accidentally crossed over into South Korean waters on a fishing boat. Four members of that group decided to defect to the South, despite Pyongyang's demands that they all be repatriated to the North, the South Korean Red Cross said in March. There are currently more than 20,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, according to the South's Unification Ministry. The number of annual defectors has risen drastically since the turn of the century and continues to climb. Defectors who are forcefully repatriated to the North after attempting to cross over into places such as China, Mongolia or Southeast Asia are commonly sent to prison camps as a punishment. Many defectors who live in South Korea fear for the lives of their family or relatives who remain in the North.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The South Korean military apologized Monday for shooting at a commercial airplane carrying 119 passengers and crew. The Asiana Airlines flight was preparing to land Friday morning at Incheon International Airport, 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Seoul, when two soldiers fired at the aircraft after mistaking it for a North Korean military jet. The soldiers were on Gyodong Island near the North Korean border. After firing 99 rounds, they reported the incident. The South Korean military claims the rounds were only warning shots from K-2 rifles, and there was no damage to the aircraft because it was out of range. ""I sincerely apologize for causing the public concern over the incident,"" Col. Lee Bung-Woo, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Monday. The aircraft, on its way from Chengdu, China, was ""flying on its regular route under command of the flight control tower,"" Asiana Airlines spokesman Ki Won Suh said. Asiana confirmed two other flights flew on the same route 20 minutes before and after the firing incident, raising questions about why only one flight concerned the soldiers. The passengers and pilots were unaware they had been fired upon until they landed. ""We understand the guards need more education on how to distinguish civilian airplanes,"" said Lee, the military spokesman. But the South Korean military said it will not reprimand the two soldiers because they acted in accordance with procedure. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two Koreas. Pyongyang said it would cut off all ties with Seoul last month, accusing the South of waging psychological warfare by sending propaganda into North Korea undermining the regime.

"(CNN) -- John Miller, who has moved back and forth between public service and journalism like few others in either profession, is doing it again. This time he's leaving CBS News, where he has been a senior correspondent for two years, and joining the New York Police Department. Miller announced his latest move on Thursday. He embodies something that is, for some media critics, a source of great concern: the so-called ""revolving door"" between the people who cover the news and the people who are being covered. For CBS, he's something else: a fount of great knowledge who will be almost impossible to replace. David Rhodes, the president of the network news division, said Miller's decision was ""a loss for CBS."" ""He's been really great for us,"" Rhodes said in a telephone interview on Thursday. CBS allowed Miller out of his contract with the network because, as Rhodes put it, ""it would just be inappropriate to stand in the way"" of a return to public service. Miller's exact title at the NYPD is not yet known. But he'll have a high-profile job in counterterrorism, reuniting with his former boss William Bratton, who was the commissioner of the police department in the mid-1990s and will return to that position in January. Miller worked for local television stations in New York before going to work for Bratton as a spokesman for the NYPD in 1994. He subsequently worked for ABC News; the Los Angeles Police Department, again under Bratton, who had become police chief there; the FBI; and the office of the Director of National Intelligence. In late 2011 he joined CBS as a senior correspondent. When asked at the time about Miller's moves back and forth between journalism and law enforcement, Rhodes said, ""He understands journalistic sources and methods and he understands our values."" On Thursday, Rhodes said of the revolving-door situation and Miller, ""He's traveled through it a number of times,"" and added ""we don't think it's a bad thing."" Rhodes praised Miller for having an unmatched Rolodex of sources and said CBS has ""benefited from that greatly."" Among the stories Rhodes cited were the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut, when Miller was frequently on television to share information he had obtained from law enforcement sources. Rhodes added, ""John was the reason why we didn't go with the erroneous reports of an arrest in the Boston bombings."" (A number of other news organizations, including CNN, prematurely reported an arrest had been made two days after the April explosions.) ""There's nobody like him, and I think people around the television industry would agree with that,"" Rhodes said. ""They all would have liked to have him on those, and many more stories that he's done for us."" Miller's close relationships with law enforcement sources, however, are among the reasons why some media critics have objected to his role at CBS and his repeated transitions from public service to journalism. They say the revolving door creates conflicts of interest for Miller and reporters like him. Miller's ""60 Minutes"" report about the National Security Agency met with disapproval by media critics earlier this month in part because of his pending move to the NYPD. (Michael Calderone of The Huffington Post said on CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" ""John Miller has left journalism twice before."" Calderone listed Miller's prior jobs and said that in the ""60 Minutes"" report, ""He disclosed only one of those for law enforcement roles."") Rhodes indicated that he didn't think the report on the NSA was a conflict of interest. He said on Thursday, ""If he (Miller) was covering the NYPD, that would have been inappropriate."" Miller's move was announced via a news report on WCBS, the CBS affiliate in New York City. In an interview, Miller alluded to the fact that he'll be involved in the city's counterterrorism efforts, saying of New York, ""They have certainly the biggest, most complex and forward-leaning counterterrorism operation of any police department in the world, so it will be a great challenge that I hope to rise to."" Rhodes said CBS News would seek to replace Miller soon, possibly through a combination of new hires. ""If and when he decides to return to journalism, we'd welcome him back,"" he said.","John Miller is leaving CBS News to join the New York Police Department .
His career has included stints in both journalism and law enforcement .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- An Atlanta, Georgia, lawyer, whose well-publicized bout with tuberculosis caused an international health scare, is suing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for invasion of privacy. Congress held hearings in June 2007 to discuss Andrew Speaker's TB case and the ensuing health scare. In the suit filed this week, Andrew Speaker alleges that the CDC released his name and sensitive medical information to the media in 2007, an act that harmed his reputation, his occupation and led to the ruin of his marriage. Speaker did not specify a dollar amount he was seeking in damages in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia. On May 29, 2007, the CDC held a press conference stating a patient with a rare form of tuberculosis, extensively drug-resistant TB which often proves fatal, had taken an international flight. The CDC, the suit alleges, did not in that press conference or other press conferences, tell the public that the organization told Speaker that he was not contagious and that the CDC knew Speaker had planned to take the trip to Greece for his wedding. Instead, the CDC unlawfully released extensive information about Speaker such as ""the fact that he had flown to Greece to get married, the fact that he was a lawyer in Atlanta, and most importantly, his identity -- none of which needed to be released to the general public in order to accomplish any legitimate public health purpose,"" the suit said. On July 3, 2007, Speaker's doctors changed his diagnosis to multi-drug resistant TB, a less dangerous but still potentially fatal form of the illness. The suit alleges that the CDC's inaccurate release of information about him caused major harm. ""Speaker became the object of unwanted public attention, including expressions of public scorn and contempt (including death threats) due to the inaccurate light in the information presented, resulting in so much strain on his marital relationship that he and his new bride parted ways after the wedding but before filing the marriage license,"" the suit alleges.","Andrew Speaker, who was diagnosed with TB, files lawsuit against CDC .

"(CNN) -- It was smooth sailing in the House, but things are looking much tighter in the Senate for a bipartisan budget proposal that aims to avert another government shutdown and relax sweeping forced spending cuts. Still, despite strong opposition from Republicans to the compromise, supporters are within striking distance of rounding up the votes they need to pass it in the Senate next week. Top aides in both parties privately expressed confidence on Friday the bill will get the necessary support, even if a couple of wary moderate Democrats end up voting ""no."" At least four Republicans told CNN they are committed to backing procedural votes needed to pass the measure. That gets the 55 Senate Democrats â€” most of whom are expected to support it -- close to the 60 votes needed to get the legislation through the chamber. Final congressional approval of an elusive budget agreement that was overwhelmingly approved in the House and supported by the White House would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off. It would also avert another government shutdown like the one in October that Americans largely blamed on Congress. ""I think it would be outrageous to shut down the government and I'm not going to do that to my constituents who I represent,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Other key GOP members . In addition to McCain, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who often votes with Democrats, said she will vote for the bill. Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said they are undecided on the bill itself, but both will vote with Democrats on the critical procedural motions. Democrats think they have a chance of getting the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri. Each seemed to be struggling with their decision. ""I would say it's not as good an agreement I had hoped for but it's a better agreement than I was afraid it might be. So I'm certainly open to looking at it,"" Blunt said. ""It needs to get done for a lot of good reasons; we want to avoid a shutdown, clearly,"" Murkowski said. ""Do I like a lot of the stuff in it? Eh, no."" Most GOP Senators, raising a variety of concerns, are expected to vote against the bill. ""I'm concerned we have once again kicked the can down now a long road,"" said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, who said he is undecided. ""I'm leaning strongly against it,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a veteran lawmaker who opposes some of the fees the bill raises. Budget deal struck . The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, on hard-hit defense and non-defense programs. It does this, in part, by raising fees on airlines tickets, shrinking the retirement benefits of some veterans, extending some cuts to Medicare providers, and imposing other fees. Current federal spending expires in mid January, raising the possibility of another shut down at that time without a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled. The strong vote in the House on the budget plan on Thursday -- 332-94 -- brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters who initially thought it would sail through the Senate where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided House. But after reading details of the agreement, many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill. ""I'd really like to stay within the caps,"" complained Sen. John Boozman, R-Arkansas. ""This busts the caps and as a result I'll vote against it."" ""I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,"" said Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, in announcing his opposition. ""We need to find a better way to save $6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi who said he would vote against the bill. Graham, Wicker, and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, sent a letter to their Senate colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits. It was unclear if the emergence of the politically sensitive issue would increase opposition. One Senator said outside interest groups for service members and veterans were caught off guard to the provision in the agreement and were just now beginning to mobilize against it. Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Nebraska, said he finds the military pension issue ""bothersome' but remains undecided on how to vote. ""I wouldn't say leaning 'yes' or leaning 'no.' I'm very concerned about the package but I can also see the merits of a two year deal. So I want the weekend to think about it,"" he said. The retiring first-term lawmaker predicted the bill will pass the Senate regardless of the way he votes. Midterm primaries, and 2016 . The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has hinted strongly he will vote against it. He cites the weakening of budget sequester as a key complaint. The same is true for his top two lieutenants -- Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota -- both of whom have declared they will oppose the compromise. McConnell and Cornyn are up for re-election and both facing primary challenges from the right. That might explain some of their sensitivity to giving up on the budget cuts, which are very popular with conservative voters. Three leading tea party-backed senators -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco Rubio of Florida, -- each with 2016 presidential aspirations, also have come out against it for similar reasons. ""The new budget deal moves in the wrong direction: it spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it,"" Cruz said.","The House passed a compromise budget bill easily, sending it to the Senate .
Bill aims to avert another government shutdown as early as mid January .
It would also ease unpopular spending cuts to the military and other programs .

"Limassol, Cyprus (CNN) -- Cyprus is known for its sunshine, its ancient ruins and its delicious halloumi cheese, but one thing that is less well known is that it is also home to the oldest named wine in the world. Commandaria is a dessert wine with a flavor as rich as its history. It is originally believed to have been given its name by crusading knights in the 13th century, but to have first been made up to 5,000 years ago. It is produced in the fertile high-altitude slopes in the south-west of the island that became known as ""La Grande Commanderie"" during the Crusades. Around this time, the Knights of the Order of Saint John renamed the local wine after their new protectorate. Throughout the following centuries, stories of the wine abound. According to legend, King Richard the Lionheart of England was so taken with commandaria that at his wedding he pronounced it ""the wine of kings and the king of wines."" Equally struck by the intoxicating liquor was the French King Philippe Augustus who is said to have declared it to be ""the Apostle of wines"". Over time production continued to grow. By 1879 the British explorer Sir Samuel White Baker recorded that Cyprus was annually exporting 155,000 ""okes"" (a Turkish measurement that translates roughly to 230,000 liters) of commandaria to Austria alone. All the elements of Cyprus . In the coastal town of Limassol, on the sunny southern coast of Cyprus, the most popular brand of commandaria -- KEO St. John -- is produced to a recipe that is now protected by a legally enforced appellation, the only one held by Cyprus. Dimitris Antoniou, senior oenologist at KEO, believes the wine they produce is very special. ""In it you have all the elements of Cyprus: you have honey, herbs, vanilla, spices, and dried fruits such as plums ... it is very complicated,"" he says. One distinguishing feature of commandaria is that after the grapes are picked, they are left in the sun for ten days, which increases the density of their sugars. The grapes are then pressed, the wine is fortified (usually with a high percentage grape-based alcohol) and then it is aged for at least two years in oak barrels before being bottled. As the years roll by, the amber liquid intensifies in both viscosity and sweetness. Read more: The island of Aphrodite still has its struggles . Dimitris, together with George Metochis, senior winemaker at KEO, oversee the vast operation where annually over 130,000 liters of wine are produced, largely for market within Cyprus, but also exported to Russia, Scandinavia, France, the United States and Australia. The cavernous KEO vaults currently house 400,000 liters of commandaria with a range of vintages; the oldest batch dates back over a century. Ancient heritage, modern interpretation . Archaeological digs, conducted over the past decade, have unearthed evidence that the history of wine in Cyprus stretches back not just hundreds, but thousands of years. Some believe that Cyprus may have been the site of the earliest wine harvests in Europe, stretching back 5,000 years. Alongside the mainstream labels producing commandaria, a new generation of winemakers is looking to this more distant history to try to get in touch with the country's original viniculture. One such winemaker is Lefteris Mohianakis who has vineyards in the high hills near the village of Zoopigi. The two grapes he uses -- Mavro a red grape, and Xynisteri a white -- have long been used to produce the island's famous sweet wine. But when Lefteris talks of Cypriot wine, he speaks of ""Nama"", the more ancient name for what the crusading knights of the 13th century came to call commandaria. Read more: Cyprus bets on a natural gas-filled future . Lefteris Mohianakis is respectful of commandaria's great history, but says that his ""Anama Concept"" wine takes inspiration from the past while still very much looking towards towards the future. ""I'm working on the base of tradition, but I'm trying to involve oenology, which is a contemporary science,"" he says. Throughout his career, Mohianakis has worked in wineries around the world, and in his view, Cyprus is unique in its ability to grow sweet wine. ""I truly believe that terroir (the geology and climate of a place) is one of the most important things towards producing a high quality wine,"" he says. ""That is why nobody in the world can produce a Sauvignon Blanc like Marlborough in New Zealand, or a Cabernet Sauvignon like Bordeaux. That is the reason why I strongly believe that Cyprus is one of the rarest terroirs that can produce such high quality sweet wines. It is the sun and the soil. It is unique."" So does Mohianakis believe that his wine tastes the same as the nama that was being enjoyed in Cyprus 5,000 years ago? ""I think that historians can tell stories and can give you an idea about the past, but senses cannot be transmitted through history. So we cannot understand how an ancient nama smelled or tasted,"" Mohianakis says. ""My mentality is that we are walking on the base of tradition, on the base of the things transported from generation to generation -- the tales, the feelings -- but the best thing we can do is to give the vine the opportunity to choose for itself what kind of product it wants to create. Those vines have been there for 150 years ... I am just trying to give the vines the opportunity to express themselves through my wine.""

And according to The Hollywood Reporter, preferential choices Ryan Gosling and Garrett Hedlund also passed on the project. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson chosen for 'Fifty Shades of Grey' Fans have not rallied around the idea of Hunnam as Christian Grey and have offered another suggestion: Matt Bomer. (The ""White Collar"" actor has since said that while he appreciates the support, Hunnam's staying put.) Some readers of E.L.

In their eyes, Alexis Bledel would be far better for the role, but THR notes that it was Shailene Woodley studio Universal had eyes for. 'Fifty Shades' gets a release date .

"Brooklyn, New York (CNN) -- We all have things that we can't stand but must routinely put up with. Here are a few of mine: slow elevators, outrageous bank fees and being asked the question, ""Where are you from?"" Everybody hates the first two, but why am I so opposed to the last one? For starters, I know the impatient looks that will follow when I answer with where I live (Brooklyn) or where I grew up (Canada), or where I was born (Switzerland). That last one, by the way, really seems to throw people for a loop. (My parents were graduate students in Zürich when I landed on this earth.) What often follows next is that the person asking me the question either congratulates me on speaking English well or, confused by my answers, looks at me like I don't understand English. The next question, though, is always the same: . But where are you really from? Of course I know what they mean, and the people who ask me this (almost) never have any real malice in mind. They're not saying I couldn't possibly be American. Rather, something about me -- perhaps my name or the color of my skin -- has lit their curiosity. Still, I've always resented the question because it implies that I can only really and authentically be one thing, the one thing, incidentally, that I had no choice in choosing and have no power to change. I don't want to be misunderstood. Like millions of other Americans, I,  too, have a hyphenated identity. Left of the hyphen, I'm Egyptian, and a very proud one to boot.  But that's not all I am. I'm also a writer, a professor, a Muslim, a German speaker, a passionate (but terrible) singer, a lousy swimmer, a New Yorker, an Arab, the youngest of three children, a drinker of way too much coffee, a lover of W.B. Yeats' poetry, a hater of injustice, a husband, a frequent flyer, and, according to my wife, a person in some serious denial that he's getting older. The question ""Where are you from?"" may help others locate me, but it will never describe me. It used to be the case that after I told people about my origins, I would invariably hear a wish to visit the pyramids or be asked my thoughts regarding certain Anne Rice novels. Yet lately, the reaction has changed. Now, after telling people I'm Egyptian, I can almost see the news headlines and maps of the Middle East overlapping in their mind, and I'm usually confronted with a statement like this: ""Oh.  (Long pause.) Hey, I have nothing against Muslims."" That's precisely what a man I met in an Ohio restaurant recently told me. It was his pause that, well, gave me pause. Today, identity is too easily turned into a rallying cry for purity and violence. Think of the lunatics of al-Qaeda, like Adam Gadahn, who recently called on American Muslims to attack their own country. Al-Qaeda will never accept that Muslims (or Americans) can be more than what al-Qaeda determines them to be. Likewise, the anti-Muslim chorus led by people like Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who calls Islam a ""retarded culture,"" want to pigeonhole us into diametrically opposing identities that necessarily have to careen into conflict with each other. But this is nonsense. I know it because I live the many facets of my identity every day without succumbing to my own internal civil war. Millions of other Americans do, too. A few years ago, I heard a useful way of thinking about identity. I was in Ramallah, addressing a group of Palestinian university students, and with me was François Burgat, the eminent French scholar of the Arab World. Burgat began his talk about identity with a metaphor, asking the audience to imagine they were invited to a big international pot luck dinner. All the guests have brought their national foods to share. At that moment, our differences are the only things that matter, since from the differences in taste comes flavor. But if a fire were suddenly to consume that same house, trapping a baby in the flames, no sane person would hesitate to save that baby, regardless of its origin. In our choices for survival, our similarities simply must outweigh our differences. Burgat's metaphor strikes me as a particularly powerful way of thinking about the United States. Yes, there are people around today trying to start that fire, but I'm confident they are a few in an increasingly complex nation of over 300 million people, each of us with multiple identities. It's up to us to douse the flames of hatred and intolerance before they start, keeping the party that is the United States going.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- He is the face of New Japan Inc. 35-year-old Yoshikazu Tanaka, founder of mobile social gaming network Gree, is the world's second youngest self-made billionaire behind Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. The similarities don't end there. Tanaka, son of a Japanese salaryman, launched Gree initially as a social network in Japan before moving into mobile social gaming. I caught up with him at his HQ in the Mori Building in downtown Tokyo, one of the most desirable business addresses in the city. Japan's 'Zuckerberg' leads new wave of entrepreneurs . He may be flying high, but philosophically he remains down to earth, from the tips of his shaggy hair to the soles of his bright red crocs. What do you think when you're compared to Mark Zuckerberg? I started my business in 2004 and Facebook also started around 2004. Facebook became such a big company and I think they are doing well in how they are changing society. I think we (Gree) can change society in that way too, so I want to continue making a challenge. How would you like to change Japanese society? We should change the way of thinking in the whole of Japan. To do that, rather than by saying, ""we should do this,"" or ""we should do that,"" we should show what we can do by a new successful example. People say there is no culture of venture business in Japan, but actually social games and our company, Gree, became successful within seven years. So we want to have an impact on Japan by showing that it can be done. What drives you? Gree originally started as my personal business using my money and my spare time. So of course it is good if I can make money out of it. However, my motivation is that I want to have an impact on society with my business. Do you think your industry will become the most important part of Japan's economy? It is true that the social gaming industry is an important industry for the Japanese economy. Originally there were many Japanese game companies like Nintendo which became successful globally. Japan is an island and an industry like ours doesn't have to worry about importing raw materials or exporting. In that sense we can do our business without having the disadvantage of being on an island, so I think it is a good industry for Japan. What is the problem with older, traditional manufacturing businesses? If they have a problem, I think it would be that they tried to compete only in the domestic market and didn't try the global market. That means they can only be successful in Japan and they need to think more globally. What Japan should do now? Of course it is easy to blame politicians but Japan is democratic and its citizens choose the politicians. So the problem does not only exist in them. I think the biggest problem is that so many people have not been able to accept the fact that we cannot survive without trying to compete globally. Do you think mobile game industry can be a savior of Japan? I don't know whether we can be a savior or not but I can say there are not many industries which can generate this much profit and become successful globally. Not just our company but the whole of Japan should consider developing an industry like that.","Yoshikazu Tanaka is billionaire founder of mobile games company, Gree .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea is considering hunting whales in the waters off its shores for what it says are scientific purposes, drawing criticism from environmental groups and countries around the Pacific Rim. Citing calls from fishermen for a resumption of limited whaling, the head of the South Korean delegation to the International Whaling Commission, Kang Joon-suk, said Wednesday that Seoul was working on a proposal to hunt minke whales migrating off the Korean Peninsula. Korean fishermen complain the whales are disrupting their fishing activities and eating fish stocks, Kang said at the commission's annual meeting in Panama. Nonlethal measures are not enough to assess the whales' numbers and feeding habits, he said. But environmental organizations were skeptical about the South Korean explanation. ""We believe this move is a thinly veiled attempt by Korea to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research, similar to hunts conducted by Japan in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary,"" said Wendy Elliott, head of World Wildlife Fund's delegation to the whaling commission. 'Whale Wars' captain freed on bail from German jail . Japan hunts whales each year despite a worldwide moratorium in place since the 1980s, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Environmental activists like the organization Sea Shepherd track the Japanese hunters, facing off with them in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and the firing of smoke bombs. South Korea intends to pursue a similar approach to Japan by submitting a proposal to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission. Other countries in the region reacted to Seoul's plans with dismay. ""I am very disappointed by this announcement by South Korea,"" Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia said Thursday. ""We are completely opposed to whaling; there's no excuse for scientific whaling."" Gillard said she had instructed the Australian ambassador to South Korea to take the matter up ""at the highest levels of the Korean government."" Save the whales? There's an app for that . New Zealand intends to take similar action over the situation, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said, suggesting that South Korea's plans could undermine the standing of the International Whaling Commission. The announcement ""will put further pressure on an organization that already has significant difficulty sustaining itself as a credible international institution,"" he said. The United States also opposes Seoul's proposal, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a statement. ""We are extremely concerned about South Korea's push to kill whales in the name of research,"" said Russell Smith, deputy assistant secretary for international fisheries at the agency. ""Legitimate research can be done without killing whales."" The minke whales that would be the target of South Korea's proposed hunt are considered endangered by the whaling commission's Scientific Committee, WWF said in a statement. But Seoul is suggesting that the number of minke whales in the north Pacific has ""recovered considerably."" In his statement to the whaling commission, South Korea's Kang said that his country's ""whaling history dates back to prehistoric times, and whale meat is still part of a culinary tradition of some of Korea's local areas such as Ulsan."" Before the international moratorium came into effect in 1986, Koreans were catching about 1,000 minke whales each year in the waters around the peninsula, he said. But his claim that the whales were now making life difficult for fishermen failed to impress environmental groups. ""Blaming whales for declining fish populations is like blaming woodpeckers for deforestation,"" Greenpeace said in a statement. ""Whales do not cause declines in fishing stocks, over fishing and mismanagement by humans do."" Japan ends whaling season 70% below quota . CNN's K.J.

"Washington (CNN) -- On its face, the political showdown over extending long-term unemployment benefits to 1.3 million Americans is about offering a lifeline to those struggling to recover from a job market that hasn't caught up to the recovering economy. But just below the surface is a political fight that will continue into the midterm elections in November. Democrats say they're trying to help Americans struggling to pay their bills until they get back on their feet and that failing to pass an extension will tank the economic recovery. Republicans say they, too, want to help, but want to offset the $6.4 billion price tag with cuts elsewhere. They also argue such extensions are a disincentive to looking for work. Caught in between are those who lost their benefits because of Congress' failure to act late last year. Why have unemployment benefits become a battle? On Tuesday, a Democratic bill that would provide the three-month extension cleared its first hurdle in the Senate with the help of a handful of Republicans. In an effort to help end a budget stalemate and avoid another government shutdown like the one in October, leaders in both parties last month agreed to a deal that funded the government but excluded an extension of jobless benefits. As a result, Congress did not continue a 2008 recession-era law providing nearly a year of payments, footed by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. Democrats promised to take up the issue as soon as they returned after their holiday recess, but Republicans said they saw no reason to rush to preserve the benefits until it was time to make a deal. ""I have to admit I am a little surprised at the fervor with which the majority is dedicated to reviving the expired emergency unemployment benefits after they ignored the issue all of last year,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said during debate on the Senate floor on Tuesday. Democrats do seem to be playing it both ways â€” taking credit for engineering the economic recovery, but claiming that the economy is still too fragile to withstand changes to assistance programs. The White House also pointed out that Republicans who voted for a similar jobless benefits extension since 2008 now oppose it. Republicans have blamed President Barack Obama for the slow pace of the economic recovery on the one hand while claiming that the economy is now stable enough to withstand the impact of letting people go without benefits. Democrats feel like they are in a win-win position on jobless benefits â€” if they win this fight, they are the champions of those struggling to recover from the Great Recession; if they lose, they can blame the Republicans. The issue also can energize their base going into the midterms. Extending benefits is a priority for congressional Democrats and Obama, who is trying to make income equality a centerpiece of his second term. Republicans want to keep the focus on the disastrous rollout of the President's signature health care reform law and wield it in the midterm campaigns. The broader argument over the divide between the haves and have-nots will rage on through the midterms. However, conservatives aren't ceding the issue of income disparity to Democrats. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have both made addressing poverty part of their tentative explorations into possible 2016 presidential bids. The political war over poverty . In remarks after the Senate vote, Obama noted that members of Congress have not yet passed the jobless benefits bill itself. ""All they've agreed to, so far, is that we're actually going to be able to have a vote on it,"" he told supporters in a speech at the White House. ""We have got to get this across the finish line without obstruction or delay."" Still, he achieved a major step on the path toward his goal when 60 senators -- including six Republicans -- voted Tuesday to move ahead with debate on the measure. ""Today brought us a glimmer of hope,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, after the vote. ""It shows that the big plates -- the tectonic plates in our politics -- are moving."" But House Speaker John Boehner said he told Obama a month ago that another extension of temporary emergency unemployment benefits ""should not only be paid for but include something to help put people back to work. To date, the president has offered no such plan. If he does, I'll be happy to discuss it, but right now the House is going to remain focused on growing the economy and giving America's unemployed the independence that only comes from finding a good job."" The 60 yea votes were the minimum needed to allow debate to go forward and avoid a filibuster in the Senate. Democrats got help from Republicans Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire; Dan Coats of Indiana; Susan Collins of Maine; Dean Heller of Nevada; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; and Rob Portman of Ohio. Obama: Extend unemployment insurance . Obama was introduced before his remarks at the White House by Katherine Hackett, of Moodus, Connecticut, who wrote to the President last month, explaining that she is unemployed and had been forced to cut back on food and home heating. ""I have cut expenses everywhere possible,"" she said, adding that she wears a coat inside her house to keep down heating bills. Both her sons serve in the military, she said. ""I hope our leaders in Washington can find a solution to help families like mine,"" Hackett pleaded. Obama appealed to Congress and the rest of the nation to do just that. ""These are your neighbors, your friends, your family members,"" Obama said. ""When times get tough, we are not a people who say, 'You're on your own.' We are people who believe we're all in it together, and we know, there but for the grace of God go I."" Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois said he wants to help people, but insisted Congress must find a way to pay for the measure. ""I, obviously, have people in my state who would benefit. The better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way,"" Kirk said. ""I want us to get on the bill so we can talk about an offset to pay for it,"" Collins said. ""Ultimately, I think we should restructure the unemployment compensation program so it's more closely linked to job training for the long-term unemployed whose jobs probably are not coming back."" In the run up to the vote, conservative interests were applying heavy pressure. New year, same old fight over jobless benefits . The Club for Growth had urged all senators to vote ""no"" on the proposal and cited the lack of spending offsets. ""Congress should end the federal unemployment insurance program and return the authority back to the states, which already have programs in place,"" the group said. ""Absent this, Congress should pay for this extension by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget. After six years, an extension can no longer be called an 'emergency' with any credibility. There is plenty of waste in the federal budget from which to find an offset,"" it said. The U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7% in November, the most recent Labor Department statistics show. That means more than 10 million people were out of work, a third of them for at least 27 weeks. CNN's Ted Barrett and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","The benefits extension is year's first partisan showdown in Congress .

"(CNN) -- In sport, finishing fourth rarely provokes scenes of rapture, nor does it excite the keyboards of headline writers. But for Vegalta Sendai who finished in that position in last season's J-League -- Japan's top soccer competition - fourth place was truly a miracle. The Japanese soccer club has rarely tasted glory in its short history. Despite having a small but vociferous fan base, the team is better know as perennial nearly-men; forever stuck in Japan's second division as promotion to the big league eluded them season after season. Yet in March last year Vegalta Sendai was looking forward with optimism to a rare season in Japan's top flight. On March 11 those dreams turned to rubble. When a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and devastating tsunami hit Japan's Tohoku region, the city of Sendai was one of the hardest hit. Tens of thousands of people from the area were killed or remain unaccounted for. Every aspect of life was affected and the city's beloved soccer club -- majority owned by the city and the Miyagi prefecture - was no different. The team's stadium was declared to be ""in ruins"" by J-League chairman Kazumi Ohigashi, its training ground destroyed. Vegalta's foreign players, so traumatized by what they saw, canceled their contracts and returned home. The players that remained helped in the clean up operation and ran soccer camps for the orphans. The league was suspended. ""Immediately after the earthquake and tsunami we, as a team, wondered if we should, and could, continue to play soccer,"" said the team's coach, Makoto Teguramori. But it was controversially decided that the J-League would continue. The club was homeless and its fans traumatized but Teguramori believed that Vegalta Sendai could ""be the symbol of hope for the entire Tohoku region and to lead and encourage the reconstruction efforts with our strong performance."" Which is exactly what happened. Despite only ever being a minor footnote in Japan's soccer history, Vegalta Sendai went on an incredible 11 game unbeaten run and sat at the top of the league table. Before their first match of the restarted season against Kawasaki Frontale the fans displayed a banner that read: ""Thank you for all [our] friends. We do not lose until we regain a hometown."" By the time the team did eventually lose for the first time, Vegalta Sendai had been good to their word. Not only did they beat Kawasaki Frontale 2-1 in dramatic fashion that day, the stadium was quickly rebuilt and the team returned for the rest of the season. ""Everyone who follows the J league was shocked by Sendai's performance. I met so many people who were encouraged by Vegalta. At the same time, they, fans and players, know that to keep on keeping on is important,"" explained Koji Takao, a writer for Japan's leading Weekly Soccer magazine. ""The people in Sendai started a rush constructing job on the stadium. Although there was some serious damage after March 11 they could host a game against Urawa on April 29. So the speed of reconstruction of the stadium was very fast."" Not everyone could watch Vegalta's matches though. ""People in Tohoku still couldn't watch that game as there was no electricity,"" he added . After losing for the first time in June many in Japan assumed that Vegalta would then plummet like a stone. But after a brief drop in form the team went on another 11 game unbeaten run that only ended last November. ""To have one good run is difficult to do under the circumstances,"" said Takao. ""To have another good run and bounce back to the top table of the J-league made people in Sendai and Tohoku proud."" In the end, Vegalta Sendai's fairytale dream of winning their first ever J-League championship was a bridge too far. But their fourth placed finish represented their best ever season. The 2012 J-League season began last Saturday, the day before the anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami. Vegalta Sendai started as they ended last season with a 1-0 win against Kashima Antlers. But like the Japanese women's national team, who famously won the World Cup last June by beating the U.S. in the final, Vegalta Sendai's performances on the pitch resonated far outside soccer. ""What Vegalta and Nadeshiko Japan [Japan's women's national soccer team] show is how not to give up,"" said Takao. ""That's why Japanese people cheered for the team. But that cheer was probably not only for the team. It was also for ourselves and the people who suffered.""","Japanese football team Vegalta Sendai had best ever season last year .

"(CNN) -- The nominations for the Academy Awards were presented Thursday morning, and as always there were trends and surprises. Here are a few things we learned: . 1. Make way for older women. It's not for nothing that one of best jokes from Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the Golden Globes referred to the lack of meaty roles for actresses of a certain age: ""Meryl Streep (is) so brilliant in 'August: Osage County,' proving that there are still great parts in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60,"" said Fey. And yes, Streep was nominated for an Oscar (for best actress) as well. But also nominated were Judi Dench, 79, and perhaps more surprisingly, June Squibb, 84. Squibb is a longtime character actress -- you may remember her as Elderly Woman in ""Far From Heaven"" or Mrs. Cone in an episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" -- who got a chance to shine as Bruce Dern's exasperated yet caring wife in ""Nebraska."" In fact, of the 10 actresses nominated for either best actress or best supporting actress, six are over 40 and two others -- Amy Adams and Sally Hawkins -- are in their late 30s. Think you can pick the winners? Check out the Oscar ballot . 2. Diversity, but no diversity. This year featured a number of notable movies starring or directed by people of color, including ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" ""Fruitvale Station,"" ""42,"" ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" and ""12 Years a Slave."" But of that group, only ""12 Years"" got any support from the Oscars, with nine nominations. ""Mandela"" picked up a nod for a U2 song; ""Fruitvale"" -- despite showcasing rising talents Michael B. Jordan and director Ryan Coogler -- got nothing. And despite a $100 million box office -- and raves for performers Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey -- ""The Butler"" also came up with zero. During the Globes show, there was a Twitter hashtag protesting the lack of diversity: #notbuyingit. You'll probably see it again on Oscar night. 2014 awards season: Does diversity matter more than wins? 3. Where's Tom Hanks? What about Oprah? Tom Hanks is one of the most beloved film stars in Hollywood. He's a successful producer and two-time Oscar winner. After a sluggish few years, marked by ""Cloud Atlas,"" ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" and ""Larry Crowne,"" he was back in the good graces at the box office and with critics, thanks to ""Captain Phillips"" and ""Saving Mr. Banks."" The result? No Oscar nominations. Maybe he split the vote; maybe voters just weren't that impressed. (They certainly weren't by ""Mr. Banks."") As for Winfrey -- also a successful producer and personality -- the theory is that ""The Butler's"" summer release hurt its chances. But it was still a surprise that her name wasn't listed for either the Oscars or the Golden Globes. Better luck at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Oprah. 4. There are no sure things. The handicappers were wrong about a lot. Take a gander: . • Snubbed: Robert Redford, ""All Is Lost."" An almost wordless solo performance goes for naught at the Oscars. ""Lost,"" indeed. • Snubbed: The Coen brothers, ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" Despite their offbeat production, Ethan and Joel have become Oscar favorites -- even if it's just a scriptwriting nod. Not this year. Llewyn Davis will have to keep walking the streets (probably with a waterlogged shoe). • Snubbed: Emma Thompson, ""Saving Mr. Banks."" So much for ""Banks"" despite its Disney pedigree. • Snubbed: James Gandolfini, ""Enough Said."" The academy thought ""Enough"" was apparently too much, since neither Julia Louis-Dreyfus nor Nicole Holofcener's script were picked, either. • Surprise!: Sally Hawkins, ""Blue Jasmine."" The academy loves Woody Allen screenplays (he got nominated, too), and Hawkins wasn't overlooked. • Surprise!: ""Philomena."" A small, character-driven movie about a woman searching for her son? Best picture, best actress (Dench) and best adapted screenplay nominations are the prizes. Special coverage: All things awards season . 5. Love for ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Perhaps ""Hustle,"" ""12 Years"" and ""Gravity"" will duke it out for best picture. But remember ""no sure things,"" because when it came to audience response at the nominations, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" was the clear winner, greeted with cheers for every nomination. It has an Oscar-friendly subject -- a heroic battle against AIDS -- and strong performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. It received a surprising six nominations. The Academy Awards are March 2. Confessions of an Oscar freak .","Older women shine at Oscar nominations .
Films highlighting diversity were mostly overlooked .

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman gave a scathing review of the Sanford Police Department when he spoke at a public meeting in January 2011, describing what he'd seen in ride-alongs with officers as ""disgusting."" On September 18, 2011, he wrote an e-mail thanking the city's police chief and praising the department's ""professionalism."" The two exchanges, eight months apart, show a significant shift in Zimmerman's relationship with police months before officers responded to the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. What happened the night Trayvon Martin died . Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, is charged with second-degree murder in the death, which sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control. His relationship with police is something critics of the case have questioned, noting that Zimmerman worked closely with officers as part of his work with the neighborhood watch program he started. HLN: Zimmerman wife talks publicly for the first time . Zimmerman was once sharply critical of police in Sanford, according to an audio recording of a January 8, 2011, public meeting at Sanford's City Hall obtained by CNN. Police: Trayvon Martin's death 'ultimately avoidable' ""I also have had the opportunity to take ride-alongs with the city of Sanford Police Department and what I saw was disgusting,"" Zimmerman said at the time. ""The officer showed me his favorite hiding spots for taking naps. ... He took two lunch breaks and attended a going away party for one of his fellow officers."" Zimmerman asked members of the city council to repeal the pension of the city's former police chief. ""I would just like to state that the law is written in black and white. It should not and cannot be enforced in the gray for those that are in the thin blue line,"" he said. Zimmerman prosecutors release evidence list . Sanford Police Capt. Robert O'Connor told CNN that the department does not have specific details about when Zimmerman rode with police or whom he rode with ""if in fact he ever did ride with SPD."" On September 18, 2011, Zimmerman wrote an e-mail to the then-chief of Sanford's police, saying that he had ""a completely new perspective"" after working closely with the department's community volunteer coordinator. ""I have not had a positive perspective of Sanford Police Department,"" he wrote, according to a copy of the e-mail obtained by CNN after a records request. Donations pour in to Trayvon Martin's killer . But he said working with the department's community volunteer coordinator as part of neighborhood watch efforts ""to curtail the spike in robberies and home invasions in (the) neighborhood within the past two months"" had changed his view. He praised the volunteer coordinator's quick responses to e-mails and phone calls, saying she went ""above and beyond to help launch a neighborhood watch"" and calling her ""a testament to the highest level of professionalism of (the chief's) administration."" ""I have high hopes for, and restored faith in your administration and the Sanford Police Department in its entirety,"" he wrote. Court documents released last week showed a cordial relationship between Zimmerman and the police. New documents shed light on Trayvon Martin killing . Beginning in August 2011, Zimmerman exchanged e-mails with the Sanford police department at least three times, the court documents show. A rash of burglaries that began in July prompted the watch captain to ask the police department to host a neighborhood watch presentation for members of the community. Zimmerman's e-mails with Sanford police show a cordial, even friendly, relationship. In an e-mail dated September 19, Sanford police volunteer coordinator Wendy Dorival thanked Zimmerman for his ""kind words"" sent to the chief. He responded, ""It was with great pleasure that I sent that email, you deserve the recognition!"" Police records indicate that five burglaries were documented in the neighborhood where Zimmerman lived in less than three months, starting in mid-July. At the neighborhood watch meeting on September 22, according to court documents, Sanford police distributed contact cards and hosted a presentation on crime-prevention and security measures. Some of the flyers distributed read, ""Report suspicious persons...activities...or vehicles."" Another reads, ""Know your neighbor"" -- going on to issue advice on how to ""profile"" your neighborhood block. Less than six months later, on February 26, Zimmerman shot Martin. He told police he shot the teen in self-defense. More details emerge in Trayvon Martin investigation . Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in April.","Two exchanges show a shift in George Zimmerman's relationship with police .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese authorities are holding an American man on suspicion of killing a female Irish exchange student in Tokyo, a police spokesman said Friday. Police charged a second American man with groping the dead woman's friend. Nicola Furlong, 21, died in a hotel room in the presence of one of the men last month, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. The 19-year-old man, whom police declined to identify because he's considered a minor under Japanese law, was arrested on suspicion of murder, a spokesman for the Tokyo police said Friday. The man, a musician, had been previously detained on suspicion of improperly touching Furlong's friend, but was not charged with that offense. The police have 20 days to decide whether to charge him with murder. The other American man, James Blackston, 23, has been charged with groping the friend, said Tsutomu Nakamura, his lawyer. Blackston, a dancer from the Los Angeles area, faces up to 10 years in prison if he is convicted. His lawyer said he is not guilty and will fight the charges. He is alleged to have improperly touched the woman during a taxi ride with Furlong and the 19-year-old man to the hotel where the victim died. Authorities have not said how the four ended up together, but Japanese media have reported that the women were attending a Nicki Minaj concert in Tokyo when they met the men and decided to accompany them to their hotel rooms. The hotel staff went to the room after customers complained of loud noises coming from it, police said. When the staff entered the room, they found Furlong unconscious in the company of the 19-year-old and called the fire department, according to authorities. The death is believed to be a result of suffocation by cervical compression, the police said. Furlong's parish priest, the Rev. Jim Fitzpatrick, described her last month as an ""outgoing, bubbly sort of girl and very well liked."" He said she had been looking forward to coming home after being in Japan since October. Everyone in Furlong's close-knit rural community, which has only 300 or 400 families, was devastated by the news of her death, according to the priest. ""When the death of a young person happens, everybody knows and is in some way involved or concerned,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""When it happens in tragic circumstances and so far away from home, it has a double impact on people."" Her parents last spoke to her the day she died, he said.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan gathered Sunday amid tears, prayers and a moment of silence to mark one year since an earthquake and tsunami killed thousands, and triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis in a quarter century. Throngs nationwide observed a moment of silence at 2:46 p.m. local time (12:46 a.m. ET), the exact time the earth shook on March 11, 2011. At the main event at a Tokyo theater, hundreds bowed their heads in silence during the service. ""A lot of lives were lost ... I feel the grieving families' pain and I cannot express my sorrow enough,"" Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said at the ceremony. Emperor Akihito, who is recovering from recent surgery, also attended. ""I'd like to express my mourning for the people who passed away a year ago ... almost 20,000 died and others remain missing. Many of them were firefighters,"" the emperor said. Government officials and victims' relatives laid flowers at a shrine set up at the front of the theater. In tsunami-ravaged towns along the northeast, residents solemnly placed wreaths where homes once stood. Warning sirens wailed in some areas at the precise time the quake struck. Clad in black, residents of Ofunato gathered to pay tribute to hundreds of the town's residents killed during the earthquake and tsunami. Some wept quietly. The 9.0-magnitude quake shifted the earth's axis and unleashed a wall of water that swept away lives and homes. Million of people fled for higher ground. Nearly 16,000 people died and 3,000 others remain missing. iReport: Tokyo memorial . For those who survived that day, life is not the same. ""On the surface, it is business as usual,"" said Nicky Washida, a British expatriate who's lived in Japan for 10 years. ""We wake up, we go to work, we shop for dinner. We drink, we laugh, we care for our children. But running underneath the veneer of normality is the constant reminder that life has changed."" Washida said something as simple as buying food has changed in the wake of the nuclear crisis. She said she reads labels to ensure there are no chances of contamination. As residents scramble to return to normalcy, Noda recently addressed rebuilding efforts, which represent Japan's greatest challenge since the end of World War II. ""The Japanese people are united in working with the government to put all our might toward working on the reconstruction,"" Noda said this month. ""The debris cleanup, the building of temporary houses and daily support for the disaster victims -- we have been making steady progress on all those issues,"" he said. Following the quake and tsunami, Japan found itself dealing with the worst nuclear crisis since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility was knocked offline, resulting in a meltdown of three reactors, with radiation leaking into the air and contaminated water spilling into the sea. While no deaths were attributed to the nuclear disaster, more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its long-lived fallout settled. ""While always keeping in mind the tremendous responsibility we have to maintain stable conditions at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, we will continue to safely work toward the mid-to-long term decommissioning of the reactors,"" said Tokyo Electric Power Co., which owns the plant. ""In addition, all TEPCO group companies will further intensify their efforts to care for the presently afflicted and provide the compensation due them in a swift manner."" One year on, Japan is far from dug out of the destruction wrought by the triple disaster, but the prime minister said he is committed to rebuilding and in re-energizing the nation in the process. For some of the nation's youth, hope reigns amid the heartbreak and ruins. ""A lot of Japanese are very optimistic, so don't worry about (us) too much,"" said Kohei Maeda.

"(CNN) -- As a Russian proposal to strip Syria of its chemical weapons began to take shape, the White House eased off the gas on Tuesday in its drive for congressional approval to strike the Middle Eastern country. President Barack Obama asked congressional leaders to delay votes on authorizing military action in Syria while the diplomatic process works itself out, the president announced in a prime-time speech to Americans. Obama said he will continue talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and will send Secretary of State John Kerry to meet with his Russian counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday. The United States will also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about the suspected chemical attack that occurred August 21, the president said. ""Meanwhile, I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on (Syrian President Bashar al-)Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails,"" Obama said in his 16-minute address. Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate floor that he had canceled a briefing for all senators scheduled for Wednesday. He said the Senate schedule was driven by developments and not by an artificial timeline. ""It's important that we do this well, not quickly,"" he said. ""We'll see what's going on. You know, the last 24 hours has had some remarkable changes in what people are talking about. Let's see what else happens."" Keeping up with the latest key developments . Important meeting in Geneva . Kerry will bring a team of experts with him Thursday for the talks with Lavrov, according to senior State Department officials. Another U.S. official told CNN the Department of Defense will be sending experts in chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction. The discussions are expected to take place in several sessions over two days, but negotiations may not be concluded in Geneva, the officials cautioned. The officials said a final deal -- whenever it is reached -- would be taken to the United Nations and presented in a Security Council resolution. Russia calls off Security Council session . Moscow withdrew its request for an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting on the Syrian crisis that had been set for Tuesday, a U.N. diplomat said. Russia -- which has been a key player in efforts to have Syria give up its chemical weapons -- dropped its request due to ""changing circumstances,"" according to the diplomat. Syria is willing to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said before departing Moscow. ""We are ready to fully cooperate in realizing the initiative,"" he told reporters, according to a CNN translation. Earlier Tuesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry said it deemed as ""unacceptable"" a French proposal -- also backed by some U.S. lawmakers -- asking the Security Council to declare Syria responsible for the August 21 chemical attack that U.S. officials say killed more than 1,400 people. According to Syrian state TV, Syria on Tuesday accepted Russia's proposal to put its chemical weapons under international control a day after Kerry floated the idea in what appeared to be an off-the-cuff comment suggesting it would be the only way for Syria to avoid a punishing Western military strike. Moallem said the country was ready to disclose the location of its chemical weapons, halt production and show facilities to representatives of Russia, the United Nations and other states. Syria's chemical arsenal at a glance . Syria is a longtime Russian ally, and Russian officials have argued, as have Syrian officials, that rebel forces could have staged the attack. Growing support . Moallem said Tuesday that his country had agreed to the Russian proposal after what the Russian new agency Interfax quoted him as calling ""a very fruitful round of talks"" with his Russian counterpart, Lavrov, on Monday. Despite the lack of details, the idea was gaining traction around the world. On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed support for the concept. Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said it would safeguard stability in the region. Syrian ally Iran welcomed the proposal, and Germany expressed interest. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France will not accept delays in the transfer. ""We need quick results,"" Fabius said. European Union Foreign Affairs Secretary Catherine Ashton said she supported the French plan to bring the issue to the Security Council, saying the proposal ""now needs to be fully worked up as quickly as possible."" Even Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a proponent of a military strike on Syria and robust aid to the rebels, said the idea was worth exploring. ""I'm very, very skeptical,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""But the fact is, you can't pass up this opportunity -- if it is one."" CNN Poll: Syria strike . Inauspicious beginning . The Russian proposal surfaced publicly on Monday, when Kerry -- responding to a reporter asking what Syria could do to stop a U.S. attack -- suggested that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ""could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week."" ""He isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously,"" Kerry added. His spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, sought to roll back the comments, saying the secretary was simply responding to a ""hypothetical."" But it turns out Putin brought the idea up to Obama last week, a senior administration official said Monday night. Kerry and Lavrov have also been discussing ways for Moscow to get involved for more than a year, the official said. But U.S. officials didn't realize how serious Russia was until Lavrov seized on Kerry's comment on Monday, the official said. Obama's challenge: Convince you on Syria .

"(CNN) -- Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008 on fears that tensions with Iran have the potential to disrupt supplies through the Strait of Hormuz. The price of a barrel of brent crude hit $128.40 a barrel and eclipsed $110 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a disputed report Thursday on Iran's Press TV and other Middle East outlets of a pipeline explosion in Saudi Arabia. Prices for brent crude dropped to $125.45 and $108.50 on the NYMEX early Friday. ""I think the main problems are coming from some supply disruptions, or some fear to supply disruptions, particularly Iran,"" U.S. Federal Reserve Chief Ben Bernanke told a U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. ""So I'm not sure what could provide relief in the very short term."" The price of North Sea brent crude has risen more than 15% this year, while NYMEX crude has risen more than 8.5% on growing tensions surrounding Iran and fears that may lead to the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a critical pathway for petroleum exports. Opinion: America, quit whining about gas . ""Frankly, it has nothing to do with supply and demand there -- these are geopolitical situations,"" Angel Gurria, head of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, told CNN. ""So it has to be solved at that level."" While worries in the Middle East have caused a spike, oil prices face longer-term pressure due to increased demand from China and other emerging economies. At 9.4 million barrels a day, China consumes half the amount of oil of the U.S., according to 2010 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But while U.S. usage has remained flat, China's oil consumption rises about 5% per year. China is now the world's largest automobile market. Last year, 18 million vehicles were sold in China, compared with about 13 million in the United States. Obama on soaring gas prices: No silver bullet . ""It's not just more people driving, it's also every product that you buy is made of plastic or synthetic materials out of China is made with oil,"" said Patrick Chovanec of Tsinghua University. After the U.S. and China, Japan is a top consumer with 4.4 million barrels a day, followed by India (3.1 million) and Russia (3 million). If oil prices continue to rise, analysts worry it will hurt developing economies whose growth has helped buoy Western economies struggling with tepid growth and the threat of recession. ""Very high oil prices will dampen any kind of recovery and any kind of growth even during normal times,"" Gurria said. ""It's not desirable. It is something we would like not to have."" U.S. gas high? Not as high as UK . Rising oil prices, however, present a silver lining for Japan, which has been struggling with deflation for years, says Jesper Koll, managing director of research of JP Morgan in Tokyo. ""Oil is rising because global demand for goods and services is accelerating. And Japan is a big beneficiary of that because Japan is such a powerful exporter, so volumes are picking up much, much faster than costs are picking up for corporate Japan,"" Koll said. ""Bad news would be a supply shock - if you did have a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz or a war in the Middle East,"" Koll said. ""You'd have a big supply disruption, that would be cost push and Japan would get a double punch with declining global growth as well as an increase in costs really squeezing profits.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is investigating a report that workers at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were told to use lead covers in order to hide unsafe radiation levels, an official said. The alleged incident happened December 1, nine months after a major earthquake and tsunami ravaged northern Japan and damaged the plant. ""We'll firmly deal with the matter once the practice is confirmed to constitute a violation of any law,"" said the ministry official, who could not be named in line with policy. An official with the plant's operator, TEPCO, said the company received a report of the alleged incident Thursday from subcontractor Tokyo Energy & Systems. The report said a second subcontractor, Build-Up, created the lead covers and ordered workers to use them over their dosimeters, pocket-size devices used to detect high radiation levels. The TEPCO official could also not be named in line with policy. Tokyo Energy & Systems said in its report that the workers never used the covers, the TEPCO official said. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper, however, reported Saturday that while some workers refused the orders to use the lead covers, nine others did use them for several hours. The newspaper's report cited plant workers, who described the lead covers as fitting snugly over the dosimeters inside the breast pockets of the workers' protection suits. TEPCO told CNN it ordered Tokyo Energy & Systems Inc. to conduct an investigation and is awaiting a reply.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- March 11 marks the one-year anniversary of the largest Japanese catastrophe since World War II. The unforgettable triple disaster was triggered by the 9.0-magnitude Great East Japan earthquake, resulting in a devastating tsunami and subsequent nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, the effects of which are still being felt today. Three months after the earthquake, we set out for Tokyo with Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter and producer Pharrell Williams, who has a strong affinity for Japanese culture and has been strongly involved in Japan's music and fashion scenes for the last decade. We wanted to see how the young population of this iconic city was coping with the aftermath and ongoing elements of the crisis. What was most memorable in the capital was a darkened Shibuya Crosswalk, arguably the most famous crosswalk in the world, and a symbol of Tokyo the same way Times Square is to New York or Piccadilly Circus to London. To see it with all the lights and advertisements and video screens turned off was profoundly unsettling, and immediately recalled the eerie quiet of lower Manhattan in the weeks after September 11. The rolling blackouts and voluntary power outages to conserve energy added to an atmosphere of nervous desolation already fostered by the flight of foreigners to their home countries and native Japanese further south, as worried Tokyo residents tried to come to terms with the scope of the disaster and fear of the very air around them. At the same time, the city kept going. The spirit of post-3/11 Japan and the resilience and stoicism of its citizens has drawn comparisons to the reaction of New Yorkers and DC residents in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but it is also a testament to the more celebrated aspects of Japan's national character. The Japanese people live in one of the most volatile regions in the world. The country's islands are situated on the westernmost edge of the Ring of Fire and are regularly subjected to earthquakes, storms, and floods. The threat of calamity and exposure to the violence of nature is part of the daily fabric of Japanese life. Disaster is ingrained in the national psyche and has been an object of consistent cultural fixation -- it's in their art, movies, and literature, and has been for centuries. See the rest of Tokyo Rising at VICE.com . What was exciting to witness amid the organized efforts at recovery and general collective response, was how the events of March 11 have spurred Japanese youth to an interrogation of traditional society. For the first time in years, the national government and media are under widespread scrutiny, leading many citizens -- especially those in their 20s and 30s -- to turn inward and rely on each other for information via social media like Twitter, blogs, Mixi and Facebook. A noticeable shift has taken hold of Tokyo's creative class -- young Japanese seem suddenly possessed of a social and political consciousness at odds with their generation's portrayal as detached, passive and apathetic. There's a fire in the hearts of the young creatives we spoke with and new questions that are just starting to be asked out loud. Through art, creativity, entrepreneurship or protest, Tokyo's youth have begun asserting an active and individualistic will that runs counter to much of traditional Japanese thinking. Undeniably, Japan is at a crossroads. Many of the old systems that governed the accepted Japanese ""life path"" had already lost their clout long before March 11 -- assumptions like lifetime employment, job security, financial security started coming into question with the economic downturn of the previous decade. This is the story of the youth of Tokyo beginning to peer over the wall of the established structures to look for the other possibilities their society has to offer. And in the process, redefine their Japanese identity and what it means to be young and creative in Japan today.","VICE looks at how young people in Japan are coping one year after the tsunami .

"New York (CNN) -- Helen Gurley Brown, who created the idea of a modern woman with her book ""Sex and the Single Girl"" and was editor in chief of Cosmopolitan magazine for three decades, has died at age 90, the Hearst Corporation said Monday. Gurley Brown died Monday morning at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia after a brief hospitalization, the publisher said. ""Helen was one of the world's most recognized magazine editors and book authors, and a true pioneer for women in journalism -- and beyond,"" Hearst Chief Executive Frank Bennack said. It was Gurley Brown who invented today's notion of a modern woman -- one who could have both a successful career and an exciting, satisfying sex life, said Bonnie Fuller, the influential magazine editor who took over at Cosmopolitan when Gurley Brown stepped down in 1997. ""Young women today don't realize the legacy that they owe her,"" Fuller said in an interview with CNN. Gurley Brown's 1962 book ""Sex and the Single Girl"" encouraged young women to enjoy being single, find fulfillment in work and non-marital relationships with men, and take pleasure in sex, Hearst said. The book was on the bestseller lists for more than a year and became a movie starring Natalie Wood, Tony Curtis, Lauren Bacall, and Henry Fonda. When Betty Friedan's book ""The Feminine Mystique"" ushered in the modern women's movement in 1963, the two books and their authors helped lead the growing national dialogue about the place of women in society and popular culture, Hearst said. Dr. Ruth: Brown told women the truth about sex . Two years after publishing ""Sex and the Single Girl,"" Gurley Brown followed it up with the 1964 bestseller ""Sex and the Office."" Gurley Brown was born in Arkansas in 1922 to schoolteacher parents and moved with her mother and sister to Los Angeles after her father's death. After graduating high school as valedictorian, Gurley Brown put herself through Woodbury Business College (today Woodbury University) and earned a business degree. A string of secretarial jobs finally landed Gurley Brown at the advertising agency of Foote, Cone, and Belding, where her ""witty notes"" so impressed boss Don Belding that he encouraged her to become a copywriter, according to Hearst. Gurley Brown excelled in the job, winning awards and rising to become the highest-paid female copywriter on the West Coast by the late 1950s, Hearst said. Together with her husband, David, who died in 2010, Gurley Brown began pitching more books and new magazines targeted at single women. One of the magazines caught the eye of Hearst, but instead of a new title, they asked her to revive Cosmopolitan magazine, according to the company. It was 1965 when Gurley Brown became editor in chief of Cosmopolitan. She was 'tireless"" in the job, growing the magazine in the 1980s to 300 pages -- a third of which were lucrative advertisements, Hearst said. The magazine is now one of the top selling women's magazines in the world, published in 35 languages and in more than 100 countries, Hearst said. Fuller said Gurley Brown was a ""brilliant"" woman who articulated ideas that were considered risque at the time. ""Helen was a modern career woman in a time when there weren't very many,"" Fuller said. ""She saw that the next generation of women would be her. She 'created' Cosmopolitan to talk to that woman and to liberate her from the idea that she didn't have to become June Cleaver -- and that she could grow up to have a career that was just as fulfilling and exciting as any man's career."" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Gurley Brown a pioneer who reshaped not only the entire media industry, but the nation's culture as well. ""She was a role model for the millions of women whose private thoughts, wonders and dreams she addressed so brilliantly in print,"" Bloomberg said in a written statement. ""She was a quintessential New Yorker: never afraid to speak her mind and always full of advice. She pushed boundaries and often broke them, clearing the way for younger women to follow in her path."" Gurley Brown left Cosmopolitan in 1997 to become editor in chief of its 64 international editions. She wrote 11 books in all, including the 1982 bestseller ""Having It All: Love, Success, Sex, Money, Even If You're Starting With Nothing."" The cover featured a smiling, well-dressed Gurley Brown sitting on the edge of her writing desk. Her definitive memoir, ""I'm Wild Again: Snippets from My Life and a Few Brazen Thoughts,"" was published in 2000. In an interview with Vanity Fair magazine in 2007, Gurley Brown said the historical figure she most identified with was Cleopatra, because ""she was a good boss and had a good love life."" She admitted her ""fat tummy"" was the one thing she would change about herself if she could, and she regretted never sitting down with her mother to get her life story. She also said her husband was the greatest love of her life. Asked her motto, Gurley Brown told the magazine, ""Get up and do it if it needs to be done, even if you hate it!""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Three Australian activists are being held aboard a Japanese ship Monday after illegally boarding the vessel to protest Japan's annual whale hunt in Antarctic waters. The three men are not yet under arrest, but are being questioned by Japan's Coast Guard, a spokesman for Japan's Fisheries Agency said Monday, declining to be identified as is customary in Japan. The Australian attorney-general, Nicola Roxon, said that her government was working to secure the release of the men, but that she believed they could face criminal charges in Japan. Video footage released by the anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd shows the three men, from the environmental group Forest Rescue Australia, approaching the Japanese vessel on a small boat on Sunday. The video shows their boat pull up next to Japan's Shonan Maru #2, a patrol vessel supporting Japan's whaling mission in the Antarctic waters. A voice from the small boat calls out, ""Go, go, go!"" as the men slip onto the Japanese ship. In the background, voices in Japanese scream in alarm, saying ""They're boarding!"" Sea Shepherd described the three activists -- Geoffrey Owen Tuxworth, 47, Simon Peterffy, 44, and Glen Pendlebury, 27 -- as ""prisoners."" The organization said the men boarded the vessel to force Japan's fleet to stop hunting whales. Japan annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Each year, environmental groups like Sea Shepherd face off with Japan's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups. Two days before he boarded the Japanese vessel, Peterffy said in a video released by Sea Shepherd that stopping Japan's hunts was a personal responsibility. ""We've got a big responsibility for all those people in future generations,"" he said. Australia's Roxon said the countries were engaged in diplomatic discussions to ensure the well-being and safety of the three men, but called it a ""difficult situation."" Roxon said that while Australia steadfastly opposes Japan's whale hunt, the incident did not happen in Australian territorial waters. ""That doesn't give us rights for Australian law to automatically apply,"" she said. ""In fact, our advice is that Japanese law will apply because a Japanese boat is the one that's been boarded."" This is the third time activists have boarded ships involved in the Japanese whaling fleet. In 2008, two Sea Shepherd activists sneaked aboard a Japanese vessel. They were released back to the anti-whaling group. In 2010, Pete Bethune, a New Zealander, also boarded the Shonan Maru #2. Bethune was arrested, taken back to Japan, and tried in a Tokyo court. He spent five months in prison and was released on a two-year suspended sentence.","The three activists could face criminal charges in Japan, an Australian official says .

"(CNN) -- Japan on Tuesday described an attack on a car carrying the country's ambassador in Beijing as ""very regrettable."" Ambassador Uichiro Niwa was unhurt in Monday's incident but a man ripped off the Japanese flag flying on the vehicle. ""It was very regrettable -- the national flag shows the country's dignity and it's a principle of international law that you should respect it,"" Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, told reporters. Relations between the two countries have been tense in recent weeks, with anti-Japan protests erupting in several Chinese cities earlier this month over a disputed island chain known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. Anti-Japan protests erupt in China amid island dispute . Gemba said he planned to send Japan's vice foreign minister, Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, to deliver a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao on behalf of Japan's prime minister. He said that Tokyo demanded preventative measures and a criminal investigation. Xinhua, China's official news agency, said that authorities were ""seriously investigating"" the case. ""The Chinese government always conscientiously fulfills the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to protect the safety of foreign embassies and personnel,"" Xinhua said. Diplomatic vehicles in China carry special number plates but typically only ambassadors' cars display national flags. Gemba also said that Japan and China needed to exchange views on the current bilateral relationship and regional issues such as the Korean peninsula. Diplomatic tension ratcheted up after pro-Beijing activists landed on one of the disputed islands earlier this month. They were arrested by Japanese authorities and later deported. Japanese activists landed on the islands days later carrying Japanese flags, draping one over a lighthouse. The landings triggered protests across China.","Japan labels incident ""very regrettable""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A former member of a Japanese doomsday cult wanted for the murder of a notary official surrendered after nearly 17 years on the run, authorities said Sunday. Makoto Hirata turned himself in late Saturday in Tokyo, according to a metropolitan police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity -- as is the practice among Japanese police. Hirata is described as a former senior member of Aum Shinrikyo, or Cult of the Supreme Truth, the group behind the 1995 sarin gas attack on a Tokyo subway. The attack left more than a dozen people dead and thousands injured. The cult now claims to be a benign religious group. At the height of its activities in the 1990s, it preached the world was coming to an end and that it must arm itself to prepare for various calamities. A number of the cult's senior leaders were jailed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Hirata, 46, has been on the run since February 1995 when authorities say he and other members of the cult kidnapped a chief clerk in a Tokyo notary office.","Makoto Hirata has been on the run since 1995, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Police have questioned a man in connection with a shooting in New Orleans' French Quarter over the weekend. Justin Odom was interviewed Wednesday by homicide detectives with his attorney present, New Orleans Police spokeswoman Officer Hilal Williams said. The 20-year-old was arrested and booked on unrelated traffic and shoplifting charges by Gretna police. According to a Thursday news release from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, he ""completed his booking procedures and will be released due to jail overcrowding today."" Police said they are still investigating the shooting and declined to release more information. Gretna is a town of nearly 18,000 people located just across the Mississippi River from New Orleans. Police had requested the public's assistance in locating Odom and are still looking for another person in the case. A 21-year-old woman has died of her wounds from the early Sunday morning shooting, NOPD Officer Garry Flot said Wednesday. ""Our deepest thoughts and sympathies are with the family of Brittany Thomas,"" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. ""This type of tragedy strikes at the heart of who we are as a people and as a city."" The woman was among 10 people shot on Bourbon Street about 2:45 a.m. Sunday. Three people remain hospitalized, all in stable condition, NOPD public information officer Frank Robertson III said Wednesday. New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas has said the shooting may have happened because of a heated exchange between two young men. The 700 block of Bourbon Street, where the shooting occurred, is a popular gathering place for tourists and revelers, where many of them pack bars and clubs between St. Peter and St. Ann streets. Crowds often spill into the streets. Landrieu has called for additional resources from the federal government and the state of Louisiana to combat violence in the city. He asked President Barack Obama to send a ""targeted surge team"" of federal law enforcement officers to help stem crime. He asked Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to assign 100 state police officers to the city and rededicate a penny from the hotel/motel tax from the convention center to the city for public safety. ""These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered,"" Landrieu said. ""These perpetrators will be brought to justice.""

"(CNN) -- Almost six months after Japan's women gave the country a much-needed boost by winning the football World Cup, the team was again celebrating after scooping a hat-trick of prestigious awards. At a ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland late Monday, Homare Sawa was crowned FIFA Women's World Player of the Year after she captained Japan to the Women's World Cup title in Germany, while her manager Norio Sasaki was named coach of the year. ""I couldn't comprehend it when my name was called,"" Sawa told reporters Tuesday. ""I felt like I was in a dream, just like the World Cup. There are so many great players out there. It was an unimaginable moment, walking up to the podium, being among all those people."" Japan's Football Association also picked up the FIFA Fair Play Award in recognition of the hardships the country endured following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated large parts of Japan on March 11 last year. Team skipper Sawa, dressed in a traditional kimono, was joined on stage by JFA president Junji Ogura to receive the accolade. ""It's a great honor for JFA to receive such a prestigious award from FIFA,"" said Ogura. ""We will do our best to continue to prepare in our activities. We are very proud in this award."" Japan's surprise victory in Germany in July last year denied the much-fancied U.S. team a record third title. They even battled back twice after going a goal behind. But even as the team progressed through the competition against the odds, it became about more than just football or a trophy. Their exploits were inspiring a country that had suffered so much. ""After the disaster, the whole country was in the spirit of trying their best. What we saw was the soul of Japan,"" one fan, Yasushi Tsuha, told CNN after watching the match at a Tokyo bar. Despite the fact the game kicked off at almost 4 a.m. local time, men and women flocked to watch the game. By the end of the epic clash, there were few dry eyes in the bar as the victorious Japanese players lifted the World Cup trophy for the first time. They were overcome with emotion and pride in a team that few knew anything about before this competition. ""When I see women like me giving so much spirit, it gives me energy to keep going in my daily life,"" said another fan Ayako Nishi. The national team left Japan bound for the tournament with little fanfare. A month later, they were swamped by jubilant fans as they arrived back at Tokyo's Narita airport as national heroes. Their success looks likely to continue in 2012, after the Nadeshiko qualified comfortably for the Olympic Games in London later this summer.","Japan captain Homare Sawa is crowned FIFA Women's World Player of the Year .

"Washington (CNN) -- The biggest worry -- and potential opportunity -- for President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats this midterm election year came into full focus this past week, and it had nothing to do with the latest Obamacare numbers or newly released White House emails about Benghazi. Sure, those issues matter now and will undoubtedly factor into the final six months of Campaign 2014. But to borrow a line from Campaign 1992, ""It's the economy, stupid."" That slogan was the most important wall hanging in the Little Rock headquarters of the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, the strategic imperative strategists James Carville and Paul Begala imposed on a campaign that often, especially early on, seemed to be careening into questions of character and credibility. Fast forward 22 years, and a variation of ""It's the economy, stupid"" is what the White House and vulnerable Democrats on the 2014 ballot had hoped would be their best weapon against GOP attacks -- and against the history of midterm elections. And it is the economy -- and voter perception of the economy -- that is making it so difficult for Obama to improve his political standing. There are numbers to support the Democratic case that things are better -- especially when compared to the deep recession Obama inherited in January 2009. Just Friday, the Labor Department reported the April 2014 unemployment rate to be 6.3% -- down from 6.7% in March and the lowest jobless rate since September 2008. More context -- and ammunition for the White House case that the trajectory of the economy is now strong: April's unemployment rate is down from 7.5% a year ago, and from 9% in April 2009, a few months into the Obama presidency. Helping push the rate down: the economy added 288,000 jobs last month -- the best month-to-month gain in more than two years. During a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, Obama highlighted April's growth in jobs and gave the American people credit for their ""grit and determination"" for the economic rebound. Add in this: the Dow closed Thursday at 16,558, a tad off a record high hit Wednesday. That's more than double the April 30, 2009, close: 8,168. Now, in the political debate over the economy, the question is this: will Americans process the drop in the jobless rate and a strong monthly jobs number as proof the recovery has deep roots, or as just another month on the roller coaster? The question is very real, in part because as Democrats try to focus on the ""good"" data, there is consistent competition from less encouraging and, at times, quite discouraging numbers. Hiring is up in April, unemployment down . The government on Wednesday, for example, reported that the economy stalled significantly in the first quarter of 2014 -- with the GDP increasing just 0.1%. And even in Friday's unemployment report there is fodder for the pessimists: the workforce shrunk by 806,000 people -- meaning there were fewer people actively looking for work. Plus, the number of long-term unemployed -- those without jobs for 27 weeks or longer -- stands at 3.5 million people. The liberal Economic Policy Institute attributed the decline of the unemployment rate in April ""entirely due to people dropping out of the labor force."" Its estimate of what EPI calls ""missing workers"" -- people who are not working or actively seeking work -- is a record 6.2 million Americans. Count them, and the real unemployment rate would be 9.9%. House Speaker John Boehner called the exodus from the workforce ""troubling"" and said, ""we need more robust economic growth if we're going to help the millions who remain unemployed get back on their feet."" Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Republicans were in the way of creating more jobs and helping the long-term unemployed. ""The Republican approach shows nothing but contempt and disregard for working families,"" Pelosi said in a statement. Here is what to watch between now and Election Day: . * Will robust month to month job growth become the norm? * Will the jobless rate fall to or below 6%? * And, perhaps most importantly in the political context, will voter sentiment about the economy shift in any significant way? At the moment, that sentiment is negative -- and a major drag on the President's political standing. Two national surveys this week offered sobering numbers on the ""right track/wrong track"" question: . The NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found 63% of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track. An ABC/Washington Post poll put the ""wrong track"" number at 66 percent. Political battle over jobs report . In that ABC/Post survey, just 28% of Americans described economic conditions as getting better. So more than seven in 10 Americans think the economy is treading water or getting worse. In the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, 41% of Americans said the economy had improved some and Obama deserved some credit. Seventeen percent said it had improved but that the President didn't deserve much credit. Forty-two percent said it had not really improved. GOP pollster Bill McInturff says history is clear on the question: ""Here is a rule that no President has been able to beat yet in an off-year election: high wrong track and weak economic confidence are crippling to the electoral prospects of the party that controls the presidency."" That economic pessimism is the source of considerable frustration at the White House. There, the parallel to 1992 is striking. Then -- a presidential year not a midterm -- the growth numbers were far more robust than now. But the pain of the early 1990s recession had left deep scars and the Bush political operation was unable to make a persuasive case things were on the upswing and that he deserved the credit. This time, in the off year, Democratic strategist Margie Omero says it is imperative that her party not let all the political blame fall on the President. ""I don't see Republicans convincing people they have a plan for the economy that people like, or, frankly, that they have much of a plan for the economy at all,'' Omero said. She also made the case -- and the polling data backs this up -- that the Republican brand is severely tainted at the moment, and that in most cases Democrats have an edge when voters are asked which party they trust more on economic fairness questions. ""That said, I think the constant fighting and inaction in Washington hurts both parties' image, even if it generally hurts Republicans more,"" Omero said. ""And Democrats have certainly lost elections before while still having the advantage on the issues."" The Democrats' election-year strategy includes a focus on economic issues where the party believes it can draw sharp contrasts with Republicans, among them equal pay and an increase in the minimum wage. Working against the Democratic effort, however, or at least complicating it, is a voter crisis of confidence when it comes to political leadership. Recent Gallup polling is instructive on this question: . * Just 42% of Americans are confident about Obama's economic prescriptions. ""Not surprisingly, given his low ratings on the economy, it is a drag on the overall approval rating,"" the GOP's McInturff said. * Only 35% voice confidence about Democratic leaders in Congress on the economy. * And an anemic 24% say they are confident Republican congressional leaders would do the right thing about the economy.","The Labor Department reported April unemployment at 6.3% -- the lowest since September 2008 .
The numbers could support the Democratic case things are better than when Barack Obama took office .
The question is whether Americans will believe the recovery is sustainable or just a blip .
Struggles of the long-term unemployed, voter mistrust of political leadership might hurt Democrats ."
"New York (CNN) -- A piece believed to be from one of the airliners that hit the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001, has been found behind the site of an Islamic community center near ground zero, the New York Police Department said Friday. Investigators are looking into how a part of what appears to be landing gear became wedged between 51 Park Place -- the site of a controversial community center -- and another building, just a few blocks from ground zero. ""If you see how confined this space is, and you realize the chaos that existed on this street, I think it's understandable. It's not that surprising,"" NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said. ""It's very, very confined and no construction work went on, or no clean up went on in this 18-inch space between the two buildings"" after the attacks. Even so, he said investigators are looking at all possibilities, including whether the part was intentionally placed between the two buildings. ""We are also looking into a possibility it was lowered by a rope,"" Kelly said, adding that a piece of rope appeared to be intertwined with the part. But Kelly said an initial survey found no marks on the walls between the two buildings consistent with such an object being lowered. He also it appears that there is a break in the rope and that it came down from the roof on top of the plane part. National Transportation Safety Board investigators will determine whether the part is from either United Airlines Flight 175 or American Airlines Flight 11, which hit the twin towers, he said. Police have said the part includes ""a clearly visible Boeing identification number."" On Saturday, the NYPD said police investigators had been in touch with Boeing, which confirmed the part is from one of its 767 aircraft. Both flights that hit the World Trade Center towers were 767s. American Airlines and United Airlines declined to comment. Boeing spokesman John Dern confirmed the company was asked to ""examine the images to see what can be determined."" The part was discovered Wednesday by surveyors hired by a property owner. They called 911 to report that they'd found ""apparently damaged machinery,"" police said. ""The NYPD is securing the location as it would a crime scene, documenting it photographically,"" the police statement said. The plane part will not be moved until after the medical examiner's office completes a health and safety inspection. ""The office of the chief medical examiner will do an in-depth examination of the site to see if there are, in fact, human remains there,"" Kelly said. New York police officers were standing guard through the weekend outside the buildings. Investigators are expected to return Monday to determine how to remove the part. The plane part is about five feet long, four feet wide and 17 inches deep, Kelly said. The discovery of the plane part comes more than 11 years after the two airliners slammed into the towers of the World Trade Center. ""Well, obviously, this is a manifestation of a horrific terrorist attack a block and a half away from where we stand,"" Kelly said. ""So sure, it brings back terrible memories to anyone who was here and anyone who was involved in that event."" Sally Regenhard, whose son Christian -- a probationary firefighter -- died when the towers collapsed, said she was not surprised by the find. ""I'm disgusted, because after 9/11 the proper search was never done. The whole aftermath was uncoordinated. It was inadequate,"" she said. Regenhard has been one of the leading voices and, at times, critics for the families of the September 11 victims, pushing hard for a federal investigation and calling for a more comprehensive search for remains and debris. ""We advocated for a huge trajectory from that collapse,"" she said. ""Human remains were thrown at least for a mile, but probably two or three miles from the site."" In the years since, a number of pieces of debris as well as human remains have been discovered in Lower Manhattan. ""We are cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities to make sure this piece of evidence is removed with care as quickly and effectively as possible,"" said Sharif El-Gamal, president of Soho Properties, the owner of 51 Park Place. The building had been the site of furious protests, pitting those opposed to putting an Islamic center near ground zero and those who say it is a center meant to bring people together. Rob Frehse reported from New York; Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Police have detained two American men as part of an investigation into the strangling death of an Irish exchange student in Tokyo, Japanese authorities said Sunday. Nicola Furlong, 21, was found dead in a hotel room with one of the men, according to Tokyo police. The men were not charged in Furlong's death. Rather, police arrested the men on suspicion of improperly touching Furlong's friend in a taxi early Thursday, as the four headed back to the hotel, authorities said. Authorities would not say how the four ended up together, but Japanese media reported that the women were attending a Nicki Minaj concert in Tokyo when they met the men and decided to accompany them to their hotel rooms. Police said both men in custody were entertainers -- a 19-year-old musician and a 23-year-old dancer -- but did not say if they were part of Minaj's entourage. The hotel staff found Furlong unconscious after customers complained of loud noises coming from the room, police said. When the staff got to the room, they found her in the room with the 19-year-old and called the fire department, Tokyo authorities said. The death is believed to be as a result of suffocation by cervical compression, police said. Furlong's parish priest, the Rev. Jim Fitzpatrick, described her as an ""outgoing, bubbly sort of girl and very well liked,"" and said she was looking forward to coming home after having been in Japan since October. ""Everyone's a little devastated,"" in her close-knit rural community, which has only 300 or 400 families, he said. ""When the death of a young person happens, everybody knows and is in some way involved or concerned,"" he said. ""When it happens in tragic circumstances and so far away from home, it has a double impact on people."" Her parents last spoke to her the day she died, he said. She was ""very close"" to her siblings, particularly her sister Andrea, Fitzpatrick said. The U.S. State Department confirmed the arrests, but could not provide additional details, citing privacy concerns.

"(CNN) -- It's the small details in the before-and-after photographs from tsunami-hit Fukushima Prefecture in northeastern Japan that are the most telling. A year later, there's not one power pole, wall-mounted gas meter or roadside curb that hasn't been meticulously attended to. Almost as if a giant hand cleared the twisted debris, straightened the paving and fixed the bent and broken pipes, what remains in the worst-hit areas are well-manicured expanses of nothingness. Where industrious fishing towns once stood are empty streetscapes that resemble vast car parks. In some places, just the foundations -- also looking swept and groomed -- are the only things left to tell the story of the worst post-war catastrophe to hit Japan. Before and After: Devastation in Japan . The 12 months since a Richter 9.0 earthquake unleashed a tsunami that smashed into the towns and cities of Fukushima, Iwate and Miyagi prefectures has been the story of ""gaman"" -- the Japanese word for forbearance. The scale of the disaster still defies comprehension. In human terms, the earthquake and tsunami killed 15,848 dead and a further 3,305 people are still listed as missing, according to the latest Japanese police figures. Shelters are still struggling to accommodate the 341,411 evacuees from the immediate disaster and the subsequent nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The nuclear disaster at Fukushima -- now ranked on par with Chernobyl in terms of seriousness -- could take as long as 40 years to be completely under control. In terms of economic impact, the Japanese government now estimates that material damage alone could cost as much as $300 billion. The region's fishing industry -- one of the economic mainstays of the area -- was decimated by the tsunami. An estimated 90% of the 29,000 fishing boats in Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima prefectures were lost or damaged in the tsunami and 440 fishermen have been listed as killed or missing. The damage to the prefectures' fishing industry is estimated at $5 billion and the rebuild is expected to take between three and 10 years. Map: Impact of the earthquake . For the newly created Reconstruction Agency -- which the government has dubbed the ""command tower"" for recovery -- the scale of the clean-up is still daunting one year later. ""The most serious problem is how to handle the enormous amount of debris,"" Kazuko Kori, the parliamentary secretary for reconstruction, told the Yomiuri Shimbun. Miyagi Prefecture has 15.69 million tons of debris, equivalent to 19 years' worth of general waste, according to figures from Japan's Environment Ministry. According to Miyagi's governor, Yoshishio Murai, a daily workforce of 1,000 is needed simply to separate the types of debris. Demolition work on homes and facilities damaged in the tsunami is still underway with the agency saying that just 43% of the related debris had been moved to temporary storage sites by February 1 this year. A spokesman from the agency said other challenges -- including the reconstruction of residential areas on higher ground, creating employment for those who have lost their jobs as a result of the tsunami and psychological care for the victims -- persisted in the tsunami, or Tohoku, region as it is called in Japanese. Send in your stories from Japan . While it's hoped the agency will speed up the rebuilding process, many are asking why it has taken almost a year to create. Fukushima Governor Yuhei Sato told Japanese media recently that the new agency was ""a step forward."" However, he added, ""From the victims' perspective, I can't help but ask, 'Couldn't they have launched the agency more quickly?'"" Meanwhile, the official effort has been backed by hundreds of volunteer organizations that have done everything from clearing debris and shoveling mud to providing psychological counseling. Japanese policymakers are divided on whether it will be cost effective to reconstruct towns and infrastructure. Some say it may be time to abandon the towns and villages along a stretch of coast that has registered so many tsunamis over the centuries it has been dubbed ""tsunami alley."" ""One of the difficulties we face is their efforts to rebuild these towns to the way they used to be before the disaster... there is also the issue of land and property rights,"" said a spokesperson from the Reconstruction Agency. Hotel manager Satoshi Ito, who runs the the Horaikan Inn in tsunami-hit Kamaishi, said his business only re-opened on January 5 this year. While it took 10 months to rebuild the damaged lower floors of his hotel, he regards himself as one of the lucky one. Watch Satosi's footage of the tsunami . ""The rest of the town is only making slow progress,"" says Ito. ""When I look around, there is nothing. No houses, no buildings.""

"(CNN) -- Thailand's warring political factions hardly need red shirts and yellow shirts to identify themselves: a short few hours by road from Bangkok reveals a dramatic shift in culture. In central Bangkok, the young and moneyed throng the bars of Thong Lo where the men have the well-groomed detachment of the younger Abhisit -- the Eton and Oxford-educated leader of the opposition, whose 2008-2011 government launched a violent crackdown on the largely rural pro-Thaksin Shinawatra red-shirt protesters in 2010. Amid the jazz bars and cool beer gardens of Thong Lo, these young Thais represent not only an urban and educated middle class but also the money of some of Thailand's most established families. Just a few hours to the northeast and the prevailing culture gives way to pick-up trucks, cowboy hats and the whine of electric organ and guitar that comes from ""mor lam"" music: the Thai ""up country"" version of country and western. Even the King of Thailand, whose image beams from billboards dotted along the highway, is shown in his up country guise wearing the ubiquitous slouch hat favored by Thai farmers. Traditionally the poorest region of Thailand, Isan, in the northeast of the country, accounts for a third of Thailand's population. However, it is rapidly turning from its economic staple of subsistence farming to an economy driven by trade and services. Booming economy . If growth in Thailand -- South East Asia's second largest economy after Indonesia -- is slowing, in the northeast of the country it's booming. Economic growth in the region hit 40% from 2007 to 2011, compared with 23% for the rest of Thailand over that period and just 17% for greater Bangkok, according to government figures. Isan, which once exported people to Bangkok and the rest of the world as cheap migrant labor, is seeing its workers return. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- the sister of deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- has brought in a raft of policies that ensure Thaksin's populist policies, which included practically free healthcare and low-interest loans, continue to underpin the boom in the red shirt heartland. Chief among them is a 2.2 trillion baht (US$71 billion) infrastructure program aimed at the northeast and a nationwide minimum wage of 300 baht (US$10) a day. In some parts of Isan, this boosted household incomes by more than 35%. An expensive rice subsidy, which guarantees farmers 40% above market price for their crops, that has led to a conservative estimate of losses in the region of 136 billion baht ($4.3 billion), has been widely criticized in Thailand and even recently drew fire from the International Monetary Fund, which urged Thailand to drop the $21 billion scheme. Sleeping giant . As the boom fuels a growing middle class, Bangkok's elite now realizes that it ignores the northeast -- which holds a third of the electorate -- at its peril. Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates a Bangkok-based risk assessment firm, said that while Thaksin's populism has been demonized in Bangkok, it has awoken a sleeping giant in the northeast. ""There's this cultural overlay,"" Quaglia told CNN. ""Thailand's system has been fairly feudal with the social ascendancy of a small group of historic families in Bangkok lording it over the rest of the country. ""There's an attitude that says 'it's not so wrong to have smart and good people in Bangkok running the entire country'. They don't really want to see one man, one vote. ""It sort of echoes U.S. history when women and blacks fought to get their vote. The underlying supposition is that these people aren't smart enough to really cast an intelligent vote, they're prone to corruption, you can buy their vote for $5."" Social revolution . He said the advent of social media had also changed the political landscape in Thailand, giving both sides of the political divide a means of organizing quickly and challenging government. ""In Bangkok, we saw the so-called 'V for Thailand' movement where thousands of people changed their Facebook pages,"" Quaglia said, referring to anti-Shinawatra protests in June. ""But also in the northeast, there's a robust social media exchange among people."" According to Thitinan Pongsudhirak, Professor of Political Science at Chulalongkorn University, the political and socio-economic divide in Thailand is further complicated by the position of the Thai monarchy. ""In Thailand, we are seeing the rise of a citizenry that used to be merely loyal subjects,"" Pongsudhirak told CNN. ""This means that in Thailand almost all Thais are monarchists and democrats at the same time. Most Thais will not reject democracy and they want to protect the monarchy -- they embrace both."" However, he said that divisions have emerged in this widely held position. ""Some people will embrace electoral democracy first and foremost; these are the people that keep voting for the Thaksin party because they feel that it gives them a voice, it gives them rights, it allows their grievances to be expressed and everything else is subservient to that. ""On the other side you have the anti-government protesters. They don't reject the electoral democracy but they prefer the monarchy-based social and political hierarchy at the top. That's why they keep calling for good people to run a good government to eradicate corruption."" He said that the monarchy will be critical to the stable future of Thailand. ""The monarchy has become the fault line of Thailand's entrenched polarization and its future, including the succession, is where the battle lines will be drawn."" CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Thailand's protests reveal an increasing divide between the urban south and the rural north .

"(CNN) -- For nearly 15 years, Dolores Prida was the Latina answer to ""Dear Abby."" The Cuban-born writer penned columns -- as she once put it -- with ""Latin-style tongue-in-cheek advice for the lovelorn, the forlorn and the just torn."" Prida died in New York on Sunday, leaving behind a loyal following of readers. She was 69. Many knew her popular ""Dolores Dice"" column in Latina magazine. But Prida was also an opinion columnist who tackled tougher topics such as gun control and teen pregnancy in New York newspapers and a playwright who won international recognition for her work. The night before she died, she was at a party in New York with Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and others celebrating the 20th anniversary of a close-knit network of Latina journalists, lawyers and other professionals. Opinion: Latina 'Dear Abby' brought wit, wisdom, light . Prida had no training in writing advice when she took over Latina magazine's column in 1998. But her ""wit, humor, tender poet's heart and commitment to empowering young women"" made her a perfect fit for the job, said Sandra Guzman, then the magazine's editor in chief. ""She delved in with passion and gusto,"" Guzman said. And her wry humor quickly made the column a hit. The questions poured in -- hundreds every month, according to the magazine. Should I tell my ex-husband not to bring his new wife to our daughter's quinceanera? Should my undocumented immigrant husband and I hold off on buying a house? Why can't Latinos be a strong community rather than lashing out at people from different parts of Latin America? Readers regularly said ""Dolores Dice was the first feature they turned to,"" Damarys Ocana Perez, Latina's executive editor, said in a tribute to Prida posted on the magazine's website. ""She said what had to be said, and said it with humor most of the time,"" said Maite Junco, a longtime friend of Prida. ""She always had a light touch. She always believed that you're going to get people with humor more than anything."" Prida was known for her witty responses telling young Latinas to focus on themselves, not boyfriends or looks. Her answers to their questions -- written in English with a bit of Spanish sprinkled in -- made readers laugh, but also pushed them to think. To a woman wondering whether her skinny figure was making her boyfriend lose interest: ""Before you dive into those lardy tamales again, make sure his lack of attention is actually related to your slimmed-down curvas."" To a 17-year-old whose older boyfriend wanted her to stop wearing makeup, plucking her eyebrows and going out with friends: ""Your boyfriend may not want to be seen as robbing the cradle, but it sounds like he wants to rob you of your youth. Why would you want to stay home in a muumuu, sporting pale lips, blushless cheeks and hairy, Frida Kahlo eyebrows while your amigas are out having a ball looking fabulosas?"" To the reader who asked about whether she and her undocumented immigrant husband should buy a home: ""Stop fretting. Maybe you should wait a while to buy your casita. Instead, put your energy into prodding Congress to come up with humane legislation to solve the undocumented workers crisis."" Prida once said she enjoyed working with young Latinas at the magazine. ""Younger Latinas today are more self-assured. They have opportunities we didn't have 30 years ago,"" Prida said in an interview with New York's Repertorio Espanol theater company. ""With the boom of Latino popular culture we're experiencing, they feel it's 'cool' to be a Latina -- and they rejoice in it. As an older Latina, it makes me proud that in my lifetime I can see a magazine of such quality for and by Latinas."" Hiring Prida ""was one of the best decisions of my tenure at the magazine,"" Guzman said. ""Dolores touched, healed and inspired many hearts."" Exploring 'how we see ourselves' But she didn't save all her advice for lovelorn readers. Friends said she was also quick to recommend books and movies, to mentor younger writers and to offer constructive critiques. ""She would take the time to work with people,"" Junco said, ""to share what she had learned and what she knew with all types of writers."" Prida was a teenager when she immigrated to the United States from Cuba with her family in 1961. She began working in the theater in the 1970s and won widespread recognition for her work, including an honorary doctorate from Mount Holyoke College. She wrote more than a dozen plays and musicals, including the critically acclaimed ""Beautiful Senoritas."" They stood out, in the eyes of reviewers, for their sensitive portrayal of the immigrant experience and the humor of balancing two cultures and two languages. Throughout her career, she pushed for more cultural exchanges with Cuba -- a position that was so unpopular with some that there were bomb threats when one of her plays was set to be performed in Miami in 1986. Being a woman and being bicultural are threads that run through many of her plays, according to Repertorio Espanol's guide to her work. ""My intention as a writer is to explore, in many different ways, our being here,"" Prida told the theatrical company. ""Being from a different culture. Trying to fit in or not fit in. How other people see us, how we see ourselves."" 'An important voice' The night before her death, Prida excitedly talked about future projects with Sotomayor and other friends at the party. ""As always, she was filled with life and plans for the engaging work she was involved in,"" Sotomayor said in a statement after learning of Prida's death Sunday. ""Dolores was a visionary. As a writer she inspired us to think deeply about our culture."" In 2009, Prida printed T-shirts emblazoned with the words ""Wise Latina"" -- a phrase Sotomayor had used that drew sharp criticism from some lawmakers during her confirmation hearings. For Prida, the description was a point of pride. She gave the T-shirts to Latina leaders and wrote a column about Sotomayor's success. ""We thank her for the term 'Wise Latina.' It is going to stay around for a long while,"" Prida wrote in the New York Daily News. ""For the first time, Latinas who, for close to a century, have been stereotyped as temperamental hot tamales or inarticulate maids and cooks, have a label they want to hold onto."" New York's El Diario newspaper, which ran a regular opinion column by Prida, called her ""an important voice for the Hispanic community in the Big Apple."" ""She was ahead of her time in the sense that she's been making the case for Latinos in the U.S. for a long time. Now it's sort of in the news, but 20 years ago Dolores was already writing about Latinos,"" said Junco, who for years edited columns Prida wrote for the New York Daily News. ""She always made the case that we, the Latinos, were an important part of America today, and that was only going to grow."" Her death was unexpected, and the cause was unclear, Junco said. Prida left Saturday night's party because she didn't feel well, then called her sister, telling her she had chest pain. According to Junco, as paramedics took her to the hospital, Prida described the night's festivities. ""I was at a party,"" she told them. ""I was dancing of joy.""

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for a Roma couple accused of abducting the girl found living with them says the pair adopted the child from her biological mother. In a case that has generated huge interest in Greece, authorities have charged the couple with abducting the child they call ""Maria."" They appeared in court Monday and were remanded into custody pending a trial. Authorities released photos of the child, possibly 4 or 5 years old, last week and sought public tips on her birth identity. Kostas Katsavos, one of the couple's lawyers, told the Reuters news agency that they adopted Maria with the permission of her biological mother. He conceded that the adoption was ""non-legal."" But he said he believes the biological mother will be located soon and will verify the couple's claims. ""They love her, and they took care as their own child,"" Katsavos said. Haralambos Dimitriou, head of the local Roma community, said the couple took the girl in because her Bulgarian mother couldn't keep her. He said Maria was raised like a ""normal"" child. Video provided by the Roma and shown to the media in the Roma settlement near Larissa does appear to show Maria dancing with a woman who is believed to be the same person now charged with abducting her. The Roma offered the video to demonstrate that Maria was happy and in good care. 1,000 years of Roma discrimination . Police suspicions . Police say they are suspicious of the records the couple provided for the child and for other children in their care. In addition to the abduction charge, the couple are accused of falsifying official documents. Authorities asked questions about Maria because she has fair skin and blonde hair while her parents have darker complexions typical of Roma, also known as gypsies, a race descended from Indian nomads who face widespread discrimination in Europe. Thousands of calls poured into Greece after authorities released photos of the girl last week. Authorities released photos of the two adults Monday, hoping the publicity will reach someone who can provide more information about them. Child 'doing much better' A spokesman for the charity taking care of Maria said Sunday that she is in a group home where ""she is doing much better."" Smile of the Child spokesman Panagiotis Pardalis said the girl was found in ""bad living conditions, poor hygiene."" The child was found Thursday in the Roma community near Larissa in central Greece. Authorities said the blonde child looked nothing like the man and woman with her, and DNA testing confirmed that they were not her biological parents. A police statement said the couple ""changed repeatedly their story about how they got the child."" The government news agency said police found suspicious birth and baptism records as well as family registrations that claimed the woman was mother to 10 children and the man was the father of four more. Marietta Palavra, another attorney representing the couple, said DNA tests will show that five of the children belong to the man claiming to be their father but that there aren't conclusive results for the others. She would not elaborate. Europe's Roma discrimination shame . Prejudice against the Roma . Prejudice and discrimination against the Roma are widespread in Greece and elsewhere in Europe, Amnesty International says. Maria's case plays into old prejudices about them stealing children for forced labor. Pardalis mentioned such a possibility, saying, ""We don't have any other information if this girl was forced to work or to beg on streets."" And the government news agency raised ""the possibility of the existence of a ring bringing pregnant women to Greece from Bulgaria and then taking their children for sale."" The agency also cited past ""reports"" that empty coffins were found for infants who supposedly were stillborn to foreign mothers in Athens. Photo blog: The plight of the Roma .

"(CNN) -- Responding to a question at Tuesday's presidential debate that referred to reintroducing the Clinton-era assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, Republican candidate Mitt Romney said that it was already illegal to own those kinds of guns in the United States. The claim: ""Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal. We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons,"" Romney said. The counterclaim: President Barack Obama did not challenge Romney on the issue, having mainly steered clear of gun rights during the campaign. He said at the debate that he would favor new assault weapons legislation, but conceded, ""Frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s. They're using cheap hand guns."" The facts: Automatic weapons, whether semi-automatic or fully automatic, are legal in much of the country. Semi-automatic weapons account for about 15 percent of the more than 250 million privately owned firearms in the United States, according to the National Rifle Association (NRA). Fully automatic weapons are legal in most states, but require an extensive federal background check and a permit from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, the NRA said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Don't expect President Barack Obama or Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to talk about the issue of gun control in the wake of last week's deadly mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado -- there's little to gain from bringing up the issue. While gun rights issues are split along party lines, independents, who will determine the outcome of the election, are also divided over the issue. Both men and their surrogates have steered clear of discussing thorny Second Amendment issues since the shootings. Polls, such as one conducted by the Pew Research Center in April, have found that 55% of highly coveted independents feel it is ""more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns,"" with 40% saying controlling gun ownership is more important. The poll also found that 72% of Republicans feel protecting gun ownership is important, while 27% of Democrats feel that way. This tracks with similar polls conducted after other mass shootings such as last year's assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, in Tucson in which six people were killed. A Pew poll conducted after the shooting found that ""49% of Americans say it is more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns, while 46% say it is more important to control gun ownership."" And the issue likely won't play well in a battleground state such as Colorado, with its culture of strong and proud gun ownership but a recent history of deadly mass shootings such as Friday's theater massacre and a similar event in 1999 at Columbine High School, said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. ""It's political suicide to"" to advocate greater gun control in Colorado, Lizotte said. Colorado is also a state with a fast-growing segment of independent voters, according to a study by the Third Way, a Washington-based, moderate-leaning think tank. ""No politician in their right mind would say anything about gun control in Colorado because you simply won't get it,"" said Lizotte, who grew up in Grand Junction, Colorado. ""Growing up I didn't know anyone who didn't own a gun."" So despite New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, calling for Obama and Romney to debate gun issues, the two candidates are unlikely to move gun policy discussions from anything more than a back-burner debate. That's because in moving the conversation about guns front and center both politicians could get burned. Romney has had a mixed history on the issue of gun control, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact website, which grades the accuracy of political comments. ""During his campaigns for statewide Massachusetts office, Romney openly spoke of his support for -- to use his words from 2002 -- 'tough gun laws,' "" PolitiFact found. During the 2008 Republican primaries, Romney said, ""I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA."" However, the GOP presidential hopeful's ""pro-gun rhetoric has become sharper and virtually all nuance was erased. He even touted the bill he signed in Massachusetts by scrubbing any reference to the provisions banning assault weapons,"" the site found. The site noted that ""even in the 1994 campaign (Romney) didn't take a full-blown, pro-gun-control stand."" And though Romney's messaging sounds more pro-gun, he ""has never gone so far as to specifically renounce his prior positions, such as his signing of the 2004 Massachusetts law,"" an assault weapons ban mirrored after a similar federal ban. Romney earned a ""Half Flip"" from the site for messaging on guns that ""has been more on the rhetorical level than substantive."" Meanwhile, Democrats long gave up the messaging battle on guns. ""Democrats finally figured out that this was an issue that they were getting walloped on in many Western, Southern states and many swing states,"" said Jim Manley, who worked in the Senate for more than 20 years as a top aide to Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""So they began a subtle shift to try to coordinate and/or get more pro-gun Democrats to run."" He said, ""For many Democrats, it's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate."" Talk of gun rights was largely absent from Obama's speech in the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting in 2009 and after Giffords and others were shot in Arizona last year. Obama mentioned gun safety only in passing after the Tucson shootings to describe the polarizing nature of the issue. The president penned an opinion piece two months after the Tucson shootings that acknowledged the importance of the Second Amendment and called for a ""focus"" on ""effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" Political discourse on guns is unlikely to increase since polls indicate Americans don't want to make gun laws more strict and overall gun violence has actually decreased, said Kristin A. Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of ""Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America."" ""Historically the pro control side has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative that will help people come over to the case of stricter gun control laws,"" Goss said. ""For a long time these gun violence rates and massacres speak for themselves. They relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful but very well-disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart.""

"(CNN) -- Uganda's parliament adjourned Friday without acting on a bill that would have made engaging in homosexual acts a capital offense, leaving the future of the widely condemned bill uncertain. Though parliament's mandate ends May 18, next week has been reserved for the swearing in of new members. Friday's lack of action on the proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill means that the issue will not be discussed this session. The bill has been condemned internationally since October 2009, when it was introduced. In addition to proposing the death penalty for certain gay acts, it proposed requiring anyone aware of violations of the bill to report them to the authorities within a day or face criminal sanction, said Human Rights Watch. The bill would have criminalized ""promotion of homosexuality,"" the organization said in a written statement. That would have jeopardized the work of promoters of human rights, it said. The bill or an amended version of it could be presented in the next parliament, which is expected to open in June, Human Rights Watch said. But by then it would have to return to the beginning of the legislative process, the organization said. ""Today marks the end of a chapter in the fight to protect the rights of the LGBT community in Uganda but the struggle isn't over yet,"" said Graeme Reid, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Program at Human Rights Watch, ""There's a real danger we might see this bill remerge in some form."" Amnesty International released a statement expressing relief over the lack of action on the bill, which proposed life in prison for marriage by same-sex couples. ""We are relieved that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill was not passed into law today,"" said Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International's deputy director for Africa. ""This bill would have institutionalized the discrimination, including harassment and arbitrary arrests, that LGBT people in Uganda already face."" In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner on Thursday condemned the proposed bill as ""odious."" He added that both President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""publicly said it is inconsistent with universal human rights standards and obligations."" Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists.","The future of the widely condemned bill is uncertain .

"New York (CNN) -- Relatives of a bar owner killed more than 30 years ago over a spilled drink said Tuesday the life sentence given to a reputed mobster has finally brought them justice. Bartolomeo Vernace, 65, was sentenced in U.S. District Court to life without parole plus 10 years for his 2013 racketeering conspiracy conviction. Criminal acts from 1978 through 2011 included drug trafficking, illegal gambling and the 1981 double homicide of Richard Godkin and business partner John D'Agnese, according to prosecutors. They said Vernace held key roles with the Gambino organized crime family. ""Thirty-three years is a very long time to wait for justice. We have our closure, but we have been waiting for justice,"" Godkin's daughter, Christine Orsini, told the court shortly before the sentencing. Vernace, wearing glasses and a blue jumpsuit, declined to make a statement prior to his sentencing. Defense attorneys Charles Carnesi and Joseph DiBenedetto said there will be an appeal. Vernace has maintained his innocence, Carnesi said. Family's long journey for justice in case . Godkin and D'Agnese ran the Shamrock Bar in Queens when they were killed the night of April 11, 1981, after a dispute between an alleged Gambino family associate and others in the bar over a drink spilled on his girlfriend. According to the U.S. Attorney's office, the patron left the crowded bar and picked up Vernace and a third accomplice. They went to the bar and gunned the ""two innocent bar owners"" down, authorities said. Vernace, also known as ""Bobby Glasses,"" went into hiding in the weeks after the slaying, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office statement, but would emerge years later to take an active role in the Gambino family. Vernace was charged in 1998 in Queens County Supreme Court with the deaths of Godkin and D'Agnese, but was acquitted of state charges after trial in 2002, according to prosecutors. According to all accounts, no witness could identify Vernace. It wasn't until Vernace was arrested in January 2011 as part of a national sweep of 100 alleged members and associates of organized crime that he was brought up on the federal racketeering charges. During the federal trial in 2013, an eyewitness testified he recognized all three assailants in the bar but lied during the state trial out of fear, saying ""two men were dead over a spilled drink. I think that was reason enough to be afraid."" That eyewitness testified that he saw Vernace point a gun at Godkin's head and saw one of Vernace's accomplices threatening D'Agnese with a gun, according to a 2013 statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office. D'Agnese was shot in the head and Godkin was shot in the chest when he tried to intervene, according to court documents. Godkin's children and grandchildren filled the courtroom Tuesday and embraced prosecutors following the sentencing. ""It took too long, but we will take it,"" Godkin's widow, Catherine Godkin, said outside court. ""Justice has finally been served thanks to the lawyers, the jury, and all the witnesses who testified.""

"(CNN) -- It's that time again, time to pull out the ballots and read the tea leaves and see who's going to take home the trophies at Sunday's 86th Academy Awards. Will it be ""12 Years a Slave""? Leonardo DiCaprio? ""Let It Go"" from ""Frozen""? Oscar forecasting is a lighthearted parlor game for many and a ""who cares"" shrug for others. (Go ahead, commenters, let us know how you really feel!) But to studios, agents, managers and many of the nominees, winning the Oscar is not only first-line-of-the-obituary recognition, but it also means ""cold, hard cash,"" as Oscar winner Wendy Hiller once bluntly put it, in box-office receipts and future contracts. With that in mind -- and with the possibility of some of this article's readers taking home cold, hard cash for winning their Oscar pools -- here are a few key indicators to follow at the 2014 Oscars Sunday night. Of course, the Oscars being the Oscars, nothing is guaranteed. What are the best picture front-runners? There may be nine nominees for best picture, but only three have a good chance of winning, says Tom O'Neil of the awards handicapping site GoldDerby.com: ""12 Years a Slave,"" ""Gravity"" and ""American Hustle."" ""12 Years"" is the favorite among his 30 experts, with ""Gravity"" second at 10-3 odds and ""Hustle"" at 50-1. Everything else is 100-1. The site TheCredits.org agrees. Its social awards season app, DataViz, crunched the numbers based on mentions on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and film-related sites. It determined that ""12 Years"" has 42% of the online mentions (as of February 24) and ""Gravity"" is second with 33%. But, points out Clayton Davis of AwardsCircuit.com, in a year with divisive choices -- and ""12 Years,"" though widely hailed, is not necessarily widely loved -- the preferential voting system for best picture can favor everybody's second choice. That's ""Gravity,"" which also has the benefit of being the people's choice as the highest-grossing film among the nominees. Film editing is your friend . Of course, best picture is the last category of the night. What are some of the early signs that one of these films has an edge? The film editing category may seem minor to Oscar viewers, but it often has an outsized role in showcasing best picture winners. O'Neil observes that the best picture has won the editing Oscar more than half the time -- and if you rule out action-oriented flicks such as ""Bullitt,"" ""Star Wars"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" it's even more predictive. This year's editing nominees include all three best picture front-runners along with ""Captain Phillips,"" directed by the handheld-camera-favoring, quick-cutting Paul Greengrass, and ""Dallas Buyers Club."" ""Gravity"" is the favorite, says O'Neil, and that could foretell a spacey night. But even more notable will be if ""12 Years"" or ""Hustle"" grabs the trophy, since a win would be so unexpected. As for ""Phillips,"" that would simply acknowledge the expertise of Greengrass and editor Christopher Rouse -- who won for ""Ultimatum"" six years ago. Pressing the flesh . Though overt Oscar campaigning is frowned upon, there's nothing wrong with showing up at industry functions, saying the right things, posing for pictures and shaking a few hands. That could make a difference in the best actor category, whose favorites are Matthew McConaughey (""Dallas Buyers Club"") and Leonardo DiCaprio (""The Wolf of Wall Street""). Though both have some high-profile wins, they have yet to face off in the same category. (Both won Golden Globes, but McConaughey's was for a drama and DiCaprio's was for comedy.) And when it comes to politicking, DiCaprio has played the game well, says O'Neil, who points out that the ""Wolf"" star has been making the rounds with humor and class. ""When I look at the list of past winners of best actor, I see movie stars,"" he says. ""There's kind of a veteran glow to it. With Leo being overdue, it's to his advantage -- and he's given the biggest performance of his career in the most talked-about movie of the year."" But McConaughey may have a secret weapon. No, not his extreme weight loss. Try ""True Detective"" on HBO, which has become an addictive hit. ""(One academy member) told me he's voting for McConaughey because he's addicted to 'True Detective,' "" says O'Neil. Technically speaking . ""Gravity"" is up for several technical awards, including production design, sound editing, sound mixing and visual effects. It's considered the front-runner for most of them. If it falters, it could be a long night for director Alfonso Cuaron and his film. ""If you see 'Gravity' lose some techs, it's indicative that it's not going all the way,"" says Davis. A 'Slave' surprise . ""12 Years a Slave"" has fewer technical nominations but has a number of acting nods: best actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, best supporting actor Michael Fassbender and best supporting actress Lupita Nyong'o. Only Nyong'o is given a strong shot to win -- she's the top pick of GoldDerby's experts -- but if Fassbender and Ejiofor triumph, expect ""Slave"" to take it all. Fassbender has the toughest road, says O'Neil. The academy has softened up about giving Oscars for villainous roles, but there's usually a wink involved -- think Christoph Waltz in ""Inglourious Basterds"" or even Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Not so for Fassbender's character, a vicious slave owner. ""He's pure Satan,"" says O'Neil. Do the ""Hustle"" ""American Hustle"" did even better among the major categories -- it's the only film nominated in the Big Six of picture, director, actor, actress, supporting actor and supporting actress. But of all the film's nominees, only Jennifer Lawrence -- who's won a Globe and a SAG Award, and who's the most popular actress in the world right now -- is considered a threat in her category, best supporting actress. The key is probably Amy Adams, up for best actress. That category is considered a runaway for Cate Blanchett of ""Blue Jasmine,"" but if the Woody Allen controversy has rubbed off on her, five-time nominee Adams could take the Oscar and indicate bigger things for the film about the '70s Abscam scandal. Davis is doubtful, though. Even the Seahawks gave up a touchdown during the Super Bowl, he says. ""I'm sure she'll lose a couple votes, but not enough to matter,"" he says. Watch Weinstein . Producer Harvey Weinstein is the master of awards gamesmanship. He makes high-quality, often audience-friendly films with good casts -- ""Shakespeare in Love,"" ""The Artist,"" Quentin Tarantino's films -- and he knows how to promote them. This year he's putting his chips on his best picture nominee, ""Philomena."" The film has earned good reviews, done respectable box office and features the ageless Judi Dench. It has a good shot at adapted screenplay, which was co-written by star Steve Coogan, and Dench is a seven-time nominee who's won once before. Along with Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" it's probably the leading dark horse -- but whereas ""Wolf"" is divisive, ""Philomena"" is liked. O'Neil thinks screenplay is possible -- ""sometimes the most emotional movie wins"" -- but thinks that might be it. Still, at least ""Philomena"" picked up a best picture nomination. Weinstein's other major film, ""August: Osage County,"" didn't even get that. Splitting tickets . Finally, this is an odd handicapping year. Usually the best director has directed the best picture, but this year the handicappers are picking ""Gravity's"" Cuaron for best director and ""12 Years a Slave"" for best picture. When the two categories differ, it's a surprise, not an expectation. Davis can't shake the feeling that voters won't split their votes -- and that will make ""Gravity"" the big winner.

Cuaron not only won the top award from the Directors Guild, but ""Gravity"" also tied ""12 Years"" as the best film picked by the Producers Guild -- which, given the PGA's use of the preferential ballot, was an incredible shocker.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli Air Force shot down an unidentified flying object over the Dimona nuclear plant in the Negev Desert Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said. The object appeared in a designated no-fly zone, the air force was scrambled and the object was shot down, the IDF said. The object could have been a party balloon, the IDF said, but forces have not yet found the debris to determine what it was. There have been unconfirmed media reports that it was a motor-driven object. The air force reacted according to procedure when the object was spotted, the IDF said. The Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz reported that last October ""IDF warplanes intercepted an Israeli ultralight aircraft that accidentally flew into the area and forced it to land at an airstrip in southern Israel."" It also reported that ""an Israeli surface-to-air missile downed a crippled Israeli fighter-bomber that strayed into the restricted zone"" during the Six Day War in 1967.

"Washington (CNN) -- A private marketing firm has been temporarily blocked from using President Obama's familiar ""Rising Sun"" campaign logo, after the Obama campaign committee filed a trademark infringement lawsuit. Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing Washington-based DemStore.com from selling a variety of merchandise -- hats, buttons, balloons and T-shirts -- with the red-and-blue image, without the permission of Obama for America, the president's re-election campaign. In his three-page order, the judge said that for now, the company cannot use the trademark or ""confusingly similar"" images in its products, including ""engaging in any course of conduct with respect to the 2008 Rising Sun Trademark that is likely to mislead the public into believing that the products marketed and/or offered for sale by defendants are, sponsored, authorized, or otherwise approved by"" the Obama campaign. Re-election officials filed suit on June 1, and a preliminary hearing was held Monday. Further hearings are scheduled later this month. Obama officials said the issue was time-sensitive, since this kind of merchandise is typically sold in the six months leading up to the November elections. The campaign itself sells its own merchandise through the store.barackobama.com website, including the logo that shows the letter ""O"" decorated with a blue half-circle and red stripes. The Obama team said people buying products through its official website also provide contact information, which the campaign can then use to solicit further monetary donations. ""Defendants are using the Rising Sun Trademarks on merchandise in a deliberate and willful attempt to draw on the goodwill and commercial magnetism of the Rising Sun Trademarks and the Obama Campaigns,"" lawyers for Obama said in federal court briefs. On Tuesday, the DemStore.com website still featured products with the ""Rising Sun"" image, including a ""Veterans for Obama"" button listed as a ""top seller."" The parent company Washington Promotions & Printing has been retailing material supporting Democratic candidates since 1985. The company denies any wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that the Obama campaign had known of the alleged trademark infringement since 2007 and cannot now claim ""immediate harm"" from continued use of the logo by private companies. Washington Promotions & Printing suggested that a federal political campaign logo would be in the public domain, not subject to trademark restrictions. The case is Obama for America v.

"Tampa (CNN) -- Paul Ryan symbolizes for many Republicans of his generation a passing of the torch and a call to embrace the Reagan-era principles that appealed so strongly to young voters in the 1980s. The Wisconsin congressman evoked both when he took the stage on Wednesday night and delivered a prime-time acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that skewered what the GOP sees as President Barack Obama's failed economic policies. With Ryan, 42, holding down the No. 2 spot, the ticket hopes to strengthen his Generation X demographic ahead of November and broaden the campaign's appeal to a wealth of younger voters, a much more challenging prospect. During his speech, Ryan spoke directly to young voters' economic concerns. ""Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for, or any work at all,"" Ryan told the crowd. ""So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?"" The first Gen Xers were eligible to vote for Ronald Reagan's second term at the height of his popularity and his conservative dogma. Younger voters for Reagan, the oldest U.S. president ever inaugurated, were among his strongest supporters. It was not known then that Reagan's political aura and his mantra for smaller government and lower taxes would endure well into the next century. Nostalgia for Reagan is powerful. His views remain a litmus test for Republicans seeking national office. Paul Ryan and Gen X GOP . Generation X represents more fertile ground for Republicans in November than younger Millennials of Generation Y who overwhelmingly supported President Barack Obama four years ago. In Ryan, Gen X Republicans see similarities to Reagan and a changing of the guard. ""As a fellow Gen Xer, I'm excited about him and it says a lot,"" said Dylan Glenn, a former Bush administration economic policy analyst who has been friends with Ryan for nearly two decades. ""There's a pent up demand that it's time for us and Paul represents the tip of that spear so to speak,"" Glenn said. Ryan formally pitched his personal story and his aggressive budgetary reform agenda in his address that highlighted his connection to post baby boom constituents. ""I accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old -- and I know that we are ready,"" Ryan said in his address. Amy Holmes, anchor of GBTV's ""Real News"" at the Blaze, a conservative news site owned by Glenn Beck, said Ryan's Reagan-like sensibilities resonate with voters who came of age in the 1980s. ""Alex P. Keaton wasn't the anomaly. He was the norm,"" Holmes said, referring to the preppy, politically driven teen sitcom character played by Michael J. Fox. ""Reagan is not some bogeyman for many Gen Xers."" Ryan's fiscal outlook for streamlining budgets and overhauling the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly is typical of the thinking of Reagan-influenced conservative Gen Xers, said Soren Dayton, communications director for the Young Republican National Federation. ""This is a guy who grew up in the context of Reagan's optimism"" that included the belief that private enterprise is crucial to addressing national issues, Dayton said. Young Republicans argue that Ryan's controversial ""Path to Prosperity"" entitlement reform plan, which proposes a partially privatized Medicare program, takes a cue from Generation X and Generation Y concerns that those benefits will not be there for them. They also point to high unemployment for younger Americans as another factor that could push more younger voters into the arms of Romney and Ryan in November. Ryan tapped into that frustration during his speech. ""College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life,"" Ryan said to applause. ""Everyone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now. And I hope you understand this too, if you're feeling left out or passed by: You have not failed, your leaders have failed you,"" he said. Young Democrats say Ryan's deeply conservative views diverge from many of his generation and may not appeal to younger voters either. ""He's really somebody who has taken positions that are way, way to the right of where most millennial voters are,"" said Sam Spencer, president of the Young Democrats of North Carolina and a delegate to next week's Democratic National Convention. During the 2008 election, Obama won Millennial voters under the age of 30 by 66% to 32%, according to exit polls. A recent CNN/ORC International poll of registered voters found Obama with a 56% to 37% lead among that same demographic. The Generation X vote was closer last time with Obama outpacing McCain by just 6 points, according to exit polling cited by the Pew Research Center. Paul Ryan's Gen X sensibilities an asset . But on Wednesday night it was clear that Ryan and the Republican party hope to turn those numbers around. ""We're a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I. And, in some ways, we're a little different. There are the songs on his iPod, which I've heard on the campaign bus and on many hotel elevators,"" Ryan said. ""He actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies. I said, I hope it's not a deal-breaker Mitt, but my playlist starts with AC/DC, and ends with Zeppelin."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report .","Many younger Republicans see Paul Ryan as a symbol of their generation .
Ryan will have to make the case to young voters that GOP policies are an asset .
Young Democrats say Ryan is too far right to represent young voters .

"(CNN) -- Being nice to others and cooperating with them aren't uniquely human traits. Frans de Waal, director of Emory University's Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Lawrenceville, Georgia, studies how our close primate relatives also demonstrate behaviors suggestive of a sense of morality. De Waal recently published a book called ""The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates,"" which synthesizes evidence that there are biological roots in human fairness, and explores what that means for the role of religion in human societies. CNN's Kelly Murray recently spoke with De Waal about the book. More about de Waal's research . CNN's Kelly Murray: Tell us about the title of your book. Frans de Waal: Well, the reason I chose that title is, when I bring up the origins of morality, it revolves around God, or comes from religion, and I want to address the issue that I think morality is actually older than religion. So I'm getting into the religion question, and how important is religion for morality. I think it plays a role, but it's a secondary role. Instead of being the source of morality, religion came later, maybe to fortify morality. CNN: How would you say that ethics or morality is separate from religion? De Waal: Well, I think that morality is older. In the sense that I find it very hard to believe that 100,000 or 200,000 years ago, our ancestors did not believe in right and wrong, and did not punish bad behavior, did not care about fairness. Very long ago our ancestors had moral systems. Our current institutions are only a couple of thousand years old, which is really not old in the eyes of a biologist. So I think religion came after morality. Religion may have become a codification of morality, and it may fortify it, but it's not the origin of it. CNN: Why do people need religion? De Waal: Well, that's a good question. I'm struggling with that. I'm personally a nonbeliever, so I'm struggling with if we really need religion. ... I'm from the Netherlands, where 60% of the people are nonbelievers. So in northern Europe, there are actually experiments going on now with societies that are more secular, to see if we can maintain a moral society that way, and for the moment I would say that experiment is going pretty well. ... Personally I think it is possible to build a society that is moral on a nonreligious basis, but the jury is still out on that. CNN: So do you believe that people are generally good? De Waal: Yeah, my view is that you have two (kinds of) people in the world. You have people who think that we are inherently bad and evil and selfish, but with a lot of hard work we can be good, and you have other people like myself who believe that we are inherently good. There's a lot of evidence on the primates that I can use to support that idea that we are inherently good, but on occasion when we get too competitive or frustrated, we turn bad. CNN: So when the stakes are higher for survival, we're more individualistic than group-oriented? De Waal: Oh no, we very much survive by group life. Humans are not able to survive alone. For example, solitary confinement is one of the worst punishments we can give. We are not really made to live alone, we would not survive, and so when things get tough we would actually come together more and be more social when things get tough. CNN: Can you talk about how being nice to another individual helps you? De Waal: Sometimes people put that in a very narrow sense, and they say that everything that humans do or that animals do needs to have a payoff, but that's not true. The example ... of adoption of children, I basically think it's a costly act with no payoff, and these things happen in animals also. Animals sometimes help each other even between species. Dolphins may help human swimmers, and I don't think the dolphins get much out of it. So individual acts don't necessarily need to have a payoff. So they are not selfishly motivated. They are really altruistic, but you have the tendency to help, and to have empathy for others in general, on the average, is beneficial. Because you live in a group, you depend on these others, so you need to care about these others also because your survival depends on group life, and so there is some sort of general payoff, but people often think in terms of each individual act needs to (reap) some benefit but that's not necessarily true. CNN: Tell us more about the origins of empathy. De Waal: We think that the origin of empathy, in the mammals at least, has to do with maternal care. So a female, whether you're a mouse or an elephant, you need to pay attention to your offspring, you need to react to their emotions when they're cold, or in danger, or hungry, and that's where we think the sensitivity to others' emotions come from. That also explains why empathy is more developed in females than males, which is true in many animals, and it's true for humans, and it explains the role of oxytocin. Oxytocin is a maternal hormone. If you spray oxytocin into the nostrils of men and women, you get more empathic (empathetic) reactions from them, and so the general thinking about empathy is that it started in the mammals with maternal care, and then from there it spread to other relationships. So men can definitely have empathy, but they on average have a little bit less of it than women. CNN: By empathy, you mean that they feel each others' pain? De Waal: Well, feeling someone else's joy is also empathy. Being affected by the laugh, as humans are, is a form of empathy. So empathy basically says that you're sensitive to the emotions of others and react to the emotions of others. Sympathy is a bit more complicated. Sympathy is that you want to take action. You want to help somebody else who's in trouble. So sympathy is a bit more specific, it's a bit more action-oriented. Empathy is just a sensitivity. Empathy is not necessarily positive. If someone wants to sell you a bad car for a high price, he also needs to empathize with you in order to get you to buy it. So empathy can be used for good purposes; I think most of the time it is, but it is not always used for good purposes. CNN: In your book, you talk about a female primate who is crouching down giving birth while the rest of the group gathers around, and one of the other females is crouching and acting like the one giving birth. Would that be an example of empathy? De Waal: Yeah, that's an act of mimicry and synchronization, which is the first form of empathy. If you talk with a sad person, you're going to have a sad expression on your face. You're going to feel sad very soon. That is the body channel of empathy. You synchronize with the other, and that female in the birthing scenario was synchronizing with the other. It's a very early form of empathy; we call it ""modes of mimicry,"" when you do the same thing as somebody else. The body channel of empathy is very important to us and we rely on it every day. If you talk with people and you adopt their facial expressions, they will be laughing, you will be laughing, and so on. CNN: Different cultures of humans have different ideas about morality. Is it the same way in primates? Do different groups of primates have different cultures and ways of interacting with each other? De Waal: We do think that primates have different cultures. One group behaves quite differently from another one. I'm not sure that I would say they have different moralities, but they may have different styles of interacting. But (with) the human variation in morality, one society may have different moral rules than another one. In our current society in the U.S. we have debates about gay marriage, abortion - we have a lot of moral debates going on, and years from now we will believe different things from what we believe now, and so morality changes as a result of society, and that means you should not look for specifics of your morality in biology. Biology provides some of the general primate psychology that we have, like pro-social tendencies, sense of fairness, following rules. Our primate background provides that kind of thing, but the specific rules that our society adopts are not contained in biology, and sometimes people confuse that when I say that morality is contained in our biology, that every rule we follow has to come out of biology. I don't think it works that way. I think that we have general tendencies that come from our primate ancestors, and we turn that into our moral system that is suitable to our way of living. CNN: Is there anything we can learn from animals about how to live a good life? De Waal: I don't think I can give you specific lessons for your life out of my animal studies, but I do think the animal studies have some sort of general message that is important. Instead of looking at human morality as something we design in our heads â€” the philosophers want us to believe that by logic and reasoning we arrive at moral principles â€” I think it works very differently. We have a lot of feelings and tendencies that drive us to moral solutions, and yes, we often then later try to justify these solutions and come up with reasons for them, but that's often secondarily. In primate behavior we can see they have a sense of fairness. They have empathy: they enforce rules among themselves, they can delay gratification and they can control their impulses. So many of these tendencies that go into our moralities can be found in other animals, but instead of them coming from logic and reasoning, they actually come from our primate psychology most of the time.","Frans de Waal authored a book about biological roots in human fairness .

"(CNN) -- Law enforcement officers forcefully but safely ended a two-day hostage situation at a suburban Chicago house Wednesday morning, rescuing two children and two women while taking two suspects into custody in a raid on the home, authorities said. The move -- made after four other hostages were released the previous night -- finished a roughly 20-hour standoff that police say began with a robbery attempt at the home in Harvey, Illinois. The hostage-takers shot and injured at least one police officer when the standoff began Tuesday, but no shots were fired and no one was hurt when police moved into the home Wednesday, having determined negotiations were no longer progressing and that tensions were rising. ""We're very happy that there's been a peaceful resolution,"" Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told reporters. The four rescued hostages, including a 6-year-old child and a 12-year-old girl, were ""traumatized"" but unharmed, Dart said. Police knocked down a first-floor door and rushed up to the second floor, where they found the hostages and the suspects. Authorities decided to move after round-the-clock negotiations ""were getting a little bit more on the dicier side,"" Dart said. ""It was the (proper) time to act,"" Dart said. Started with robbery attempt . The incident began at about 12:45 p.m. Tuesday when two people tried to rob the home, Dart said. Inside the home when the suspects arrived were four children from one immediate family, plus two children who are related to them, and the two women, Dart said. Police were called, and one responding officer was shot in the arm but is OK, Dart said. Another officer was injured and also is OK, Dart said, without elaborating. Sometime afterward, law officers from all over Illinois surrounded the residence and began the negotiating process. Four hostages -- children ranging in age from 1 to 12 -- were released Tuesday night and were not injured, police said. Dart said the talks persisted for hours and proved to be a ""very thoughtful approach"" to hostage negotiations. Then, the back-and-forth stalemated and ""the time had come for certain action,"" Dart said. ""At this juncture it was the prudent thing to do, which was to enter the house and to secure the hostages to make sure they weren't being harmed,"" Dart said. Asked if police and the suspects were in a struggle, Dart answered: ""They didn't surrender themselves."" There's no indication that the suspects had any connection to the hostages before Tuesday, Dart said. Harvey Mayor Eric Kellogg had asked residents to stay inside their own homes as police, who blocked off nearby streets, dealt with the situation. A city of about 25,000 people, Harvey is about 20 miles south of Chicago. CNN's Bill Kirkos and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","4 remaining hostages rescued Wednesday morning, nearly a day after situation began .

"Arlington, Va. (CNN) -- For some athletes, running the Marine Corps Marathon is about the exhilaration of running 26.2 miles, pushing through one's physical limits and the thrill of taking those first steps past the finish line. It requires months of dedicated training and grueling discipline. But for other runners, like Salina Jimenez, it's about something larger than herself. Jimenez laced up her sneakers Sunday to pay tribute to her late husband, Army Sgt. David Jimenez Almazan, a combat medic from Van Nuys, California. Almazan was killed in 2006 by a roadside bomb in Iraq just three weeks after his deployment. He was 27. Jimenez, a Huntington Beach, California resident who has run two other marathons, says she runs to keep the memory of her husband alive. ""Every mile is a memory,"" Jimenez said. ""He once said that life is about the memories, so every mile creates a new memory that we're able to share and experience with other runners."" Almazan, a native of Mexico, was granted American citizenship posthumously. As she prepared for the race, Jimenez wanted people to remember her husband for the man that he was. In addition to loving soccer and salsa dancing, Almazan also loved the country he died for, she said. Jimenez ran as a member of a team fielded by Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), a group that supports surviving family members of loved ones lost in combat. This year, 265 runners ran for TAPS' ""Run and Remember Team."" Like many of her teammates, Jimenez ran with a photo of her husband pinned to the lapel of her jersey, one that she carries for every race. ""I keep it close to my heart,"" she says, ""David was an amazing man. He was a medic, so he cared about people. He would take the shirt off his back for you even if you were a stranger and that's what motivates me to get out there and pound pavement."" Minutes before Jimenez approached the starting line, she shared her angst about the course, which ends with a final hill up to the finish line near the Iwo Jima Memorial. It's considered the final challenge of the runner's journey. Some 8,597 current and former military personnel participated in the 35th Marine Corps marathon, which took athletes through Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. Nearly 22,000 total runners finished the event. Security was heightened for Sunday's race due to recent shots fired by an unknown gunman or gunmen at various Marine Corps military sites. In the final leg of the race, Jimenez said she thought about the day she found out her husband was killed. At mile 25, with little strength left, she said she got a rush of energy before making her final quest up the hill. ""It was like he was right there. I could hear him saying, 'Are you done yet? Hurry up!'"" Like most runners, she admitted to she doubts as she approached the last few miles: ""I said, 'I don't know if I can do this, David. I love you.'"" But the hill signified much more. ""It's the journey, it's the climb, it's equivalent to the journey we're on, the grief journey."" Jimenez says she'll definitely be back for next year's marathon, which offers no prize money and is dubbed the ""People's Marathon."" ""Even though that day took away something special, he lives in all these miles,"" she said afterward. ""It was phenomenal.""","Widow runs marathons to remember fallen medic .

"(CNN) -- The political pyrotechnics of a face-to-face encounter between U.S. President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin could eclipse a spectacular fireworks show set to illuminate the Normandy coastline to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. French President Francois Hollande has gone to great lengths to prevent such an uncomfortable meeting. On Thursday evening, Hollande dined with Obama before hosting a separate dinner with Putin. Talk about awkward dinner parties. Obama and Putin are among the leaders invited to take part in French ceremonies Friday marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which helped change the course of World War II. The two are likely to cross paths in France, Obama said, but no formal talks have been announced. If they should speak, Obama has said, he will give Putin the same message on Ukraine that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements. On Thursday, after a meeting of G7 leaders in Brussels, Belgium, from which Russia was excluded, Obama offered stern words about Russia's actions in Ukraine. Putin ""has a chance to get back into a lane of international law,"" Obama said. Obama said Putin could start by recognizing Ukraine's new President-elect Petro Poroshenko, stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. Putin, in an interview with French television station TF1, did not discount the possibility of meeting with Obama. ""As for my relations with Barack Obama, I have no reason whatsoever to believe he is not willing to talk to the President of Russia,"" he said. ""But ultimately, it is his choice. I am always ready for dialogue, and I think that dialogue is the best way to bridge any gaps."" The D-Day events also could bring Putin and Ukraine's Poroshenko face to face. Asked if he would speak with Ukraine's new leader, Putin said he will not ""evade"" Poroshenko or anyone else. ""There will be other guests, and I'm not going to avoid any of them. I will talk with all of them,"" he said, according to the Kremlin's translation. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Obama and Putin could come face to face in France at D-Day commemoration .

"(CNN) -- Early in 2002, shortly after the U.S. overthrow of the Taliban regime, Taliban leader Khairullah Khairkhwa phoned Afghan President Hamid Karzai asking for a job. As a member of the same tribe, he had known the Karzai family for years, and was hoping to use this link to switch allegiances to the new U.S.-backed Afghan government, a move typical of the twists and turns of the country's 30 years of war. Karzai promised to help, and referred Khairkhwa to his brother Ahmed Wali Karzai, a close CIA ally based in Kandahar province. Ahmed Wali Karzai agreed to send a representative to meet Khairkhwa in Pakistan. But before this could transpire, a rival Taliban figure alerted the Pakistani border police to Khairkhwa's presence. He was arrested, handed over to the Americans, and sent to Guantanamo. Khairkhwa is one of the five Taliban leaders who were released from Guantanamo over the weekend in a deal for Sgt. Bowe Berghdahl, the lone American POW in Iraq and Afghanistan. I learned of Khairkhwa's story, which is corroborated in his Guantanamo detainee files, from interviews with the late Ahmed Wali Karzai and other Afghan government officials. In fact, all five of the swapped prisoners were initially captured while trying to cut deals, and like Khairkhwa, three had been attempting to join, or had already joined, the Afghan government at the time of their arrest. This history shows that the categories we take as rigid and unchanging, such as ""terrorist,"" are in fact remarkably fluid in the context of Afghan politics. Uncovering the stories of these men tells us much about Guantanamo, the Taliban, and the possibility of a negotiated end to the conflict. Obama: I don't apologize for Bergdahl swap . Mohammad Nabi Omari, the most junior ranking of the five, was a small-time commander linked to pro-Taliban strongman Jalaluddin Haqqani in the 1990s. After 2001, he was among the many Haqqani followers who switched allegiances to the Karzai government. Malem Jan, another ex-Haqqani commander who switched sides, remembers him vividly. ""Omari was angry with the Taliban for throwing the country away (for Osama bin Laden),"" he said in a 2010 interview. ""He would sit there and tell me, 'if I see a Talib, I won't even let him take a piss, I'm going to turn him in.'"" Malem Jan, Omari, and other former Haqqani commanders began working for the CIA. In his Guantanamo file, Omari describes dealing with an American named ""Mark."" ""We worked for the Americans,"" Malem Jan recalls. ""We met them regularly to get instructions and give intelligence."" In those days, the United States was handing out money freely for such intelligence, which inadvertently provided incentive for bogus accusations. Some Afghan officials in Khost allege that Omari reaped profits from falsely accusing others of al Qaeda membership. If so, he certainly accrued enemies, and in September 2002, he, too, was accused of insurgent membership by rival warlords and politicians, despite being publicly aligned with the Karzai government. ""He was on our side,"" said Malem Jan, who now lives in Kabul. ""And then all of a sudden, he was in Guantanamo."" In October 2001, Abdul Haq Wasiq, another of the five, traveled to Ghazni province for a clandestine meeting with the CIA and Afghan warlords in an attempt to strike a deal. Wasiq worked with the Taliban's spy agency, and he was negotiating on behalf of his boss, according to the memoir of Harry Crumpton, then deputy chief of operations at the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. The CIA, however, was not interested in reconciliation, only in intelligence leading to bin Laden or other top al Qaeda figures. Wasiq could not deliver this because he, like most Taliban members, did not actually have access to the Arabs. So the American team bound and gagged Wasiq and his companion, eventually shipping them to Guantanamo. The six soldiers at center of Bergdahl debate . Of the five, only Mullah Mohammad Fazl and Mullah Norullah Noori were significant military commanders. In November 2001, as their movement was collapsing around them, they surrendered, along with their foot soldiers, to the U.S.-backed warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum. (Fazl is a notorious human rights violator, as is Dostum). Years earlier, Fazl had helped Dostum escape a precarious battlefield situation, and he engineered the deal in the hopes of having the favor returned. But Dostum sold them to the Americans and massacred hundredsâ€”some sources say thousandsâ€”of their foot soldiers and conscripts by suffocating them in shipping containers. Instead of being recalcitrant terrorists bent on fighting America, this history indicates that all five can make pragmatic deals if the conditions are right. Does this mean they won't pose a threat upon their release? How big a terror risk are former Guantanamo prisoners? It's difficult to say; two Taliban commanders who surrendered to Dostum alongside Fazl and Noori were also sent to Guantanamo. Upon their release in 2007, they quickly joined the insurgency and rose to its top ranks. Ghulam Rohani, who was arrested with Wasiq, has rejoined the fight since his release that same year. On the other hand, other Taliban leaders have successfully returned to civilian life after their Guantanamo release, including Taliban Ambassador Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, Commerce Minister Mullah Abdul Razak, and Gov. Naim Kuchi. What is clear, though, is that with the ongoing turnover of the Taliban's mid- and senior-level leadership in recent years, the arrival of a few individuals to Qatar is unlikely to make a significant impact on the battlefield in Afghanistan. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? So, the cost of the prisoner swap may be low, but the potential payoff is high. In a country that has seen few openings for peace in the last decade, this could mark the first tangible step toward a negotiated settlement. There is little trust, understandably, between the Taliban and the United States, and in this vein the mutual release of prisoners could be a confidence building measure. To be sure, a grand deal may never comeâ€”there are many divergent interests within the Taliban, their patrons in Pakistan, and Afghan society at large. But when endless war is the only alternative, even the most difficult paths are worth pursuing. Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl . Who is Bowe Bergdahl?

"(CNN) -- Bahrain has ordered the expulsion of a U.S. diplomat for meddling in the country's internal matters, the kingdom's foreign affairs ministry said. Tom Malinowski, U.S. assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, is ""unwelcome and should immediately leave the country"" due to his ""interference in its internal affairs,"" the ministry said. ""These activities have included holding meetings with one party, leaving out others who represent different parts of society, which is indicative of an approach which discriminates amongst the people of this one nation,"" the ministry said. The U.S. State Department said it is deeply concerned with Bahrain's demand, saying Malinowski's visit was coordinated far in advance and warmly welcomed by Bahrain, ""which is well-aware that U.S. government officials routinely meet with all officially-recognized political societies."" ""Contrary to our longstanding bilateral relationship and in violation of international diplomatic protocol, the government insisted ... to have a Foreign Ministry representative present at all of Assistant Secretary Malinowski's private meetings with individuals and groups representing a broad spectrum of Bahraini society, including those held at the U.S. embassy,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. For its part, Bahrain said it reaffirms its ""strong and solid relations with the United States of America, and underlines that the progress and development of these ties should not be affected by such unfortunate acts."" Bahrain has made headlines over the past three years after pro-democracy protests sparked a government crackdown. In 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring, Bahraini citizens demanded democratic reforms and other changes in the way the country was run. Anger from the majority Shiite population was directed at the ruling Sunni minority . In February, the king has ratified a new law that imposes a prison sentence of up to seven years and fine of up to $26,500 for anyone who publicly insults him, state-run media said.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A group of Iranian intellectuals released a public apology this week for what they say is a long history of the country's mistreatment of members of the Baha'i faith. The letter lists 11 reasons why its signatories are ashamed of the past treatment of Baha'is. The apology -- titled, ""We are ashamed"" -- was published on the Web site Iranian.com and was signed by 42 Iranian professionals, all of whom do not live in Iran. ""As Iranian human beings, we are ashamed for what has been perpetrated upon the Baha'is in the last century and a half in Iran,"" the letter says. In the letter, the group detailed incidents of violence and discrimination that it says the Iranian government has perpetrated against Baha'is. The Islamic republic has been condemned by human-rights activists and governments across the globe for its treatment of members of the Baha'i faith. The Baha'i movement has said that six of its followers were arrested in January in Tehran, including one who works with Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, the lawyer and activist. Seven leaders of the group arrested in 2008 also remain in jail. Members of Baha'i -- who say they are targeted in the predominantly Shiite nation because of their faith -- have faced arrests and other oppression over the years. They say the persecution is part of a pattern that began in 1979. That's when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created. Baha'i -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- claims to have 5 million members across the globe and about 300,000 in Iran. The European Parliament passed a resolution in January that criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'is. The U.S. State Department also criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'i followers in a report last year. CNN's Roya Shadravan contributed to this report.","Iranian intellectuals publish letter of apology to members of the Baha'i faith .

"London (CNN) -- It's September 11, 2012. The National Day of Catalonia. And an estimated 1.5 million people are on the streets of Barcelona waving banners ""Catalonia -- The next state in Europe"" and ""Independencia."" Separatist Catalans are calling for sovereignty from Madrid and the rule of the conservative Popular Party, led by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Losing 20% of the economy is the last thing the Spanish government needs right now. But if those calling for independence get their way, that could be exactly what happens when Catalans go to the polls this weekend. Catalonia -- a region in the northeast of Spain and home to global brands and tourist attractions including Barcelona Football Club and the Gaudi House Museum -- represents one fifth of the Spanish economy. The Catalonia issue comes at an inconvenient time for Rajoy's government, which opposes any talk of independence. Spain, part of the eurozone mainstay, is grappling with unsustainable borrowing costs and a soaring public deficit while trying to placate public anger over a lack of jobs and stringent austerity. Out of the hardship, regional disputes in northern Spain have started to resurface, particularly in Catalonia. Economists at Deutsche Bank say the political turmoil in such a prosperous region could be the catalyst that forces the Spanish central government into seeking aid from Europe's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. As the industrial heartbeat of the eurozone's fourth largest economy, Catalonia is the most important economic region in Spain. Situated on the Mediterranean and bordering France, the area is home to seven million people and made up of four provinces: Barcelona, Lleida, Tarragona and Girona. Calls for independence . The debate over Catalan independence is not new. Strained tensions between Madrid and Catalonia have been around for centuries. But Salvador Giner, sociologist and president of the Intitut d'Estudis Catalans, told CNN the vehemence of the debate fluctuates depending on the political and economic zeitgeist. Artur Mas, head of the Catalan government, has announced a snap regional election on November 25. If his nationalist CiU party win, a referendum on Catalan independence is expected to follow shortly after, according to Gilles Moec, co-head of European economic research at Deutsche Bank. Giner told CNN that a victory for Mas and CiU should be considered a certainty. He said: ""The socialist party in Catalonia is in disarray. He [Mas] knows that he'll win hands down."" However, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, a professor in economics at Columbia University, says that Mas is simply ""following the crowd"" on calls for sovereignty. He said: ""Up until September 11 his strategy was to go to Madrid and ask for a better financial deal or ""fiscal pact"" as he called it. I guess that the massive demonstrations convinced him that his people no longer want a better financial deal from Spain. They want independence. And he joined the bandwagon... Mas doesn't lead. He follows."" Catalonia's nearby regions, the Basque country, and Galicia in the Northwest of Spain also have self-governance mandates under the Spanish Constitution of 1978. And while not wholly independent from Spanish state law, they are still considered autonomous. On October 21, both the Basque country and Galicia held regional elections. Rajoy received a boost in his home region of Galicia where his centre-right party won a majority of the parliamentary seats against two nationalist groups and a socialist party. The win represented support for Rajoy's government as it tries to reduce Spain's deficit through a rigorous austerity program. The Basque elections presented a very different outcome. The nationalist party -- known as PNV [Partido Nacionalista Vasco] won 27 seats while the pro-independence party, Bildu, secured 21 and Rajoy's Popular Party won just 10 seats of the 75. For over 50 years, the Basque region was home to a paramilitary group known by the acronym ""ETA"" and in English ""Basque Homeland and Freedom."" The terrorist group -- formed in 1958 -- carried out a number of attacks on Spanish citizens in the name of sovereignty and but declared a permanent cease-fire last year. Giner says their activities failed to help the Basque country's cause and he would like to see Catalan independence achieved peacefully. He told CNN: ""I believe full sovereignty for Catalonia is absolutely possible and we can achieve this in a civilized manner, without the use of terrorist groups."" Spain's austerity drive . Today, Spain is suffering. The Madrid-based Popular Party is introducing deeply unpopular policies. These include a fiscal cocktail of severe budget cuts and rising taxes on a population already afflicted by the highest rate of unemployment in Europe at 25.1%, according to Eurostat figures. The CiU is raising the debate on sovereignty at a time of public frustration over taxes in Catalonia. Moec said in a note that the CiU blames the central government for disproportionate taxes levied at Catalans -- with the wealth then re-distributed to Spain's poorer regions. Salvador Giner says he understands the need for Spanish solidarity and to help struggling regions, but says a large proportion of the revenue generated from taxes is not being reinvested in Catalonia. He added: ""Catalans are fed up with the current situation on taxes. Catalonia gets back only about 19% to 21% of our contribution to the central government."" According to Sala-i-Martin, taxes and regional distribution of wealth are a large part of the problem for Catalans -- but the biggest tensions are steeped in the country's modern history. Catalonia's past . After the country's military dictator, Franco, died in 1975, Catalans thought that they could be part of a country that recognized its different cultures, languages and nations, Sala-i-Martin said. Initially, that looked possible. But then: ""In 1981, after the military coup attempt, the monster woke up,"" the Columbia professor added. ""All the Spanish institutions reinterpreted the constitution in ways that did not allow Catalunya to feel comfortable within that country."" In 2010, the Spanish constitutional courts ruled that although the term ""nation"" could be applied to Catalonia, the description had no legal validity. The recession and financial crisis of 2008 then exacerbated the tensions between Catalonia and Madrid, Sala-i-Martin said. This forced the Catalan administration to make a plea to the central government in Madrid for a regional bailout of five billion euros from an 18 billion euro credit line set up for debt-ridden Spanish regions. Employment in Catalonia is also causing a political headache for the CiU and the national governing Popular Party. According to a report by the Organization of Cooperation and Development [OECD], unemployment in Catalonia has jumped by 8.6% to 16.3%, since the collapse of the housing market and the global financial crisis began in 2008. Salvador Giner says the unemployment rate is in part due to immigrants -- largely from Southern Spain and North Africa -- settling in the region. The situation has been aggravated by an extended period of low economic growth. The Catalan people are becoming steadily disillusioned with the economic management from Madrid, says Sala-i-Martin. He said: ""If Spain came back today with an offer to solve the financial problems, most Catalans would still like to be given the right to vote for independence.""","Catalans go to the polls on Sunday November 25 in a vote that trigger a referendum for independence .

"(CNN) -- NBA star LeBron James has become a minority shareholder in English soccer team Liverpool after penning a representation deal with the club's owners. James, who plays for the Miami Heat, has partnered his own sports marketing firm, LRMR Branding & Marketing, with Fenway Sports Management (FSM) to represent him exclusively worldwide, Liverpool's official website confirmed. FSM is in the portfolio of companies owned by Fenway Sports Group, who own the Anfield club, and as part of the deal with James the 26-year-old has received a stake in the Premier League outfit. According to LRMR chief executive Maverick Carter, the idea is to build James' worldwide portfolio by acquiring equity in global firms. James is one of the biggest basketball stars in the United States and caused controversy when he moved from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Heat in July 2010, revealing the news on a television special. ""The first time I stepped on an NBA court I became a businessman. This is a great opportunity for me,"" James was quoted as saying by the Wall Street Journal. In an FSM statement he added: ""I am thrilled to be working with John Henry and Tom Werner. These guys, like me, have a passion for sports. ""You can see the drive and commitment they have for their teams. For me, this is about being in business with an organization that loves sports as much as I do. ""Liverpool is one of the most important clubs in all of sports, and I am excited to be affiliated with this incredible organization."" Referring to Liverpool's English title haul he added: ''Eighteen championships. I see myself trying to do the same things they have."" Tom Werner, chairman of FSG and Liverpool, told the Wall Street Journal: ""We're not interested in talent or athlete representation but we think he is one of the most remarkable athletes of his time. ""We believe we can open doors for LeBron and LeBron can open doors for us. Without purchasing Liverpool, we never would have been able to have this conversation.'' He added in an FSM statement: ""We are very excited that LeBron will be part of the Liverpool FC family. ""LeBron and Liverpool each has a powerful presence internationally, with particular strength in Asia, but we feel the business opportunities for both working and being identified together in emerging international markets will result in unforeseen opportunities that neither would have been able to realize alone.""","LeBron James becomes minority shareholder in English soccer club Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- When the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Bill Murray come storming across film screens this winter, in the drama The Monuments Men, viewers will be immersed in the world of Nazi art theft. The Monuments Men were a group of some three-hundred Allied officers charged with locating, protecting, and recovering art and monuments that were endangered by the fighting in World War II. They would eventually learn of Hitler's elaborate and highly-organized plan to strip Europe of its art. Indeed, Hitler had established a military unit solely dedicated to art and archive theft and made detailed plans to restructure the entirety of his boyhood town of Linz, Austria, into a city-wide ""super museum,"" containing every important artwork in the world. We have the so-called Monuments Men to thank for the salvation of tens of thousands of masterpieces, among the estimated five million cultural objects stolen during the war. But while the film will focus on two great trophies, Jan van Eyck's Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, and Michelangelo's Bruges Madonna, there will be something of an elephant in the screening room. For a fascinating question remains, and one with a complicated answer: did the Nazis steal the Mona Lisa? The answer is that they thought they did. Mona Lisa's vanishing act . The most famous act of theft associated with the Mona Lisa took place about a century ago. December 14, 2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the return of the world's most famous painting to public display, after it was stolen in 1911 from the world's most famous museum. Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa was swiped from the under-secured Louvre Museum by an amateur Italian painter and handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia. Peruggia was under the mistaken impression that the painting had been looted by Napoleon, during his Italian campaign. This was a pretty good guess, for through his art theft unit (the first military unit in history dedicated to art theft), Napoleon had made off with tens of thousands of artworks during his Italian campaign. Leonardo's painting was not among them, however, as it had left Italy with the elderly Leonardo, when he spent his twilight years under the protection of the French king, Francois I, who legally purchased several of his paintings after his death, the Mona Lisa among them. Read more: Christie's: Evolution of the Asian art market . But Peruggia had missed the lecture on this historical detail. He saw an opportunity to repatriate the painting when the firm for which he worked as a carpenter and glazier was hired to build protective cases to cover some of the Louvre's most famous works, ostensibly to protect them from attack, after an anarchist had slashed an Ingres painting in protest. Peruggia found himself with a Louvre worker's uniform, and direct contact with the Mona Lisa. On the night before August 2 1911, he hid inside a closet in the Louvre, waiting for the footfalls of the night guards to fade into the distance. In the early morning hours, he slipped out of the closet, removed the Mona Lisa from its wall in the Salon Carre of the Louvre, and retreated to a service staircase. There he took the painting out of its frame, wrapped it in a white sheet, and headed down the stairs. There was surely a moment of great panic, when Peruggia twisted the doorknob at the foot of the stairs, and found it locked from the inside. He was prepared for an eventuality such as this, and had tools with him. He unscrewed the doorknob and slipped it into his pocket, thinking this might unlock the door, but it didn't. He was trapped inside the Louvre, with the world's most famous painting tucked under his arm...and then he heard the sound of footsteps approaching. Up the stairs came a plumber, making his morning rounds. To the plumber, Peruggia looked like a Louvre worker who had accidentally been locked in overnight—not an unheard-of occurrence. He opened the door and let Peruggia out, thinking nothing of the Mona Lisa-shaped package that Peruggia carried with him. It would be two years before the Mona Lisa was seen again. The investigation was a fiasco that resulted in the dismissal of the head of the Louvre and the head of the Paris police. International media mocked the lack of security at the Louvre -- in fact, this was the first theft to spark the interest of the world media, kicking off a love affair with the elite world of high-priced art, and its theft. Read more: Rare Psalm book sells for $14.2 million . Priceless loot . The most cinematic and resounding success for the Monuments Men was the salvation of the 12,000 masterpieces destined for Hitler's planned Linz museum, which were stored in an ancient salt mine at Altaussee, in Austria, which had been converted by the Nazis into a secret stolen art warehouse. It was supervised by a ferocious SS officer, August Eigruber, who was determined to destroy all of the art if he could not defend it against the Allies. This is where the most famous pieces were kept, including gems by Vermeer, Raphael, Rembrandt, and a who's-who of Old Master artists. But there is some confusion as to whether the Mona Lisa was there, as well. There are two primary source documents that attest to the Mona Lisa's presence in the Altaussee salt mine. The report of a secret mission called Operation Ebensburg, in which four Austrian double-agents were parachuted into the alps to delay the destruction of the Altaussee mine until the Allied Third Army could arrive, stated that the double agents ""saved such priceless objects as the Louvre's Mona Lisa."" Another document from 12 December 1945 notes that ""the Mona Lisa from Paris [is included in] 80 wagons of art and cultural objects from across Europe"" that were found in the mine. And yet there is no record beyond these two documents of the world's most famous painting being part of the world's most famous hoard of looted art. Surely that would have been noteworthy, a rescued prize as famous as Adoration of the Mystic Lamb. Shrouded in mystery . The Louvre remained reticent about whether it had lost the Mona Lisa at all. The only documents about the painting during World War II attest to its having been crated up on August 27, 1939, and sent with other French national treasures to a series of five chateaux, for safe-keeping—theoretically just ahead of the advance of the Nazis south through France, though the invaders quickly overtook the entire country. The next document that refers to the painting is not until 16 June 1945, when the painting was listed as having been returned safely to the Louvre. Its whereabouts during the war are unrecorded. But are they unknown? The latest word from the Louvre is that an identical copy of the Mona Lisa, also from the 16th century and difficult for any non-specialist to distinguish from the original, was one of a few thousand works that were gathered at the Musee Nationaux de la Recuperation, for whom owners could not be found. This copy was marked MNR 265. After five years had passed with no one able to prove ownership, it went to the Louvre. From 1950 onward, it hung on the wall outside the office of the director of the museum. Based on the available evidence, and a little detective work, a plausible (though unconfirmed) conclusion may be reached as to what happened to the Mona Lisa during the war. A painting was crated up in 1939 and sent to various castles, just ahead of Nazi hands—but it was this 16th century copy, not the original. Knowing that the Mona Lisa would be such an obvious target for Nazi art hunters, the Louvre may have kept the original hidden in Paris, while the copy led the Nazis on a wild goose chase. This would explain why the ""Mona Lisa"" did return from Altaussee, but why it may also be that the ""Mona Lisa"" never left Paris. It was the copy that was stolen, hidden at Altaussee, and recovered. Some who saw it assumed it was the original, while others, specifically the art-savvy Monuments Men who catalogued the art saved from the salt mine, recognized that it was only a copy.

"(CNN) -- With President Obama's nomination Tuesday, a federal appellate judge could become the first Hispanic U.S. Supreme Court justice and the third woman to serve on the high court. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says some have concerns about Sonia Sotomayor's philosophy. Sonia Sotomayor, who is on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was named a U.S. District Court judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, and was elevated to her current seat by President Bill Clinton. Sotomayor, who is of Puerto Rican descent, rose from humble beginnings at a housing project in the South Bronx and went on to attend Princeton University and Yale Law School. CNN's Wolf Blitzer spoke with former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales about what it means to have a Hispanic judge nominated, what problems conservatives may have with her, and whether he believes she's the right person for the job. Here is an edited version of that interview: . Blitzer: Let's get to a former member of the Bush administration who has a unique perspective on Sotomayor's nomination to the United States Supreme Court. That would be the former attorney general of the United States, Alberto Gonzales. He once was seen as a possible contender himself to be the first Latino on the high court. Attorney general, thanks very much for coming in. Gonzales: It's good to see you, Wolf. Blitzer: How close were you, in your mind? Did you ever find out how close you were to being President (George W.) Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court? Gonzales: I didn't concern myself, Wolf, with respect to my status on the short list, so ... Blitzer:  But do you know if you were on the short list? Gonzales: That's a question, I think, that's better posed to President Bush. Blitzer: But you -- but you know you were, right? Gonzales: Listen, I know that people -- people did consider me as a possible candidate for the Supreme Court. Blitzer: All right. Well, now there's going to be -- well, there's a nominee, already, who's Hispanic, a woman. Gonzales: Yes. Blitzer: How do you feel about that? You're the first Hispanic to serve as the attorney general of the United States. What do you think about her? Gonzales: I think it's a proud day for the Sotomayor family. It's a historic day for the Hispanic community. I don't think that any gender group or ethnic group is entitled to representation on our courts. I don't think that the outcome of a case should depend upon the ethnicity or gender of the judge, any more than the outcome of a case should depend on the ethnicity or gender of a prosecutor or defendant. But having said that, Wolf, this is a powerful message, a powerful message of hope and opportunity of hope through this appointment, just like there's a powerful message sent when an African-American is elected president or an African-American or Hispanic is appointed as attorney general of the United States. It's a powerful message that a president listens to, and this president obviously did. Blitzer: Because that picture that we saw earlier at the White House, the first African-American president now nominating the first Hispanic justice -- to become a United States Supreme Court justice. That says a lot about what's going on in our country right now. Gonzales: Again, it says a lot about opportunities in our great country. Obviously, this judge still needs to go through a confirmation process. There are questions, some concerns raised in certain quarters about her judicial philosophy, but that's what the confirmation process is all about. And no nominee is entitled to a free confirmation process, an easy confirmation process. She will be fully vetted, as she should be, because this is a lifetime appointment to our nation's highest court. Blitzer: Here's what she said back in 2001, and I'll put it up on the screen: ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" That's generating some commotion out there. Gonzales: I'm not sure what that -- what she was trying to say there. I think -- you know, I served on the Texas Supreme Court. And there were times -- there were cases in which I had to interpret a statute. I didn't like the outcome based upon that interpretation as I read the statute, the intention of the state legislature, but I felt obliged by my oath of office to honor that intent of the legislature. I think it's dangerous when judges impose their own personal views with respect to the outcome of a particular case. Blitzer: Did you -- when the president of the United States says he wants something -- someone who's empathetic, and has had real-world, real-life experiences, is that good or bad? Gonzales:  I think we all -- we'd like to think that all of our government officials are good people, compassionate people. And obviously, someone with this kind of story makes a very attractive candidate in a confirmation process. But to say that you empathize with someone, I think it's -- it's very, very difficult to predict the outcome of a case based upon whether or not a judge feels good about a result. I think there ought to be predictability and certainty in the interpretation of our laws. I think that's the number one requirement that a president should look for in the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. Blitzer:  Based on what you know, the fact that the first President Bush named her to the federal bench to begin with. She was confirmed. Then President Clinton got her to the court of appeals. She was confirmed. Based on what you know about her, do you think she's qualified to be a United States Supreme Court justice? Gonzales: I have no questions in my mind about her qualifications in terms of education, experience. A president is not required to nominate the most qualified person to the court. I think he's obligated to nominate someone who is well qualified, and I think by any measure she is well qualified. I think there are legitimate questions about her judicial philosophy, and again, that will be something that ... will be examined in the confirmation process. Blitzer: As a Hispanic-American, how worried are you that if Republicans or conservatives go really hard against her, that would further alienate the Hispanic vote against the Republicans in the years to come? Gonzales: Well, obviously, the Republicans are very desirous of the Hispanic vote, but they have an obligation, a duty. They took an oath as well to the Constitution, and they have an obligation to vet every nominee carefully, whether or not that nominee is Hispanic, and you know, white, African-American, male or female. They have an obligation, and I expect them to discharge that obligation. Blitzer: How worried are you, switching gears for a moment, that the Justice Department lawyers who wrote those legal opinions authorizing enhanced interrogation, how worried are you that the system now will come down on them, either disbarment or worse? Gonzales: What I worry about, Wolf, is that good people, well- intentioned people serving in a historically difficult time, a dangerous time in our nation's history, may be penalized for doing their best, simply providing the best legal advice that they can. I'm afraid of the chilling effect that that's going to have on future lawyers at the Department of Justice. Blitzer: You were the White House counsel at that time. This was before you became the attorney general. Gonzales:  That's correct. Blitzer: And were you involved in some of those legal opinions early on? Gonzales: Well, what I can say is that I worked with the Department of Justice ensuring that legal advice was provided. But at the end of the day, it's the responsibility of the Department of Justice to provide the legal guides on behalf of the executive branch. Blitzer: So are you in any -- do you think -- are you afraid that you could be in any legal jeopardy right now? Gonzales: Wolf, I stand by my record. I did my best to defend our country during very difficult times, so I'm proud of my service. Blitzer: All right. Attorney general, thanks very much for coming out. Gonzales: Thank you, Wolf.","Former attorney general: No questions in my mind about her education, experience .

"(CNN) -- Rapper Gucci Mane has been arrested -- again. This time it's for disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana and for carrying a gun, Atlanta police said. The arrest took place early Saturday morning on an Atlanta street after a man flagged down officers who said he was concerned about the way his friend was acting. Officers approached the friend -- later identified as Radric Davis, which is Gucci Mane's real name -- and began speaking with him. Mane became ""increasingly agitated,"" police said, cursing and threatening the officers. DMX arrested again . They took him into custody and discovered he was carrying a handgun and a small amount of marijuana. Mane, 33, is a convicted felon, and so, cannot be in possession of a weapon. In March, Mane was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta night club. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper. In 2010, he was arrested in Atlanta for violating a number of traffic laws. But they were dismissed for want of prosecution. In 2005, Mane was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man -- but the charge was later dropped because of insufficient evidence.

In a tight Premier League opener against Southampton, the attacking talents who still remain at Anfield proved last season's runners-up still have bite, despite the departure of English football's least favorite Uruguayan. Big things are expected of livewire Raheem Sterling and the England starlet continued the electrifying form he displayed at the end of last season. Latching onto a perfect Jordan Henderson through ball in the first half, he produced a calm finish to open the scoring. But after Southampton equalized in the second half, it was Suarez's former strike partner Daniel Sturridge who made the decisive contribution. One half of the ""SAS"" duo that was so prolific last term, Sturridge steered home Sterling's 79th-minute header to ensure Brendan Rodgers' team opened with a 2-1 win. Playing in just his 50th match for Liverpool, Sturridge scored his 36th goal. If Sturridge and Sterling keep firing, memories of Suarez will fade fast. ""Vanishing spray"" Consisting of 80% water and 17% butane gas, it's an unlikely football icon. But on its Premier League debut, ""vanishing spray"" was cheered to the rafters by supporters the length and breadth of England. Used to great success at the 2014 World Cup, having long been a staple of South American football, the foamy substance is sprayed by referees to position players at set pieces. English football is a late adopter of the pocket-sized innovation, but the country's fans whooped and hollered like cavemen playing with a lighter every time a referee grabbed the canister from his waistband. Not everyone is convinced, though. Arsenal's Santi Cazorla swallowed a mouthful of the stuff after referee Jonathan Moss suffered a nozzle malfunction. It might be hard for the Spaniard to stomach, but it looks like ""vanishing spray"" is here to stay. Cristiano Ronaldo . The craze which has swept through the United States has made its way into football and, even though he didn't kick a ball this weekend, Cristiano Ronaldo rounds up our list of winners. The Real Madrid star became the latest footballer to brave the ""ice bucket challenge,"" which began in North America as a way of raising money for the degenerative condition Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Motor Neurone Disease. A host of celebrities have soaked themselves in icy cold water, and Ronaldo joined the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Justin Timberlake and Conan O'Brien after being nominated by former Manchester United teammate Darren Fletcher. Sat in a tiny purple speedo, Ronaldo nominated rapper Little Wayne as well as Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez before being drenched by fellow Portugal international Fabio Coentrao. Over to you, J'Lo... Losers . Manchester United . How misleading can six pre-season wins be? Manchester United's 2-1 home defeat by Swansea on Saturday showed there will be no easy fixes for new manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutch ""mad genius"" quickly had to rethink his 3-5-2 formation as Swansea exposed manifest weaknesses in United's defence, while comfortably dealing with their ponderous midfield and stuttering attack. More worryingly Saturday's defeat highlighted the lack of investment in United's squad over the last few years, a legacy bequeathed to former manager David Moyes by his predecessor Alex Ferguson. The club's owners have spared no effort in lining up myriad global sponsors --- official noodle and paint partners to name but two --- so it's a shame more hasn't been done to identify and rectify deficiencies in the playing staff. Chief executive Ed Woodward has a matter of days left in the transfer window to improve United's strength in depth but his track record of success --- or arguable lack of -- in bringing in new players is increasingly coming under the spotlight. Monaco . Have Monaco lost their mojo? After finishing second last season, Monaco is without a point after two games and Sunday's 4-1 defeat at Bordeaux illustrates Ligue 1's noveau riche club might struggle without James Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in the summer. Two of those four goals came from penalties, which prompted Monaco's new coach Leonardo Jardim to point the finger at referee Tony Chapron as a key factor in his side's defeat. ""We had two refereeing errors that sealed the match and after that there's been no game. We must continue to work - we will continue to believe in these players,"" Jardim told reporters. There was some good news for Jardim and Monaco in that Colombian international Radamel Falcao came on as a second substitute as he returns from the serious knee injury that ruled him out of the World Cup. Brandao . Elsewhere in France, Bastia's Brazilian striker Brandao could be in all sorts of trouble after the Corsican club's 2-0 defeat by champions Paris Saint-Germain. Thiago Motta suffered a broken nose after the game with CCTV cameras in the Parc des Princes tunnel showing Brandao waiting for the Italian international before the Bastia forward headbutted the PSG midfielder. French secretary of state for sports Thierry Braillard told Franco Info the headbutt was ""scandalous"" and ""unacceptable"" and ""merited a sanction."" PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi went further, telling Canal Plus TV after the game that Brandao should be ""suspended for life... he is not a football player."" France's Professional Football League disciplinary committee is due to examine the incident on Thursday and, given the severity of the ""biting"" sanction handed out to Luis Suarez by world governing body FIFA, it will be interesting to what the French regulator does. That wasn't Brandao's only impact on the match with PSG saying their Dutch defender Gregory Van der Wiel suffered ""a fracture of the second lumbar vertebra"" following a knee in the back in the first half."" Last season Brandao was suspended for four matches after elbowing PSG's Yohan Cabaye at the Parc des Princes while playing for Saint-Etienne.","Without Luis Suarez, Liverpool beat Southampton 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- Who was Robin Williams? In the wake of his death from an apparent suicide, that question looms large as fans and friends try to grasp how someone who brought so much happiness to the world could leave it under a cloud of such despair. It's the dichotomy of fame in that while a celebrity can be so well-known there are parts of their lives and selves they never share with the public. And while only his loved ones truly knew the private aspects of the Oscar-winning actor whose performances could elicit tears as easily as they could giggles, Williams did allow us to see how multifaceted he could be. These are just some of them: . The devoted dad . The last image Williams left for the world on his Instagram was a poignant one: a black and white image of the actor holding his then toddler daughter with the caption ""#tbt and Happy Birthday to Ms. Zelda Rae Williams! Quarter of a century old today but always my baby girl. Happy Birthday @zeldawilliams Love you!"" He posted a similar image earlier in honor of his son Zachary's birthday. He often spoke lovingly of being father to the pair and another son, Cody. ""My children give me a great sense of wonder,"" Williams said. ""Just to see them develop into these extraordinary human beings."" The prankster . Sure he was funny on-screen, but Williams also liked to pull a leg or two in real life. He told fans during a 2013 Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session that he once walked into a San Francisco sex shop in full Mrs. Doubtfire make-up and tried to buy a sex toy. ""And the guy was about to sell it to me until he realized it was me -- Robin Williams -- not an older Scottish woman coming in to look for a very large [sex toy] and a jar of lube,"" Williams said. ""He just laughed and said ""what are you doing here"" and I left."" The husband . The actor was married three times. His union with Valerie Velardi from 1978 to 1988 produced his son Zachary. Williams was married to Marsha Garces from 1989 to 2010, with whom he had Zelda and Cody. In 2011, he married graphic designer Susan Schneider. The breakups were costly for Williams, he told Parade magazine. ""Divorce is expensive. I used to joke they were going to call it 'all the money,' but they changed it to 'alimony.' It's ripping your heart out through your wallet. Are things good with my exes? Yes. But do I need that lifestyle? No."" The friend . There was a good reason Williams has been so deeply mourned by his show business colleagues. He showed himself to be incredibly loyal to friends such as Jay Leno and the late Christopher Reeve, who came to love Williams before he was famous. After Williams' death, Leno said, ""I saw him on stage that very first time he auditioned at the Improv in Los Angeles, and we have been friends ever since. It's a very sad day."" Gilbert Gottfried: Robin Williams' generous heart . It was while students at Juilliard in New York City that Williams and Reeve -- who would find fame in the role as Superman in the '70s and '80s -- cemented a bond. In fact, after Reeve was paralyzed in a riding accident, he credited Williams with making him laugh again. Reeve was about to undergo a serious operation when Williams showed up dressed in surgical scrubs and speaking in a Russian accent, saying he needed to do a rectal exam. ""For the first time since the accident, I laughed,"" Reeve said. ""My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be OK."" The mentee . While so many younger actors looked to Williams for inspiration, he was a a huge fan of the late comedian Jonathan Winters, whom Williams discovered as a child while watching Jack Paar on ""The Tonight Show"" with his father. Years later, an adult Williams would share the ""Tonight Show"" stage with Winters and cast Winters to play his son on his hit show ""Mork & Mindy."" When Winters died in 2013, Williams wrote a moving appreciation of his mentor for The New York Times. ""No audience was too small for Jonathan,"" Williams wrote. ""I once saw him do a hissing cat for a lone beagle."" The edgy actor . His skills as a zany funny man were legendary, but Williams could also deliver riveting dramatic performances. 2002 was especially a break-out year for him as he played a killer in the film ""Insomnia"" and a stalker photo technician in ""One Hour Photo."" Williams not only changed his look for the latter to play Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish but he said in an interview that to prepare, he ""watched some interviews with serial killers -- 'Psychotics Through the Ages.' It's a collectible tape from Time-Life Books. But basically, it was using the material and extrapolating from there."" It's a role that still astonishes. ""Williams' finely calibrated performance was utterly free of the tics and affectations that are so tempting to someone who has come to count on and crave the audience's love,"" Washington Post critic Ann Hornaday writes. ""Rather than seek his fans' approval with the actorly equivalent of ingratiating winks, Williams was willing to completely inhabit a character who was somehow terrifying, pathetic, creepy and vulnerable all at once."" The philanthropist . As one of the co-hosts for Comic Relief's debut in 1986, he helped raise both funding for and awareness about the homeless. But that was just one of the many charities to which Williams gave his time and resources. Robin Williams' legacy: A big heart for charity . ""Robin came from a family with money -- he was brought up with a silver spoon in his mouth, and I think he felt so blessed that he wanted to do something for people who weren't brought up like that,"" Comic Relief founder Bob Zmuda told The Los Angeles Times. The sports enthusiast . Williams involvement with sports went beyond that time he dressed up a as Denver Broncos' cheerleader for an episode of ""Mork & Mindy."" Robin Williams: His passion for cycling . Die-hard fans remember his hilarious stand-up routine about the origins of golf, and he would often end up on the cam at various sporting events. The actor was a close personal friend of then-professional cyclist Lance Armstrong, who he would join in training. The sci-fi geek . Perhaps it was playing an alien that did it. It turns out that Williams was a bit of a sci-fi geek who when asked his favorite book said, ""Oh my God, Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy. It's one of the greatest books of all time, and the greatest character is The Mule."" The man who struggled . As shocking as his death has been, Williams was open about his issues with substance abuse and stints in rehab. He blamed his relapse into drinking for helping to end his second marriage. ""You know, I was shameful, and you do stuff that causes disgust, and that's hard to recover from,"" Williams told The Guardian in 2010. ""You can say, 'I forgive you' and all that stuff, but it's not the same as recovering from it. It's not coming back."" Robin Williams and the dark side of comedy . Even then it seemed that Williams was trying to find his way. Asked whether he was happier in his life, he responded ""I think so. And not afraid to be unhappy. That's OK too. And then you can be like, all is good. And that is the thing, that is the gift."" Complete coverage of Robin Williams .

"(CNN) -- The murder of a teacher has prompted a petition calling for Pakistan's government to take a greater role in protecting girls and teachers attending school. Shahnaz Nazli was on her way to an all girls school where she taught in the village of Shahkas, in the country's northwestern Khyber tribal district, when two men on a motorcycle pulled up and opened fire, government official Asmatullah Wazir told CNN. She was transported to hospital in the nearby town of Jamrud, but later died from the multiple gunshots to her body. Nazli's husband and son, however, told CNN that the teacher died at the scene. ""I was standing next to my mother when they fired the first shot and she fell to the ground,"" her son, Daniyal Ahmad said. The attackers shot Nazli again and told her son to run away. ""When I came back, my mother was struggling to breathe. She had five minutes of life in her,"" he said. Nazli had been a teacher for 24 years and had never been threatened, said her husband, Ishtiaq Ahmad. However, due to escalating terrorism, the government had transferred Nazli and other teachers to Khyber. ""There was no security from the government,"" he said. ""Not just for my wife, but for all the teachers. My wife was martyred while she was on duty."" Eighteen suspects have been arrested in an operation to find the culprits, said Wazir, the government official. He added that no one has taken responsibility for the attack. The Khyber Agency is one of seven semi autonomous tribal agencies in northwest Pakistan along the Afghan border. The area has been a hotbed of militant activity in recent years. The case has chilling similarities with the attempted murder last year of Malala Yousafzai, a teenage schoolgirl from Pakistan. The 14-year-old was riding home in a school van in the Swat Valley, a Taliban stronghold, when masked men stopped the vehicle. They demanded that the other girls identify Malala, and when they did, the men shot Malala in the head and neck. The gunmen also shot another girl, wounding her. Malala's story, especially her recovery from appalling injuries against the odds, moved Pakistan to vow that it would more vigorously fight for girls' rights and against the Taliban. She gained international attention three years before she was shot, as a campaigner for girls' education in Pakistan. In 2009, she wrote a blog published by the BBC about how she wanted to go to school but was afraid -- the Taliban had banned all girls from schools in the region. But on her blog, Malala praised her father, who was operating one of the few schools that would go on to defy that order. She started giving interviews with news outlets, including CNN. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who serves as the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, has championed education issues in Pakistan, especially after the shooting of Malala. OPINION: Malala spurs school-for-all vow, now deliver, says Brown . His office called Nazli a ""courageous teacher"" who wanted ""to ensure girls have the right to go to school."" It appealed for Pakistan's president and government to protect girls and teachers in schools. ""We call for all girls and all teachers to be protected and given security to enable them to enjoy their basic right to be educated,"" read a statement on their online petition.

"Washington (CNN) -- An unprecedented summit of African leaders in Washington. An Ebola outbreak in West Africa that sparks global fears. The two events this week juxtaposed the best and worst of Africa at a time when its leaders want to move, finally, past perceptions of a ""dark continent"" rife with war, poverty and disease. Those problems exist, as demonstrated by the Ebola crisis threatening to spread beyond the epicenter of neighbors Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. So does evidence of galloping economies and prolonged political stability in countries across Africa, a point emphasized repeatedly at the Washington gathering hosted by America's first African-American president. 5 reasons Obama's Africa leaders' summit matters . Trade, not just aid . Leaders who once came seeking aid now make deals for trade, citing statistics to boost their case. Six of the world's fastest developing economies are in Africa. Burgeoning middle classes offer growing markets for foreign goods. To Senegalese President Macky Sall, the summit ""should allow us to confirm the change of perspective towards a vision of Africa"" from a continent that ""used to need aid."" He cited the evolving perception chronicled by The Economist, which ran a May 2000 cover with a picture of a gun-toting African above the phrase ""the hopeless continent."" Eleven years later, the same magazine's cover heralded ""Africa rising."" President Barack Obama emphasized the same point on Wednesday, declaring that ""we are here to take action -- concrete steps to build on Africa's progress and forge the partnerships of equals that we seek."" He announced more money for Africa, both aid and investment: $12 billion more for an existing program to provide electricity in sub-Saharan Africa, and $14 billion from companies including Coca-Cola, Marriott, General Electric and Blackstone. China ahead . African leaders told Obama that the United States needed to catch up with other foreign investors on their continent -- especially China. For the past two decades, Beijing has poured billions into Africa for roads, bridges, mines and other development needed to extract natural resources sent back home and elsewhere. In some African countries, governments and local communities have chafed at resulting environmental harm and the use of imported Chinese labor instead of local workers. Obama got a dig in at China about that, telling his African visitors that the United States would be a responsible partner. ""We don't look to Africa simply for its natural resources; we recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents and their potential,"" he said Tuesday to applause. ""We don't simply want to extract minerals from the ground for our growth; we want to build genuine partnerships that create jobs and opportunity for all our peoples and that unleash the next era of African growth."" Overall, international trade and aid to Africa have increased in recent years after slowing due to the global recession. African aid and investment . According to the African Economic Outlook put out by a consortium of international organizations, the total amount of external money flowing to the continent was expected to exceed $200 billion in 2013. The report showed government aid slowing while direct business investment, portfolio investment and remittances -- money sent to home countries by Africans living abroad -- grew at faster clips. At the same time, new security concerns over Islamist extremists such as al Shabaab in Somalia and Boko Haram in Nigeria raise questions about future risk for investors. After disastrous African interventions such as Rwanda, when U.N. peacekeepers failed to prevent the 1994 genocide, the United States and Western allies have sought to shift more of the security burden on the African Union and individual nations. Security issues . At his news conference concluding the summit, Obama announced additional funding and resources to bolster such African efforts such as a new security initiative ""to help African countries continue to build strong professional security forces, to provide for their own security."" ""We also agreed to make significant new investments in African peacekeeping,"" he said. ""The United States will provide additional equipment to African peacekeepers in Somalia and the Central African Republic. We will support the African Union's efforts to strengthen its peacekeeping institutions. And most importantly, we're launching a new African peacekeeping rapid-response partnership, with the goal of quickly deploying African peacekeepers in support of U.N. or A.U. missions."" However, the summit also showed the difficulty that African leaders have getting a handle on the security issue. At a session Tuesday, the leaders of Tanzania and Tunisia initially argued over the scope of the problem. ""Africa is more secure today than it was many years ago,"" said Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, at the same time acknowledging that troubles continue with al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Shabaab. ""From time to time they will bomb this, ignite a bomb there."" Opinion: Africa and U.S.: Invest in human rights . ""We still have huge problems"" His Tunisian counterpart, interim President Moncef Marzouki, took exception. ""I'm sorry. We still have huge problems in Central Africa,"" he interjected. ""We still have huge problem in Sudan, you know, where people are starving. There is a terrible situation in Sudan. We have a terrible situation in the northern part of Mali."" Marzouki then agreed with Kikwete that Africa was ""much more secure than before, but we are still facing a challenge, an important challenge on the matter of security, and we have to work together as Africa."" South African President Jacob Zuma, meanwhile, blamed insecurity in Libya and elsewhere in North Africa on the Arab Spring upheaval. Promising African solutions to the continent's security challenges, Zuma summed up the most significant benefit the summit provided -- the chance for he and other leaders to represent their countries in such a prominent setting. ""Today I think we stand a better chance as countries in the continent to better ourselves,"" he said. ""That is why we appreciate this opportunity, because we have been in a position to tell our own story rather than people telling the story on our behalf.""

"(CNN) -- Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa, whose hands and feet were amputated in a bid to save her from a deadly and little-known illness, died early Saturday, two friends of the model told CNN. Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died Saturday after undergoing multiple amputations. ""Unfortunately Mari couldn't resist any longer. She passed away at 3 a.m. today,"" Henrique Fontes, executive director of Miss World Brazil, said in an e-mail to CNN. Renato Lindgren, a friend of the model who runs a blog dedicated to her, confirmed da Costa's death. On his blog, Lindgren wrote that he and other friends were going to the hospital. ""On behalf of all the family, we are grateful for the support and the affection that the entire world has sent to us,"" he wrote. Da Costa, 20, had fought a pernicious disease that has ravaged her body and forced doctors to perform the amputations and extract part of her stomach as well as both kidneys. She had been breathing through a respirator, officials at Dorio Silva Hospital in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo said Friday. Da Costa suffered from necrosis, or the fast deadening of tissue, caused by septicemia. Septicemia, triggered by a bacterial infection, causes insufficient blood flow that can lead to organ failure. Da Costa first sought medical advice after feeling ill in late December. Hospital officials said she was transferred to Dorio Silva on January 3 in ""septic shock,"" a serious medical condition caused by an inflammation. Da Costa was first diagnosed as suffering a urinary tract infection. By the time the infection was detected, it had developed into septicemia. Doctors decided to amputate first her hands and then her feet after the condition reduced the amount of oxygen being delivered to her limbs. Just less than one month ago, da Costa was a healthy young woman well on the way to achieving her dream of becoming a world class model. She placed sixth in the Miss Bikini International competition in China last year and took first place for the ""Best in Swimsuit"" category. In 2007 and 2008, she came fourth in the contest to become Brazil's entrant for the Miss World pageant. Thiago Simoes, da Costa's fiance, said she was on her way to international stardom, signing with prominent model scout Dilson Stein, who brought Brazilian models, including Gisele Bundchen and Luize Altenhofen, to the world stage. ""All the agencies were very interested in knowing her. I know for a fact that they would have loved her because Mariana is beautiful,"" Stein told Brazil's Tribuna newspaper. Simoes told CNN that da Costa woke up from a coma 10 days ago and told him how much she wanted to be alive. ""She told me she was praying to stay alive, that she still had a lot to do on this earth, that she wanted to go on with her plans,"" he said. ""She comes from a humble family and she was the main breadwinner,"" said Simoes, who refuted rumors that da Costa was dieting and that might have affected her health. ""She never dieted, never took pills...she is a very simple, very warm human being,"" he said. A doctor who recently published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine on the disease, told CNN that little was known about the illness, although it is the tenth leading cause of deaths in the United States. ""We know a lot about what happens once a patient contracts the illness but we know very little about what causes it,"" said Dr. Greg Martin of Emory University in Atlanta. Martin said sepsis is a ""response"" to an infection that can cause the immune system to lose its balance. ""Basically, the immune system goes haywire after contracting an infection and begins to overreact,"" he said. Men are more susceptible than women, Martin said. News of da Costa's condition spread quickly throughout Brazil and then worldwide. A message on her Web site said that the volume of traffic had caused it to crash, and that the site had received more than 15,000 hits in two days. ""The whole world, I repeat, the whole world is touched by the case of Mariana,"" it said. The message said they had received ""e-mails of solidarity from all corners of the world: Australia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, France, Italy, USA, Russia, etc."" CNN's Hilary Whiteman and Helena de Moura contributed to this report.","NEW: Brazilian amputee model Mariana Bridi da Costa died early Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Tennis is 'likely' to change one of its anti-doping rules after Viktor Troicki received an 18-month suspension for refusing to take a drug test at a tournament earlier this year. Troicki was hit with the ban after he opted against giving a blood sample at the Monte Carlo Masters in April, citing poor health. He provided a urine sample. The Serb claims the doping control officer on site allowed him to take the blood test the day after but the International Tennis Federation (ITF) says that wasn't the case. When he did take the blood test the following day, Troicki said, it came back negative. Troicki, who is taking his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport next week, said in a statement released Tuesday that good friend and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic was the first player to sign a petition demanding new rules at the ""doping control station if there are problems."" The ITF said Wednesday there would indeed probably be alterations next year to avoid any possible confusion. ""The tennis anti-doping rules are likely to be changed in 2014 to say that, where a player refuses or fails to provide a sample (as Mr. Troicki did), the doping control officer should try to offer the player an opportunity to speak to the event supervisor or referee to confirm the player's responsibilities under the program,"" Stuart Miller, the ITF's anti-doping manager, told CNN. When asked if the change of thinking was due to the Troicki affair, Miller added: ""I think it's fair to say that the Troicki case highlighted the issue. ""Given this only happened in 2013, I think it's looking at the problem pretty quickly and trying to find a solution."" Troicki, a former world No. 12, said other players were ""worried"" in the wake of his suspension. ""The players demand that the tournament supervisor or the ATP tour manager must be called to the doping control station if there are problems,"" the 27-year-old said. ""No one should leave the room without providing samples if one of them has not been called. ""The players are worried. What happened to me could have happened to them."" CNN was unable to verify if Djokovic signed any petition, although he told reporters at Montreal's Rogers Cup in August: ""We all give (Troicki) big support because he's definitely innocent."" Troicki said he was ""confident"" ahead of his hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland on October 9. ""I am fighting for the truth and I will do it as hard as I can,"" he said. ""I have done nothing wrong, apart from following the instructions of the doping control officer. ""I really put all my hopes in the judges that will decide in Lausanne. I hope they take their time and that they really find the truth. I don't even want to think about anything else.""","Tennis will probably change one of its anti-doping rules in 2014 following Viktor Troicki's ban .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has blocked an Oklahoma voter-approved measure barring state judges from considering Islamic and international law in their decisions. The three-judge panel at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an earlier injunction preventing State Question 755 from being certified until the free speech questions are resolved. The decision Tuesday allows a lawsuit brought by Islamic-American groups to move ahead to a bench trial. ""The proposed amendment discriminates among religions,"" said the judges. ""The Oklahoma amendment specifically names the target of its discrimination. The only religious law mentioned in the amendment is Sharia law."" A federal judge last summer had issued a temporary restraining order in favor of the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which had sued to nullify the law completely. The amendment would require Oklahoma courts to ""rely on federal and state law when deciding cases"" and ""forbids courts from considering or using"" either international law or Islamic religious law, known as Sharia, which the amendment defined as being based on the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed. In bringing suit, CAIR argued that the amendment violates the establishment and free-exercise clauses of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom. The group's local leader, Muneer Awad, has said the amendment passed in November 2010 under a campaign of fear and misinformation about Islam. ""This is an important reminder that the Constitution is the last line of defense against a rising tide of anti-Muslim bigotry in our society, and we are pleased that the appeals court recognized that fact,"" Awad told CNN after Tuesday's announcement. The appeals court said voter initiatives normally should be given great deference by the courts but concluded the Oklahoma measure would be applied selectively. Ballot supporters ""do not identify any actual problem the challenged amendment seeks to solve,"" said the 37-page ruling. ""Indeed, they admitted at the preliminary injunction hearing that they did not know of even a single instance where an Oklahoma court had applied Sharia law or used the legal precepts of other nations or cultures, let alone that such applications or uses had resulted in concrete problems in Oklahoma."" State Question 755, also known as the ""Save Our State"" measure, was approved by a 7-3 ratio. It was sponsored by Oklahoma State Reps. Rex Duncan and Anthony Sykes, both Republicans. ""The fact that Sharia law was even considered anywhere in the United States is enough for me"" to sign on, Sykes told CNN last year. ""It should scare anyone that any judge in America would consider using that as precedent."" Sykes said his concern was compounded by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan's comments during her confirmation hearings in June 2010 that she would be willing to consider international law when hearing cases before the court. As written on the ballot, the measure states it would amend a state constitution section dealing with the state courts, making them ""rely on federal and state law"" when deciding cases, forbidding them ""from considering or using international law"" and ""from considering or using Sharia Law."" The ballot then briefly described international law, which ""deals with the conduct of international organizations and independent nations, such as countries, states and tribes,"" and Sharia, which is ""based on two principal sources, the Koran and the teaching of Mohammed."" ""Shall the proposal be approved?"" the ballot read, instructing voters to respond ""yes"" if they're for the proposal and ""no"" if they're against it. Saleem Quraishi, president of the American Muslim Association of Oklahoma City, runs the Islamic Center at the Grand Mosque of Oklahoma City. He said there are more than 5,000 Muslims in the city. While there are no exact numbers for the Muslim population in the state, it is not among the larger communities, said Ibrahim Hooper of CAIR. ""It's just fear-mongering; it's nothing,"" Quraishi told CNN. ""What's Sharia law have to do with Oklahoma?"" The Oklahoma controversy stems from a New Jersey legal case in which a Muslim woman went to a family court asking for a restraining order against her spouse, claiming he had raped her repeatedly. The judge ruled against her, saying that her husband was abiding by his Muslim beliefs regarding spousal duties. The decision was later overruled by an appellate court, but the case sparked a nationwide firestorm. The issue spread to Oklahoma, prompting the ballot initiative. Tuesday's ruling deals only with the injunction stopping certification and enforcement of 755. There was no indication when the federal district judge would hear the larger merits of the Oklahoma case and issue a ruling, but that could be some months away. The losing side could then try again at the federal appeals court, then possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeals case is Awad v. Ziriax (10-6273).

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- David Letterman told his audience Thursday that he is the victim of an alleged extortion attempt and admitted to having sexual relations with several members of his staff, according to a press release from his production company. David Letterman admitted to having sexual relationships with female staff members, his company says. Letterman made the announcement during taping of the ""Late Show."" ""This morning, I did something I've never done in my life,"" Letterman told his audience, according to a release from Worldwide Pants Inc. ""I had to go downtown and testify before a grand jury."" The 62-year-old funnyman said he received a package three weeks ago from a person who claimed to have information about Letterman's sexual dalliances, ultimately demanding $2 million to prevent public revelation. Letterman said he went to the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which conducted an investigation, and an arrest was made earlier Thursday. In his grand jury testimony, Letterman said, he revealed the relations with members of his staff. ""My response to that is, yes I have,"" he said. ""Would it be embarrassing if it were made public? Perhaps it would. I feel like I need to protect these people -- I need to certainly protect my family."" It is not known when the sexual encounters with staffers took place. Letterman married long-time partner Regina Lasko in March. The couple, who have been together since 1986, have a son, Harry, 6. Letterman has been host of ""Late Show with David Letterman"" on CBS since 1993 after leaving NBC, where he was host of ""Late Night with David Letterman"" for 11 years. ""Late Show"" airs at 11:30 p.m. ""Late Night"" aired an hour later.","Letterman tells audience he is the victim of an extortion attempt .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to actress Maria Bello's sexuality, perhaps the best way to describe it is ""whatever."" As the 46-year-old actress reveals in a first-person column for the New York Times, she's been romantically involved with her female best friend -- but considers the father of her 12-year-old son, Jack, her partner as well. The ""Prisoners"" star, who's spent the past 20-plus years appearing in a variety of films and TV shows, from ""ER"" to ""Coyote Ugly,"" says in the column that maybe the true ""modern family is just a more honest family,"" and that her truth is that she's fallen in love with her friend, Clare. ""My feelings about attachment and partnership have always been that they are fluid and evolving,"" Bello writes in the New York Times. ""Jack's father, Dan, will always be my partner because we share Jack. Dan is the best father and the most wonderful man I've known. Just because our relationship is nonsexual doesn't make him any less of a partner. ... And Clare will always be my partner because she is also my best friend."" And yet, a few years ago, Bello realized that her feelings for Clare moved beyond friendship. Those feelings also ""aren't the same as the butterflies-in-the-stomach, angst-ridden love I have felt before,"" Bello writes. ""They are much deeper than that."" But as she came to this realization and embarked on a ""long, painful, wonderful process of trying to figure out what our relationship was supposed to be,"" there were two questions that immediately came to mind. ""First, how would it affect my son? He trusted Clare. He loved her. He had never met most of the men I had been in love with and had no idea I had been with a woman as well,"" Bello says. ""Second, how would it affect my career? I have never defined myself by whom I slept with, but I know others have and would."" Indeed, Bello admits that she was somewhat scared about how her revelation would be perceived, especially by her adolescent son. But, as she recounts in the column, her fears were unfounded. After she opened up to Jack that she was in a romantic relationship with Clare, a woman who's like a godmother to him, he responded, ""Mom, love is love, whatever you are."" Bello has taken her son's words to heart, and concluded that she ""would like to consider myself a 'whatever,' as Jackson said. Whomever I love, however I love them, whether they sleep in my bed or not, or whether I do homework with them or share a child with them, 'love is love.' And I love our modern family.""","Maria Bello came out in a December 1 New York Times column .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The wife of Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant filed for divorce Friday, eight years after she famously stuck by him after he admitted having sex with a woman at a Colorado hotel, a court spokeswoman said. Vanessa Bryant cited ""irreconcilable differences"" as her reason for filing the divorce petition Friday, Orange County, California, Superior Court spokeswoman Gwen Vieau told CNN. The two have been married for 10 Â½ years. The couple have two daughters together, ages 8 and 5. Calls made Friday night to Kobe Bryant's agent were not immediately returned. Their marriage came into the public spotlight after a 19-year-old desk clerk at a Vail-area resort hotel told police that Kobe Bryant had sexually assaulted her on June 30, 2003. Eagle County District Attorney Mark Hurlbert filed charges against Bryant about three weeks later, on July 18. Later that evening, Vanessa Bryant sat by her husband's side as he publicly apologized to her while admitting that he'd had sex with the 19-year-old, an encounter he said was consensual. Turning to his wife, Bryant said, ""You're a piece of my heart. You're the air I breathe. And you're the strongest person I know. And I'm so sorry for having to put you through this, for having to put our family through this."" Criminal charges against Bryant were dismissed in September 2004. He settled a federal lawsuit with his accuser in March 2005, days before he was scheduled to be deposed in the case, his attorney Pamela Mackey said at the time. His legal woes cost him some high-profile endorsement deals, including one with McDonald's. But he re-signed with the Lakers in 2004 and again in 2010, for a total of over $200 million. Sports Illustrated -- like CNN, a division of Time Warner -- reported in June that Bryant, 33, earns an estimated $34.8 million annually, ranking him sixth on the magazine's list of the top-grossing athletes in sports. He also found more success on the court, including winning an MVP award in 2008 and leading the Lakers to NBA championships in 2009 and 2010. After a protracted labor dispute that prompted the NBA to trim its regular season to 66 games, the Lakers' team captain is scheduled to play in next Monday's preseason opener against the Los Angeles Clippers at the Staples Center.","Vanessa Bryant cites ""irreconcilable differences,"" a court spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- The job ad listed the many unusual requirements for director of operations -- and still, a few dozen people answered it and set up video interviews: . -- Must be able to work 135-plus hours a week, it said. -- Must working standing up for most hours, often overnight. -- No breaks. -- Eating depends on when the ""associate"" eats. -- Able to manage 10 to 15 projects at one time. (There are many, many more tough demands on time, emotions and mental skills.) -- And the work for Rehtom Inc. (there's the first clue) is pro bono. Yes, for free. The job sounds impossible. But the people behind the ad say billions of people do it every day. If you go to the online version of the job ad, there is a link that goes to a video for #WorldsToughestJob, a Mother's Day campaign on the American Greetings Card Store. The video is a reminder that a mother's ""impact is endless. And so is her job description,"" American Greetings says on the website. As you might guess, when the interviewer discusses the unique requirements for the job, many a head is shaken and words like ""crazy"" and ""insane"" are dispersed. Eventually, there is the reveal of the true job title -- mom -- and the sentimental among us have to brush away the tears as the tributes to moms flow. The video had been viewed through YouTube more than 4 million times since it was posted Monday. Andrea Mileskiewicz, an associate creative director for Boston-based Mullen, the advertising agency behind the spot, said that because Mother's Day is such an important day for American Greetings, her team went in with big goals. ""The topic of mom is so heartfelt and so relatable, and we just wanted to make a video that inspired meaningful connections,"" she said. ""We're incredibly pleased with how people are connecting with it."" She shared some details about how the ad came to be. Mileskiewicz went home to Michigan where she spent time with her brother, his wife and their newborn, the couple's second child. And, she said, it really hit home when she witnessed how hard being a mother was for her sister-in-law. When she went back to Boston, the planning for the Mother's Day campaign was just beginning. She pitched the idea that many people talk about how hard being a mother is, but actually showing it would be a different take on a holiday campaign. Mileskiewicz said as the concept took shape, a team of moms from the two companies weighed in to give it its humor and authenticity. ""They took the idea to what it's become,"" she said. So Mullen placed an ad in newspapers and online. Craigslist ads linked to a fictitious job description page. Hundreds of thousands of people saw the ad online or in the papers, but only 24 answered it. That kind of proves the point that people think the job is too tough, Mileskiewicz said. Then the Mullen team set up interviews with people who were told they would be helping evaluate the job ad by video conference. The man who described the ad to them actually was an improv actor. Some of the test group came to an office in New York while others used a webcam from home, Mileskiewicz said. Only one person actually started to see the ruse while there. The others sat through about 15 minutes of interviewing before they were let in on the real message. ""Everyone [who] came in had no idea had no idea what they were reacting to,"" Mileskiewicz said. ""All of those reactions are completely authentic."" So, will there be something similar for Father's Day? Mileskiewicz: ""All I can say is fathers are just as important, and it's something we're already excited about. So stayed tuned.""","The ad was fake, but it reminds people how hard one important person's job is .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft is going all out in an attempt to push customers to its new Windows Phone 8 operating system. All it has to do is convince people the platform is better than Google's Android and Apple's iOS. Easy, right? The company officially launched the latest version of its smartphone OS on Monday in San Francisco. The press event is part of a larger marketing blitz by Microsoft, which started last week with the rollout of its new Windows 8 OS for PCs and tablets, and its new Surface tablet, which aims to take on the iPad. Soon, you won't be able open a magazine or watch TV without seeing an ad for the new Windows products, CEO Steve Ballmer said. Big tech launches like these are piling up in the weeks leading up to the holiday shopping season. Last week, Apple announced its new iPad Mini, a fourth-generation iPad and a refreshed line of laptop and desktop computers. Google also announced news on Monday on its blog, including a new Nexus 4 handset and updates to its Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets. The devices will go on sale November 13. The company had planned to unveil the products at a large event in New York City but canceled at the last minute due to concerns about Hurricane Sandy. Secrets, once used to build anticipation ahead of these announcements, are getting harder to keep, due to leaky supply chains and forgetful employees leaving devices behind in bars. Only a few new bits of information came out of Microsoft's presentation, which featured cute kids and Jessica Alba. The attractive and colorful Windows 8 interface was shown off on large moving screens. As with the desktop version, icons are replaced by live-updating squares and rectangles, called Live Tiles, which can be customized by the user. Microsoft highlighted a handful of new features. Parents might appreciate Kid's Corner, a new limited mode for the phone that can be customized for your children. Rooms allows you to group people together and share calendars, updates or other select information with just that group. And Data Sense monitors how much of your data plan is being consumed, then optimizes your data usage so you can get more out of it. The Windows Phone 8 platform isn't just an updated version of its predecessor. Microsoft has overhauled its entire design and architecture to make it more similar to the Windows 8 operating system, so that the user experience and data are more consistent across the entire line of products. Microsoft's SkyDrive feature can be used to sync photos, videos and Office documents across multiple Windows devices. Other changes include adding support for sharing-feature near field communication, over-the-air updates and support for quad-core processors. A new smartphone operating system is nothing without some slick new devices to run it. So far Windows Phone 8 has the Nokia Lumia 920 and 820, Samsung Ativ S and HTC's Windows Phone 8X and Windows Phone 8S. The first devices designed specificially for Windows Phone 8 should be available in stores and online starting in November. Windows Phone has been around for two years, but it has yet to make a dent in a market dominated by Google and Apple. According to Strategy Analytics, Microsoft phones will only account for 4% of the smartphone market in the U.S. in 2012. The launch isn't just a big deal for Microsoft. Finnish phone maker Nokia is taking a big gamble on the Windows Phone platform too, which might be its last chance to win back smartphone customers. Nokia reigned as top cell phone company for many years, until 2007, the year the iPhone came out. Last week, the company slid off the list of top five smartphone manufacturers in the world, according to research firm IDC. Nokia is still the No. 2 phone manufacturer in the world, thanks to its booming feature phone -- or ""dumb phone"" -- sales. Microsoft has a big sales job ahead of it on Monday, explaining to consumers and businesses why this platform is a better choice than Android or iOS. The Windows ecosystem's biggest missing piece at the moment is its app selection. At Monday's event, Ballmer said that the Windows Phone app store will have 46 of the top 50 apps from other stores, and announced a slew of new apps and games for the platform including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Jetpack Joyride, Cut the Rope and Pandora (all new Windows Phone 8 users will get one year of free music, no ads). There are still only 120,000 apps in the Microsoft app store, but that number could jump in the near future. Microsoft's Build developer conference begins Tuesday at the company's main base in Redmond, Washington.","Microsoft will officially unveil its new Windows Phone 8 operating system on Monday .

"(CNN) -- By distance, the running of the bulls course in Pamplona is pretty short: just 850 meters, or half a mile. But with six, half-ton raging bulls and their menacing horns closing fast, the run can strangely seem like an eternity. An eternity of thrills, of bravery and bragging rights, and sometimes, of tragedy. The tradition of running bulls in this northern Spanish city dates back 400 years, and became known worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in his 1920s novel, ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" Nowadays the annual San Fermin festival is so popular that Pamplona's population of 200,000 can triple during the eight consecutive days of running, held from July 7 to 14, at 8 a.m. daily. Hordes of international travelers, many of them young, crowd in for a chance to watch from the barricades and balconies. Many even try their luck with the bulls. Some years ago, I was one of them. I made my only run with the bulls and like most who take part, I didn't run very far. The bulls are faster, and the runners -- now more than a thousand most days, and even more on weekends -- are densely packed. No escape . I started close to the beginning of the course, near the top of the Cuesta de Santo Domingo, the hill leading up from the bull corrals, and then dashed across city hall plaza. By the time I took cover, I couldn't even get close to the supposed safety of the wooden barricade on my right, because there were already clumps of runners packed against it. Luckily, the bulls kept going straight and didn't turn right, toward me, I kept thinking afterward. Others went further that day, among them my Spanish friend Chema. Perhaps because he's from a farming village and knows more about bulls. But for novices and others who don't know enough, there's fresh help. Just days ago, a group of American, British and Spanish bull running veterans published an e-book: ""Fiesta: How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona."" Contributors include John Hemingway, grandson of the novelist and himself an author; Jim Hollander, a Israel-based photographer for the European Pressphoto Agency who's captured images of the running for years; and Alexander Fiske-Harrison, a Briton who's fought bulls. Their collective advice goes well beyond the most important mantra -- that if you fall to the street while running -- stay down and don't move, and the bulls will likely step over you. I didn't know that rule when I ran. It's possible some others who in the past have been gored or even killed may not have known it, or heeded it. Because the instinct to get up from the street can come at the worst moment -- just as the bulls' horns arrive. There've been 15 deaths since records began in 1924, most recently in 2009 when a 27-year-old Spanish man was fatally gored in the neck. Thousands more have been injured, often hurt when falling or being pushed to the ground by frantic runners. On the first three days of running this year, 13 people have been taken to hospital, three for goring-related injuries and the rest having being hurt in falls or collisions. Of these, three were non-Spanish, including a 32-year-old man from Chicago who was gored in the right thigh, a 23-year-old from Japan and a 23-year-old man from Nottingham. Ambulances and medical teams now line the course, and the injured are usually transported quickly to hospitals staffed with surgeons experienced in operating on bull goring wounds. Seeing red . Police typically try to make the running safer by limiting the crowds inside the course, and prohibiting those who are clearly drunk or carrying objects, like cameras. Yet some see red at this spectacle. This year, animal rights groups again plan demonstrations decrying the bull running and subsequent bullfights where the animals are killed, in the afternoon. Campaigners have had success in Barcelona, where the Catalan regional parliament voted in 2010 to ban bullfights in that region, but their criticism does not seem to have dented Pamplona's event. The fiesta is an unrivaled source of revenue for the town, an intense week of tourism worth millions of dollars, and the bull running is just a small, albeit renowned, part. Pamplona's city hall says nearly 1.5 million people attended the hundreds of concerts, parades, children's activities and religious events organized around last year's celebration of the city's patron saint. Yet those eight days included just 17,813 bull runners, some of them repeat participants over several days. Since my own, short run, I've returned various times as a correspondent to cover Pamplona's big event. And one of my questions has brought an intriguing answer: some international revelers say they've never read anything by Hemingway. Not a single book, much less his novel that brought fame to this town. They've said it repeatedly, over the years, even in the shadow of the statue of Hemingway, which the town proudly erected outside the bullring. For some, the details of his passionate writing are lost. But they've picked up the gist: Pamplona, they will tell me, is a must see: this wild fiesta and this dangerous bull running.","Running of the Bulls begins this year on July 7 and is expected to attract thousands of participants .

"(CNN) -- So, that happened. Fresh on the heels of the infamous Red Wedding, Sunday's ""Game of Thrones"" served up more murderous matrimony. But, with what fans have dubbed the ""Purple Wedding,"" many of us finally got something we'd been hoping for since season one. As the loathsome King Joffrey lay on the ground doing his best impersonation of Violet Beauregarde from ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,"" one question sprung to mind after the obligatory high fives: Who did it? Certainly there is no shortage of folks who would have loved to off the sadistic, smug boy king. Here, we run down some of the key suspects and why they may have been behind the deadly deed. Let us know your theory in the comments (and, book readers, no spoilers, please!) Tyrion . He's obviously Cersei's top suspect. And it's not like he doesn't have reasons. There was no love lost between Tyrion and his nephew (remember the much-celebrated slap?) even before Joffrey went out of his way to humiliate him repeatedly, both before and after the wedding. Slicing up his gift of a rare and priceless book? Check. Wine on the head? Check. Trying to force him into a humiliating performance at the feast? Check. Was it all just too much for Tyrion? Not hard to imagine. Sansa . And then there's Tyrion's wife. Joffrey was responsible for the deaths of her father, mother and brother. And that's on top of having her publicly beaten and tossing her aside for a more politically useful marriage. (Not that she wanted anything to do with him by that point.) Sansa may be as close to an innocent as still exists in King's Landing. But what better time than Joffrey's wedding day to exact some revenge? Oberyn Martell . ""The Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."" When the Martells sent fiery warrior Oberyn to the wedding in place of his brother, Prince Doran, it was a not-so-subtle hint that they haven't forgotten, or forgiven, that Oberyn's sister, Elia, was raped and killed by Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane, who serves the Lannisters. It only took hearing a Lannister song, ""The Rains of Castamere,"" to send Oberyn into an anti-Lannister stabbing fit at a brothel. Was murdering Joffrey his plan all along? The Tyrells . The wedding was over. Margaery was a queen. But Margaery and the rest of the Tyrell family, particularly Margaery's grandmother Olenna, had no doubts about what a rotten little bastard (literally) Joffrey was. It's possible they've concocted a scheme to off Joffrey, but still press their claim for the Iron Throne now that Margaery has a crown on her head. Stannis and Melisandre . As Jaime told Joffrey, the war is not over. We assume Joffrey's transition to a lovely shade of purple was due to poisoning. But could it have been more dark magic from the Red Priestess instead? It's easy to focus on the people who were at the wedding. But we've already seen what Melisandre can do to a foe without having to be in his presence. Could this have been an otherworldly announcement that Stannis is down, but not out? Somebody else? Seriously, who doesn't have one reason or another to want Joffrey dead? Lord Varys isn't called ""The Spider"" for nothing. He's sneaky, as well as professing to be the only person in Westeros who truly wants what's best for the kingdom. He could have decided that's not Joffrey. Knight-turned-fool Ser Dontos was obviously up to something. Was this part of a plan to save Sansa and avenge his humbling by Joffrey? It's hard to imagine how Daenerys could have played a part from across the Narrow Sea. But could someone loyal to the Targaryens have made a move to weaken the Lannisters' hold on the throne? We can presume it will all become clear in time. Meanwhile, we'll make a mental note to never, ever, accept a wedding invitation in Westeros.","Sunday's ""Game of Thrones"" leaves us with a major ""whodunnit?""

"(CNN) -- If it wasn't already clear that Congress is done legislating this year, the scene inside and outside the Capitol on Wednesday illustrated that the midterm elections are in full swing. Just before the House Rules Committee began authorizing the Republican lawsuit against President Barack Obama, House Democrats gathered on the East Front steps just below the room where that hearing was to take place to unveil their ""middle class jump start"" agenda. With their dueling messages, they hoped to energize their respective political bases and propel supporters to the polls in November. The GOP decision to sue Obama over delaying the Obamacare employer mandate puts the politically-charged health care law -- an issue that motivates the most ardent GOP voters -- front and center. House Democrats argued in offering their middle class initiative that Republican priorities in Congress were skewed toward wealthy special interests at the expense of working families. Standing in front of sizable red white and blue convention-style placards with the phrases ""Women Succeed,"" ""Affordable Education"" and ""Make it in America,"" House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra tried to contrast the two political parties. ""You can either sue the president of the United States, or you can do your job here at the House of Representatives and pass laws that help the middle class and working families,"" the California Democrat said. Citing the GOP lawsuit as a factor affecting the midterms, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in a Wednesday interview in the Washington Post set an ambitious goal of picking up 25 seats in the House. Democrats would need to take back 17 seats to regain control, a feat most Democrats concede isn't likely, especially in the sixth year of Obama's presidency. That's when a president's party historically loses seats. Kohn: Dear Speaker Boehner: Do your job instead . Midterm focus for Democrats: Women . Congressional Democrats on both sides of the Capitol are directing much of their message toward women, who they view as the critical voting bloc. Obama won re-election in 2012 with support from 55% of women compared to 44% for GOP nominee Mitt Romney. In an off-year congressional election, Democrats know they can't expect the same turnout. But they're talking about child care, contraception coverage, and education to maximize their chances. Democrats unveiled their ""100 Day Action plan"" on Wednesday, pledging to hold votes on bills focusing on women, if they win back the House. Those measures would be targeted at raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay for equal work, and boosting access to early childhood education. ""Our agenda for women and families is 'When Women Succeed, America Succeeds,'"" Pelosi said. This is not just the title of our agenda. This is a statement of absolute fact. And our agenda presents a stark contrast to what the Republicans have done to roll back women's rights and limit women's opportunities."" Women's work: The GOP's glass ceiling . Dems in the Senate . In the Senate, Democrats seized on the Supreme Court's big Obamacare decision last month that employers of some for-profit companies were not required to provide insurance plans that covered contraception if they opposed on religious grounds. A Democratic bill to reverse that decision was blocked this week. But the Democratic narrative on the Supreme Court fits with what many in the party have labeled a Republican ""war on women."" Pelosi and other Democrats emphasized that decision was made by ""five men"" who were effectively dictating whether or not women could get access to contraceptives. 'Over and over again' ""This is 2014, not 1914. Most Americans thought this was settled long, long ago. But for some reason, Republicans keep dragging us back here - over and over and over again,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said. But the GOP is positioned well to retake control of the Senate in November, and top Republican leaders recognized that the issue could damage their standing among women if they didn't respond. Two female Republican senators -- Kelly Ayotte and Deborah Fischer -- wrote an editorial on Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal arguing Democrats were distorting the issue for political gain. ""Contrary to the misleading rhetoric, the Hobby Lobby ruling does not take away women's access to birth control. No employee is prohibited from purchasing any Food and Drug Administration approved drug or device, and contraception remains readily available and accessible for all women nationwide,"" the two senators wrote. Senate Republicans introduced their own counterproposal that would codify that no employer can block a woman's access to FDA-approved contraception. Hobby Lobby is the retail business that successfully appealed the contraception case. Supreme Court women lash out at birth control decision . A move to rally Republican base . As the battle over a major women's issue played out in the Senate, House Republicans took their first step to approve a lawsuit arguing Obama violated the Constitution by making changes to Obamacare on his own instead of allowing Congress to act. House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions presided over a hearing with legal experts, and insisted the GOP move to sue was not about politics, but about protecting the authority of the legislative branch. ""The separated powers between these branches are there in order to ensure that no one person would trample on the rights of others,"" the Texas Republican said. ""My fear is that our nation is currently facing the exact threat that the Constitution is designed to avoid. Branches of government have always attempted to exert their influence on other branches, but the President, in my opinion, has gone too far,"" Sessions added. But the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Louise Slaughter, wasn't buying it. The suit was being ""used to appease members of the Republican party who will not rest until President Obama is charged with articles of impeachment,"" she said. ""This is a partisan, political stunt, timed to peak in the House of Representatives in November right as the midterm elections are happening."" Motivating voters . But both sides believe the suit will motivate voters. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released Web ads on Wednesday targeting 21 Republican incumbents and challengers with this message -- ""Tell Republicans: Don't use our taxpayer dollars for your frivolous lawsuit."" As the hearing was about to start, the House GOP's campaign arm tweeted an ""urgent"" message urging supporters to sign an online petition with this: ""Stand with House Republicans as they protect your constitutional liberties and the country from continued executive abuse."" The message was another tool for the campaign committee to gather names and contract information to help solicit money to support their candidates. Despite the argument by Republican candidates that Obama and his party are failing a competency test on a range of issues from the economy to the immigration crisis at the Southwest border, Obamacare is still a foundation of their campaigns. GOP candidates are expected to run ads focusing on the health law they despise, targeting specific problems voters in their districts are experiencing with it, such as cuts to a popular Medicare program.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Four journalists are free weeks after they were captured by the Libyan military and then sentenced to jail for a year, a Libyan government spokesman said Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Tunisian government condemned Libya's alleged continuous firing of rockets at the border town of Dhiba, a Tunisian foreign ministry source told the Tunisian News Agency. Also, fighting resumed Wednesday between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi at the Dhehiba/Wazen border crossing with Tunisia, according to the Tunisian state-run news agency. Significant reinforcements joined the rebels while government troops responded with heavy artillery, the agency said. At the same time, UNICEF announced a humanitarian campaign to raise $20 million for children and women inside Libya and for nearly 800,000 refugees who have fled to neighboring countries including Tunisia. The freed journalists include two Americans: Clare Morgana Gillis, a freelancer for the Christian Science Monitor, the Atlantic and USA Today; and James Foley of GlobalPost. The others are Spanish photographer Manuel Varela, who also goes by the name Manu Brabo, and British journalist Nigel Chandler, Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said. Ibrahim said a judge released the four journalists after ordering them each to pay a $164 fine for entering the country illegally. Ibrahim didn't know if the journalists had paid the fines yet. When asked about missing South African photographer Anton Hemmerl, Ibrahim said the government isn't holding him and hasn't been able to locate him. ""We never had him with us at any stage,"" Ibrahim said. Ibrahim spoke with the four journalists after they arrived in the lobby of the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli and told them they are welcome to stay and work in Libya under a visa. South Africa's ambassador to Libya was also at the hotel trying to get any information on Hemmerl. The four freed journalists were to spend the night at the hotel Wednesday, with their rooms paid for by the Libyan government, and then be driven to the Tunisian border, Ibrahim said. Gillis, Varela and Foley were detained by pro-government forces in early April, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Once taken to the border with Tunisia, Varela will head home to Spain, the Spanish foreign ministry said in a statement. The foreign ministry declined to give any details earlier this month about Varela's situation, due to the ""discretion and prudence"" that his case demands, but Spanish media reported April 24 that he talked by phone to his parents in northern Spain and told them he was safe and being treated well. Spain still has an embassy in Tripoli, although it evacuated its personnel from the city, like many other nations, as fighting between the regime of Moammar Gadhafi and rebels intensified in late March. When asked about journalists being mistreated while in Libyan custody since violence erupted in February, Ibrahim said all journalists were treated ""fairly"" and ""as good as possible,"" but he pointed out that the country is in armed conflict, and the military didn't know for sure whether persons captured were indeed journalists. Ibrahim added that many former military personnel from Europe are now working with the rebels. Since February, the Committee to Protect Journalists has tallied more than 80 attacks on members of the news media in Libya, including four deaths and 49 detentions. Human Rights Watch and CPJ have called upon the Libyan government to account for missing journalists covering the conflict there. Meanwhile, in Tunis, the government charged that Libya's rocket-firing at Tunisia is a violation of its sovereignty and puts citizens and infrastructure at risk, even though Tripoli pledged several times not to fire in the direction of Tunisia, the foreign ministry source told the Tunisian News Agency. The Tunisian government warned of ""immediate and disastrous consequences"" to bilateral relations and said the ""serious"" attacks are likely to force Tunis to take ""severe"" measures such as reporting the violations to the U.N. secretary general in order ""to defend its territorial integrity,"" the source told the news agency. In a related matter to Libya, UNICEF issued its appeal to raise $20 million for the Libyan crisis and said more than 1 million people may have been affected by the conflict, especially as almost 800,000 Libyans have fled to Egypt, Algeria, Niger, Chad, Sudan and Tunisia, the group said in a statement Wednesday. ""Children have been deeply affected by this conflict.  Their rights to learn, to play and to express themselves have been compromised.  UNICEF and partners are working to support the community in their solidarity to create safe spaces for all Libyan children,"" Shahida Azfar, UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and north Africa, said in a statement. CNN's Michael Martinez and Al Goodman contributed to this report.","Four foreign journalists covering the Libyan conflict are released and fined .

"(CNN) -- Marriage, any good therapist will tell you, is a balancing act. For Angela and Willie Gillis, the act is easy. They've been best friends for more than 10 years, married for three. Their individual strengths balance the other's weaknesses. They credit this sense of balance with helping them lose a combined 500 pounds. ""Everyone needs that one person to help them through, to talk to and someone who will hold them accountable. That person has been my husband,"" Angela writes on her blog, WeBeatFat.com. A few days before their first wedding anniversary, Willie woke up and told his wife, ""I'm tired of being big."" He had just gotten back from visiting his newborn goddaughter and was scared he might not live long enough to see her grow up. ""For years I had been reading up on 'This is how you lose weight -- nutrition, exercise,'"" he says. ""I wanted to see if I could do it."" That was January 2011. He weighed 492 pounds. Couple's 500-pound weight loss just one success story . His wife didn't have to think long about joining him in his quest. Growing up, she never thought she had a problem. ""You know how (New Jersey) Gov. (Chris) Christie said, 'I'm the healthiest fat person'? That's how I was,"" she remembers. She was fairly active, but she loved food. If she was happy, she ate. If she was sad, she ate. If she had the best day of her life, she ate chili cheese tater tots. By January 2011, she weighed 338 pounds. Willie had recently moved to Angela's hometown of Beaumont, Texas -- a city so enamored with fried food and lazy summer days that it was named the fifth most obese city in the nation in 2012. Even in the growing population, the two felt ostracized by their size. ""It's amazing how people will look at you when you're fat,"" she says. ""We just didn't want to be those people anymore."" Memphis, most obese U.S. city, moving from fit to fat . So, her husband took out his research and created a plan. The couple started hitting the gym six days a week. At first, all they could do was walk 30 minutes on the treadmill. Slowly they increased their time, until she was running and he had walked off almost 150 pounds. In the kitchen, Angela was the expert. She loves to cook and quickly learned to make healthier versions of the couple's favorite meals. The Gillises started eating a solid breakfast of steel cut oats and fruit or veggie omelets. They packed diet-friendly frozen meals for lunch and low-calorie snacks like yogurt, carrots and apples. Dinner was -- and still is -- lean meats and vegetables. ""We haven't had fried food in two years,"" she says. That doesn't mean they don't give in to cravings on occasion. Willie used an iPhone app to track his calories and saved a few every day for a weekend treat. Angela had to continually ask herself if she was eating something because she loved it or because she just loved eating. Through it all, they kept each other accountable. ""I never wanted to come home and say, 'This is what I did today,' because I didn't want to disappoint him,"" she says. ""And he didn't want to disappoint me."" Eating out was their biggest obstacle. Even light restaurant meals can be loaded with sodium and fat. It didn't bother the Gillises to go out and not eat anything, but it bothered the people they were with. ""Most of the memories we had with our friends (were) sitting down, going out to eat,"" she remembers. ""Food is a very social thing."" They ended up isolating themselves a bit, and met new friends through their gym. They took photos of their progress, seeing a visible change each month as they weighed in. Life for the Gillises is now full of activity. She teaches spin classes at the gym and recently completed a half marathon. She's lost 200 pounds, going from a size 28 to a size 0. ""I'm stronger. I believe more. I go after things I want more. I was never, ever a risk taker, but now I take the risk,"" she says. Willie joined a local running club. He has lost 300 pounds and gained a world of self-confidence. ""A lot of people give up -- they end up quitting because they're not doing something right. You have to take what you messed up on and try to make it work for you,"" he says. ""Once you learn it, it doesn't take much to keep it going.""","Willie and Angela Gillis weighed 492 and 338 pounds respectively .

"(CNN) -- A day after a Southwest Airlines jet with 124 passengers landed at the wrong airport, many are asking: How in the world could that happen? ""It's not common, but it's not unheard of,"" said pilot Mark Weiss, a 20-year veteran of commercial aviation who has frequently flown Boeing 737-700s, the same kind of aircraft that touched down Sunday at a small airport in Taney County, Missouri, about seven miles from where it was supposed to land at Branson Airport. The plane stopped about 500 feet from the end of a runway at M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport, but no one was injured, said Chris Berndt, the Western Taney County Fire District fire chief and emergency management director. ""There are a lot of questions, and I suspect this is a matter of procedures not being followed, something along the long chain of everything you must do and constantly do as a pilot for safety,"" Weiss said. But that's little consolation for passengers shaken by the experience. ""Really happy (the) pilot applied brakes the way he did,"" said passenger Scott Schieffer. ""Who knows what would have happened?"" The airport's runway is 3,738 feet long, about half the length of the Branson Airport runway, which is 7,140 feet. That forced pilots to act fast and brake hard when the aircraft touched down. If they had not, the plane could have overshot the end of the runway, tumbled down an embankment and onto U.S. Highway 65. Air traffic controllers had cleared the jet to land at Branson and only learned of the mishap when the pilots radioed that they had landed at the wrong airport, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Branson is not equipped with radar, and Clark has no control tower. Southwest said the flight's captain had worked for the airline for 14 years and the first officer had been with the company for 12. Both were on paid leave pending an investigation, it said. The jet took off Monday from Clark after ""a thorough inspection"" and was scheduled to resume regular service in the evening. The airline did not disclose its destination, but the aviation website FlightAware said it was bound for Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""We have since reached out to each customer directly to apologize, refund their tickets and provide future travel credit as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience,"" the airline said in a written statement. Apology following landing announcement . Passenger Schieffer told CNN the flight had been late in departing Chicago's Midway International Airport on Sunday afternoon, but nothing seemed amiss. As the plane touched down on the runway, however, Schieffer said he heard and felt the brakes hit hard and smelled rubber burning. It was ""one of the hardest landings I ever experienced,"" he told CNN. Kevin Riley, who lives near the airport, said he was sitting in his living room when he heard the landing. ""I thought it was a military plane because it's so loud,"" he said. ""This airport takes small planes ... nothing to the level or volume of that plane."" ""Welcome to Branson,"" the pilot announced, Schieffer recalled. A few minutes later, the pilot came back on. ""I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, we have landed at the wrong airport,"" he said, according to Schieffer. He then repeatedly apologized to passengers who were stuck on the tarmac for two hours while steps could be brought over from Branson Airport to help them deplane. The pilots declined to talk about what happened as they left the plane, Berndt said. While waiting, Schieffer and the other passengers ate peanuts provided by flight attendants. Southwest offered them a $200 travel voucher, he said. Paper and computer . Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said Sunday night he didn't yet have enough information to say why the plane landed at the wrong location. CNN first learned of the landing error via tweets from the region. There are many questions that the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board will explore. Both agencies have launched investigations. Weiss gave insight into what investigators will be looking for in their probes. When the plane was still on the ground at Midway, the pilots would have looked at a paper flight plan on which the distance between their departing location and arriving location would have been written. That distance should have also been plugged into the cockpit computer. ""You match one thing to the other,"" he said. ""Let's say there was 503 miles on the paper. The computer in the console should have matched that distance."" That's important if the pilots end up doing what is called an instrument landing -- essentially where they rely on their instruments to assure everything is as it should be. If the equipment was correct on the ground at Midway, the instrument reading during an instrument landing would have indicated to the pilots they were descending to the wrong location. Relying on instruments is sometimes the only alternative pilots have when the weather is poor or there are other factors making visual landing difficult. When the plane landed, it was 58 degrees Fahrenheit in the area, with visibility for 10 miles and clear skies. It was a bit breezy with a south wind of about 20 mph. A checklist to mind . Regardless of particular variables, pilots should constantly be working on a checklist of safety measures. ""You back the approach (to a runway) up (consulting) all the instrumentation and validation that you have available to you,"" Weiss said. That includes scanning the horizon, looking up and down, talking to air traffic controllers, reading instruments and communicating frequently with a copilot. Some smaller airports don't have towers. The airport where the Southwest plane landed did not, but it's unclear whether air traffic controllers were in touch with the pilots. When an airplane descends, the pilot will tell the controllers, ""I have the runway in sight."" ""Once a pilot says that then the responsibility for getting that aircraft to that runway isn't a joint responsibility,"" Weiss said. ""It's the responsibility of the pilot."" Pilot Ken Hiller has been flying into both Missouri airports for a decade. He said a navigational tool called a localizer could have told the pilots that they were off. The airports have different runway numbers that would have popped up -- they are 20 degrees of difference between them. If pilots were only doing a visual landing, they might not have noticed the difference in numbers in a navigation tool. But even with all the instruments available to modern pilots, Mary Schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation told CNN that planes landing at the wrong airport aren't unusual. ""A visual landing on side-by-side airports, not far apart ... that's how it happens,"" she said Monday on CNN. ""It happens many times."" Similar incidents . Sunday night's incident brought to mind another landing at a wrong airport two months earlier. In November, a mammoth cargo plane landed at the wrong airport in Wichita, Kansas -- one that typically does not accommodate such beasts and with a runway half a mile shorter than such an aircraft usually uses. The Boeing 747 Dreamlifter was bound for McConnell Air Force Base from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. But instead of landing at the military airport on Wichita's southeast side, it landed at the much smaller, general aviation Col. James Jabara Airport on the northeast side. It eventually took off. In August 2012, a regional commuter plane landed at the wrong West Virginia airport. United Express Flight 4049, operated by Silver Airways, was supposed to fly from Morgantown to Clarksburg but landed instead at Fairmont Municipal Airport about 10 miles away. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers, Thom Patterson, Aaron Cooper, Jethro Mullen, Shawn Nottingham, Joe Sutton, Dave Alsup and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","Controllers learned plane had landed at the wrong airport when pilots radioed them, source says .

"(CNN) -- The authorities who control Kosovo may have stolen organs from prisoners of war and political rivals when the Kosovo Liberation Army was fighting Serbian forces for control of the territory, European authorities allege in a new report. ""Numerous indications seem to confirm that ... organs were removed from some prisoners ... to be taken abroad for transplantation,"" according to a draft report from the Council of Europe. Investigators have ""made progress"" toward ""proving the existence of secret KLA places of detention in northern Albania where inhuman treatment and even murders are said to have been committed,"" draft author Dick Marty says. Illegal organ trafficking continued after the war ended, the draft suggests. Nearly 1,900 people who disappeared during the conflict still have not been found, and another 500 disappeared after NATO troops arrived in June 1999, Marty says. And links between ""criminal activity"" and ""certain KLA militia leaders ... has continued, albeit in other forms, until today,"" he report charges. Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of Kosovo is one of the founders of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The report names him as the ""boss"" of a prominent faction in the militia that ""apparently wrested control"" of ""illicit criminal enterprises"" from rivals across the border in Albania. His office refused to comment on the allegations. Kosovo's government called the report ""defamatory"" and ""mendacious,"" saying the allegations ""have been constructed to damage the image of Kosovo and the Kosovo Liberation Army."" Kosovo's acting President Jakup Krasniqi -- a Thaci ally -- expressed deep indignation about the report, saying it was ""nothing but fabricated and irresponsible statements."" Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said it was ""based on no facts, evidence or reality. Thus it proves political line of the author, who flagrantly abuses the authority of the Council of Europe."" European Union officials in Kosovo said that anyone with concrete evidence of war crimes or organized crime should come forward. ""The mission is already investigating and prosecuting a number of cases related to war crimes and organized crimes,"" spokesman Blerim Krasniqi said. On Thursday, the report will be debated by a committee of the Council of Europe, an organization with 47 member countries that seeks to promote democracy and human rights. The council's parliament plans to debate it in January. The report is based partially on investigations by European Union officials and was written by Dick Marty for the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights. Investigators are not getting enough cooperation from either Albania or Kosovo, the report adds. Kosovo's majority population is ethnic Albanian. Serbs are the minority. The KLA was backed by NATO bombing when it fought for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s. Kosovo has made it ""complicated"" to dig for missing bodies, and Albania has refused to allow it, Marty says, adding: ""Serbia ultimately cooperated."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday, ""We are very seriously concerned about the published information."" He was appearing in a joint news conference in Moscow with Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic. The report from the Council of Europe -- which is separate from the European Union -- was prompted partly by allegations made in a book in 2008. Carla Del Ponte, the former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, leveled the accusation in her memoir ""Madame Prosecutor."" The court opened an investigation into the allegations but dropped it, the Council of Europe said, without explaining why. Evidence has since been destroyed, Marty's draft says. He acknowledges the chaotic situation in Kosovo after the war but also criticizes the international community for tending to see Serbs as aggressors and Kosovars as victims. ""The reality is less clear-cut and more complex,"" Marty writes. But the international authorities who took control after the 1999 war felt that they ""needed to promote short-term stability at any price, thereby sacrificing some important principles of justice."" Kosovo was a province of Serbia but declared independence in 2008. About 70 countries have recognized the declaration, but Serbia does not, and international organizations including the United Nations and European Union continue to have administrators in Kosovo.

"Washington (CNN) -- Just nine months into his tenure as Secretary of State, John Kerry successfully delivered an interim deal with Iran on its nuclear program. It is the most significant level of cooperation between the United States and the Iranians in decades and it could impact the remainder of his tenure. While the deal that also includes other world powers has been panned by Israel -- one of the biggest U.S. allies in the region -- and some members of Congress, Kerry has praised it as a good first step. ""We believe very strongly that because the Iranian nuclear program is actually set backwards and is actually locked into place in critical places, that that is better for Israel than if you were just continuing to go down the road and they rush towards a nuclear weapon,"" Kerry said in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Related: Iran reaches nuclear deal with world leaders - now what? The leg work . On Iran, Kerry did not have to start from zero. A series of events helped to shape the outcome. Talks with Iran hit a high point in 2009 when it and the United States reached a tentative agreement for Tehran to export three quarters of its nuclear stockpile. But the Iranians walked away, according to Robert Einhorn, a former State Department official involved in Iran negotiations. Stalled talks led to strict sanctions that economically hurt Iran. And in June, Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a pragmatist, won the Iranian presidency. Related: President Barack Obama's legacy moment on Iran . A senior administration official confirmed that since the election, U.S. and Iranian officials have been holding private, previously secret discussions to generate ideas for the wider nuclear negotiations. The dÃ©tente climaxed in a telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Rouhani in September during the United Nations General Assembly - the highest contact between leaders of the two countries since the Islamic revolution that led to the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. After that phone call, President Barack Obama ordered Kerry to restart talks. But Kerry's involvement in the negotiations quietly began even before he was named Secretary of State at the beginning of this year. While chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he became a player in the stalled -- and secret -- negotiations. The White House realized that the government of Oman could play a critical role in talks with Iran. So Kerry made an unannounced trip to Oman to talk to Omani officials about Iran to see if they were interested in helping facilitate a dialogue between the U.S. and Iran. The resume . Kerry's career is steeped in foreign policy. As a decorated Vietnam veteran, he protested the war and testified before the Senate Foreign Relations committee about it. He later chaired the panel during his nearly three-decade Senate career. Kerry immersed himself in details of world affairs, including Iran and its nuclear program. He served on the committee when President George W. Bush refused to negotiate with the Iranians in 2003 and in 2010, when Congress and the Obama administration ramped up economic sanctions. In succeeding Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, Kerry hit the ground running. Related: One agreement, wildly different reactions . He has already logged more than 200,000 miles, rivaling Clinton, who was the most-traveled Secretary of State. ""In general, Kerry is more of an activist in terms of negotiations,"" Einhorn said. Related: Meet the American 'badass' leading negotiations with Iran . Accomplishments . Kerry's enthusiastic attitude toward negotiations has yielded significant success. When Obama was on the verge of a military strike against Syria, Kerry spearheaded the U.S. side of negotiations involving Russia to turn Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons over to international control. The Syria and Iranian agreements in the volatile Mideast are notable. ""I think Kerry came in determined to pursue diplomacy,"" Einhorn said. A sign of the future? Still, the accord with Iran is only an interim deal to last six months. The real work begins now on a broader, long term agreement. That's going to be a real test for Kerry and the Obama administration. ""We're in the first stage of a long and difficult road,"" said Suzenne Maloney, senior fellow, at the Brookings Institution. As for the rest of the region, Michele Dunne, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Iran issue is a silo and not connected to other issues in the region, especially the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Related: Deal may define Barack Obama's legacy, for better of worse . Kerry came into office determined to make progress on the Mideast Peace Process. While Israel is fuming about the Iran deal, calling it a ""historic mistake,"" Dunne said ""the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations already were not moving forward."" If Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu uses the Iran deal as a reason to not engage in peace talks, Dunne said it would make little difference because the talks ""were not that meaningful in the first place."" While he's had some success, he still has a challenging road ahead.

He was also known for his roles in movies and on the stage, as a producer and as a Grammy Award-winning gospel singer. Officials, stars and fans react to the death of Andy Griffith . ""North Carolina has lost its favorite son,"" Gov. Beverly Perdue said. ""Throughout his career, he represented everything that was good about North Carolina: a small town boy and UNC graduate who took a light-hearted approach to some of the attributes he grew up with and turned them into a spectacularly successful career,"" she said. ""And regardless of where that career took him, he always came back to North Carolina and spent his final years here."" Actor and director Ron Howard, who played Griffith's son, Opie Taylor, on ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" said he is ""forever grateful"" to the actor. ""His pursuit of excellence and the joy he took in creating served generations & shaped my life,"" Howard said on Twitter. President Barack Obama also noted Griffith's death, saying the actor had ""warmed the hearts of Americans everywhere."" ""A performer of extraordinary talent, Andy was beloved by generations of fans and revered by entertainers who followed in his footsteps,"" Obama said. President George W. Bush honored Griffith in 2005 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for ""demonstrating the finest qualities of our country and for a lifetime of memorable performances that have brought joy to millions of Americans of all ages."" A member of the Televison Hall of Fame, Griffith also was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. His 1996 album, ""I Love to Tell the Story -- 25 Timeless Hymns,"" netted him a Grammy Award. Born in Mount Airy, North Carolina, in 1926, Griffith graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1949 with a degree in music. He originally wanted to be a preacher, he told American Profile magazine in a 2005 piece. ""I went to the bishop and said, 'Can I major in music and still be a minister?' and he said no,"" the magazine quoted him as saying. ""I went back and prayed over it for a couple of weeks, and I went back to the bishop and said, 'I'm going to major in music.' So that was it."" White House mourns the death of Andy Griffith . After teaching high school music for a few years, he began his entertainment career with a traveling act with his first wife, Barbara Edwards, according to biography.com. After regular appearances on ""The Ed Sullivan Show,"" Griffith appeared in the 1955 Broadway play ""No Time for Sergeants,"" for which he received a Tony nomination. He later appeared in a film version of the play. He was again nominated for a Tony in 1960 for the play ""Destry Rides Again."" He made his film debut in the critically acclaimed ""A Face in the Crowd,"" but it was the 1960 debut of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" that brought his greatest fame. In the show, Griffith played the amiable sheriff of an small, idyllic town modeled on his own birthplace of Mount Airy. The gentle comedy continues to be broadcast and retains a following, including ""Rerun Watchers Club"" chapters around the country and on Facebook. After his eight-year run as Taylor, the actor tried to break out of his mold as a genial father figure with mixed success. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived . ""I wanted to prove that I could play something else, but there were 249 episodes out there of 'Mayberry,' and it was aired every day. It was hard to escape,"" Griffith said, according to a quote on IMDb. A 2010 role in a television commercial for the Department of Health and Human Resources generated some political controversy. In the commercial, Griffith praised the Affordable Care Act and its reforms. Department officials said the ad was meant to educate the public, but congressional Republicans said it was partisan propaganda and demanded that it be pulled. Griffith came down with the muscular disease Guillain-Barre syndrome in 1983, according to biography.com, but made a full recovery. In 2000, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery, and had hip surgery following a fall in 2007, according to his IMDb profile. Griffith's first marriage ended in divorce in 1972. He married again in 1976 but divorced after five years, according to biography.com. In 1983, he married Cindi Knight, his current wife.

"(CNN) -- Before he came to this country in summer 1964, my father never could have envisioned the tradition he would create in America. He came here from Louth Village, County Louth, in the midlands of Ireland to follow my mother, who had come here on a job search. My father stumbled upon the horse and carriages on Central Park South and hit the jackpot. He was a third-generation blacksmith and went to work immediately as the stable hand and blacksmith to the carriage trade. He would work all day, fixing problems with the carriages and then shoeing horses. The stable owner allowed him to drive a carriage on weekends to earn extra pay. He worked like this until 1967, when he purchased his first carriage. This is the origin of my family tradition. The horse and carriages have put the bread and butter on my family's table since 1967 and I intend on keeping it that way for years to come. The iconic carriage industry is a big part of what makes New York special. We are a gateway to enjoying the city, providing a slow-paced tour of Central Park, the greatest park in the world. We carry visitors from all over, providing them with a memory that lasts a lifetime. In my 26 years driving a carriage, I have participated in hundreds and hundreds of engagements, weddings, anniversaries, proms, birthdays, movies, TV commercials and sitcoms -- and provide a special moment for all my regular customers. I am the proud owner of two draft horses -- Tyson, an 11-year-old Morgan and Percheron cross, and Jokinson, a 7-year-old Percheron mare. Tyson is my ""lead"" horse, which means he is my best horse. Draft horses such as mine and the others used in the carriage trade have been born and bred, for centuries, to pull loads. Opposite view: Ban New York's horse-drawn carriage rides . On average, my horses work alternate days, so they generally work three to four days a week. I have owned many horses in my 26 years in the business and have never been involved in an accident nor have any of my horses been seriously injured. The horses that pull the carriages are treated exceedingly well. The stables themselves are open to inspection 365 days a year. The Department of Health inspects them four times a year, and the New York Fire Department conducts an inspection at least once a year. Every horse gets checkups from a licensed New York state veterinarian and a minimum of five weeks out of the city to pasture. If a horse goes across state lines he must be seen by a vet before leaving and before returning. Our industry wants transparency when it comes to our horse care. We welcome it. In 2010, the Carriage Operators of North America invited Harry Werner, an equine veterinarian and former head of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, to check out the horses' working and living environments in New York. He says he and other veterinarians paid their own way and found clean stalls, excellent veterinary care and food, and no inhumane conditions or neglect. He told The New York Times recently that the ""demeanor of the horses was, to a one, that of a contented horse."" There are 68 licensed carriages, 220 licensed horses and about 300 licensed drivers, of which 160 are employed. The carriage industry has 144 pages of regulations that cover everything from where we can operate to how much insurance we should carry. The industry is monitored by five agencies: the ASPCA, Health Department, Mounted Police division of the NYPD, Department of Consumer Affairs and the Parks Department. On January 1, the new mayor of New York was sworn in to office determined to end my beloved industry, one that is also loved by New Yorkers and people all over the world. Mayor Bill de Blasio believes there is no place in New York City for horse drawn carriages and wants to replace them with antique-style cars. He says the business is inhumane, but has flat-out refused to see how the horses are treated or meet with the men and women who work with them. Members of Teamsters Local 553 union have extended an open invitation to him and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to visit and see for themselves how the industry works, and to this date they have declined. There are horse and carriage rides available in many U.S. cities: Chicago, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Salt Lake City, Honolulu, Boston and Charleston, South Carolina, are just a few. Horse people around the world are watching to see what happens here in the next few months. Banning the practice in New York could set a precedent that would put hundreds of people out of work. I will fight the ban. We have a legitimate, thriving, well-regulated industry. It is 99% walk-up: People love the chance to get up close and pet a beautiful horse in an urban environment. The horse is the star. That special experience can't be replaced with an electric car. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Malone.","Stephen Malone's carriage business goes back to his dad, who came from Ireland .

"(CNN) -- As many as 5,000 people may have passed recently through a Missouri restaurant where an employee with hepatitis A worked while possibly contagious, health officials said Wednesday. Red Robin said the employee last worked on May 16 and that the restaurant has been deemed safe after an inspection by the Springfield-Greene County Health Department. The New Jersey-based restaurant chain didn't say in what area of the restaurant the employee worked but told diners who ate there between May 8 and 16 to call the health department for information about what to do next. ""It scared me because my husband has been sick,"" Andrea Hall, a Red Robin customer, told CNN affiliate KOLR. ""And a lot of his symptoms of his matched. A red flag just went off and I was like what do I do from here."" Hepatitis A is usually transmitted via contaminated food or water, or by someone who's infected, according to the Mayo Clinic. Frequent handwashing is recommended to limit the spread. The highly contagious infection inflames the liver, limiting its ability to function. While mild cases don't require treatment and the Mayo Clinic says most of those infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage, severe cases can lead to liver failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. Health officials in Springfield said symptoms include fever, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine and clay-colored bowel movements. Vaccination center set up . All workers at the Red Robin have since been innoculated with a immune globulin prophylaxis shot, the restaurant chain said. The health department will run a two-day vaccination clinic at Remington's, a venue that hosts concerts and trade shows. On its Facebook page, the entertainment complex said 4,000 doses of a vaccine were being shipped there. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the incubation period for hepatitis A is between 15 and 50 days. The CDC says on its website that immune globulin offers protection for about three months for people who get the shot pre- or post-exposure. But the shot needs to be given within two weeks of exposure for maximum protection. Many people already have been given a two-step vaccine, which was introduced in the United States in 1995. The CDC estimates that 17,000 people contract hepatitis A each year. CNN affiliate KYTV reported that thousands more customers might have been exposed to the virus because the infected employee worked for Red Robin for several months. They should watch for symptoms, the station said. Hepatitis A scare at NYC restaurant prompts 239 to get vaccinated .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Adm. William Fallon has resigned as chief of U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia after more than a year in the post, citing what he called an inaccurate perception that he is at odds with the Bush administration over Iran. Adm. William Fallon had been serving as chief of U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia since 2007. Fallon, the head of U.S. Central Command, was the subject of a recent Esquire magazine profile that portrayed him as resisting pressure for military action against Iran, which the Bush administration accuses of trying to develop nuclear weapons. In a written statement, he said the article's ""disrespect for the president"" and ""resulting embarrassment"" have become a distraction. ""Although I don't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command area of responsibility, the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America's interests there,"" Fallon said. In Washington, Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters at the Pentagon that he accepted Fallon's resignation ""with reluctance and regret."" But, he added, ""I think it's the right decision.""  Watch why some believe Fallon was forced to resign » . ""Admiral Fallon reached this difficult decision entirely on his own. I believe it was the right thing to do, even though I do not believe there are in fact significant differences between his views and administration policy,"" Gates said. In a written statement, President Bush praised Fallon for helping ""ensure that America's military forces are ready to meet the threats of an often troubled region of the world. ""He deserves considerable credit for progress that has been made there, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan."" Fallon, a 41-year veteran of the Navy, took over as chief of Central Command in early 2007. Gates said he will be replaced by Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey, his deputy, who commanded an Army division in Iraq in the early days of the war and led efforts to train the Iraqi military. The perception that Fallon has opposed a drive toward military action against Iran from within the Bush administration dates to his confirmation hearings in January 2007, when he told the Senate that the United States needed to exhaust all diplomatic options in its disputes with the Islamic republic. But he also has said that the United States would be able to take steps if Tehran were to attempt to block the Strait of Hormuz, the outlet of the Persian Gulf and a choke point for much of the world's oil. And he recently told CNN that the United States is looking for a peaceful settlement to disputes ""in every case."" ""We're trying to encourage dialogue and find resolution,"" he said. ""In fact, that's our message to the Iranians out here, given that everybody is nervous and anxious about their activities, is to come forth and explain what they are doing with all the people in the region."" On Tuesday, Gates said, ""We have tried between us to put this misperception behind us over a period of months and, frankly, just have not been successful in doing so."" But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Fallon's resignation showed that independent views ""are not welcomed in this administration."" ""It is also a sign that the administration is blind to the growing costs and consequences of the Iraq war, which has so damaged America's security interests in the Middle East and beyond,"" said Reid, D-Nevada. ""Democrats will continue to examine these matters very closely in the coming weeks and months."" Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain offered words of praise for Fallon. ""Under Adm. Fallon's leadership at Central Command, the situation in Iraq has improved dramatically,"" McCain said in a statement. ""All Americans should be grateful for Adm. Fallon's service and respect his decision to retire."" Gates' spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said Monday that the secretary and the admiral still had ""a good working relationship"" and that the Esquire article -- ""The Man Between War and Peace"" -- had not changed that. He said Gates had read the article and had no comment on it. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- U.S. lawmakers considering the closure of the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention center will probably be looking at a rehabilitation program in Saudi Arabia that focuses on religious re-education for captured jihadists. Ahmed, who took part in a bombing mission in Iraq, said he was a ""wiser man"" after taking part in the program. President Obama issued executive orders relating to Guantanamo last week, including one requiring that the detention facility at a U.S. Naval base in Cuba be closed within a year. Now some analysts are asking not only whether intelligence agencies will be able to get the information they need to keep America safe but where the prisoners will eventually end up. The answer to the second part of this question may lie partly in the Saudi rehab program that analysts in that country say has helped deal a big blow to al Qaeda. Since the 2003 bombings in Riyadh that killed dozens there have been no major attacks in the kingdom, they point out. Libya is using a similar philosophy of religious re-education, moving away from brutal treatment of militants in jails, and Pakistan is also looking at it. The program focuses on religious re-education for young men, all in their late teens to early 30s, captured while engaged in terrorist activities. Of the 218 people who have taken part, only nine have since been rearrested after trying to rejoin al Qaeda, Saudi officials told CNN. ""We have reduced the threat but cannot say we have eliminated it,"" said interior ministry spokesman Gen. Mansoor al Turki. ""Such a re-education program will help the police to make sure these people get rid of the ideology that penetrated their brains [and to] make sure, when they leave prison, [they] can lead [a] normal life."" The key to the government-run scheme's success is the way it uses imams, or religious teachers, to explain to the young, radicalized Muslims that not everyone can issue a fatwa. It tells them that what they have been taught previously is wrong: You cannot just go and kill someone. In an al Qaeda cell, one person will issue a fatwa to justify whatever violent action the group will take, but the rehabilitation program makes clear that to issue a fatwa you must be a well-trained, experienced imam. One young man who had been through the program said he had learned his lesson. Ahmed, who admitted driving a truck that exploded in Iraq, killing 12 people, said he had been brain-washed by al Qaeda militants. ""They told me Americans kill Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan ... and they brainwash me. ... They said it's the honorable thing to do to go fight Americans."" Ahmed said that he was just a regular Muslim before he was radicalized but that the program had taught him the error of his ways, and now, ""I will never think about the jihad again."" ""My message to all young people: If you are in Iraq, leave and come back home and ask governments and elders about religion. Don't do what these bad people tell you to do. Everyone makes mistakes. ""I used to hate Americans. Now it's different. Thank God I am a wiser man and I know right from wrong. In the program, they taught me killing a person -- Muslim or non-Muslim -- is wrong even if he gets in my way. You should help people, not hurt them."" The program came about after the Saudi government recognized that locking up the young radicalized Muslims and mistreating them in jail was counterproductive and served only to foment anger in the Islamic world. Reformed jihadists said Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin, for example, the al Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia who was killed in 2004, was angry about his treatment in jail. So officials realized that a better way to deal with the threat of radicalized Muslims was to rehabilitate them. ""It's not easy just to take the behavior or the person with behavior or bad behavior and put him in jail,"" said psychologist Turki Al-Otayan. ""How about his thoughts? How about his emotions? That's why we have the advisory committee to correct the cognitive things and the emotional things."" Al-Otayan said that if the program did not exist, the young men would easily revert to their old ways. ""If we leave them, someone will take our job like the terrorists or the mujahadeen. ... They will pass them money."" He said he was convinced that the program had greatly cut the number of young Muslims traveling to Iraq to carry out jihad. Officials realize that it will never be 100 percent successful, and it is labor-intensive and expensive, but it may very well be among the approaches that U.S. officials will consider as they work out how to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and rehabilitate the 700 or so prisoners.","U.S. looking at how to close Guantanamo Bay detention center .

"(CNN) -- Woodpecker. Spider species. Nuclear particle. For anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, the varied list of namesakes keeps growing. In July last year, just in time for his birthday, scientists named a prehistoric woodpecker after him, adding to the many tributes for South Africa's first black president. The woodpecker, officially named Australopicus nelsonmandelai, was unveiled by scientists at a fossil site on the nation's southwest coast. Thousands of miles away, Mandela's name is on yet another unusual item: an apartment in a British sitcom. The apartment in ""Only Fools and Horses"" was called Nelson Mandela house. The main characters in the sitcom, which was broadcast for decades until early 2000s, lived in the house. Years earlier, a British university named a nuclear particle after him. The 'Mandela particle' got its honor in 1973 from the physics institute at Leeds University. And the list goes on. And on, according to the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory. There's the orchid, 'Paravanda Nelson Mandela,"" named after him during his 1997 visit to the botanical garden in Singapore. And the ""Escape from Robin Island"" computer game with him as a hero who breaks away from the island to free his daughter. In Argentina, there was a racing horse named ""Mandela"" in 1971, when he was languishing in prison after a life sentence for sabotage. Mandela was sentenced to 27 years in 1964 for his fight against the apartheid government in South Africa. The frail icon has battled health issues in recent months, and is hospitalized in serious but stable condition in Pretoria for a recurring lung infection. With advancing age and bouts of illness, Mandela has retreated to a quiet life, but still retains a special place in the nation's consciousness. But as he has faded away from public life, the accolades kept coming. Worldwide, there are buildings, streets, parks, postage stamps, even flowers named after him.","A woodpecker is officially named Australopicus nelsonmandelai .

"(CNN) -- Eighteen-year-old Susan El-Baneh and her husband of three weeks died holding hands, her brother said, victims of a terrorist attack Wednesday on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. American citizen Susan El-Baneh, 18, and her Yemeni husband of less than a month were killed in the attack. The Lackawanna, New York, native, a high school senior, had gone to the Arabian Peninsula country a month ago for an arranged marriage. She and her husband were in the waiting area of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, trying to find out the procedure to bring her spouse back to the United States. Susan El-Baneh was the only American killed in the attack. Some of El-Baneh's family members, who had traveled from Lackawanna with her for the wedding, heard the blasts of the coordinated terrorist attack echo through the city's walls. When they called to find out what happened, the relatives were told that 16 people, including the attackers, had been killed, her brother Ahmed El-Baneh told CNN on Thursday. Among them were an unidentified man and his wife. Susan El-Baneh's uncle rushed to the hospital to see the bodies. ""He just knew it was them,"" Ahmed El-Baneh said. The couple was still holding hands, he said. Officials said al Qaeda-linked insurgents disguised as Yemeni forces bombed the outer wall of the embassy, and snipers opened fire on first responders heading toward the scene.  Watch the aftermath of the embassy attack » . Susan El-Baneh had traveled to Yemen 30 days earlier with younger brother and mother, who gave her away during the wedding. ""She was so excited, so happy to be getting married,"" Ahmed El-Baneh said. ""She was going to go there and try and bring her new husband back to the United States after paperwork was done and then complete her last year of high school."" Ahmed El-Baneh said he spoke to his sister about the wedding two weeks ago. ""And for the first time in my life I told my sister I loved her,"" he said. The woman's family had thrown her a shower before she left for Yemen on August 17, and she couldn't have been more excited about the wedding, her brother said. ""It was like you have to, you have to do this,"" he said. ""The wedding was going to be so wonderful. There wasn't any -- you aren't going to be invited -- the whole village was there."" Susan El-Baneh probably was going to come back to the United States in December, her brother said, or whenever the paperwork for her new husband was cleared. She planned to finish her final year at Lackawanna High School and then go on to study to be a nurse. ""She was a very outgoing person, and she did anything to help out her family,"" her brother said. ""On top of that she was taking advantage of the times now when a Muslim lady can go to work, doing what they want, not just being housewives. She was going to get her education and be successful."" Lackawanna High School principal Peter Hazzan told CNN affiliate WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York, that grief counselors met with students Wednesday. ""The news hit hard today. It was devastating for many of the Arab-American students,"" Hazzan told WIVB. ""Many of them are still grieving, and many were actually sent home."" El-Baneh's wedding was a source of pride for her family as they celebrated the holy month of Ramadan, a time in which Muslims believe the Quran was revealed and presented to the Prophet Mohammed. ""But if you die in the month of Ramadan, you go straight to heaven, and that is where my sister will be,"" Ahmed El-Baneh said. ""But anyone that did this cowardly act, they will go straight to hell."" Susan El-Baneh is related to Yemeni-American Jaber El-Baneh, who is on the FBI's most-wanted list, accused of being the seventh member of the Lackawanna Six. The six were convicted or providing material support to al Qaeda. El-Baneh confirmed the relation but preferred to talk about his sister and how the attack proved anyone can be the target of a terrorist act. ""It touches everyone no matter who you are,"" he said. Muslims are supposed to be peaceful, he said, and those who committed the attack on the embassy in Yemen only smear that view. ""They say they do this for a cause, but there is no cause,"" he said. ""A cause is when you sit down and talk, not when you kill millions and millions of people, now including my sister among them. What is the cause for that?""","Susan El-Baneh went to Yemen a month ago for an arranged marriage .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Security forces in Bahrain stormed the main hospital, beating doctors, and attacked demonstrators in Manama's Pearl Roundabout on Wednesday, witnesses in the Bahraini capital said. Bahraini officials deny these accounts. Demonstrators reported hearing steady rounds of ammunition being fired while thick smoke rose from the Pearl Roundabout area. At least five helicopters whirred above the historic landmark, which has been a rallying spot for anti-government demonstrators in recent weeks. In a statement Wednesday, Bahrain's government said that as police approached the roundabout, they were attacked by protesters -- whom they call ""saboteurs"" -- who threw Molotov cocktails at them. Police dispersed the protesters with tear gas, as protesters set fire to tents and trash cans on their way out, the government said. According to the government, no live ammunition was used, and the only fatalities were two police officers who were repeatedly run over by three vehicles driven by protesters. Three arrests were made, an interior ministry spokesman said. The crackdown comes a day after Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency and two days after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dispatched troops to the Persian Gulf island nation to ""protect the safety of citizens,"" the Bahraini government said. The clashes prompted Iran to recall its ambassador to Bahrain in what an Iranian government statement called a protest against ""the killing of people of Bahrain by their government."" Bahrain's Sunni Muslim monarchy has long suspected Iran of attempting to foment unrest among the island's majority-Shiite population, leaked U.S. diplomatic documents show, and Iran has asserted territorial claims over the onetime Persian province both before and after the 1979 revolution brought the current Islamic republic to power . Speaking in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the intervention by Bahrain's neighbors ""alarming"" and urged all players in the region to keep ""their own agenda"" out of the struggle. Washington has told the Bahraini monarchy that ""there is no answer to the demands for political and economic reform though a security crackdown,"" Clinton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. And President Barack Obama called both the Saudi and Bahraini kings to express his ""deep concern over violence"" and the need for ""maximum restraint,"" according to White House spokesman Jay Carney. Bahrain is home to the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, the naval arm of American power in the region. Cell phone networks in several areas were disrupted. Security forces blocked highways leading to the capital and formed a ring around the country's main hospital, Salmaniya Medical Complex, not letting people enter or leave, witnesses said. Security forces then stormed the hospital and beat staffers, several doctors there said. Doctors have been hiding in rooms, said Yousif Sharaf, a doctor at the hospital. ""We are trapped,"" Sharaf said. ""We are asking for the security forces to please stay outside the hospital. They are beating the staff."" Fatima Haji, another doctor, also said she was trapped in the hospital. ""We are in a small group hiding,"" Haji said, her voice rising with emotion. ""This is a government hospital. How can this happen in a government hospital?"" Haji said two people had died in the hospital Wednesday morning, and she feared for the other patients there because the doctors were not able to work. Eventually, the army told hospital workers that they could leave, but they had to give their names and have their pictures taken, Haji said. Some of her colleagues were taken to the gates and beaten, she said. CNN could not independently confirm the doctors' claims. The Bahraini government expelled CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom from the country Wednesday without explanation. Reporting from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Jamjoom said two Bahraini information ministers came to his hotel and told him that the rest of the CNN crew was welcome to stay, but he was not. ""I was then escorted to the airport and made to leave the country,"" Jamjoom said. Jamjoom said he and others were woken by the sound of gunfire Wednesday morning. ""We could see thick black plumes of smoke. We could see tear gas being dispersed,"" Jamjoom said. ""It was a very, very violent scene from where we were looking on it."" Calls made to various hospitals turned up multiple accounts of witnesses being attacked, including medical staff and doctors, Jamjoom said. On state-run television, a banner read, ""Official source: Media allegations that medical care is being denied to patients are baseless."" Dr. Nazar Al Baharna, Bahrain's minister of health, resigned later in the day. He did not elaborate on the reason why. Officials at another private hospital, Salmany Hospital, also said they were being besieged by troops. It was unclear whether the attacks were carried out solely by Bahraini forces or included foreign troops who arrived in the country earlier in the week to help quell the demonstrations. The Bahraini government denied the allegations and said foreign troops had been dispatched to secure specific installations, not participate in the crackdown. A curfew was in effect from 4 p.m. Wednesday to 4 a.m. Thursday in various parts of the capital, the foreign ministry said. Meanwhile, the U.K. Foreign Office announced Wednesday that the British Embassy in Bahrain was closed until further notice. A day earlier, security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in the southern city of Sitra. At least two protesters were killed, and at least 150 people were wounded, according to medical officials on the scene. The protests started February 14 and are part of a series of demonstrations that have swept across the Arab world this year, toppling the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt. In Bahrain, moderates have been demanding a constitutional monarchy, and hard-liners have called for the abolition of the countries' royal family altogether. The king's decree mandates that security forces should ""take the measures and procedures necessary to preserve the safety of the nation and its people,""  a government statement said. ""King Hamad's decree does not give the authorities a blank check to commit abuses,"" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Daniel Ricciardo drove the race of his young life to secure an unlikely victory for Red Bull Sunday in an incident-packed Hungarian Grand Prix which saw Lewis Hamilton ignore Mercedes team orders to let title leader Nico Rosberg through. Australia's Ricciardo overtook two-time world champion Fernando Alonso of Ferrari for the lead on lap 68 of 70 at the Hungaroring for his second victory of the season. Lewis Hamilton claimed the final podium spot after starting from the pit lane and spinning off the track on the first lap with Rosberg in fourth place. But the intense rivalry between the pair reached a head when Hamilton refused to allow Rosberg through at a crucial stage of the race. The German, who made one more pit stop than his teammate, showed his impatience on race radio. ""Why is he not letting me through,"" he complained. Hamilton countered by saying Rosberg had not been close enough. ""I'll let him through if he gets closer,"" he said. ""I'm not slowing down for Nico..."" The 2008 world champion's stubborness looked set to be rewarded by a remarkable victory as he closed on Alonso, whose own tires were losing their grip. But Ricciardo, who won earlier this season in Canada, was the fastest off all the front runners and first went past Hamilton before surging clear of Alonso. Rosberg, who still leads the championship from Hamilton by 11 points, was making up about three seconds per lap on the top three after his stop for new tires, but his charge came too late. Hamilton, whose challenge was so nearly over on the opening lap, was helped by the safety car being deployed twice as drivers crashed out on a wet but drying track. The first safety car disadvantaged Rosberg, who looked impregnable in first place after starting from pole. Ricciardo was among those who were able to switch to slick tires at that point, while Rosberg had to wait an extra lap and lost position. ""It feels as good as the first win, it really does,"" said Ricciardo at the trophy presentation. ""The safety car at first played to our advantage but the second one didn't really help us, but we got there in the end and I had to do the overtaking at the end which was fun."" Felipe Massa for Williams and Kimi Raikkonen in the second Ferrari showed their experience by finishing fifth and sixth with four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel took seventh, again overshadowed by his young Red Bull teammate Ricciardo. Vettel was the last driver to start from the pit lane and take a podium spot in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix of 2012 and Hamilton was delighted to emulate him after a fire in his engine wrecked his qualifying effort on Saturday. ""It's been a crazy weekend,"" he said. ""The car has been fantastic but there were a lot of points lost this weekend. The brakes were very, very cold (at the start) and I was gone but I got going again and managed to push on from there."" But the ramifications of his refusal to follow team orders is set to rumble on with Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff telling gathered reporters there would be an internal inquiry, but ""no knee-jerk reaction.""","Daniel Ricciardo wins Hungarian Grand Prix for Red Bull .

"Qunu, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans celebrated Nelson Mandela's 94th birthday Wednesday by participating in good deeds nationwide to honor the legacy of the famous statesman. The frail icon has not appeared in public for years, but he is celebrated worldwide on his birthday for his role in reconciling a country torn apart by apartheid. In South Africa, citizens performed at least 67 minutes of public service on his birthday, a reference to the number of years he devoted to helping others. In Mandela's childhood village of Qunu, relatives, including children and grandchildren, gathered to mark his birthday and perform community service at the local health centers. The family will get together for a meal that will include a champagne toast -- which the ailing Mandela cannot partake in -- and his favorite dish of tripe, a meat delicacy. A life in pictures: Nelson Mandela at 94 . A day before his birthday, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, had lunch with Mandela in the small southeastern village where he grew up and spends most of his time. A quiet but smiling Mandela, wearing a beige cardigan in the cool temperatures, sat at the head of the table as he shared a meal with the Clintons on Tuesday. A picture of the two leaders walking down a dusty path with their arms around each other sat nearby. Clinton, whose presidential term coincided with Mandela's, hailed him as a ""wonderful friend"" and planted a tree in his honor during the visit. Bill Clinton on Nelson Mandela . ""He didn't call me a single time, not once, when he didn't ask about Hillary (Clinton) and Chelsea,"" Clinton said of their conversations during their time in office. ""If it wasn't too late, he'd ask me to go get Chelsea, bring her to the phone, ask about her homework."" Clinton said the anti-apartheid icon never lost touch with his humanity. ""I saw in him something that I try not to lose in myself, which is no matter how much responsibility you have, he remembered you were a person first,"" he said. Musical tribute to Mandela . In addition to public service, South Africans held various activities to honor a man credited with helping bring together a nation deeply divided by apartheid. About 14 million students sang ""Happy Birthday"" in unison nationwide before they started their lessons. World leaders also paid tribute to his legacy. U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, described him as committed to democracy, saying his accomplishments changed South Africa and the world. ""Nelson Mandela's personal story is one of unbreakable will, unwavering integrity, and abiding humility,"" Obama said in a statement. ""... By any measure, Nelson Mandela has changed the arc of history, transforming his country, continent and the world."" Mandela, a Nobel peace laureate, spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of minorities in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed from prison. Despite his rare appearances, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. The former president has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup held in South Africa. He spends his time resting and gets round-the-clock care after abdominal surgery this year and a bout with an acute respiratory infection the year before.

"New York (CNN) -- In a move intended to better track criminal suspects, New York City's finest are now photographing the eyes of those they haul in. Adding eye scans to a list of police identification methods that include mug shots and fingerprinting, New York rolled out a fleet of new iris scanners in an initiative announced earlier this week, city officials said. The new measures are part of an effort to improve security and safeguard identities, said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. ""It's a big, complex system,"" Kelly said. ""We want to make sure it's the right person when they get in front of the judge, so this is a common sense way to do that."" Police turned to scanners after two recent incidents in which prisoners escaped using false identities. Upon arrest, suspects now will be required to look directly into binocular-like devices that photograph the iris -- the circular diaphragm forming the colored portion of the eye -- and store the image in a police database. When the suspect appears in court, police will match the scan to see whether the image corresponds with records in the system, Kelly said. But the tiny cameras are drawing opposition from civil liberties groups who call the new police measures excessive. ""The police department is hitting a fly with a sledgehammer,"" said Steven Banks, attorney in chief of the city's Legal Aid Society. ""There's been an extensive legislative debate in New York state in which the legislature only permits the police department to collect DNA evidence in certain kinds of cases. So it's incumbent upon the police department not to find a whole new technology and then forge ahead without any legislative authority."" Proponents of the devices say the new initiative falls within existing identification measures. ""We are authorized to take pictures,"" Kelly said. ""This is just a picture of your iris. ... We're matching that iris to see if you're the same individual. Our lawyers say we don't need any mandate to do it."" Twenty-one machines will be set up throughout the city, Kelly said, which includes scanners employed in Manhattan earlier this week. Police put the price tag at $500,000, paid for through a U.S. Department of Homeland Security grant, which raises the question whether the device could be potentially used an anti-terrorism tool. ""That's not our intention here, but it has potential,"" Kelly said. ""Just like all technology has potential for growth, for innovation, for development,"" he added. ""But right now, this is simply a process to help us better identify someone and prevent us from making mistakes.""","New York City rolled out a fleet of new iris scanners in a police initiative announced this week .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's presidential candidate, Prabowo Subianto, who slammed the country's election commission and rejected the official results of the vote held earlier this month, appears poised to launch a legal challenge. A member of Prabowo's legal team said they plan to file a complaint against the election commission at the Constitutional Court on Friday. The court has until August 21 to make a ruling. His opponent, Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo, won Indonesia's presidential race with 53% of the votes over Prabowo's 47%, the country's election commission announced on Tuesday. Hours before the release of the voting results from ballots cast on July 9, Prabowo criticized the election commission, citing what he called ""massive, structural and systematic cheating."" In his speech carried live, he declared: ""We withdraw ourselves from the process."" His statement drew confusion and uncertainty. But on Wednesday, his brother and business tycoon Hashim Djojohadikusumo said, ""Let me be clear, Prabowo never withdrew as a candidate for president."" He said they would have accepted the results, whether the former lieutenant-general won or not, if they believed the vote count was fair. ""We continue to have grave concerns about the integrity of the electoral process in a number of provinces,"" his brother said. ""An estimated 52,000 polling stations have reported irregularities, putting an estimated 21 million votes in question. The indication of massive fraud and widespread irregularities is overwhelming."" Congratulations for Jokowi . Meanwhile, congratulations from the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and other nations poured in for Indonesia's president-elect. Widely known as ""Jokowi,"" he has drawn comparisons to Barack Obama for his unlikely ascent, from growing up in humble origins to becoming a national politician. On Tuesday, he delivered a speech aboard a traditional Indonesian boat, calling for national unity in the world's most populous Muslim nation. ""I ask you to heal your relations within your family, with neighbor to neighbor and with friends that were once broken."" The new president will be inaugurated on October 20.

"(CNN) -- It's been in continuous production since the 1950s but Volkswagen Brazil -- the last country where the vehicles were still being made -- ceases production of the classic Kombi van today, the last day of 2013. Rolling off the production lines in Hanover, Germany, until 1979 but continuing in Brazil, the VW Transporter, aka the camper van, is the longest-produced model in automotive history, according to Vokswagen. Around 3.5 million of the affordable, utilitarian vehicles, with their classic cloth window curtains, have been made. Attaching themselves to the mini-homes on wheels were equally numerous roof racks, surfboards and travel memories. On a backpacking trip to Europe back in 1973, a 20-year-old Californian named Gary Garfield shelled out US$700 to set himself up for the months of travel ahead. He spent a chunk of that money on a 1967 Volkswagen minibus, wanting to combine transportation and accommodation in one slightly rickety but reliable vehicle. He ripped out the seats, put in a platform bed and installed shelves and cupboards. Garfield spent the next 10 months in this mobile home with his wife battling desert sands in Algeria, food poisoning in Tunisia and enduring six-week stints with no contact with friends or family. Similar stories are told by countless other travelers. VW is calling it quits because the Kombi won't meet new safety standards set to come into force next year in Brazil. Upgrading the van with dual front airbags and anti-lock brakes was ruled too costly. Come next year, old Kombis sluggishly powering their way along highways and up mountain passes, being overtaken by virtually all other traffic, will be all that remain -- ageing steel bodies from a time when people were less concerned about getting somewhere fast. It's worth pausing to reflect on what made the Kombi a travel icon. Hippies and surfers . The Kombi became synonymous in the 1960s and 1970s with hippies and surfers, its utilitarian features -- capable of carrying surf boards, musical equipment and various loads inside or on its roof -- combining well with its cheap price (secondhand Kombis could be picked up for a couple hundred bucks) and easy maintenance. Garfield's van required the repair of one flat tire and a new battery in 10 months of travel. Many people named their Kombis, like iReporter Jason Kauffman, 40, who affectionately called his Kombi ""Double D."" ""I have no desire to own anything except an old VW,"" Kauffman insists. Other iReporters named their vans ""Bus Gus,"" ""Homer,"" ""Claire"" and ""Charlotte."" Vince Moellering, 32, explains, ""Cars like the VW van are more than just cars, they're cultural icons."" Those who traveled in one in their youth keep the memories with them. Others own their van (or vans) for decades before passing them to offspring. Even people without ""VW lineage,"" as iReporter Bryan Scott calls it, can find themselves bitten by the urge to up and travel in a Kombi. Second life online . Online communities provide space to share stories and trade ""ideas that help keep our vans going,"" says Moellering. Australia's Kombi Club is an online forum co-founded and sponsored by The Bus Stop, a parts distributor. ""Roy"" from The Bus Stop says the business supplies Kombi enthusiasts in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and Canada and other countries. ""Once you've driven a Kombi, you're hooked for life,"" he says. But why? After all, these VW vans, at least in their original form, are underpowered, slow, have dodgy suspension and don't offer much comfort in either heat or cold. ""The Kombi exemplifies the free spirit of peace activists, lovers, world travelers, campers and families moving about together across this planet,"" says Garfield. ""Few vehicles scream: 'Let's go exploring!' the way a VW van does,"" says Moellering. Modern modification . Simplicity has helped the Kombi remain relevant in a new century. It's undergone plenty of modifications, but its outward appearance remains instantly recognizable. The model produced in Brazil was based on the second phase of the Type 2 (VW's Type 1 was the Beetle), which was produced in Germany from 1967--1979. It differed from the first phase with a larger engine, greater weight and a bay window, rather than the previous model's split-windscreen. Numerous iterations have brought speed and body width increases, automatic transmission and an engine switch from air- to water-cooled. It's not a complicated machine -- handy when something goes wrong. Kombi owner Bryan Scott says part of the VW's appeal to him was, ""We'd always heard [they] could be fixed anywhere and by anyone."" Jason Kauffman says the Kombi's enduring appeal comes down to versatility: ""You can travel in it, sleep in it, it gets decent fuel mileage and it's very compact compared to large motor homes."" Vince Moellering applauds the Kombi as a jack of all trades, saying he's used his ""as a camper, a mountain bike hauler, a moving van and a construction supply truck."" German effectiveness . The versatility of a Kombi goes right back to its name, which comes from the German ""Kombinationskraftwagen,"" a combination of passenger and cargo vehicle. Its ability to carry both passengers and piles of stuff has made the Kombi more than a mode of transport. ""The bus is both our home and a member of our family,"" says Bryan Scott. ""We talk to it as we decide a path for each day, coax it slowly over the next hill and thank it as we arrive at each new destination."" The vehicle is also a great conversation starter. ""VWs are [like] a language understood throughout the world,"" says Jason Kauffman. ""People in each country we visit love the bus -- they stop to tell us their stories and ask to hear ours,"" says Scott. Not the end of the road . Devotion to the Kombi helps loyalists remain upbeat about the end of production. ""As long as enthusiastic owners keep the remaining cars and their spirit alive, the end of active production won't mean the end of the vehicle,"" says Moellering. When Gary Garfield completed his 1973 tour in the bus that had served him so reliably, he sold it for a $100 profit. Then he ""watched it drive away to offer its new owner's fond memories."" Even though the factory gates have shut, well-preserved Kombis will keep rumbling along the road and in the recollections of 63 years of travelers.

"Washington (CNN) -- On the day he shot President Ronald Reagan, 25-year-old John Hinckley Jr. left in his hotel room a letter addressed to young actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was infatuated. The letter began: . ""Dear Jodie. There is a definite possibility I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan."" See letters Hinckley sent to Foster . But on March 30, 1981, Hinckley survived. His gun empty after he fired six shots at the president in less than two seconds, Hinckley was tackled by police and Secret Service agents. He was rushed away and all but disappeared into custody for the past three decades. On Wednesday, a federal judge will begin a week and half of hearings on whether Hinckley eventually should be released from the mental hospital where he has been a patient since his 1982 trial ended in a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Doctors at St. Elizabeth Hospital, a federal mental facility in Washington, have petitioned the court for approval to grant Hinckley convalescent leave if all goes well in series of extended visits to his mother's home. Hinckley is now 56, his hair turning gray. In the last court hearing two years ago, U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman acknowledged hospital doctors' testimony that his mental problems were in remission. The court has steadily granted Hinckley greater freedoms over the years. The government's response for the hearing describes Hinckley as ""a man capable of great violence"" and argues that there are still concerns ""that this violence may be repeated."" His mother, JoAnn Hinckley, a widow who is now 85 but in good health, lives in a gated resort development near the James River in historic Williamsburg, Virginia. Hinckley has been allowed several visits in recent years. A next-door neighbor, signing as T. Richardson, wrote a month ago in a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, The Virginia Gazette, that upon moving in during the 1980s, Mrs. Hinckley phoned to say that ""They would never bring John to Williamsburg."" Yet, the letter writer said, Hinckley had been allowed to roam the streets alone on long walks during those recent visits. Hinckley's proposed release, the writer concluded, ""is not terribly reassuring to me living next door."" Much of the eight-day hearing will involve contrasting testimony from psychiatrists on either side, as did Hinckley's trial. Hinckley did not testify then, and whether he will do so this time remains in dispute. The U.S. attorney's office has told the judge that if Hinckley does take the stand at the hearing, it wants the right to question him. Hinckley's lawyer, Barry S. Levine, replied that Hinckley will testify only if the judge does not allow any cross-examination. The hospital motion for Hinckley's eventual release was filed under seal, unavailable to the public. However, in answering that, the government said the motion proposes a series of eight new visits of 17 to 24 days each to Hinckley's mother's home. After that, the government said, the hospital wants ""the sole discretion to place Hinckley on convalescent leave"" and to do so ""without any further review by this court."" No immediate decision is expected during the court hearing. In the past, the judge has taken some time before issuing a written ruling. Hinckley came within an inch of killing Reagan: That's how close the last bullet came to penetrating the president's heart. The president lost half his blood supply as his left lung was flooded. Had the Secret Service not gotten Reagan to a hospital within minutes, doctors said, he might well have died. Watch agent show where bullets struck the presidential limo . Hinckley wounded a police officer, a Secret Service agent and Press Secretary James Brady before his sixth and final shot ricocheted off the presidential limousine and struck Reagan beneath his left armpit as agents shoved him into the back seat of the vehicle. Brady, shot in the head, survived against the odds but was so severely injured he was never able to return to his White House duties. Hinckley had left numerous letters and notes for Foster, a freshman at Yale University, after seeing her in a breakthrough role as a child prostitute in the movie ""Taxi Driver."" One of his last notes, shoved under her dorm door a few weeks before he shot Reagan, echoed a line from that movie: ""Just wait. I'll rescue you soon."" The day after the shooting, Foster said she did not even know who Hinckley was.","Letter by mother's neighbor expresses unease about possible release .

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 29 students at a college in Nigeria are dead Tuesday after an attack authorities suspect was carried out by Boko Haram Islamists, according to the Nigerian military. The attackers also torched several buildings, the military said. ""There were burnt bodies of students who cannot be easily identified,"" State Police Commissioner Sanusi Rafai said. The attack happened at a federal college in Buni Yadi, near the the capital of Yobe state. It came three days after President Goodluck Jonathan sent his top military chiefs to the northeastern part of the country to try to put down the violence there. The attackers escaped from the scene, military spokesman Capt. Eli Lazarus said.

"(CNN) -- The promoter for famed Filipino fighter Manny Pacquiao says he expects to swiftly resolve a dispute with the country's tax authorities that have led to the boxer's assets being frozen in his homeland. The 34-year-old Pacquiao, who is also a second-term Philippines congressman, announced Tuesday his domestic bank accounts had been frozen, along with his wife's, over allegations he had evaded paying $50 million in taxes on highly-paid bouts in the United States. The move has prevented the boxer from following through on a pledge to help victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan on the back of his comeback win over American Brandon Rios in Macau over the weekend. Pacquiao dedicated his victory to those affected by the disaster, tweeting after the fight: ""Yesterday's victory wasn't about my comeback but a symbol of my people's comeback from a natural disaster and a human tragedy."" The fighter told reporters in his hometown, General Santos City, that he had paid the correct taxes in the United States, and was not required to pay additional tax in the Philippines under a treaty preventing double taxation. ""I am not a criminal or a thief,"" he said. ""The money ... is not stolen... This came from all of the punches, beatings, blood and sweat that I endured in the ring."" Pacquiao's promoter, Bob Arum of Las Vegas-based Top Rank, said in a statement that Pacquiao had paid the necessary taxes to the United States government from the period under scrutiny, which included Pacquiao's boxing heyday from 2008-9. ""Filipino authorities confirmed that Manny is not required to pay double tax,"" he said. He said Top Rank had paid monies owed from Pacquiao's earnings -- 30% of fight purses -- to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) via electronic funds transfer (EFT), and had submitted copies of deposit acknowledgments to the Philippines Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as proof of payment. But the tax authorities had rejected the documents as proof. ""The BIR received the documents but directed Manny to obtain 'certified' documents directly from the IRS itself,"" he said. ""As I am sure people appreciate, obtaining certified copies of documents from the IRS takes time. Manny made the formal request to the IRS and we have every expectation that the necessary documents will be furnished to the BIR very soon."" Pacquiao's unanimous points victory over Rios was seen as reviving his career following a knock-out loss to Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez in December 2012. The win in Macau raised spirits in the Philippines, where thousands of fans in the city of Tacloban, one of the hardest struck cities, gathered to watch the fight in public spaces.","Filipino boxer Pacquiao has had his assets in his homeland frozen .

"London (CNN) -- Charles Dickens is one of the world's best-loved writers, whose books -- and the countless film and TV adaptations they inspire -- still keep readers (and viewers) on the edge of their seats. Now, 200 years on from his birth, his genius is to be feted with a host of events marking the bicentenary of one of Britain's most famous sons. Dickens 2012 will see everything from readings to royal visits, celebrating the man who gave the world ""Oliver Twist,"" ""David Copperfield"" and ""Great Expectations."" In London, the special events will begin with a celebrity performance, by actors Simon Callow and Joanna Lumley, at the Dickens family's graves in Highgate Cemetery on Monday. And on Tuesday, the anniversary of Dickens' birth, the Prince of Wales will lay a wreath at Dickens' grave in Poet's Corner, Westminster Abbey, while actor Ralph Fiennes, Dickens' biographer Claire Tomalin and the author's great-great-grandson, Mark Dickens give readings. There are more commemorations planned across the country, and around the world, so what is Dickens' secret? And why, above all others, is his work still revered, so many years after his death? Clare Pettitt, Dickens specialist at King's College London, puts his continued popularity down to his modernity. ""Everybody says this about absolutely every author ever, but Dickens really was a peculiarly modern writer, very attuned to what was new; he was writing at the beginning of the industrial revolution which, effectively, we are still in. ""He would have been fascinated by Twitter, for example -- he loved the telegraph, the railways, all sorts of modern communications technology, he was very 'on the button'."" Adrian Wootton, co-director of the Dickens 2012 celebrations, insists that almost 150 years after his death, the ""Oliver Twist"" author still has something to say: ""Dickens is not some fusty historical figure, but still an ultra-relevant, dynamic innovator. ""He rewrote the style, form and substance of the novel; changed the process and dissemination of the printed word; wrote the way a camera saw before film had ever been invented, and he remains the most cinematic of writers."" ""A critic of the young Dickens once said the writer 'would go up like a rocket and come down like a stick,'"" said Florian Schweizer, director of the Charles Dickens Museum. ""In 2012, one thing seems to be sure: That rocket will not come down again. ""175 years after he first shot to fame at the age of 25, Charles Dickens continues to be regarded as one of the world's finest authors and storytellers, and one of the most influential figures Britain has ever produced."" But the Dickens 2012 celebrations are not limited to the UK -- and fittingly so. ""Dickens' fame and appeal spreads well beyond Britain,"" says Pettitt. ""He has huge global reach, well beyond the bounds of this island -- he's been taken up by Bollywood, set in the south seas, in 'Mr Pip,' and on and on."" The bicentenary will kick off in Australia, with the first part of a 24-hour Dickens read-a-thon to be staged in 24 countries across the world, from Albania to Zimbabwe, with readings from ""Oliver Twist"" in India, and ""A Christmas Carol"" in Kazakhstan. Susie Nicklin, director of literature at the British Council, which has organized the event, agreed such a worldwide celebration was truly appropriate, given Dickens' international fame -- and his passion for performing. ""Reading aloud -- bringing characters to life -- was a crucial part of Dickens' life,"" she said, adding that the event would be a ""truly global homage to a great British literary giant."" And while many of the festivities are centered on February 7, others will be much longer-lasting. One of the biggest commemorations of Dickens and his works in 2012 is the Dickens and London exhibition at the Museum of London (until June 10), which celebrates the author's links with the city, and explores how it inspired so many of his novels. It features items from Dickens' own life -- including the desk he wrote at, his bank ledger, and the manuscripts for some of his most popular novels -- alongside items evoking life in London in the 19th century, from playbills, pub signs and theatre costumes to heartbreaking evidence of the extreme poverty Dickens knew well from his own childhood. London's other big draw for Dickens fans, the Charles Dickens Museum, housed in his former home, is -- perhaps surprisingly -- to close for a large part of the bicentennial year, as part of a major refurbishment program, but it is expected to reopen just in time for Christmas 2012, when a further round of Dickens celebrations are planned.","Several events planned to mark bicentenary of birth of Charles Dickens .

"(CNN) -- Let the naming and shaming begin. China will start to point the finger at its top ten most air-polluted cities -- each and every month -- in the hopes that national humiliation will push positive environmental action. A parallel list of the nation's ten cities with best air qualities will also be published. Beijing's political -- and very public -- pressure on its most polluted cities comes within a year of the capital reporting its worst air quality levels in recorded history and an Asian Development Bank study showing seven of the world's top ten most air-polluted cities were in China. ""We must put air quality control as an ecological red line for economic management and social development,"" said China's Vice Premier Zhang Gao Li, in a statement. On Wednesday, he announced the new policy at the 18th Air Pollution Control Conference in Beijing. ""Air pollution control is a long, arduous and complex mission. We need to highlight the control of major polluted cities and strengthen the reduction and management of various polluters,"" added Zhang. Chinese officials did not say when the first list would be announced, but the northern megacities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as the surrounding provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shandong have signed onto an official plan to speed up air pollution control measures. This past August, an official environmental assessment found these six regions to be China's most polluted. ""I think the policy is a very good inspirational mechanism, especially for those cities on the 'shaming' list, so that they can work to get off the list quicker,"" said Huang Wei, Climate and Energy Campaigner at Greenpeace China, to CNN. ""However, it is not enough to rank those cities. It's also important to control energy, especially coal consumption. Some cities didn't clarify how much they are going to reduce their coal consumption. The lack of a number makes us worried that there won't be any dramatic change in terms of air quality."" Earlier this month, the central government said it would stop approving coal-fired power plants in more heavily polluted industrial areas. It also announced a national blueprint to lower the concentration of harmful particles in the air -- much of it caused by the burning of coal -- by at least 10% between 2012 and 2017 levels. In heavily polluted areas, including China's north, targets will be more stringent. Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, all signatories to this week's new air pollution control plan, aim to cut particles by 25%. In southern China's Pearl River Delta, across the border from Hong Kong, the goal is 15%. ""We know high-ranking officials really want to tackle the (air pollution) problem but in reality how much does this help?"" said Sum Yin Kwong, CEO of the Clean Air Network in Hong Kong, to CNN. ""It all might be more symbolic because when you look at the regional or local level, growth is measured by GDP, not by how environmental the city has become. I'm not too optimistic,"" added Kwong. China is the world's largest consumer of coal by volume and will continue to be for years, relying on the fossil fuel for 70-80% of its energy needs, according to various experts and the World Coal Association. Much of that energy goes towards electricity for factories and for winter heating. Beijing says it hopes to reduce the nation's coal consumption to 65% by 2017. In comparison, Australia draws about 75% of its electricity from coal, according to the Australian Coal Association. The United States generated 37% of its electricity from coal in 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. As people in China have grown wealthier, they have increased demands on the government for a cleaner environment. This past July, a landmark study by Chinese and international academics revealed that severe pollution and toxic air slashed an average of five and a half years of life expectancy for residents of northern China. According to a recent Greenpeace report, 83,500 people died prematurely in 2011 from respiratory diseases in Shandong, Inner Mongolia and Shanxi -- China's top three coal-consuming provinces.","China to name and shame top ten worst-polluting cities each month .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Diplomatic wheels turned Tuesday as much of the international community prepared to welcome -- and help support -- a new government in Ukraine. ""The United Nations is committed to assist a Ukrainian-led, accountable and inclusive governance process, in a spirit of non-violence and upholding the key principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, thereby creating a conducive environment for free and fair elections,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters in New York. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon sent a senior adviser, Robert Serry, to Kiev, where he met with senior officials and pledged the world body's commitment. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said U.S. officials were ""deeply engaged in trying to help this extraordinary transition that is taking place in Ukraine."" In a joint news conference with British Foreign Secretary William Hague, Kerry said Ukraine's alliances should not necessarily determine what happens to its people. ""It is not a Russia or the United States or other choices,"" he said. ""This is about people of Ukraine and Ukrainians making their choice about their future. And we want to work with Russia, with other countries, with everybody available to make sure this is peaceful from this day forward."" Their comments came as Acting President Oleksandr Turchinov told parliament Tuesday that an interim unity government in Ukraine would be appointed Thursday, raising the specter of continued instability here in the wake of the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych. At the same session, parliament voted to ask the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands to investigate the ""illegal actions of the main members of the government"" -- including Yanukovych. But the ICC public affairs unit said in an e-mail that it had received no communication regarding Ukraine and that the ICC has no jurisdiction over that country, because it is not a state party to the Rome Statute, the court's founding treaty. In addition, it said, a state cannot ask the ICC to investigate specific individuals. In the parliamentary session Tuesday, lawmakers also voted to hold mayoral and city council elections on May 25, concurrent with presidential elections. One candidate has already been announced. Opposition leader and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko will run for the presidency, his press secretary Oksana Zinovyeva told CNN. A dramatic sequence of political upheaval has unfolded in Ukraine in recent days after months of anti-government protests. Last week, bloody street clashes between demonstrators and security forces left more than 80 dead, the deadliest violence in the country since it gained independence when the Soviet Union collapsed 22 years ago. The violence continued Tuesday, when an ex-presidential aide, Andriy Klyuev, was hospitalized after being shot in the leg, his press secretary, Artem Petrenko, told CNN. Amid the unrest, the United States has sent a team of Marines to the U.S. Embassy in Kiev to beef up security, an American official said. The request was made by the State Department and approved by the Pentagon. Last week, parliament ousted Yanukovych, the focus of protesters' anger, and authorities issued a warrant for his arrest over civilian deaths. But his whereabouts were unknown. Lawmakers appointed Turchinov to serve as acting President and fired several of Yanukovych's ministers. On Monday, parliament named a new chief prosecutor, security service chief and central bank head. Those now in power in the capital face a raft of challenges: the division between the country's east and west; protesters eager for bigger changes in government; an economy riddled with corruption; and how to handle the intentions of Russia, a vital supplier of natural gas and a key backer of Yanukovych. 'We were trapped': Eyewitness to massacre in Kiev . Leadership change . The head of Ukraine's electoral commission, Konstantin Khivrenko, said the campaign to elect a new president would begin Tuesday, three months before the May 25 election date set by authorities. But Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized those elections Monday, saying Ukraine's parliament was acting rashly, and accused lawmakers of discriminating against ethnic Russians, most of whom live in the eastern part of the country -- near the border with Russia -- by excluding them from the reform process. ""A course has been set for suppressing those who disagree in different regions of Ukraine with methods of dictatorship and terror,"" the Foreign Ministry said. Russia -- which pried Ukraine away from the European Union with a $15 billion loan in November -- has withdrawn that offer, and President Vladimir Putin's role in the formation of a new government was uncertain. Russia contends that Yanukovych was driven out by an ""armed mutiny"" of extremists and terrorists. ""We have not only the internal enemies, but we have the external enemies, like Russia,"" member of parliament Lesya Orobets told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday from Kiev. ""We are afraid of military intervention, and Putin is trying to find a pretext for that."" Russia's foreign minister has vowed not to intervene militarily, but tension is high between pro-Russian and pro-European Ukrainians. Clashes have broken out in the Crimea region on the Black Sea. Orobets said one of Ukraine's biggest challenges is getting its financial house in order. ""We have to make unpopular steps, and we have to have this government taking those steps,"" Orobets said. ""Not just to have financial aid, but to have the plan of reforms to get outside of this economic crisis."" ""This is not just the issue of Ukraine. This is the issue of the whole region's stability."" Winners and losers . East-west divide . Yanukovych's decision to scrap a European Union trade deal in favor of one with Russia prompted the protests, which began in November. The country's new leaders have said Kiev's return to European integration will be a priority. But in doing so, they risk an end to the aid that the Kremlin had bestowed on Yanukovych. Interim Finance Minister Yury Kolobov proposed Monday that an international donor conference be held within two weeks. Ukraine, he said, will need $35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew spoke Sunday with Arseniy Yatsenyuk, of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's Batkivschina, or Fatherland, party, and told him that once a transitional government has been established, an International Monetary Fund-centered international aid package would have broad support, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev said in a posting on its website. ""Secretary Lew expressed that the United States, together with Europe and others in the international community, are ready to supplement an IMF program to cushion the impact of reforms on low-income Ukrainians,"" it said. ""However, Secretary Lew underscored the need to implement reforms that could be supported by an IMF program."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Tuesday warned the United States and European Union against turning Ukraine against its neighbor. ""The relationship is not always developing in constructive ways. We have confirmed our position of not intervening in Ukraine politics,"" he said. ""We hope all channels will be used to calm the situation in Ukraine."" Lavrov said Russia was working with EU officials in Brussels, Belgium. ""It is not a good position to impose to Ukraine that 'either you are with us or without us.' But we hope it will become our full partner in the near future,"" he added. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso appealed Tuesday ""to all our international partners, in particular Russia, to work constructively with us to guarantee a united Ukraine that can be a factor for stability in the European continent; a Ukraine that will have good relations both with its western as with its eastern partners."" 'People want to be united' Yanukovych's base of support is in eastern Ukraine, where Russian culture and language predominate and where many people are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of their counterparts in western Ukraine, who were at the heart of the protests against Yanukovych that filled central Kiev for months. Yanukovych insisted in a televised address over the weekend that he was still the legitimate President. But many senior Ukrainian officials appeared to be turning their backs on their former leader. Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Yuriy Sergeyev told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that Yanukovych and his government had ""betrayed"" the Ukrainian people. But Sergeyev said the country is not as divided as some observers suggest. ""They don't want any civil war; people want to be united,"" he said. The old guard . Yanukovych's ouster was followed by the release over the weekend of Tymoshenko, one of his most bitter political foes. She spent 2Â½ years in prison, most of it in a detention hospital. She met Tuesday with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in Kiev. On Monday, Ashton spoke with Ukraine's three main opposition party leaders: Yatsenyuk; Klitschko of the UDAR party; and Oleg Tyahnybok, of the nationalist right-wing party Svoboda, or Freedom. Tymoshenko, 53, a longtime opposition leader and ally of Turchinov, has hinted she may be interested in running for the presidency. She is considered a hero of the 2004 ""Orange Revolution,"" which successfully challenged the results of an election won by Yanukovych. But she is less well regarded for her performance as Prime Minister from 2007 to 2010, when she was ousted after losing to Yanukovych in elections. ""She was a very corrupt leader,"" said Julia Ioffe, senior editor at The New Republic. ""She was part of the reason the 'Orange Revolution' failed."" Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia. Western governments said the case against her was politically motivated. Amid the changes now under way, those involved in the recent street protests have expressed a desire for a new, untainted generation of leaders to step forward. ""A lot of people who made this revolution feel like this movement has created a lot of new leaders, a lot of young leaders -- that now it's their turn,"" Ioffe told ""CNN Newsroom"" over the weekend. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Kiev, and Tom Watkins reported and wrote with Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.

"Washington (CNN) -- Some Marine Corps families, mourning a son or daughter killed in action, received an unexpected surprise for the holidays: an ornament of the Purple Heart, a letter addressed to their fallen hero and even information about athletic reconditioning. The Marine Corps was apologizing Tuesday for sending the packages to families of the fallen instead of the Marines wounded in action but still alive. ""There are no words to express how very sorry we are for the hurt such a mistake has caused the families of our fallen warriors,"" said Col. John L. Mayer, commanding officer of the Marines Wounded Warrior Regiment. ""We always strive to honor the sacrifices these Marines, sailors and their families gave to this country."" Mayer, alerted to the problem when families began phoning in Monday, said there was no excuse for what happened.

"(CNN) -- In a rare and candid interview, CNN's Robyn Curnow spoke to Nelson Mandela's wife of 10 years, Graca Machel, to find out more about the man from the person who arguably knows him the best. Here, Machel reveals that Mandela's courageous and eventful life has left him with only one regret. Machel: ""We have enjoyed this relationship in a really special way."" How would you describe your relationship with Nelson Mandela? He is simply a wonderful husband. We met in life at time we were both settled. We were grown up, we were settled, we knew the value of a companion, of a partner. Because of that, we have enjoyed this relationship in a really special way. It's not like when you are still young, you are too demanding. No, no. We just accept each other as we are. And we enjoy every single day as if it is the last day. Because of that, it has been wonderful to have him as a husband.. Do you look at him and go, ""I married Nelson Mandela?"" At the beginning, yes. I already had this very deep involvement with him. Then sometimes. It's ... there was a sort of conflict between the man I loved and the myth. Particularly because people were saying things, and I couldn't figure out the two would go together. I know him as a human being, a person and this myth surrounding him. The aura around him was a bit confusing, but then I learnt to live with it, in terms of separating the two. Is he comfortable in his own skin? Absolutely. More than comfortable. He is so happy with himself. At the end of his life also he realizes, although he doesn't express it. He realized that he achieved the things he had as goals in life. So is he at peace with himself? Yeah, really. It's peace, fulfillment. Best way to characterize it is to be at peace with himself, but also at peace with the world . Does he have any regrets? Ya, only one I know of. You feel he would have really liked much more input in the development of his children. Only thing. Although he tried his best. Madiba (Mandela) was not given the opportunity to bring up his own children. He left them. Went to prison when they were very young. He didn't have much opportunity to do those things that a parent a father does to read stories to child. How has he dealt with old age, for somebody who seems to be such a fighter, doer, has the frailty of old age frustrated him? I think the only thing that frustrates him is walking. When he tries, he feels, he puts it as his knees don't cooperate ... that's how he puts it. He is not anxious about getting old. No, no, no. He feels he would like to move freely. That this the kind of frustration I sense in him. Birthday wishes? I have already given him the best present I could and thought of, 10 years ago when we got married. I looked back sometimes ... It sounds crazy, someone of my age at the time. I was 52; I married a man of 80. It wasn't a problem. I was so happy to marry him. I think after that any other thing is much less, because it will never surpass the possibility of us being together, sharing a life. That is the best I could have given him. Because it is your wedding anniversary?  When we married, we didn't know we'd be given 10 years together. We have been very lucky. Very grateful for that.","Mandela's wife describes life with her ""wonderful husband""

"(CNN) -- Dolly Parton suffered minor injuries in a traffic crash at a Nashville intersection on Monday, according to the singer and police. ""I was in a fender bender this morning, here in Nashville,"" Parton, 67, said in a Twitter posting. ""But I am all good. Just a little tired and sore, resting at home."" A Nashville police statement blamed the driver of another vehicle with failing to yield to the SUV in which Parton was riding as a front-seat passenger. Parton and the driver of her Nissan Xterra, 68-year-old Judy Ogle, were taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, the police report said. Parton and Ogle have been close friends since elementary school, according to previous interviews. Diane Lish, 64, of Old Hickory, Tennessee, was taken to another hospital for treatment. Lish was behind the wheel of the Mitsubishi Diamante that crashed into Parton's vehicle, police said. None of the injuries appeared serious, police said.

"(CNN) -- Long lines lingered in some key states after polls closed in most of the United States, but voters and election officials reported few snags in Tuesday's balloting. In Florida and Virginia, people who were in line at the end of voting hours were allowed to cast their ballots -- a process that took hours and stretched until nearly midnight Tuesday. ""There have been polling places where there was no down time,"" said Donald Palmer, the secretary of Virginia's state Board of Elections. ""There was a consistent, heavy stream of voters."" But the process was ""very error-free,"" he said. Earlier in the day, those long lines prompted some voters to walk away in states such as Florida and Pennsylvania, election observers said. Politics: No surprises for Obama, Romney in earliest projections . In Ohio, one of the most closely watched swing states, authorities recorded only a handful of complaints. ""We are unaware of any problems that would substantially stall the reporting process,"" Secretary of State Jon Husted said Tuesday night. In two Pennsylvania counties, a voting machine had to be recalibrated after voters complained that it incorrectly displayed their vote for president. Election officials said the voters were able to cast ballots for their intended candidate, and there were no further complaints once the machines were fixed. Numerous problems were reported around Philadelphia. The nonpartisan election monitors from the independent Committee of Seventy said two voting machines had broken down at one precinct on the city's north side, forcing poll workers to issue provisional ballots. That slowed down an already long line, and at least 30 voters had dropped out, the group said. A judge in the heavily Democratic city ordered election officials to cover a mural of President Barack Obama at one city school that was being used as a polling location Tuesday morning after Republicans complained the painting violated electioneering laws. Politics: Could close race produce a popular/electoral vote split? GOP poll monitors were being escorted into precincts by sheriff's deputies after some observers had been denied access earlier in the day, said Tasha Jamerson, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. As many as 64 of the monitors had been turned away before a judge ordered election officials to admit them, the local Republican Party chapter said. One of the complaints about misbehaving electronic voting machines occurred in Millerstown, in central Pennsylvania's Perry County, where election officials said they recalibrated the unit after one voter recorded a video of it registering a vote for Obama as one for his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney. The video drew thousands of comments on YouTube and was first confirmed by NBC News. But Ron Ruman, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office, told CNN the machine was taken offline after the man complained about it, election workers recalibrated it and there have been no more complaints. A second complaint emerged later Tuesday in Lewisburg, in nearby Union County. Andy Hirsch told CNN that he pressed the box to select Obama several times, only to see the machine indicate a vote for Romney. Hirsch also captured the scene on video, showing him pressing the Obama box several times before the vote registered correctly. Hirsch said he reported the problem to a volunteer poll worker who was calm and receptive to the issue and told him the machine had been having problems all day. Opinion: From Sandy, a lesson for election . ""I thought, gee, that's probably not the reaction to have when casting a ballot for president of the United States,"" he said. The worker suggested he use a pencil eraser to finish his ballot, but the video he shot shows the same issue. Hirsch said he saw workers shutting down the machine as he left. Greg Katherman, Union County's director of elections, confirmed there was an issue with one voting machine, but said there were no further issues after the machine was recalibrated. In other states, most complaints focused on long lines. But in Pinellas County, Florida, which includes St. Petersburg, officials had to send a corrective message to 12,000 absentee voters on Tuesday after an automated call told them they needed to get their ballot in ""tomorrow."" The message was supposed to have gone out Monday, but was sent out Tuesday because of a computer glitch, said Nancy Whitlock, a spokeswoman for the county supervisor of elections. Why you can't vote online yet . In the Cleveland suburb of Solon, Ohio, Dina Rock said an optical-scan voting machine jammed at her precinct, backing up the line and leaving voters confused as to how their votes would be counted. A poll worker told them to leave their ballots in a bin, ""and he was not friendly at all,"" she said. ""People were getting frustrated, and nobody knew what to do,"" she said. Voters were told, ""Just put it in here and we'll fix it later,"" she said. Concerned her vote wouldn't be tabulated, she said she called the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections and was told the ballots would be manually fed into the machine later. ""At that point, I just said, 'OK, that's just what it is, and I will trust that you know what you're doing and I will trust that my vote counts,"" she said. ""I'm a very trusting person, and I hope people are honest and they'll do the right thing."" In Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, as many as 15% of voters in some traditional Democratic precincts had been issued provisional ballots. More than 20,000 provisional ballots were issued in Hamilton County, a traditional Republican stronghold that went for Obama in 2008. And in New Jersey, state officials allowed voters displaced by Superstorm Sandy last week to cast ballots electronically or by fax. But they extended their deadline to submit those votes until Friday amid numerous complaints about the system. What to watch for on Election Night . The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union went to court Tuesday afternoon on behalf of voters who said their requests for an electronic ballot weren't being acknowledged. ""What's happening is they're not receiving any sort of response from their respective county election officials,"" said Katie Wang, a spokeswoman for the group. Voters still had to submit an application to vote electronically by 5 p.m. Tuesday, according to an executive order signed by Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. But they had until 8 p.m. Friday to submit the ballots, the order states. And in New York, which was also smacked by Sandy, polling stations around New York City saw long, slow-moving lines. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's last-minute decree that any voter could vote at any precinct, a move intended to help those displaced by Sandy, made it ""a little insane right now"" at the polling station at Public School 41 in Greenwich Village, a poll coordinator there told CNN Tuesday afternoon. ""So we have everybody coming in from everywhere,"" said the coordinator, a Republican who asked not to be named. ""It was for displaced people, but others are taking advantage of it.""

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Shane Brown squeezed through a gap between sections of a steel security fence 9 feet high, picked his way across a vacant lot infested with fire ants and climbed atop a rickety wooden platform. He stepped up and spoke into the microphone: . ""God is a good, good God."" His words were amplified over a hardscrabble patch of earth wedged against a highway the locals call the inner loop. White plastic trash bins stood sentry against litter, but there was no one there to fill them. Brown, the first speaker to take the platform Wednesday at the official ""free speech zone"" of the Democratic National Convention, had an audience of just three -- two city workers and a reporter. It was shortly before 3 p.m., and the place had been deserted since it opened five hours earlier. If a man -- be he a protester, a prophet or a pothead -- talks to a dozen trash cans in a vacant lot half a mile from a bustling political convention, does he make a sound? Without pausing to ponder the question, Brown simply turned and faced the massive traffic jam behind him on Stonewall Street, ironically in front of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. It may have been a captive audience, but at least it was an audience. ""God is a good, good God,"" he began again. And then, the generator powering the sound system shut down. A city worker fiddled with the contraption, shrugging, ""I work for the Transportation Department, so of course now I'm the sound man."" Brown, meanwhile, carried on with a bullhorn, talking for nearly 40 minutes until the second speaker, also a street preacher, showed up late. Steve Widdows' topic was ""sodomy, abortion, fornication."" He taped up signs condemning ""Wicked Democrats"" and ""Abhor-tion."" His God apparently was not a happy God. ""It is an abomination for a king to commit wickedness,"" Widdows preached, promising God's wrath against ""a former president"" who, he said, phoned ""innocent grandmothers"" in North Carolina and told them they didn't have to support a law that defined marriage as a union ""between one man and one woman."" Opinion: Even vile funeral protests are free speech . And so it went each day, until the rain came or the sun went down, whichever happened first. A preacher was followed by a speaker who wanted to legalize marijuana, who was followed by a group of atheists and agnostics, which was followed by a group of community singers. If at times it seemed like a single hand clapping in the dark, the speakers did not complain. Widdows admits he was disappointed that no one was there to hear him preach, but he showed up all three days anyway. After using his allotted 30 minutes, he said, he'd find a street corner ""where there were lots of people"" and start preaching again. ""When you say you're going to do something, you go ahead and do it,"" he explained. ""There was some benefit, to put the understanding on people. I decided I was just going to go ahead and preach, and if anyone hears it, use it, Lord."" Anarchists, occupiers and other protesters in Charlotte shunned the official speakers' area, which they sneeringly called ""the pen."" Sure, some of them signed up. But they gave false agendas, never intending to show. ""We are under the impression that the whole country is a free speech zone,"" said Michael Zytkow, a 26-year-old organizer for Occupy Charlotte. ""We were bothered by the idea of any government-designated playground."" Carol Sobel, a lawyer from Santa Monica, California, who co-chairs the Mass Defense Committee of the National Lawyers Guild, asked, ""Who'd want to use it? You're talking to yourself."" Her group works to push back against what it views as government attempts to stifle dissent. Sobel keeps a photograph on her desk showing her with blackened eyes from rubber police bullets at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. ""My rights to freedom of assembly are being violated,"" complained anarchist Vermin Supreme, a fixture at both of this year's conventions who wears a boot on his head and also happens to be running for president. Like most of the Charlotte protesters, including the cadre of 200 or so Occupy regulars who camped at Marshall Park, he took his case to the sidewalks and streets. Who's that protester with the boot on his head? On Tuesday, the first day of the Democratic convention, about 100 protesters blocked the intersection across the street from ""the pen,"" demanding their free speech rights and entangling police in a two-hour standoff that ended peacefully when the skies opened up for the daily downpour. ""At least they gave us some entertainment,"" said a city worker overseeing the free speech area, which had to be one of the loneliest convention assignments. He passed the time reading a biography of Yogi Berra. Such was the state of free speech here during last week's Democratic convention, and at the Republican convention the week before in Tampa, Florida. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to freely practice one's religion and publicly speak one's mind without government constraint or interference. It also gives citizens the right to assemble and to air their grievances to their government. But the law remains unsettled on whether the government has the power to say where. The Supreme Court has established guidelines to measure whether speech restrictions pass constitutional muster. The restrictions must be neutral and not based on content, and they must be specific; they must serve a significant government interest, such as public safety; and they must provide for alternative means of communication. The free speech zones are meant to be that alternative means of communication, but the Lawyers Guild advises clients to avoid them and use the public sidewalks. The designation of free speech zones at political conventions and other large gatherings has been evolving for more than two decades, Sobel said. In many instances, the free speech zones are set up far from the people whose attention the protesters seek. ""It makes the protest invisible,"" she said. ""This has been a growing problem."" It began at the Democratic National Convention in 1988. Atlanta set up a ""designated protest zone"" to prevent disruptions by anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and its opponents. The demonstrators objected to being confined to a ""free speech cage,"" but the practice continued during the 1992 and 1996 conventions. And, during the 1990s, free speech zones were designated in other public areas such as San Francisco's airport, which had issues with panhandling Hare Krishnas. Both the Tampa and Charlotte conventions were designated Special National Security Events, a category created in 1998. The massive protest against globalization during the 1999 World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Seattle was the real game-changer for how police and municipalities respond to protest, Sobel said. More than 40,000 protesters showed up and clashed violently with police in what became known as ""The Battle in Seattle."" It left behind indelible images of protesters blocking intersections and smashing storefront windows -- and police responding with volleys of pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets. The lawsuits that followed established that officials in Seattle had a right to declare parts of the city off limits to everyone for security reasons, but were wrong to target just the protesters, Sobel said. Tightened security was noticeable at the 2000 political conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. City officials in Los Angeles tried to file a sealed document justifying the lockdown, but a judge refused to look at it. Attorneys challenged the remote location of the free speech zone and succeeded in moving the protest area to a lot directly across the street from the arena where the convention was held. A year later, the September 11 terrorist attacks changed the way Americans looked at security. Federal agencies were rearranged in 2002 under the Department of Homeland Security, which determined which events should be considered Special National Security events. Conventions leave atheists asking: What political party represents me? The 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City were given that designation, along with the Super Bowls and a handful other other high-profile events. The agency's head now decides which events earn the designation. It puts the U.S. Secret Service in charge of security and the FBI in charge of intelligence during political conventions, international trade meetings and other events that could become targets for terrorists. Over the years, the designation has come to apply to any event likely to attract mass protests. By 2004, amped-up security and a heavy police presence had become a way of life at the conventions. Protesters at the Democratic convention in Boston were corralled into a ""pen"" with concrete walls and barbed wire and could not be seen by delegates. They responded by donning prisoner of war uniforms and marching in circles inside what they called ""Camp X-Ray."" Meanwhile, at the Republican convention in New York, police on horses and motorized scooters herded protesters into ""pens"" made of orange mesh, said Gideon Oliver, an attorney who represents some of the 1,800 people who were arrested. Eight years after the convention, a class-action lawsuit alleging civil rights violations is still making its way through the federal courts. In Tampa this year, just two people were arrested during the Republican National Convention. The city's downtown area was all but deserted -- except for the 4,000 cops in khaki fatigues -- giving the place all the ambiance of a third-world city after a military coup. In Charlotte, 25 people were arrested. Police officers wore dark blue uniforms, which made them look more like cops. Some Secret Service agents were in casual street dress, and the security perimeter was much larger because the event involved President Obama. But in both cities, everyone was subjected to daily torrents from nature's water cannon, which may have been more effective than anything police could come up with to dampen dissent.

"Washington (CNN) -- A seismic study found that the Washington Monument can withstand a worst-case earthquake scenario, officials said Thursday in describing needed repairs to the iconic landmark damaged in the 5.8-magnitude quake a year ago. The 555-foot monument will be under full scaffolding for repairs to damaged marble plates, stonework and other problems near its top, said Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. At a news conference with other U.S. officials, Vogel offered no time frame for the repairs. Officials previously said the monument could be closed through 2013 and possibly into 2014. The monument has been closed since an earthquake struck the mid-Atlantic region near Richmond, Virginia, on August 23, 2011. Quake-damaged monument may stay closed until 2014 . ""This is the most significant earthquake to ever strike the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains,"" U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said at the news conference. ""More people felt this earthquake than any earthquake in U.S. history."" A comprehensive seismic study determined the monument faced no risk of collapse, even in the event of a ""maximum considered earthquake,"" the estimated worst possible quake over a 2,475-year period, Vogel said. Such a scenario ""did not present a concern for structural collapse,"" he said, adding that ""supporting soils are indeed adequate to withstand"" a maximum considered earthquake. At least nine marble panels on the outside of the monument near the top are cracked, according to a post-earthquake assessment. Others are chipped but not in danger of falling, the report said. Indoor repairs are also required. Some interior tie beams and some cracked panels will be fixed. About 700,000 visitors go to the top of the monument in a typical year. The Washington Monument was built between 1848 and 1884 and has been repaired three times previously, with the most recent work done from 1997 to 2000. The signature obelisk wasn't the only landmark in the U.S. capital city affected by last year's quake. Three towers of the National Cathedral and carved pinnacles and embellishments that decorate them suffered severe damage. The church's interim dean, the Rev. Francis H. Wade, said Thursday that the cost for repairs, restoration and historic preservation should exceed $50 million. It is expected this effort will take 10 years. Repairs done since last summer's quake have focused on stabilizing stone. On Thursday, cathedral officials announced they had received a $5 million gift from the Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment that will be used for architectural restoration. ""After a year's time, we have a long way to go toward full restoration,"" Wade said. ""But we also have countless individuals, organizations and houses of worship to thank that have shared in their belief in the work of this sacred place -- and I have no doubt that they would join me in gratitude for this major restoration grant."" The August 2011 tremor rattled buildings around the nation's capital, as well as stoked concerns about whether residents, workers and visitors were prepared. During Thursday's news conference outside the Washington Monument, officials described an upcoming drill designed to prepare people to react quickly if another big earthquake hits the region. Called the Great Southeast Shakeout, the drill is scheduled for 10:18 a.m on Oct. 18. Its aim is to encourage people to drop to the floor or ground, take cover under a desk or table, and hold on until the shaking stops. Last year, they said, many people in the Washington business district fled their buildings like in a fire drill, putting them at potential risk from falling debris. The website for the drill is www.shakeout.org/southeast. Where to find exceptional America .

"(CNN) -- In a rare and candid interview, CNN's Robyn Curnow spoke to Nelson Mandela's wife of 10 years, Graca Machel, to find out more about the man from the person who arguably knows him the best. Here, Machel reveals that Mandela's courageous and eventful life has left him with only one regret. Machel: ""We have enjoyed this relationship in a really special way."" How would you describe your relationship with Nelson Mandela? He is simply a wonderful husband. We met in life at time we were both settled. We were grown up, we were settled, we knew the value of a companion, of a partner. Because of that, we have enjoyed this relationship in a really special way. It's not like when you are still young, you are too demanding. No, no. We just accept each other as we are. And we enjoy every single day as if it is the last day. Because of that, it has been wonderful to have him as a husband.. Do you look at him and go, ""I married Nelson Mandela?"" At the beginning, yes. I already had this very deep involvement with him. Then sometimes. It's ... there was a sort of conflict between the man I loved and the myth. Particularly because people were saying things, and I couldn't figure out the two would go together. I know him as a human being, a person and this myth surrounding him. The aura around him was a bit confusing, but then I learnt to live with it, in terms of separating the two. Is he comfortable in his own skin? Absolutely. More than comfortable. He is so happy with himself. At the end of his life also he realizes, although he doesn't express it. He realized that he achieved the things he had as goals in life. So is he at peace with himself? Yeah, really. It's peace, fulfillment. Best way to characterize it is to be at peace with himself, but also at peace with the world . Does he have any regrets? Ya, only one I know of. You feel he would have really liked much more input in the development of his children. Only thing. Although he tried his best. Madiba (Mandela) was not given the opportunity to bring up his own children. He left them. Went to prison when they were very young. He didn't have much opportunity to do those things that a parent a father does to read stories to child. How has he dealt with old age, for somebody who seems to be such a fighter, doer, has the frailty of old age frustrated him? I think the only thing that frustrates him is walking. When he tries, he feels, he puts it as his knees don't cooperate ... that's how he puts it. He is not anxious about getting old. No, no, no. He feels he would like to move freely. That this the kind of frustration I sense in him. Birthday wishes? I have already given him the best present I could and thought of, 10 years ago when we got married. I looked back sometimes ... It sounds crazy, someone of my age at the time. I was 52; I married a man of 80. It wasn't a problem. I was so happy to marry him. I think after that any other thing is much less, because it will never surpass the possibility of us being together, sharing a life. That is the best I could have given him. Because it is your wedding anniversary?  When we married, we didn't know we'd be given 10 years together. We have been very lucky. Very grateful for that.","Mandela's wife describes life with her ""wonderful husband""

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the conviction of a man who bought a handgun but broke the law by not disclosing his intent to resell it to a relative. It was a rare setback for gun-rights advocates who contend government efforts to track and keep firearms out of the wrong hands go too far. The court ruled 5-4 in the ""straw"" purchase case against Bruce Abramski, a former police officer who told a Virginia gun dealer in 2009 that he was the ""actual buyer"" of the Glock weapon. He then sold it to his uncle in Pennsylvania for $400. Abramski said he and his relative were legally able to own it. But he was charged with making false statements, convicted and sentenced to probation. At issue is whether such misstatements are ""material"" to an otherwise lawful sale and whether that kind of information should be kept by a federally licensed dealer. The Obama administration said those who purchase from licensed dealers must follow the letter and spirit of the law to ensure accurate record-keeping and to make it easier to trace the weapon. Gun rights advocates call Abramski a victim of vast government overreach, unfairly lumped into the same category as those who would buy weapons for criminals or for smuggling. The high court in recent years has affirmed the broader individual right of Americans to own handguns for self-protection in the home. And on this issue, it narrowly ruled for the stricter control, saying the ""actual transferee/buyer"" must disclose any intent to resell at the time of purchase. ""No piece of information is more important under federal firearms law than the identity of a gun's purchaser,"" Justice Elena Kagan said, stressing that the dealer in this case could never have known to run a background check on Abramski's uncle. She was supported in her opinion by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. Federal law requires prospective buyers to check a box on an Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms form indicating whether they are purchasing a gun for someone else. Abramski confirmed he was the buyer, but said he made clear all along that he planned to sell the weapon legally to his uncle was told the transfer could be completed by a licensed dealer, which he completed days later. During oral arguments in January, some justices questioned whether signing the ATF form really solved the problem of keeping weapons out of the hands of the wrong people. In his dissent Justice Antonin Scalia said the law in question was unclear. ""The court (majority) makes it a crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner,"" he said. ""Whether or not that is a sensible result, the statutes Congress enacted do not support it."" Scalia was backed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.","Former police officer convicted of buying a gun for an uncle but not saying so .

"(CNN) -- The family of a Florida man has released video of his death, hoping to get criminal charges filed against the police officer who ran him over. On May 8, Marlon Brown was being chased by DeLand police because they allegedly saw that he was not wearing a seatbelt. At a dead-end road, Brown stopped his car and started running. One of the police cars hit and ran him over, its dashcam video recording the entire incident. Last week, a grand jury decided not to indict officer James Harris on a criminal charge of vehicular manslaughter. That's when the family decided to go public, and release the video. ""We knew it wasn't going to be an easy video to watch,"" says Krystal Brown the ex-wife and mother of Brown's children, ""but in order to obtain justice, and that's what we're looking for, we knew it was something that we had to do."" Unarmed man shot 10 times by police . Justice, the family says, would be criminal charges against Harris for killing Marlon Brown. Harris, who has been fired as a result of the incident, could not be reached for comment. The dashcam video shows Harris' police car following two other police cars as they drive down a residential street into a grass lot. The two other vehicles stop but the one with the camera continues to chase after Brown. As the police car approaches, Brown stumbles and falls. While on the ground, Brown turns and faces the chasing vehicle and within seconds, his face disappears under the hood of Harris' police car. A thud is heard and the car stops. ""I think he's underneath the (expletive) car,"" a voice off camera can be heard saying. Florida deputies mistakenly shoot man in his driveway . The city of DeLand has already paid the family $550,000 in a settlement but the city did not admit any wrongdoing, according to Krystal Brown. The family decided to go public with their story and the video in hopes of triggering public outrage that would result in pressure for officials to file criminal charges for Brown's death. ""We're just asking for justice, nothing extra,"" Krystal Brown said, ""nothing no one else would want for their family member. "" State Attorney for Florida's 7th judicial district R.J. Larizza decided to present the evidence to the grand jury instead of filing charges, which he could have done if he felt a crime had been committed. Larizza stood by his decision at a news conference last week, following the grand jury's decision not to return charges after two days of testimony. ""This has been a controversial situation and this has been a case that has been a challenge since the beginning,"" Larizza said at the news conference. ""I wanted the most possible folks involved, people that were in the community, people that live here, people that care about this community to make the decision,"" said Larizza, adding, ""and I was confident and comfortable that they would do so."" Police wound 2 bystanders in Times Square shooting . Krystal Brown said the family was ""disappointed"" and ""felt let down by the criminal justice department"" even before seeing the video, adding that they believe a vehicular manslaughter charge was appropriate. ""Just knowing what the charge entails, it doesn't have to show intent -- it only has to show reckless driving,"" she said. The video alone prompted DeLand Police Chief William Ridgway to fire Harris. ""The actions taken by Officer Harris that night are not consistent with our department's training, directives, or accepted practices or techniques,"" Ridgway told CNN, in a prepared statement. DeLand police are conducting an internal review of the incident. This week, law enforcement officials have been going over more than 2,000 documents to determine whether appropriate tactics were used, whether police policies were followed and if those policies reflect the best way to deal with similar situations. Brown's family believes the video speaks for itself. ""We would have had no problem getting a call that morning saying, 'OK Marlon ran from the police and we had to tase him' or 'the dogs bit him' or something more along the lines of not using excessive force,"" says Krystal Brown. ""But to get the call that he has been ran down with a vehicle for running from the police? That doesn't fit.""","Marlon Brown died on May 8 after he was run over by a DeLand, Florida, police officer .

"(CNN) -- Police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, are sick -- sick of having their healthcare benefits cut. Nearly a quarter of the city's 2,200-member police force called in sick on Monday. That's 522 officers, according to Police Director Toney Armstrong. ""We're in a crisis mode,"" he said. ""We're going to do absolutely everything we have to do to make sure that public safety isn't compromised."" Last month, the city council voted to eliminate the city's 70% subsidy of health insurance premiums for members of the force. Premiums were also increased, apparently prompting an onset of the ""Blue Flu"" since June 30. That's when the number of officers out sick began to escalate. ""The police association has not sanctioned nor orchestrated a Blue Flu,"" said Michael Williams, president of the Memphis Police Association. ""I would characterize it as officers that are stressed out, and they are very concerned about their futures."" The public finds itself caught in the middle. ""We're in a Catch-22 as citizens because, yes, we want the protection, we need the protection, we deserve the protection, but they need their rights protected, too,"" Memphis resident Harriet Stanton told CNN affiliate WMC-TV. Armstrong said it's not hard to figure out why officers are upset. The changes are hitting them in the pocketbook. ""I certainly understand their level of disappointment and their level of hurt,"" he said, stopping short of calling recent developments a strike. ""You have to respect the process, and certainly we have a certain percentage of our force that has chosen to take another action."" For the officers who remain on the job, there are no vacation or off days. Shelby County Sheriff's deputies are supplementing the force. Tennessee Highway Patrol officers may pitch in too, if needed, Armstrong said. One Memphis resident called for disciplinary action. ""I think they should be fired because it's a responsibility for us that we have to be protected,"" Helen Fulp said. Yet, there was sympathy from others. ""Let's start up on top. Let's cut the mayor's salary. Let's cut some of his assistant's salaries, then let's cut from some of those making these decisions,"" said Calvin Harris. ""Then, we see where we need to go from there."" Obama intervenes in Philadelphia rail strike .","More than 500 officers were off the street on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Is it a guitar? Is it a piano? Nope, it is a crazy iPhone-powered combination of both. Plus it has a built in bass, violin and drum machine to boot. The Artiphon Instrument 1 looks something like a medieval lute, but with a smart phone jammed into its belly. The new instrument, released for pre-order this month, combines a keyboard, fret board, built-in plectrum and accelerometer-powered wawa effect. Named the Artiphon Instrument 1, it is the invention of Mike Butera, a Ph.D. in sound studies, from Virginia Tech. The Instrument 1 draws on the computational power of a modern smart phone to make and record sound. A downloadable app on the phone allows you to select different modes, helping you to change swiftly between instruments. Butera says the invention of the Artiphon came to him at a dinner party in his native Nashville that descended into a late-night iPhone-based jam session. ""It was a bit comical,"" Butera says, ""the singers staring down in their lap at the phone, fingers and hands contorted around a device that just begged to be dropped, trying to tap the right notes to songs we could have instantly played on a normal keyboard or guitar. ""It was then that I had the idea of a multi-instrument that would adapt to each person's playing technique and musical style. This wasn't a guitar or a violin or a keyboard but it could be any of them."" Butera says that he finds contemporary digital instruments such as keyboards, drum machines and laptops boring, so he invented his own device. ""I wanted to make something that people at all skill levels could play, a device as agnostic to musical style as the piano but as expressive as a violin."" The Instrument 1 is made out of bamboo and hardwoods, and is produced by Nashville-based woodworkers. The speaker grilles are made of polished aluminum and the entire device is assembled locally. Butera says it was important to him that the instrument should be high quality in its construction and materials: ""I want to make instruments with innovative technologies that people want to keep and pass on rather than toss when they are obsolete,"" he says. Showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show and the National Association of Music Merchants, Butera hopes the Instrument 1 will be embraced by working musicians. ""I'd like to put the Instrument 1 in Brian Eno's hands, since he's broken so many barriers in electronic music throughout his career,"" says Butera. ""And The Black Keys, because they're beyond obsessive about tone ... but I'm probably most excited about the whizkid in Japan who's going to post some killer video on YouTube and blow our minds."" The invention of new musical instruments has always come from technological leaps. The modern piano was a byproduct of mechanical development in the 18th century, and the electric guitar evolved from amplification experiments being done by big bands in the early 1900s. The release of the Artiphon Instrument 1 coincides with the 30th anniversary of MIDI, a 1983 innovation that many musicians regard as the birth of electronic music. Paul White, Editor in Chief of Sound on Sound magazine says the Instrument 1 ""seems like a high-end take on the You Rock Guitar idea, where the fingerboard is replaced by touch switches ... though as a guitar player myself, physical strings feel much more natural than virtual strings. How widely it is accepted remains to be seen but I'm always encouraged to see new instrument ideas make it into the market and this one certainly looks to be well engineered."" In 2008 the Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition was established to showcase and recognize the invention of new musical instruments. Commenting on the Artiphon Instrument 1, Gil Weinberg, organizer of the competition and director of the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology, said: ""In general, I'm a big believer in using the capabilities of smart phones to power novel hardware. The 'brain' of such devices is already in your pocket, so why not use it? ""Specifically regarding the Artiphon, I think they did a very good job in providing a wide variety of gestural input that can allow for more musical expression than interacting with the iPhone GUI. My only concern is that these new input modalities are still far from providing the expression that acoustic instruments can provide. But as long as users know what to expect, this can definitely be fun to play."" So how does it sound? According to Butera, the instrument ""can sound like anything you want."" So if you are in the market for a harp that plays like a violin and looks like a space-age guitar, Artiphon's new Instrument 1 may be the one instrument for you.

"(CNN) -- George H.W. Bush turns 90 today (June 12), only the fourth American president to reach that age. He's the last of the World War II presidents, the last American leader to preside over the Cold War, the last of a generation of elected leaders who saw themselves as old-fashioned public servants rather than cutthroat campaigners. Today, there are college graduates who weren't even born when he left office. So the question is, what can 20-somethings learn from an old man like Bush? It starts with what Bush said to a group of young people in one of the last speeches he gave as President: ""What all of us seek in our life is meaning and adventure. It's through service that all of us can find both."" He certainly has had 90 years of ""meaning and adventure"" â€” flying as one of the youngest Navy pilots in World War II; serving in Congress during the 1960s; as US liaison to China in the days of Mao; as chair of the Republican Party during Watergate; as head of the CIA after the Church Commission; as Ambassador to the United Nations during the Cold War; as Vice President during the Reagan Revolution; as President during the collapse of the Soviet Union. And as a post-presidential humanitarian, he has raised millions for cancer research and disaster relief alongside the man who was his most bitter political rival. Bush had a front-row seat to most of the major events of the second half of the 20th century, and he did it by dedicating his life to service to others. ""Public service is a noble calling,"" something he's said so often that it's engraved on a bust at his Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. (The students rub its brass nose for good luck; he once quipped, ""Thank God it was only a bust!"") I asked about Bush's formula for meaning and adventure when I interviewed 41 extraordinary people for our new documentary about our 41st president, ""41ON41."" Many of the 41 spoke of Bush's lifelong commitment to public service, whether in uniform, in appointed positions, through elected office or in community service. ""This man has affected this country and served this country in so many ways,"" said sports commentator Jim Nantz, ""and he's done it every step of the way with a kind heart, with good intentions, with real concern that he's doing the right thing to help people."" ""I do believe, if there were more people like him, the world would be a better place,"" President Bill Clinton told me. ""If your primary motivation is to serve, then, in an imperfect world, you're likely to make the right rather than the wrong compromises. ""His primary motivation was to serve. You don't get to pick the time you serve, and you can't control the circumstances in which you govern. There's always some good and some bad in it. But he made the most of a hand that was not the easiest hand to play. And he did it because, at heart, he's a servant."" Pierce Bush is G.H.W.'s grandson, and the two have talked about the day his grandfather decided to make the first step in a lifetime of service. ""He remembers sitting in an Andover [High School] auditorium right after Pearl Harbor was attacked,"" Pierce said. ""There was this spirit that he wanted to be a part of. He wanted to go and defend America, he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself."" Pierce sees the parallels with his generation -- in the same longing millennials have to be a part of something larger than oneself. His Twitter homepage quotes his grandfather: ""Any definition of a successful life must include service to others."" Pierce works for Big Brothers Big Sisters in Houston and would tell you that his life is full of both meaning and adventure. Condoleezza Rice is concerned that young people have only seen the worst of elected officials in a gridlocked Washington that seems to feed on character assassination. She knows how hard it is to decide to go into public service in such a poisonous environment. ""I would say to young people: Never forget that democracy depends on its citizens to care about it, to promote it, to work for it,"" Rice said. ""Democracies don't survive if citizens simply leave it to others to do the hard work of governing, and so if you get a chance to be in public service, do it. The greatest thing that you can do in your life is to serve your country. You could have no better role model than George H. W. Bush."" Bush's life is full of lessons for young people. I hope you'll tune in to CNN on Father's Day at 9 p.m. ET to hear more about this remarkable American life. You'll be surprised how much you'll learn.","Mary Kate Cary: George H.W.

"(CNN)  -- When France won the 1998 World Cup on home soil their triumph was hailed as a unifying force for a country with a difficult colonial past and where racial tensions were never far from the surface. The team was labeled the Black, Blanc, Beur (Black, White, Arab) because of the seamless mix of French-born and dual-nationality players who conquered the football world with a shock 3-0 win in the final against the favored Brazilians. But fast forward 13 years and leading French politicians, current star players  players and influential media commentators are among many to voice fears that the legacy of social integration engendered by that glorious night in the Stade de France has been severely tarnished, if it every existed. French talent drain no excuse for quota . Deputy Christiane Taubira, a prominent member of the French National Assembly, who was a candidate in the 2002 presidential elections, was always skeptical that it marked a sea change in French attitudes to race. ""1998 was an illusion and a short one,"" she told CNN, pointing out that less than three months later a French government minister called black youths ""young savages."" Taubira, who is in the socialist group in the National Assembly, believes that until ""all citizens are treated equally"" French society will continue to have problems of racial integration. With presidential elections looming in France next year, she believes the problem stems from the very top and is calling on Nicolas Sarkozy to promote diversity and give more opportunities to France's immigrant population. Taubira is a persistent critic of Sarkozy, particularly for his spells as French Interior Minister from 2002-07 where his hardline approach to disorder in neighborhoods with a largely North African population came under the spotlight. ""I told him back in 2002 that he was organizing a civil war in this country,"" she added. Taubira's comments come in the wake of the decision by the French Sports Minister Chantal Jouanno to clear national football coach Laurent Blanc in the ""race quotas row"" which has provoked an angry reaction from critics. Blanc, who succeeded Raymond Domenech last summer, was captured by a secret recording allegedly discussing the introduction of quotas for young players, aged 12 and 13, based on their racial background. The implication was that a smaller percentage of youngsters of dual nationality would be admitted to the famed French football academies, which act as the breeding ground for talent such as Thierry Henry. National technical director Francois Blaquart, who allegedly promoted the idea to Blanc, remains suspended by the French National Federation (FFF). Joachim Barbier, who wrote the acclaimed book ""Football made in Afrique,"" was scathing in his criticisms of the reported conversations between Blanc and Blaquart. ""You expect these people to be clever and set up a scheme for the future,"" he told CNN. ""Instead they talked like a couple of stupid drunks."" Barbier does not believe Blanc was intentionally racist, but points to the ""wide gap between the people playing football and those running it, who are mostly white and over fifty years of age."" He goes on: ""Back in 1998 the only person saying there was too much diversity was (Front National leader) Jean Marie Le Pen, now it seems everything that is not Christian and white is considered a threat."" Juliens Laurens, UK correspondent for Le Parisien, told CNN that the Blanc affair was another example of the institutional racism which he believes permeates French society. He also does not believe Blanc is a racist but highlights the appointment of his predecessor Domenech as an example of the problem. Domenech got the job in 2004 ahead of Mali-born former star player Jean Tigana. ""I'm sure it was down to Tigana's color rather than ability,"" he claimed. The race issue flared again as Domenech's tenure as national coach ended with their humiliating exit from 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Chelsea's Nicolas Anelka was sent home after a heated exchange with Domenech, prompting a brief strike by his fellow squad members. ""People said there was a clan of black players in the French squad at the World Cup, and we then saw the true face of France,"" Anelka told British reporters last December ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie against Marseille. ""When the France team fails to win people start talking straight away about the players' skin colors and religious beliefs. ""When times get tough we find out what people really think. They said Franck Ribery had hit Yoann Gourcuff -- Ribery the Muslim, and Gourcuff the good French boy."" Anelka's views are echoed by Tottenham Hotspur central defender Sebastien Bassong, who played for France at under-21 level, but with dual nationality opted to play for Cameroon in full internationals. Bassong would represent an example of the issue identified by Blanc and Blaquart whereby a player is trained in the French system then opts to play for a country of his or his parents' birth. In a candid interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper in the wake of the race quotas affair, Bassong criticized French society for its lack of diversity. ""I am not going to lie and say it is not more difficult in France than it is in England to find work if you have a big beard, for example. That is just a fact. ""In England, it is more open and that is why people come here because they know that they will get a chance, no matter how they dress or where they are from. ""French society still has to work with its approach to foreign people,"" he was quoted. Patrick Lozes, president of the Representative Council of Black Associations in France, has no doubt that prejudice is rife in his country and his organization is calling for a full judicial inquiry into the Blanc affair. ""We are talking here about children of 12 years of age, who have not chosen to be bi-national,"" he told CNN. ""These kids are being denied access to training and I call this discrimination. The lack of diversity in the French Football Federation structures paves the way for institutional racism,"" he added. A spokesman for the FFF strongly denied these claims but refused to comment on specific issues. ""The file is not closed, we're actually working on the disciplinary procedures and, following internal regulations and working laws in France, we are avoiding all comments on this topic,"" said Francois Manardo, the chief press officer for the federation. The historical facts would indeed appear to counter accusations that players from ethnic minorities and other backgrounds are discriminated by the selectors of the French national team. The first black player to represent France was Raoul Diagne in 1931 and he played in the 1938 World Cup team that featured three players from North African descent for the first time. Sons of European immigrants to France such as Raymond Kopa, Just Fontaine and Maryan Wisnieski were key members of the 1958 team which reached the semifinals. In the 1990s, the squad boasted representatives of most of the French dependencies, not to mention many African countries such as Senegal which previously came under French rule. The star player of the 1998 team, Zinedine Zidane, was born in Marseille to Algerian parents. Far-right leader Le Pen may have been a lone voice when he said that team was not sufficiently ""French,"" but in 2002 he reached the second round of the presidential elections and Ghanaian-born Marcel Desailly and other national teammates went public and urged voters to reject him. They duly did, although support for Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen's Front National party remains strong in several regions of France. Barbier believes that until ""immigration is seen as a benefit not a threat"" his country will continue to have problems. ""It's a question of leadership,"" he said.","Calls for judicial inquiry after national coach Laurent Blanc cleared in race quotas row .

"Editor's note: Daria Roithmayr is a law professor at the University of Southern California, Gould School of Law, where she teaches on race and law. She worked for Sen. Edward Kennedy as special counsel on the Clarence Thomas and David Souter confirmation hearings. Guy-Uriel Charles is a law professor at Duke Law School where he is the founding director of the Center on Law, Race, and Politics. Daria Roithmayr says Sotomayor would add broader life experiences to the background of Supreme Court justices. No one was surprised when the subject of race dominated the public conversation during Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. What was surprising was how unwilling both sides of the aisle were to talk about race openly. Republicans tried to argue that race should be completely separated from judicial decision-making. For their part, Democrats tried to minimize the importance of her race to her decision-making by focusing on her record, to show that her race had played no role in her decisions. Judge Sotomayor herself suggested that life experiences are an important part of the process of judging, but then sought to minimize the difference that those experiences might have made to a particular result. Most people understand that life experiences and racial identity do affect the decision-making process. But is this something to be lamented or celebrated? We think the latter. In this, the not quite post-racial era of Obama, scholars are developing new understandings of the connection between race, life experience and decisions. Researchers such as Scott Page and James Surowiecki are telling us that varied life experiences and ethnicity can improve the result when a group makes decisions together. At the University of Michigan, Page uses mathematical models to show not only that people's backgrounds make a difference in how they think, but far more importantly, that these differences are essential for good collective decision-making. As Page acknowledges, the relationship between life experience and decision-making is an empirical question -- a question of fact to be determined based on research. In some domains -- making decisions about the scope of anti-discrimination law or deciding on a health care policy -- we likely will see that broader life experience makes for better decisions. Surowiecki, who wrote ""The Wisdom of Crowds,"" points out that a group will more often than not come to a better decision than the average individual, so long as the group includes a  range of people with different life experiences and ways of looking at and solving problems. As Surowiecki notes, if the group has enough variation in the information that they bring to the table, their thought processes and their approach to solving problems, the group is more likely to come up with the right answer before an individual, even in some instances when the individual is an expert. The Constitution itself recognizes the importance of life experiences to legal decision-making. Defendants in the criminal process are entitled to a jury of their peers precisely because jurors bring to the process a collection of life experiences that will shape their understanding of the facts and the law. All-white juries are problematic in large part because we believe that the life experiences of jurors are an integral part of their collective judgment of innocence or guilt. We also are coming to understand that race is just one of several structural factors that affect a person's life experiences and life chances, together with economic security, gender, class and geography. These days, the best thinking on race focuses less on racial symbolism and more on understanding how race affects a person's life experiences and life chances -- her access to education, health care, economic and physical security, her experience with the criminal justice system, whether she grew up wealthy or in a public housing project. Thus, we understand that the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. for disorderly conduct after he opened his jammed front door might be a signal of existing racism in law enforcement. But the better way to understand his arrest might be to acknowledge that whether one thinks this is the symbol of continued racism in law enforcement or an officer trying to do his job, in general, Gates' race affects his life chances and life experiences. As an African-American, Gates runs a much greater chance of being arrested during his lifetime than does his white counterpart. We should also acknowledge the role that class plays in life chances -- Gates was able to summon with a simple phone call one of the best criminal lawyers in the country, an opportunity not available to most African Americans. Although we have not yet figured out the meaning of race in this supposedly post-racial era, we know that race still matters, even as we know that it does not matter in the same way that it used to. Democrats and Republicans should acknowledge that having a Latina on the bench will make a difference because it will improve the court's collective decision-making. Wise men and women with different life experiences are more likely to reach a result that is better, that is wiser and that is more just. In that vein, Sotomayor's life story -- in which a Puerto Rican girl from Bronxdale Houses grows up to attend Yale Law School and become a Supreme Court justice -- is a story that should matter to us all.

"(CNN) -- Mario Draghi is stepping on the gas, cutting interest rates to record lows, trying to funnel money into the real economy, and introducing a charge on banks that hold excess reserves with the European Central Bank. He is right to worry. Eurozone inflation is running at less than 1% a year, with several countries already experiencing falling prices. Deflation, and even very low inflation, can be a huge drag on economic activity. There's no encouragement to spend today to avoid higher prices tomorrow -- indeed, falling prices make putting off purchases attractive. Flat or falling prices also make it harder for businesses and consumers to pay off the debts left over from the financial crisis, increasing their reluctance to invest and spend. In the grip of these forces, Japan suffered two decades of stagnation. The eurozone's recovery is already stalling, and a deflationary downward spiral would be a disaster. Unfortunately, Draghi is likely to discover the ECB's gas pedal is already on the floor. There's no way to push money into the economy unless businesses and consumers are ready to borrow it to invest and spend. Today's measures are designed to encourage banks to look harder for borrowers. They aim to do this by lowering banks' costs of borrowing, by imposing some small costs on banks that sit on money rather than lending it out, and by making it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB to fund lending to small businesses. But the banks wouldn't be sitting on money in the first place if they had credit-worthy business clients eager to take out loans. Indeed, rather than clamoring for new loans from the ECB, the banks have been paying down existing ones. What is needed are policies addressed not to lenders, but to potential borrowers and spenders, who are holding back because of the dismal prospects for growth. A significant chunk of responsibility lies on the shoulders of Draghi and other ECB leaders for the eurozone's utter failure to construct a plausible model for growth since the crisis. After a brief period of fiscal stimulus in 2009, the eurozone has pursued an austerity agenda that compounds the weakness of private demand by shrinking public demand. Draghi and his predecessor Jean-Claude Trichet did all they could to ensure monetary easing was accompanied by fiscal tightening, in effect refusing to hit the gas pedal unless governments were standing on the brakes. This seemingly bizarre policy does have a rationale. The idea is to force the countries of the eurozone periphery become more competitive through cutting costs and especially wages, enabling growth through exports rather than domestic demand. To some extent, the policy has worked: savage levels of unemployment and ECB-backed measures to reduce labor bargaining power have lowered costs in the periphery. By the end of 2013, exports accounted for over 27% of eurozone GDP, up from 23% on the eve of the financial crisis. Further, the eurozone trade surplus exceeded 3% of GDP. These figures are the highest since the introduction of the euro. Despite these unprecedented developments, eurozone growth remains exceedingly weak. That demonstrates the deep intellectual failure behind the austerity-competitiveness agenda. The rickety export-led growth model faces another important threat: the euro's dramatic appreciation. Draghi's famous July 2012 pledge to do ""whatever it takes"" to preserve the euro stopped the flight from sovereign bonds and other euro-denominated financial assets. Trade surpluses also tend to promote currency appreciation. The stronger euro raises the prices of the currency bloc's businesses versus their competitors, reversing a substantial portion of the painfully won competitiveness gain. This accounts for the efforts of Draghi and others to talk the euro down, but the effect has not offset the appreciation. While Draghi clearly hopes that today's measures will further weaken the euro, they are unlikely to have much effect. For all their exceptional character, today's ECB measures are, at best, efforts to shore up a fundamentally misguided growth model that is doomed to collapse. A serious policy to fight deflation requires putting both feet on the gas, with monetary stimulus and fiscal stimulus working together, a model that has had some success in Japan. It requires abandoning the mirage of export-led growth as a savior for the eurozone, and vigorous efforts to stoke demand by increasing government spending and promoting wage growth. Only this will lead to a virtuous circle of borrowing, lending, and growth, and a sustainable rate of price growth. But Draghi's statement today revealed how very far he is from recognizing this point. He once again reiterated his support for austerity-led policies whose only coherent rationale is to promote falling (or at best stagnant) prices in the eurozone's periphery: in other words, precisely the deflation he claims to wish to avoid. Until this fundamental contradiction is resolved, the eurozone is going nowhere. Read more: ECB cuts rates to head off deflation risk .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 30 people were killed Sunday in raids by suspected Boko Haram Islamists on four Christian villages in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borno, residents and a priest said. Gunmen on motorcycles stormed the villages of Kwada, Ngurojina, Karagau and Kautikari, opening fire on residents and hurling explosives into homes and churches. The villages are near Chibok, scene of the April 14 abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls, . Barnabas Tanko, a member of a local vigilante group in Kwada, 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Chibok, said the gunmen, believed to be Boko Haram insurgents, attacked the village around 8:00 a.m. Witnesses say the gunmen pursued fleeing residents into the bush and shot them dead. In Kwada, the entire village, including its five churches, was burned by the marauding gunmen. ""We have confirmed that 30 bodies have so far been recovered in the four villages attacked by the gunmen,"" said Enoch Mark, a Christian priest in Chibok. It is difficult to say how many people were killed because the gunmen on motorcycles pursued residents fleeing into the bush and shot them dead, Mark added. ""We now have to wait until things calm down to scour the bushes to collect bodies,"" Mark said. Dark smoke coming from the directions of the four villages could be seen from Chibok. Mark said it was from burning homes. ""They are no doubt Boko Haram. They opened fire on residents, some worshipping in churches, and set buildings on fire with explosives,"" Tanko said. ""They burnt five churches and the entire village before proceeding to Ngurojina, Karagau and Kautikari,"" Tanko said. Military response was slow, Mark said, allowing the gunmen ample time to inflict massive carnage on the villages. A military fighter jet deployed five hours later and the gunmen sneaked into the bush, Tanko said. Residents of the four villages who were able to escape have fled to nearby towns and Maiduguri, the state capital.","At least 30 people are dead after raids in Nigeria, residents say .

"(CNN) -- From the sweeping coastlines of Kalamata to the sun-scorched island of Crete, Greece's olive groves have been thriving in the Mediterranean heat for thousands of years. The tiny green fruits are harvested before autumn sets in, and cold pressed to deliver extra virgin olive oil, regarded as an elixir of life. The Greeks believe this oil is the world's best. But the world, Greek brothers Thomas and George Douzis realized, did not. So, in 2007, the Douzis brothers developed a plan to take Greek produce to the global stage. It was an idea that would also, inadvertently, make the Douzis brothers early examples of the country's grass-roots survival strategy. The Douzis, now aged 27 and 30, grew up in coastal town of Thessaloniki, where their grandfather Thomas owned a grocery store, selling everyday products such as olive oil or honey to locals. Their father, Thodoris, was also in the food business, working for Kellogg's before setting up his own food distribution company. The brothers were raised on Greek delicacies, but as they grew older they realized the food they loved had a global image problem. Take Greek olive oil's reputation around the world. According to market research, shoppers preferred Italian and Spanish oils, despite 80% of Greek olive oil being extra virgin, compared to 45% in Italy. The Douzis had found their mission. ""The perception abroad is that Greek oil is the cheap one. Bottom of the shelves,"" Thomas Douzis says. As a marketing graduate, he had a plan to change that image -- and a lot more. The brothers would find the best independent producers in the country and take their products global, with a guarantee of quality. Greek olive oil, honey and other delicacies were in their sights. The brothers chose the brand Ergon -- the Greek word for project -- and set out to find the country's best produce. In the tiny Kolymvary region of Western Crete, they found the olive oil they wanted to promote. It came from olives whose history on the island dated back to the Venetian occupation, 800 years ago. The caliber was so high the area had been granted special status from the European Union. Pressed in low temperatures and strictly by mechanical means, the region's oil was among the purest in the world. It got the Ergon approval. The brothers were also spending hours in labs testing Greek's best honey for purity and sugar content -- choosing a blend which they called ""Bee's project"" to finally launch Ergon. The brand was in the market. But it was headed straight into an economic storm. Ergon launches, Greece stumbles . As the Douzis brothers developed their business plans, the country's finances were beginning to unravel. Greece had hosted the Summer Olympics in 2004 which had left the country on a high -- but blown its budget. By 2008, Greece was in recession. By 2010, it had taken its first bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, and was forced to introduce austerity measures. It slashed through people's pensions, incomes and jobs, and fed soaring unemployment. But by 2010, Ergon was an established brand, selling five lines of traditional products including spreads, canned fish, beans, mushrooms and wild truffles. The crisis, for the Douzis, fed a ""nothing to lose"" attitude that ultimately boosted their success. As Greece recovers from its financial meltdown, other young entrepreneurs have emerged as flag-bearers for a new audacity and style. And many are doing so as expats, after being forced out of the country by the crisis. Greek diaspora lift those left behind . In London, Reload Greece is typical of this change. Set up in 2012 to create a hub for Greek entrepreneurs, it promotes the idea expats can help their troubled homeland from afar. It reflects the exodus of Greek youth who went searching for better career prospects, and have since proved a surprising force for the country's recovery. Reload's general manager, Markos Kiosseoglou, left Greece for an education in England and the U.S., working in start-ups and multinationals. Like many of his compatriots, his Greek bloodlines run strong and he set up Reload, in his words, to ""let people do whatever they do, and find ways to connect them to Greece and help Greek communities."" Thomas Douzis is one of Reload's supporters. He has assisted with events and mentored potential ""reloaders"" about his own experiences of doing business with small-scale Greek operators. ""Greece used to be a country with lots of entertainment, tourist sector, big summers... now it is much more stressed environment,"" Douzis says. ""This generates more passion to perform."" Manos Sifakis is another example of the Greek renaissance. He started his multimedia marketing company Customedialabs as a part-time, one-man operation during compulsory Greek army service in 2000. Working for clients based around the world, Sifakis had a network of customers by the time he finished his service, and started working full-time. Since then, it has become an international agency with offices on two continents and high-profile clients including Johnson & Johnson, ING and Exxon Mobile. Sifakis is now based in Philadelphia, after following his American wife Maria to the U.S. He runs the agency from Pennsylvania, although most of his 60 employees in the Greek city of Larissa, where he is originally from. ""Truthfully, if I didn't have Greece, I wouldn't be in business,"" Sifakis says. And it's not cost which keeps him tapping his homeland. ""There are many places around the world with talented workforce that would be more cost-effective. ""The number one advantage is the loyalty. My most loyal talent is in Greece. I have people there who have been working for me for many years."" He hopes to hire as many young Greeks as possible. ""Greece can be successful if you find people who can inspire and lead the change,"" Sifakis says. 'Winners in a crisis' The Douzis are of this ilk. Ergon, born as Greece's economy collapsed, now has a network of 150 producers who support seven stores and delis in Greece, one in London and another being prepped for Brussels. The brothers' ambitions reach beyond Europe -- by 2017, they want to be in the U.S., where demand for fresh Greek products has grown rapidly since Americans discovered, and fell in love with, the country's traditional thick yoghurt. According to Thomas Douzis, looking back at Ergon's beginnings, ""we started in a very, very bad situation and proved that we can be winners in crisis."" Douzis recalls trying to convince the producers to join Ergon when it was in its infancy. ""Greece was wealthy back then, so we had to convince them that these two young brothers from Thessaloniki can do that job, that we can help them sell their products,"" he says. Back then, many producers didn't have barcodes or an English language list of their ingredients. Now, thanks to Ergon and despite the country's devastating crisis, their products are being enjoyed at a trendy restaurant just off Oxford Street, the main shopping hub in the heart of London. There, in Ergon's flagship London restaurant, Greece's traditional salad is created out of coarsely cut tomatoes, chunks of colorful peppers, a samphire garnish and feta cheese cream. But the key ingredient is the basil-infused olive oil that pulls the disparate flavors together. It is the oil made by small-scale farmers, under the sun of the Kolymvary region, in Western Crete.

"(CNN) -- Microsoft kept its eyes forward and revealed what is coming for the Xbox One this year and next at its 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo briefing in Los Angeles, California. However, it is what they didn't talk about that might be more interesting. Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox division at the Redmond, Washington, company hosted nearly 90 minutes of gameplay demonstrations, cinematic trailers, and the company's vision for its home entertainment console. But unlike last year, when the company rolled out its Xbox One console heavily touting its connection to Kinect, the troubled hands-free controller only got one brief mention during a segment on independent development. There also were no mentions of other forms of entertainment on the console in the software-focused presentation. ""It fits the strategy of turning around 180 degrees,"" said German gaming journalist Stephan Freundorfer. ""Last year, they showed very little gaming. This year, they showed nothing but games."" Microsoft originally bundled the Xbox One and the Kinect system together -- saying it was the best way to enjoy entertainment on the console. Recently, they said they were heeding customer feedback when the company released an Xbox One without the Kinect at a cheaper price. ""It is a risky game they are playing,"" Freundorfer said. ""Game makers now have to make the decision whether to make games with the Kinect."" Earlier this month, 45 new entertainment apps were made available, offering more content choices through the Xbox One. But that was all absent from Monday's event. Even more peculiar, Spencer mentioned Sony and Nintendo by name and offered praise to those companies for joining Microsoft in shaping the future of entertainment the best way they know how -- through gaming. He said the entire briefing would be about gaming and promised a slate of titles for this year, plus a strong look at next year and beyond. The greatest reaction came when Master Chief, the iconic character from the ""Halo"" franchise, appeared on the screen. ""Halo 5: Guardians"" is expected to be a personal journey for Chief. The creators at 343 Industries wanted players to remember where Chief came from, so this fall, ""Halo: Master Chief Collection"" will contain all four previous games, completely unlocked and playable in a seamless sequence up to the beginning of ""Halo 5."" There is also content coming to mark the 10th anniversary of ""Halo 2."" Other third-party titles showed off what's to come this year on the Xbox One. ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,"" ""Assassin's Creed Unity,"" and ""Disney Fantasia: Music Evolved,"" are part of the strong slate of games that will be available by the end of the year. Looking to 2015 and beyond, a world-premier video showed the next chapter for protagonist Lara Croft with ""Lara Croft: Rise of the Tomb Raider."" Independent game makers were also highlighted by the computing giant. Hundreds of new games are expected as more creative talent takes advantage of ID@Xbox, a publishing platform for independent developers. The program offers indie companies the chance to build, hone, develop, and self-publish games on the Xbox One. Spencer closed the show reiterating Microsoft's commitment to building and developing great games. ""We are ready to invest to bring new creators to the Xbox One,"" Spencer said, adding the investment will ""shape the future of the New Xbox."" It wasn't quite the buzz of last year's presentation of a new console. But Monday's showcase perhaps signaled a renewed focus for Microsoft on what makes gamers happy: games.","Microsoft's E3 presentation had virtually no mention of the Kinect system .
By contrast, the company highlighted its use with Xbox One last year .
Entertainment apps also were shunned in favor of game talk .

"(CNN) -- After a series of raids, police made new arrests in the public stoning death of a pregnant Pakistani woman, bringing the total of people in custody to 12. Farzana Parveen, 25, was killed in Lahore last month because she married a man against her family's wishes. The latest arrests include her two brothers and her ex-husband. The mob of 28 people that attacked her included members of her immediate family, authorities said. Shortly after her death, police arrested five people, including her father, her uncle, two cousins and the driver who brought the relatives to Lahore. The court is treating the death as an act of terror that has ""wider consequences on the safety and well being of all of society,"" according to lawyer Maliha Zia of Aurat Foundation, a Pakistani women's rights organization. She said she was worried that international pressure may have forced the government to convene an anti-terrorist court in an act of ""show and tell."" Pakistani police officers will be investigated because they didn't intervene when Parveen was publicly beaten to death with bricks, a court official said. Such killings not uncommon . Such killings often originate from tribal traditions in Pakistan but are not a part of Islam. They usually happen in rural areas, not large cities such as Lahore. Human rights activists said bystanders, including police, often don't intervene because the killings are considered family matters. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 869 women were victims last year in the nation of about 180 million people. Women's rights advocates say the actual number may be much higher. The United Nations estimates that at least 5,000 women worldwide die yearly in such killings. The prevalence of violence against women in Pakistan became apparent when Parveen's husband, Mohammad Iqbal, revealed to CNN that he killed his first wife six years ago so he could marry her. His son said Iqbal served a year in prison.","Farzana Parveen, 25, was fatally beaten with bricks .

"(CNN) -- One person was reported dead and numerous boats and harbors suffered damage in the United States after the tsunami triggered by the massive earthquake off Japan swept across the Pacific Ocean at jet speed Friday. The fatality was reported in northern California's Del Norte County, where a 25-year-old man was declared dead Friday afternoon after being swept out to sea off a beach while trying to photograph the tsunami's arrival, said Joey Young, a spokesman for the county's emergency operations center. ""We had one person reported missing who has been confirmed dead,"" Young said. ""The Coast Guard has been doing a search for the body, but the oceanic conditions are making it very difficult."" The victim's name had not been released late Friday. He had been standing on a sandbar at the mouth of the Klamath River when he was washed away, Young said. Two of his friends were carried off as well, but were able to return safely to shore, he said. The tsunami struck the Hawaiian Islands shortly after 3:07 a.m. Friday (8:07 a.m. ET) -- less than eight hours after the magnitude 8.9 earthquake struck off Japan, where nearly 300 people had been reported killed by early Saturday. The Hawaiian capital Honolulu is nearly 3,800 miles (6,100 km) from the epicenter of Friday's quake. It brought six-foot waves to Maui, where harbors remained closed Friday night, and brought 8.1-foot waves to Crescent City, California, about 15 miles north of where the only known U.S. fatality occurred. A tsunami warning was in effect in the rural area north of Redwood National Park where the victim and his friends had dared to go on the beach. He was declared dead Friday afternoon, after Coast Guard helicopters searched for him for five hours, said Lt. Todd Vorenkamp, a Coast Guard spokesman. ""The shoreline here is a dangerous, treacherous place on a good day, and with a tsunami warning, it's exponentially worse,"" Vorenkamp said. California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for four coastal counties Friday as the ocean surge inundated beaches, ports and harbors and prompted the opening of emergency shelters. In addition to Del Norte, the declaration covered Humboldt, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties in northern California. Harbors in California and Hawaii bore the brunt of scattered damage in the United States. In Crescent City, a commercial fishing center near the Oregon state line, docks and about 35 vessels in its harbor suffered damage, Young said. In Alaska, Gov. Sean Parnell reported no damage from the tsunami Friday. U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Rick Foster told CNN that all California ports were open, but oil and hazardous materials transfers were suspended until further notice. Cutters and helicopters were deployed in several areas of the state, including Santa Cruz, south of San Francisco, where several vessels were overturned or broke loose from their moorings in a marina. There were no reported injuries or distress calls, said Foster. Sensors on the southern end of the island of Hawaii, sometimes called the ""Big Island,"" were wet, indicating ocean water had come at least 100 feet ashore, officials said. The Coast Guard reported that a house on the Big Island had been washed into Kealakekua Bay. Harbors reopened Friday afternoon in U.S. Pacific territories and all Hawaiian islands except Maui, where all remained closed late Friday, the Coast Guard reported. At least 10 recreational vessels in Hawaii were sunk by the tsunami, and about 200 boats were reported damaged in Oahu's Keehi Lagoon alone. Businessman Charlie Leonard, who lives on the 19th floor of a condo on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, said Hawaiians took this tsunami more seriously than they did following a February 2010 earthquake in Chile. ""You could hear a pin drop in Waikiki,"" Leonard said. ""It came home to people,"" he said, referring to the devastation in Japan. ""I think everybody's grateful"" that damage does not appear to be major in Hawaii. Leonard and a business partner operate a waste and recycling business and had to move about 50 trucks late Thursday. Geraldine DeConte, owner of Hilo Harry's Taxi, told CNN there was a small surge of water onto land, but conditions were ""pretty moderate. It's no big thing,"" she said. Her business, fortunately, is on higher ground. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center predicted the waves, which came in about every 15 minutes, and said they were ""not going to be a major damaging event"" for Hawaii. It appeared the state's residents had heeded calls to move away from the coast, and Honolulu officials told residents to ""be aware that inundation effects could continue for several hours."" ""We called this one right,"" the warning center's Gerard Fryer said. ""This evacuation was necessary."" The threat of a tsunami prompted the U.S. National Weather Service to issue a warning for at least 50 countries or territories around the Pacific after the 8.9-magnitude earthquake struck Japan on Friday. The warnings for Guam and Indonesia were later lifted. CNN's Carter Evans in Hawaii, Casey Wian, meteorologist Sean Morris and Phil Gast and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: The tsunami sunk 10 boats in Hawaii, the Coast Guard reported .

"(CNN) -- Frustrated Republicans are retaliating for a Democratic play to weaken their hand in opposing presidential nominations, forcing an all-night session into Thursday's early hours. Votes on judicial and other appointments took place early Thursday morning, part of the fallout after the Democratic majority enforced a rule change to expedite consideration of appointments, the so-called nuclear option. Until last month, longstanding Senate rules required a supermajority of 60 votes to break a filibuster over a presidential nominee. Republicans fiercely opposed the change, which now allows the majority Democrats to break filibusters with 51 votes. Democrats, who hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate, said Republicans had abused the filibuster privilege around President Barack Obama's nominations, and the only way for him to staff his second-term administration promptly and move stalled judicial appointments was to speed things up through a rules change. ""The Obama administration and its allies have done just about everything to get what they want, one way or the other -- even fundamentally altering the contours of our democracy when they couldn't get their way playing by the rules,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in floor remarks Wednesday. ""We saw the culmination of that with the majority leader's power grab in the Senate last month."" 5 ways life changes in the Senate after nuclear option . Republicans are requiring the marathon session if Democrats want to clear a long list of nominees before leaving for vacation next week. GOP escalation of the rules fight renewed attention to sharp partisan wrangling one day after lawmakers trumpeted a compromise House-Senate budget proposal brokered across party lines. The first vote in the extended session came shortly after 1 a.m. ET as the Senate approved 51-44 Nina Pillard's nomination on the federal appeals court in Washington. For some, the appointment has been a steppingstone to the Supreme Court. The Senate will continue plowing through the backlog of nominees later Thursday. Senators will vote on the confirmation of Chai Rachel Feldblum to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Senate Democrats began enforcing the ""nuclear option"" this week, stoking Republican ire. All-nighters could continue for days. Democratic leaders said they were prepared to stay in session virtually around the clock through Saturday night to confirm a list of 10 nominees to a variety of senior posts. They range from lesser-known appointments -- such as Patricia Wald to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board -- to critical positions -- such as Jeh Johnson to be homeland security secretary. There are also several federal district court judge appointments on the list as well as nominees to Pentagon posts and the State Department. Customarily, Senate leaders work together so the chamber can conduct its business during more regular hours. But because of strict parliamentary rules, it's easy for just one senator to hold things up. In this case, the whole GOP conference is upset. What's the nuclear option? So why are they working overnights? According to Senate rules, a certain number of hours of debate can still be demanded by any senator once a filibuster is broken. Known as ""post-cloture debate time"" in Senate parlance, up to eight hours of debate time is allowed for nine of the 10 nominees on Majority Leader Harry Reid's list. For Johnson, the homeland security nominee, debate can last for 30 hours. Typically, Senate leaders would agree to allow that debate time to run with the Senate out of session. But Republicans are angry about the changes to the filibuster rules and are requiring the Senate to stay in session. Reid accused Republicans of obstructionism. ""It is hard to imagine a more pointless exercise than spending an entire day waiting for a vote whose outcome we already know,"" Reid said about the Pillard nomination. ""But Republicans insist on wasting time simply for the sake of wasting time. It's no wonder Americans overwhelmingly support the changes Democrats made to the rules last month in order to make the Senate work again.""","NEW: Senate approves Nina Pillard 51-44 to serve on federal appeals court in Washington .

"(CNN) -- Last week, we clued you in to all the annoying things that couples must cease doing on Facebook. This week, we're taking a look at the other side of the coin. What should you do about all the digital remnants of a relationship when you're no longer flitting through fields, holding hands and weaving flowers Lady Chatterley's Lover-like into one another's various expanses of hair? (i.e., after you've broken up.) A quick story that's not specifically true but is likely true for many a person: Suzie has a new beau, Johnny, and they are, oh, so in love. Like, two straws, one milkshake in love. And Suzie detests sharing because she's an only child, so you know that's big. Naturally, the two become Facebook friends, because, well, the site has 900 million users and based on Lord Zuckerberg's official decree, you don't actually KNOW anyone until you click ""friend."" Suzie is happily clicking through Johnny's pictures and scrolling through his timeline when she notices a girl named Sally has commented on quite a few snaps and left wall posts with some quite explicit descriptions of what she wants to do to his sloped-shoulder physique. Suzie is thrown into a rage that only the most only of only children can make manifest, then she realizes that the posts are from two years back. The next time she and Johnny are slurping some frozen milk she asks for the story, and Johnny reveals that Sally was his old flame, a college sweetheart who has long since lost the sweetness and acquired a whip (the accessory of choice for anyone in her rather dominating profession). Suzie heaves a sigh of relief but still finds herself haunted by Sally's vinyl-swaddled ghost, wondering what Sal had that she lacks, and what macabre moves Johnny might be into. The couple splits over (banana) splits just weeks later. It's a science-proven fact (or, at least, there's a study supporting it): Social networks like Facebook increase jealousy, partly because information is much more accessible, and that information can often be ambiguous. Our lives are now on display for all the world to see, but often we're not there to explain ourselves when our most loved of loved ones are perusing. That's why we're suggesting this week that our readers do a little bit of a purge. You likely have years' worth of romantic failure riddled throughout your Facebook profile -- old pictures, wall posts, comments, messages -- and it's not really a good look. It's basically the digital equivalent of having a box of your ex's stuff, but instead of hiding it in your closet, you're displaying it in your living room for all visitors and cable men to see. And see it they will -- a recent study by Seventeen magazine shows that 60% of respondents look at romantic interests' Facebook profiles daily. We get that you might want to hold onto some of these memories. We wouldn't ask you to throw away every old love letter or snapshot in your closet, but there's a more discrete way to do so. Download your Facebook profile for safekeeping. That way you'll have a record of all photos, messages, wall posts and comments you may have received from a former beau. Once you have done so, it's time to wipe that slate clean once and for all. Here's how: . 1). Put your status in stealth . Don't go down the winding road that is ""making it Facebook official"" in the first place, even though most couples reportedly do. Not only is changing your status back after the breakup horrible and humiliating, Facebook Timeline makes it way too easy to scroll back and see activity like relationship reduxes. When it comes to what the sitcoms whimsically call ""The Ex Files,"" let your mouth do the talking, not some post from June 4, 2011. Note: It's totally fine to change your status to ""married,"" since that's likely not changing any time soon (we hope). However, apparently close to 50% of brides (of those surveyed) do so BEFORE the wedding, which we wouldn't recommend. Cold feet, anyone? 2). Untag, untag, untag . After you take any and all pictures of you and your former off of Facebook (this is kind of a given, why would anyone keep public pics of long-dead lip locks on public display?), untag pictures where the two of you look cozy from friends' galleries. You might even want to ask pals to take them down wholesale. As we said, you don't have to get rid of said pics (download your profile or particular pictures), but no one wants to see their new hand-holder holding hands with someone old. 3). Silence old comments . We're not suggesting that you go through every picture and post and purge your ex's exclamations, but perhaps deep six any lengthy epistles or outpourings of love. If your new squeeze is turned off by an errant comment on an early college snap in which you're sporting flared jeans and pigtails, s/he's probably too jealous anyway. And blind, apparently, because that rhinestone top you're wearing is the real mood killer. 4). Unfriend exes . Now this is a tough one. A lot of you out there purport to be friends with your ex. We believe you. This is totally possible. We've seen such cases with our own jaded eyes. But you are not, my friend, pals with each and every person you've ever dated, so why are they still hanging around on Facebook, liking your snaps and writing ""haha"" on your most witty of witty posts? Here's a good litmus test: Do you refer to these ""friends"" as ""my ex so and so"" or ""my friend so and so?"" If it's the former -- and you never actually hang with this person IRL -- it's time to kill this digital sham of a friendship.","Social networks like Facebook increase jealousy because information is more accessible .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese satellite probing the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ""observed a suspected crash area at sea,"" a Chinese government agency said -- a potentially pivotal lead into what thus far has been a frustrating, fruitless search. China's State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense announced the discovery, including images of what it said were ""three suspected floating objects."" The objects aren't small: 13 by 18 meters (43 by 59 feet), 14 by 19 meters (46 by 62 feet) and 24 by 22 meters (79 feet by 72 feet). For reference, the wingspan of an intact Boeing 777-200ER like the one that disappeared is about 61 meters (200 feet), and the plane's overall length is about 64 meters (210 feet). The images were captured around 11 a.m. on March 9, the day after the plane went missing, but weren't released until Wednesday. The Chinese agency gave coordinates of 105.63 east longitude, 6.7 north latitude, which would put it in waters northeast of where it took off in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and south of Vietnam, near where the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand. ""It's where it's supposed to be,"" Peter Goelz, a former National Transportation Safety Board managing director, told CNN's Jake Tapper, noting the ""great skepticism"" about reports the plane had turned around to go back over Malaysia. ""I think they've got to get vessels and aircraft there as quickly as humanly possible."" This isn't the first time authorities have announced the discovery of objects or oil slicks that might be tied to aircraft. Still, it is the latest and comes on the same day that officials, rather than narrowing the search area, more than doubled it from the day earlier to nearly 27,000 square nautical miles (35,000 square miles). The vastness of the area and the limited details that authorities have given makes it hard to tell whether the spot that the satellite imagery captured has been searched. A Malaysian air force official, who is not authorized to speak to the media, did say Thursday morning that its aircraft were heading to that area. Bill Palmer -- author of a book on Air France's Flight 447, which also mysteriously went missing before its remnants were found -- said having a search area of that size is immensely challenging. He compared it to trying to find something the size of a car or truck in Pennsylvania, then widening it to look for the same thing in all of North America. ""It's a very, very difficult situation to try to find anything,"" Palmer told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""Looking for pieces on the shimmering water doesn't make it any easier."" The Chinese satellite find could help, significantly, in that regard. ""I think the size of the pieces ... everything we've heard... gives good cause to believe that we've now (refocused) the area,"" former Federal Aviation Administration official Michael Goldfarb told CNN. ""And that's a huge relief to everybody ... I think it's a high chance that they're going to confirm that these (are) pieces of the wreckage."" But not every expert was convinced this is it. Clive Irving, a senior editor with Conde Nast Traveler, said that the size of the pieces -- since they are fairly square and large -- ""don't conform to anything that's on the plane."" Tom Haueter, a former NTSB aviation safety director, said he'd be ""surprised"" if the objects came from the plane, rationalizing that anything that big wouldn't float. Regardless, time is of the essence -- both for investigators and the loved ones of the plane's 239 passengers and crew, who have waited since Saturday for any breakthrough that would provide closure. The flight data recorders should ""ping,"" or send out a signal pointing to its location, for about 30 days from the time the aircraft set off, noted Goldfarb. After that, Flight 370 could prove exponentially harder to find. ""It's the only clue that we've had so far,"" CNN aviation expert Richard Quest said of the satellite imagery clues. ""If this doesn't prove to be the wreckage of 370, then we're back to square one."" Timeline of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 . Vietnamese minister: 'Insufficient' information . The Malaysia Airlines flight set off seemingly without incident early Saturday, not long after midnight, en route to Beijing. Then, around 1:30 a.m., all communication cut off over a location south and east of where the Chinese satellite images were shot. Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the head of Malaysia's civil aviation department, said around 6 a.m. Thursday in Kuala Lumpur -- hours after China's announcement -- that his agency had not seen the images. This assertion comes amid frustration about the investigation, search and communication surrounding both. Relatives of those aboard the plane have expressed outrage, with video showing some of them angrily throwing water bottles at airline officials. And on Tuesday, a middle-aged man -- who said his son was on that plane -- shouted, ""Time is passing by,"" before bursting into tears. Some involved in the multinational search operation have also vented about the ordeal. Most of those on the flight were Chinese, and the Chinese government has urged Malaysia to speed up the pace of its investigation. And Phan Quy Tieu, Vietnam's vice minister of transportation, has characterized the information that Malaysian officials have provided as ""insufficient."" ""Up until now we only had one meeting with a Malaysian military attache,"" he said. For now, Vietnamese teams will stop searching the sea south of Ca Mau province, the southern tip of Vietnam, and shift the focus to areas east of Ca Mau, said Doan Luu, the director of international affairs at the Vietnamese Civil Aviation Authority. Malaysia's transportation and defense minister Hishamuddin Bin Hussein defended his government's approach. ""We have been very consistent in the search,"" he said. How you can help find the plane . Confusion about plane's route . Over the weekend, authorities suddenly expanded their search to the other side of the Malay Peninsula, in the Strait of Malacca, where search efforts now seem to be concentrated. That location is hundreds of miles off the plane's expected flight path. An explanation appeared to come Tuesday when a senior Malaysian Air Force official told CNN that the Air Force had tracked the plane to a spot near the small island of Palau Perak off Malaysia's west coast in the Strait of Malacca. The plane's identifying transponder had stopped sending signals, too, said the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Malaysia's civilian administration appeared to dispute the report, however. The New York Times quoted a spokesman for the Malaysian prime minister's office as saying Tuesday that military officials had told him there was no evidence the plane had flown back over the Malay Peninsula. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: What we know and don't know . The Prime Minister's office didn't immediately return calls from CNN seeking comment. In another shift, Malaysian authorities said at a news conference Wednesday that radar records reviewed in the wake of the plane's disappearance reveal an unidentified aircraft traveling across the Malay Peninsula and some 200 miles into the Strait of Malacca. However, it wasn't clear whether that radar signal represented Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Gen. Rodzali Daud, head of the Malaysian Air Force, said at the news conference. Rodzali said then that officials are still ""examining and analyzing all possibilities"" when it comes to the plane's flight path. As Rob Mark, a commercial pilot and publisher of JetWhine.com, told CNN's Erin Burnett: ""There's so much confusing information flying around about this right now."" Nothing has been ruled out as to what caused the plane's communication systems -- including its crucial transponder -- to suddenly stop working. Terrorism, hijacking, pilot error and a mechanical malfunction all remain just as valid as possibilities now as when the plane went missing. Amid all the confusion and complaints, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Wednesday appealed for patience. ""The families involved have to understand that this is something unexpected,"" Najib said. ""The families must understand more efforts have been made with all our capabilities."" Danica Weeks is trying to keep it together for her two young sons, though the possibility of life without husband Paul is sometimes overwhelming. She's clinging to hope even though, as Weeks told CNN's Piers Morgan, it's ""not looking good."" ""Every day it just seems like it's an eternity, it's an absolute eternity,"" Weeks said from Australia. ""We can only go minute-by-minute ... and hope something comes soon."" What is a transponder?

"Washington (CNN) -- Another brick is falling from the Bush administration's highly touted ""virtual wall"" that was intended to keep illegal immigrants from entering the United States. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Tuesday she will take $50 million in federal stimulus money away from the Secure Border Initiative, also known as SBInet, and spend it on proven, off-the-shelf technology to protect U.S. borders. As originally envisioned, SBInet was to give the United States control of its borders through a system of movable surveillance towers, high-tech sensors, radars, cameras and communication relays that would give Customs and Border Protection agents the ability to see and respond to intruders. But the system, which is being developed by Boeing, has come under withering criticism from the Government Accountability Office and others who say that it has been riddled with problems. Napolitano said the SBInet has been ""plagued with cost overruns and missed deadlines."" She said she is freezing all other SBInet funding beyond money being spent on a 53-mile stretch of border in Arizona until a re-assessment of the project she ordered in January is completed. ""Not only do we have an obligation to secure our borders, we have a responsibility to do so in the most cost effective way possible,"" Napolitano said in a statement. Last year, Napolitano announced that $50 million in stimulus funding would be spent to accelerate deployment of SBInet's surveillance technology and associated command and control technologies. But a homeland security official said DHS is opting to reallocate the money to something the department believes will be more effective at providing border security. Napolitano said Tuesday the money will be spent on commercially available technology, including mobile surveillance, thermal imaging devices, ultra-light detection, backscatter (full body image) units, mobile radios, cameras and laptops for pursuit vehicles and remote video surveillance system enhancements. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Mississippi, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said SBInet has been a ""grave and expensive disappointment."" ""Today's announcement is recognition that this troubled program needs better management and stronger oversight,"" he said Tuesday.","Secure Border Initiative funds will be diverted to proven technology .

"(CNN) -- Leon Walker, a Detroit, Michigan, computer technician, faces a jury trial in February for allegedly hacking into his then-wife's e-mail account. ""She'd asked me to read her e-mails before,"" Walker said in an interview this week. ""She gave me the password before. She didn't hide it."" Walker says the e-mails revealed that Clara Walker, who has been married three times, was having an affair with her second husband. Walker, the third husband, shared the documents with his wife's first husband, who then used them to file an emergency motion to obtain custody of his son with Clara Walker. Leon Walker said he and the first husband were both concerned because, according to Walker, husband No. 2 had a prior arrest on a domestic violence charge. ""He took action with the courts to have himself protected and I took action with the court to have my daughter protected,"" Walker said. When Clara Walker learned how the e-mails made their way into court, she complained to police. Oakland County, Michigan, Prosecutor Jessica Cooper used a state anti-hacking law to charge Leon Walker with a felony. Cooper did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment, but the Detroit Free Press published a voice-mail from her. ""The guy is a hacker,"" Cooper told the newspaper. ""It was password protected, he had wonderful skills, and was highly trained. Then he downloaded them and used them in a very contentious way."" The Michigan statute forbids someone from accessing ""a computer program, computer, computer system or computer network"" to acquire property ""without authorization."" New York criminal defense lawyer Paul Callan said all 50 U.S. states have such laws, but he called this ""a highly unusual use of a criminal statute."" The laws are typically used to prosecute ""some technological guy who's broken into a company's computer system and damaged it or stolen something,"" Callan said. Leon Walker's defense lawyer agreed. ""I find it so hard to believe that our legislature would enact a law and say 'You know what, if husbands and wives are reading each others' e-mail, that's a priority for us and we've got to stop that,'"" attorney Leon Weiss said. Walker said his decision to peek into his wife's e-mail account was like someone kicking in a door to save someone from a burning house. ""Do you kick the door open or do you let it burn?"" Walker said. ""I did what I felt was absolutely necessary."" Clara Walker responded in a written statement submitted by her attorney, saying ""Leon is not the saint portrayed in the media."" ""If you believe news reports you would think he was the faithful husband looking to protect my children. Nothing could be farther from the truth,"" she said. The couple's divorce was finalized earlier this month. CNN's Julie Cannold contributed to this report.","NEW: Clara Walker says her third husband is ""not the saint portrayed in the media""

"(CNN) -- Ahead of the biggest game of his life, Mahamat ""Iggy"" Ignegui has mastered the diplomatic language, if not his nerves. ""I am completely focused on the first match. We have to do it, we cannot lose,"" the Sudanese midfielder tells CNN before boarding a plane from Chad's Ndjamena airport that will continue his remarkable journey to the World Cup. This showpiece event will not feature Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, or any of the other household football names that will light up Brazil this summer. Instead, teams such as South Ossetia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Tamil Sri Lanka will do battle for the Nelson Mandela trophy in Sweden. This is a tournament for the stateless, the marginalized and unrecognized by FIFA -- the ConIFA World Cup. No team has traveled further or struggled harder to make it to Ostersund than Darfur United. The squad is entirely made up of refugees from the conflict that claimed over 200,000 lives, now living in the neglected camps of East Chad. Eleven years on from the conflict, foreign aid and interest has dried up, with rations cut in half and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reporting over 50% prevalence of chronic malnutrition in the camps. ""Life in the camps is better than Sudan now,"" says Ignegui, recalling that in his village even the sheep were killed and every house was destroyed. ""But they destroy youth. We need to improve our skills and go to university. But there are no good schools or hospitals, nothing to do. We need to get out."" Football is providing that release. The camps had always played the game, with cloth balls in the scorching heat, but with the support of U.S.-based humanitarian group i-ACT, a new team was formed in 2012. Thousands of hopefuls from 12 camps participated in tryouts, many traveling for days at their own expense. This was whittled down to a squad of 16 players, who traveled to Iraq for the 2012 Viva World Cup just months after forming, and played their first match in a 15-0 defeat to Northern Cyprus, before Moubarak Haggar Dougom scored their first goal in a 5-1 loss to Western Sahara. Ignegui admits that team-building was a challenge at first. ""We were from five different tribes, all with their own language, so nobody understood each other and everybody was fighting,"" the 25-year-old says. ""But after 10 days of training together we changed our behavior to respect each other, and became like brothers."" That spirit gave rise to their name. While the children of the camps wear the shirts of Real Madrid and Barcelona, Darfur United borrowed its badge from Manchester. Two years on, the team has benefited from regular training under professional coach Mark Hodson. Participation has grown, with 900 girls and boys playing at the new Soccer Academy in Djabal Camp, and several more are planned, while a women's team will be launched next year. But despite such development, the team's attendance in Ostersund was always in the balance. ""Everything came down to the wire,"" says Katie-Jay Scott Stauring, i-ACT's director of operations and community involvement. ""We had a 72-hour fundraising drive to raise $1,850 per player and coach. We made it in time with six minutes to the deadline to pay for the team's airline tickets."" The stress did not stop there, with delays for visas again threatening their participation, as well as diplomatic complications between embassies, before the team was finally allowed to travel. That Darfur United's players will be lining up in Sweden is a reflection of the international goodwill and support behind them. From the volunteer coaches and assistants, to donations received from football fans around the world. NBA basketball star Tracy McGrady contributed the team's kits, and a printing house supplied the logos free of charge, while Turkish Airlines bent its rules for travel requirements. The team will have a difficult assignment in Sunday's opening match against tournament favorite Padania, of the Po' Valley region in northern Italy. While the area was associated with the far-right Lega Nord party, the team now promotes an inclusive message, represented by star player Enock Barwuah -- brother of Italy international Mario Balotelli, who will line up at Brazil 2014. ""It's the first time I play for Padania and I said yes straight away,"" says Barwuah. ""I was born here, and lived here, so I feel a connection. It's a great experience to play with teams from around the world."" Barwuah admits he knows little about his first opponents, but is keen to learn more. There are two main purposes to the tournament, says ConIFA president and former referee Per Anders Blind. ""We work to support ethnicities and isolated regions, and also to educate the world about them, to know they exist and who they are. To show their culture, heritage and traditions."" This is the largest tournament to date for stateless peoples -- replacing the poorly organized Viva events -- with a record 12 teams, and Blind sees limitless potential. ""There are 5,500 ethnicities and regions that cannot play. FIFA have 209 members and we can easily double that,"" he says. ""ConIFA is only 10 months old and members say we have accomplished more than Viva did in 10 years. Sponsors realize we are opening up a whole new market. There are 40 million Kurdish people without a state, for example."" The knockout rounds are expected to sell out in the admittedly modest 6,000-capacity stadiums, and there is evidence of growing public interest in the outposts of football, away from the traditional powerhouses of the game. The story of American Samoa, the world's worst international team, has generated a hit book and film. ""There are so many teams who fall outside the FIFA framework and it's very valuable to give them recognition,"" says Paul Watson, an English football journalist who managed Pacific Island Pohnpei, and now Mongolia. ""The ConIFA competition will give a lot of people a chance to express their identity through football and that's a very valuable thing."" For Ignegui, it is priceless. ""Football has bought joy to a group that has not had good news in a long time. People in our camps are so proud and happy with this team when they see us representing them in the tournament,"" he says. ""It has made a lot of difference to our lives. After 11 years in our small tents, something like this seemed impossible, just a dream."" Although Darfur United's players are desperate to bring the trophy home, perhaps their most important battle has already been won.","ConIFA World Cup is a soccer tournament for stateless teams not recognized by FIFA .

"Vilseck, Germany (CNN)  -- U.S. soldiers interrogated by the Army in the 2007 murders of four Iraqi detainees blamed a military policy they said made it too hard to detain suspected insurgents, a CNN investigation has found. Soldiers questioned in the killings said the sergeant in command of their detachment ordered the suspected insurgents killed because Army rules made it too difficult to hold them. ""They're gonna be right back on the streets,"" one soldier put it. CNN obtained an extraordinary 23½ hours of Army interrogation videotapes that detail the March 2007 executions of the prisoners by three sergeants who were attached to Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment. The tapes show one of the sergeants confessing to the crime, as well as agents from the Army's Criminal Investigations Division telling soldiers involved in the crime that the military's reputation was at stake. On one tape, an Army interrogator compares the potential fallout from the slayings to the scandal over the treatment of inmates at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, telling a soldier, ""This is gonna be ugly, 'cause it is."" ""Just like them knuckleheads who were stacking naked prisoners in the pyramids at Abu Ghraib,"" the interrogator says. ""We walk down the streets, and that's a shame we all carry. And I had nothing to do with that. ""I don't know about you, but I wasn't at Abu Ghraib, but I can tell you half the time I'm walking down the streets, that's what people think when they're lookin' at us: 'Oh, there's those damn Americans that abused those poor prisoners.' "" He added, ""Frat boys get abused worse during pledge week in college than that crap. But it's what the media made of it. What the hell do you think they're gonna make of this?"" The soldiers, who were based in Schweinfurt, Germany, were videotaped in January 2008 during the Army's investigation into what happened at a Baghdad canal the previous March. On the tapes, soldiers blamed the Army's policy of detaining prisoners for the frustration that led to the shootings. By all accounts, the incident began after soldiers from the company were fired upon. The soldiers went to a house where they found four Iraqi men and a small weapons cache. The men were loaded into the back of a Bradley fighting vehicle. But instead of being taken to the detainee housing area, they were driven in a convoy of 13 soldiers to the canal and killed, according to trial testimony and other documents in the case. Pfc. Joshua Hartson, who has since left the Army because of a serious injury, recalled a conversation he had with 1st Sgt. John Hatley, who was in charge that day. ""My first sergeant comes up to me, and pulls me away from everybody, then he asked me if we take them to the detainee facility, the 'DHA,' that they're gonna be right back on the streets doing the same thing in a matter of weeks,"" Hartson told CNN. ""He asked me if I had a problem if we take care of them, and I told him no."" Hartson and other soldiers interviewed by CNN said Hatley was frustrated by the Army's rules for evidence required to hold Iraqi detainees. Hartson was not charged and received immunity for his testimony. The three sergeants who killed the detainees were convicted of premeditated murder and conspiracy in a military courtroom in Germany earlier this year. All three are serving their sentences at the U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Hatley received a life sentence that was later reduced to 40 years; Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Mayo, who had pleaded guilty to the charges, and Sgt. Michael Leahy, a medic, are serving 20-year terms. Hatley and Leahy are appealing their convictions, while Mayo is seeking a lighter sentence. Hatley and Leahy were found not guilty of killing an injured Iraqi in a prior incident. CNN obtained the 23½ hours of interrogation videos, which include Leahy's confession. The Army, citing an ongoing investigation, refused to release the Leahy tapes after CNN requested them under the Freedom of Information Act. However, CNN obtained those tapes and others in which other soldiers who were at the canal were also questioned about their knowledge of what happened. On the tapes, Leahy is asked by an Army interrogator where he shot the Iraqi detainee. ""It was in the back of the head,"" Leahy said. ""I guess in the back of the head."" Leahy admits he fired two shots, but killed only one detainee. The interrogators press him about who killed the fourth Iraqi. ""Like, my arm went up to the right, and I fired again. I'm pretty sure I didn't hit anybody, but I'm not gonna say that because I don't know for sure. I wasn't even looking when I shot the second time. My arm just went to the right."" Leahy finally admits on the tape that his bullet struck the second detainee, but said Hatley fired two more shots that killed the man. Besides Hatley, Leahy and Mayo, two other soldiers received prison sentences but have since been released. The other soldiers at the canal that day were not charged, and received immunity for testifying. The tapes, and the investigative case file obtained by CNN, reveal how the soldiers believed the policy for taking in and holding detainees was not working, and was the reason for the murders. ""Seems like, even if you do your job and take these guys to the detainee center, they just come right back,"" Leahy said on tape. ""The same [expletive] guys shooting at you."" CNN obtained a copy of a January 9, 2005, memo, marked ""draft,"" that imposed detailed standards for evidence soldiers needed before taking in suspected insurgents in Iraq. The memo was written by Maj. Gen. William H. Brandenburg, who oversaw detainee operations at the time. ""Failure to follow these regulations may result in acquittal or premature release of detainees,"" the memo states. Brig. Gen. David Quantock, who now holds that position, told CNN the rules specified in the memo were in effect through the end of 2008. ""Before the memo was written, a person could just bring a detainee to our facility,"" Quantock told CNN. ""We could take them in with little or nothing."" The memo states that ""circumstances permitting,"" evidence of criminal activity should include ""photographs of the physical evidence,"" ""photographs of the detainee at the crime scene or place of capture,"" as well as ""photographs of the detainee next to the evidence."" Other evidence should include a sketch of the crime scene, all physical evidence of the crime, and ""statements written by first-hand witnesses to the criminal activity."" Sgt. Daniel Evoy, who was at the canal but not charged, said on one of the interrogation tapes that getting two statements from Iraqi witnesses was nearly impossible. ""It's pretty hard to get somebody to give us a sworn statement unless they're pretty bad guys. So what we normally do is we pick them up, drive them around a little bit to scare them and then drop them off somewhere,"" Evoy said. Quantock said Iraqi witnesses were preferred, but not required. In documents obtained by CNN, an Army intelligence officer attached to Alpha Company said ""statements from U.S. service members were not accepted as proof of insurgent activity"" and that the detention facility ""required at least two witness statements from Iraqis."" Frank Spinner, Leahy's attorney, told CNN that soldiers are not trained to be police officers who collect evidence. ""As it was, they had to take off their soldier helmet, put on their cop hat, take them to a civilian sort of police station and show evidence that these were people that were shooting at them and if there wasn't enough evidence then they were gonna be released on the street,"" Spinner said. ""But soldiers aren't trained to be cops, and they're not trained to collect evidence and they're not trained in the ways of civilian criminal prosecutions."" Hatley did not testify at his trial. But in a letter from prison to CNN, Hatley wrote ""the guidelines established for detaining and prosecuting the enemy has extensive flaws. Furthermore, the enemy is well aware of these flaws and consistently exploits these to facilitate their release. ""I challenge you to imagine the frustration felt after being engaged in firefights for several hours with the enemy and capture them only to have them released 2-3 days later because you're being told the holding area needs more information on them,"" he wrote. According to the U.S. military, 76,985 detainees have been released out of the 87,011 captured during the Iraq war. ""We've repeatedly found ourselves fighting the same enemy again and again,"" Hatley wrote. Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Britain's love affair with the Tour de France will be rekindled when its 101st edition starts Saturday in a region famed for the literary works of the Bronte sisters and the rugged terrain which provided the setting for their most famous novels. The grueling three week-test over 3,664 kilometers, taking in the unforgiving mountains of the Alps and Pyrenees, will finish in Paris on July 27, but in recent years Le Grand Depart has often taken place outside of France to widen the appeal of cycling's most iconic race. Beating off bids from Florence and Edinburgh, Yorkshire -- which at 15,000 square kilometers and with a population of five million is the biggest county in England -- got the nod from race organizers in 2012. Its biggest city Leeds will host the start of two days of racing in Yorkshire with the first stage finishing in Harrogate and the second going from the cathedral city of York to Sheffield. It will pass through the Yorkshire Dales, the Peak District and the Pennines, with stiff climbs that will provide an early test for the 198 riders from 22 teams teams of nine. The second leg Sunday will indeed see the peloton speed through the small town of Haworth where the Bronte's -- Charlotte, Emily and Ann -- lived in the early 19th century. Their most famous works, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and the Tenant of Wildfell Hall are literary classics set against the backdrop of the wild and windswept moors that surround their birthplace in the West Riding. Local organizers are banking that the worldwide appeal of the Tour will showcase the history and heritage of their region -- dubbed ""God's own county"" by locals -- and attract new tourism. If the huge crowds which greeted the last visit of Le Grand Boucle to Britain in 2007 are anything to go by, that is pretty much guaranteed. All over Yorkshire, Haworth included, towns and cities on the route are bedecked with welcoming signs and references to the unique magic of a race which started in 1903 with the aim of boosting the circulation of a French newspaper L'Auto and has grown to become the biggest spectator event in the sporting calendar. ""The race has excited the public and cycling community and is the biggest sporting event to take place anywhere in the UK in 2014,"" said Larry Hickmott, the editor of the website VeloUK.net and a veteran observer of the British cycling scene. Over a million people are expected to line the roads for the two stages in Yorkshire and the third from Cambridge to the British capital London, before the race heads to its traditional home in France for the remaining 18 stages. The pre-race buildup has been dominated by a row over the decision to leave Britain's most famous cyclist, Bradley Wiggins, out of the Team Sky lineup. Wiggins made history when he won the 2012 edition of the Tour before going on to claim Olympic gold a week later at the London Games. With his trademark sideburns and 'Mod' fashion sense, Wiggins assumed cult status and became a national hero, but his ongoing rivalry with fellow Team Sky member Chris Froome has since taken on the sort of brooding intrigue which would not have been out of place in a Bronte novel. Froome, who had been his right hand man in helping Wiggins win the 2012 Tour, still finishing a fine second, duly won last year's race, with Wiggins absent after illness and crashes in an abortive attempt at claiming the preceding Giro d'Italia. Wiggins might have been expected to return to the Team Sky squad this year, particularly with the race starting in Britain, but instead has been left on the sidelines. His devoted fans believe Froome -- who has been quoted as calling his teammate ""mentally weak"" -- played a part in his exclusion, but this is denied by the Kenyan-born British rider. ""Just to make it absolutely clear, I do not have a role in selection,"" Froome told gathered reporters ahead of the start. Team Sky chief Dave Brailsford said the decision had ""kept him awake at night, but lauded the 29-year-old Froome as the ""the best stage race rider in the world."" Either way, while Froome and his eight teammates begin their quest to bring Team Sky a third straight yellow jersey, Wiggins will likely be training at the Manchester Velodrome ahead of riding the 4km individual and team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. ""The most popular opinion is that Wiggins should ride, both from public and avid cycling fans and even many of 'informed' inside the sport,"" said Hickmott, who has followed his career since he was a youngster. But to understand while Wiggins -- who may well have been capable of finishing on the podium -- has been left out it is necessary to examine the dynamics of a cycling team in its approach to races like the Tour de France. The entire Team Sky squad will act as ""domestiques"" or helpers for Froome, sacrificing their own chances to help him claim the yellow jersey in Paris. At best, Wiggins would have been a ""super domestique"" -- which is a rider who might be expected to step up to the plate if a mishap or illness befell the team leader Froome. Brailsford has given his role to Australian Richie Porte, hailing the Tasmanian as a ""Grand Tour winner of the future"" but has courted further controversy by leaving out young British stars Peter Kennaugh and Ben Swift, who finished first and second at their national championship last weekend. With Swift omitted it will leave Team Sky without a recognized sprinter, the riders designated to contest the bunch finishes at the end of predominantly flat stages. Despite its recent dominance of cycling at the Tour de France and in the Olympics, Britain will only have four competitors in this year's race, but in Froome and sprint king Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) it has two jewels in the crown. Cavendish, who has used his finishing speed to win 25 Tour de France stages, will be hoping his teammates can help him don the yellow jersey after the first stage which finishes in his mother's home town of Harrogate. Last year's green jersey winner Peter Sagan of Slovakia and Germans Andre Greipel and Marcel Kittel will be his main challengers in these finishes -- with all looking to win the coveted final stage on the Champs Elysees in the French capital. But the fastest men on two wheels are not contenders for the overall crown, usually losing time on the mountain stages and the individual time trials which decide that ultimate honor. Froome has proved his worth in both those disciplines, winning the 2013 Tour by over four minutes from Nairo Quintana of the Movistar team. Colombian Quintana won the Giro d'Italia earlier this year, but has decided against a tilt at the Tour, leaving two-time winner Alberto Contador as the likely main challenger to Froome. Contador courted controversy after a positive drugs test which annulled his 2010 Tour triumph and the Spaniard has struggled to repeat his earlier victories since serving his ban, but impressive performances in 2014 serve notice of his abilities. The 31-year-old always protested his innocence after failing a doping control for the banned stimulant Clenbuterol, but his presence as a podium contender will act as a constant reminder that cycling is still struggling to shrug off the doping controversies which have continually haunted the sport. On the eve of the tour came the revelation that Daryl Impey, the first South African to wear the yellow jersey last year, had tested positive back in February after his national championships for a banned substance Probenecid. He was withdrawn from the race by his Orica-Green EDGE team while Froome, who has known Impey since his time in school in South Africa, said that the news was a ""big shock to me."" Tour de France organizers will be hoping this year's event passes off without a further doping story, preferring the positive images of massive crowds lining the route in both Britain and France to cheer on their heroes rather than the darker side of the sport.","101st Tour de France starts from English county of Yorkshire Saturday .

It's the year of the ""selfie"" and the year that social media-transmitted self portraits were taken to new heights, with the arrival of U.S. space agency NASA on Instagram. In less than three months, the space agency has accumulated over 350,000 followers and given them an incredible insight into the day-to-day lives of astronauts and Nasa's work unraveling the mysteries of the universe. NASA launched the account on September 6 -- promising to take its fans on ""an out-of-this-world journey through images of Earth and beyond"" -- and soon spawned a slew of viral trends. The account's first post highlighted the launch of the agency's LADEE research robot. But the spacecraft's lift-off threw up some unexpected results in the form of an ill-fated photobomber, soon to be known as #nasafrog. New photographs from NASA's satelites and spacecraft have spread across the internet, too -- a fresh view of Saturn making headlines -- in addition to candid scenes aboard the International Space Station. Three months in, the account is going strong, picking up hundred more followers each day.

"(CNN) -- Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong tweeted Thursday that he's handed over the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Summer Games, adding that it should be at International Olympic Committee headquarters in Switzerland ""asap."" Earlier this year, the committee stripped Armstrong of the medal he won in Sydney and asked him to return it. Armstrong -- after years of heated denials -- in January admitted to doping throughout his storied career, which included seven Tour de France wins. Armstrong's tweet Thursday included a photo of the medal and said ""the 2000 bronze is back in possession"" of U.S. Olympic officials. Mark Higgins, a key member of Armstrong's camp, did not elaborate on how or why the medal was turned over, beyond saying it was given to the U.S. Olympic Committee. A spokesman for that committee, Patrick Sandusky, confirmed that it has the bronze medal it asked for and added, ""The USOC has made arrangements to return the medal to the IOC."" The Texas-born Armstrong was a rising star when he was diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer at the age of 25. After getting treatment, he returned better than ever -- reeling off his consecutive string of Tour de France victories between 1999 and 2005. Armstrong left the sport after his last win, only to come back four years later and place third in cycling's most prestigious race. His historic rise came at a time when cycling, generally, was mired in repeated doping scandals. Armstrong himself was not immune to such accusations, but each time he fired back at his critics and vehemently insisted he'd been clean. Yet the tide began to turn against Armstrong in June 2012, when the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said it had opened proceedings against him and five of his former teammates. The agency, which is designated by Congress as the country's official anti-doping organization for Olympic sports, announced two months later that it was stripping Armstrong of his Tour de France titles and barring him from future competitions for life. Armstrong remained defiant until sitting down with Oprah Winfrey last January. Calling himself ""deeply flawed,"" Armstrong admitted that he'd used an array of performance enhancing drugs and took blood transfusions to excel in the highly competitive, scandal-ridden world of professional cycling. Armstrong admits using performance enhancing drugs . ""This is too late, it's too late for probably most people. And that's my fault,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A tornado hit the south-central South Dakota town of Wessington Springs on Wednesday evening, briefly trapping some people in their homes. The Jerauld County Sheriff's Office said all have been rescued. ""The tornado hit across the street from the hospital -- really just one block away -- and there is stuff and debris everywhere,"" said JoAnn Hettinger, director of patient care at Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital. Her facility received one patient, she said. In all, 11 homes and three businesses were damaged, according to Roger Dwyer, the Jerauld County emergency management director.

As much as three-fourths of the town of 350 is gone, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger has said. Two people died during that storm, one a 5-year-old. The second death -- a traffic accident -- was probably weather-related, Unger said.

"(CNN) -- Calling himself ""deeply flawed,"" now-disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong says he used an array of performance enhancing drugs to win seven Tour de France titles then followed that by years of often-angry denials. ""This is too late, it's too late for probably most people. And that's my fault,"" he said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired Thursday night. ""(This was) one big lie, that I repeated a lot of times."" Armstrong admitted using testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO -- a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production. It increases the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to muscles, improving recovery and endurance. In addition to using drugs, the 2002 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year admitted to Winfrey that he took blood transfusions to excel in the highly competitive, scandal-ridden world of professional cycling. Doping was as much a part of the sport as pumping up tires or having water in a bottle, Armstrong said, calling it ""the scariest"" that he didn't consider it cheating at the time. 12 telling quotes over the years from Armstrong . The same man who insisted throughout and after his career that he'd passed each of the ""hundreds and hundreds of tests I took"" contended in the interview that he wouldn't have won without doing what he did. While Armstrong didn't invent the culture of doping in cycling, he said, he admitted not acting to prevent it either. ""I made my decisions,"" Armstrong said. ""They are my mistakes."" Armstrong: I was ""a bully"" The first installment in his interview, which was conducted earlier this week with the talk-show host, aired Thursday on the OWN cable network and on the Internet. The second installment will be broadcast Friday night. Armstrong admitted he was ""a bully ... in the sense that I tried to control the narrative,"" sometimes by spewing venom at ex-teammates he thought were ""disloyal,"" as well as suing people and publications that accused him of cheating. He described himself as ""a fighter"" whose story of a happy marriage, recovery from cancer and international sporting success ""was so perfect for so long."" ""I lost myself in all of that,"" he said, describing himself as both a ""humanitarian"" and a ""jerk"" who'd been ""arrogant"" for years. ""I was used to controlling everything in my life."" iReport: Tell us your take on the first part of the interview . The scandal has tarred the cancer charity Livestrong that he founded, as well as tarnished his once-glowing reputation as a sports hero. Those who spoke out against Armstrong at the height of his power and popularity not only felt his wrath but the wrath of an adoring public. Now, with Armstrong stripped of endorsement deals and his titles, those who did speak out are feeling vindicated. They include Betsy Andreu, wife of fellow cyclist Frankie Andreu, who said she overheard Armstrong acknowledge to a doctor treating him for cancer in 1996 that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. She later testified about the incident and began cooperating with a reporter working on a book about doping allegations against Armstrong. Armstrong subsequently ripped her, among others. More recently, he said he'd reached out to her to apologize -- in what Andreu called ""a very emotional phone call."" ""This was a guy who used to be my friend, who decimated me,"" Andreu told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night. ""He could have come clean. He owed it to me. He owes it to the sport that he destroyed."" In his interview with Winfrey, Armstrong said he understands why many might be upset that it took him so long to speak out, especially after going on the offensive for so long. He said he's reached out in recent days to several people, such as Andreu, who publicly accused him of doping and then were attacked -- and in some cases sued -- by him. Bleacher Report: Twitter erupts Thursday night . And the former athletic icon also conceded he'd let down many fans ""who believed in me and supported me"" by being adamant, sometimes hurtful and consistently wrong in his doping denials. ""They have every right to feel betrayed, and it's my fault,"" he said. ""I will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people."" Years of success and defiance, then a rapid fall . The Texas-born Armstrong grew up to become an established athlete, including winning several Tour de France stages. But his sporting career ground to a halt in 1996 when he was diagnosed with cancer. He was 25. He returned to the cycling world, however. His breakthrough came in 1999, and he didn't stop as he reeled off seven straight wins in his sport's most prestigious race. Allegations of doping began during this time, as did Armstrong's defiance, including investigations and a lawsuit against the author of a book accusing him of taking performance enhancing drugs. He left the sport after his last win, in 2005, only to return to the tour in 2009. Armstrong insisted he was clean when he finished third that year, but that comeback led to his downfall. ""We wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't come back,"" he told Winfrey. In 2011, Armstrong retired once more from cycling. But his fight to maintain his clean reputation wasn't over, including a criminal investigation launched by federal prosecutors. That case was dropped in February. But in April, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency notified Armstrong of an investigation into new doping charges. In response, the cyclist accused the organization of trying to ""dredge up discredited"" doping allegations and, a few months later, filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to halt the case. In retrospect, Armstrong told Winfrey he ""would do anything to go back to that day."" ""Because I wouldn't fight, I wouldn't sue them, I'd listen,"" he said, offering to speak out about doping in the future. The USADA found ""overwhelming"" evidence that Armstrong was involved in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program."" In August, Armstrong said he wouldn't fight the charges, though he didn't admit guilt either. And the hits kept on coming. In October, the International Cycling Union stripped him of all his Tour de France titles. Even then, he remained publicly defiant, tweeting a photo of himself a few weeks later lying on a sofa in his lounge beneath the seven framed yellow jerseys from those victories. Then the International Olympic Committee stripped him of the bronze medal he won in the men's individual time trial at the 2000 Olympic Games and asked him to return the award, an IOC spokesman said Thursday. The USOC was notified Wednesday that the IOC wants the medal back, USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said.

"(CNN) -- His trial's over. And now it turns out that George Zimmerman might need the same thing millions of Americans are looking for: a job. As Zimmerman and his legal team mounted their defense, they convinced people across the country to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him. Living expenses, bodyguards and expert witnesses were costly, they argued on websites set up to raise money in the case. So what's next, now that a jury has acquitted him? For the 29-year-old Florida man, the financial picture is cloudy. Critics have already accused Zimmerman of profiting from the case. Will the donations keep pouring in? Will he win a monetary reward in his defamation lawsuit against NBC? Could he cash in on his personal story with a book or movie deal? Beyond the legal costs, Zimmerman's attorney says the case has come at a high price. Fear for his safety has made him live off the grid for months. ""I don't know how he gets a job where he is out in public,"" Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara said, ""without having the fear of somebody finding out where he works."" Expert to Zimmerman: Pick a new career path . Before he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012, Zimmerman had studied criminal justice. He applied to become a police officer in Virginia in 2009, but was rejected due to bad credit, according to testimony in his trial. Even with more money in his bank account, that career path shouldn't be on the table anymore, an expert told CNN. ""That is the absolute worst thing you can do,"" said reputation management counselor Mike Paul. ""It might be your old passion; you need to find a new passion. And it needs to be helping people in a very different way -- a way that is much more compassionate, not just involving law enforcement."" So far, Zimmerman's lawyers and family have been tight-lipped about his next steps. O'Mara describes his client as a marked man, arguing that his options are limited due to death threats he faces. ""The first time that he got out of jail, he slept a lot. I think he is going to have to take a lot of time to relax, to center himself, to get used to his new reality, which is a free man, exonerated,"" brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Sunday. ""And he is going to have to take his own steps as he sees fit, whatever brings him the best result."" Whatever he does, his brother said, it will have to be under the radar. ""As he engages the world, as anyone in his situation would, without restrictions,"" Robert Zimmerman said, ""he's going to have to learn to move about in a very low-profile way and keep to himself."" Race perhaps simplest disagreement in Zimmerman post-trial interviews . Donations fueled defense, led to wife's arrest . But online, at least, being low-profile hasn't exactly been Zimmerman's style. Through websites set up for his defense, he raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars. One site, gzdefensefund.com, raised more than $330,000 in just over a year, according to a spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer. That's in addition to about $200,000 Zimmerman raised on his own through a PayPal account before O'Mara took the case. Where did that money go? A summary on the website gives examples of how Zimmerman spent some of the donations: $95,000 for bail bond, about $56,000 for security and a whopping $61,747.54 for living expenses over an eight-month period. ""If $61,747.54 sounds like a lot of money for living expenses for 8 months -- you are right,"" the website says. ""It's more than most people earn in a year. Most of George's living expenses for the first several months were allocated to providing a safe, secure place for George and his wife, Shellie, to live."" At one point after his arrest, the site says, Zimmerman was hiding out in a location that was so remote that it cost $2,500 to connect a phone line. Raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from supporters for your case is a good thing, right? Well, it wasn't for Shellie Zimmerman, who now faces a perjury charge. Prosecutors allege she lied when she told a Florida judge during a bail hearing for her husband in April 2012 that the family was indigent. In fact, they argue, George Zimmerman actually had about $135,000 at the time. She's pleaded not guilty, and has a court date in the case scheduled for next month. Even if donations keep pouring in, Zimmerman shouldn't necessarily take all the money he's offered, said Gene Grabowski, a crisis public relations manager. ""He's got to be careful to avoid the appearances of creating more divisions by accepting money or support openly from groups that, maybe, that would create more friction because of the tenor of this case,"" he said. ""He's got to be careful about who he associates with afterwards, even if they are offering financial support."" Despite outrage, federal charges uncertain in case . What about a book? A juror in the high-profile case has already inked a deal with an agent for a possible book. Could a book or a made-for-TV movie be in Zimmerman's future? Last week HLN's Nancy Grace said a multimillion-dollar book for Zimmerman would probably be in the offing. And that possibility is already drawing sharp criticism. In an editorial titled ""Zimmerman's acquittal shouldn't lead to riches,"" The Philadelphia Inquirer argued Monday that Zimmerman is ""likely to be offered millions through lucrative book and movie deals."" ""It would be a shame,"" the newspaper said, ""if the unnecessary death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin produced more paydays for the man who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager in the heart during a scuffle."" Civil lawsuits surge to the forefront . Even with the criminal trial over, Zimmerman still is likely to face several legal battles. Activists are pushing for the federal government to file civil rights charges against him. And it's possible Martin's family will file a civil wrongful death case, which could threaten Zimmerman's pocketbook. They haven't said yet if they will. That could be more likely, some analysts say, if it appeared Zimmerman was profiting from the case. A book or movie deal could make Zimmerman more vulnerable to a wrongful death suit, criminal defense attorney Randy Reep told USA Today. And then there's another case that Zimmerman started, suing NBC Universal over edited versions of a 911 call Zimmerman made. That lawsuit alleges that NBC deliberately edited an audio tape of his 911 call to make Zimmerman sound racist. ""Because of NBC's deceptive and exploitative manipulations, the public wrongly believes that Zimmerman 'use(d) a racial epithet' while describing Martin during the call to the dispatcher on that fateful night,"" the suit says. NBC Universal has disputed the accusations. ""There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly,"" the company said last year. ""We intend to vigorously defend our position in court."" The lawsuit says Zimmerman is seeking ""damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit,"" but doesn't specify a dollar figure. Zimmerman's brother says the family is focusing on getting a fresh start. But so far, the verdict hasn't put a stop to debate over the controversial case. And it's unclear what that could mean for Zimmerman's cash flow. CNN's Thom Patterson, David Mattingly, MaryLynn Ryan, Gustavo Valdes, Chris Cuomo and Kate Bolduan, HLN's Graham Winch and In Session's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, won't likely find a safe job, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, I wrote a not-at-all controversial column on this website titled, ""The argument for eating dog."" The piece ran with a visual essay on CNN Photos about the illegal dog meat trade in Southeast Asia, which is just awful to look at. I argued that the dog trade should be cleaned up and made more humane -- but that the same should happen to factory farms here in the United States. The crux of the argument was this: . If we think dog shouldn't be eaten -- like, ever, regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat, and if and why we don't feel the same way about them. Is it because we spend so much time with dogs -- looking into their eyes, talking to them, walking them, picking up their crap -- that we understand that they are living, breathing, feeling beings? Would we feel that way about other animals if we could hang out more? The implication: Eating pig, another highly intelligent animal, is just like eating dog. If we don't want to eat dog -- which I said I didn't -- maybe we should rethink pig and the rest. The Internet had deeper suspicions. And they turned out to be pretty hilarious. Someone claimed to leak an image from my new CNN ""show,"" which ostensibly features me cooking up chihuahua and plopping a Pekingese into a pot for our viewers. It's not real, of course. But some of you seemed to fear that it was. Mashable compiled a list of ""23 People Who Really Don't Want CNN to Eat Their Dogs."" Among them, @gourmetspud: . The Week wrote that I made ""social media explode."" Others pointed to an irony in my Twitter bio, which says I'm ""rooting for the world's underdogs."" When I'm not writing quick columns to go with CNN Photos posts, I run a project at CNN called Change the List, which tries to raise awareness about bottom-of-the-list places. But in the context of the dog piece, I get how weird that looks. Some guy changed it to ""sauteing the world's underdogs."" One of my colleagues here in Atlanta printed out the image of me with the chef's hat and a dalmatian in each hand and taped it to the wall in the newsroom. It got me thinking about how ridiculous -- and awesomely absurd -- it would be if that show actually came to fruition, especially since I'm an advocate for treating animals humanely. Maybe the premier could feature the ethics of pizza delivery dogs. We could call it ""BRING ME YOUR PUPPIES!"" On CNN, 9 p.m. ET. Right after ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Guest host: Sarah McLachlan. Mostly, I feel #sorrynotsorry about the ""controversy"" that column created. I stand by the argument that eating dog is morally parallel to eating pig -- another intelligent, friendly creature. And, to be clear, I'm not saying people should eat dog. I'm saying we should rethink what we eat and why. But apparently America doesn't want to look in that mirror. It's way more fun to say you hope I'll get eaten by a cannibal.

"London (CNN) -- A British spy found dead at his home in 2010 -- his naked body padlocked inside a large red carrying bag stowed in the bathtub -- was either suffocated or poisoned, but it is unlikely his death will ever be satisfactorily explained, coroner Fiona Wilcox said Wednesday. Gareth Williams' death was ""unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated,"" she ruled. He probably entered the bag alive, Wilcox said, reading her ruling to a court around the corner from the home of the world's most famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. But she was sure an unknown person put the bag containing his body into the bath and probably locked it, she said. The case has gripped the British public for more than a year and a half, since Williams, an MI6 agent known for his mathematical genius and codebreaking talent, was found dead at age 31 in August 2010. But after a weeklong inquest at which evidence from hundreds of expert witnesses, security camera images and police interviews was presented, the ""most fundamental questions as to how Gareth died remain unanswered,"" Wilcox said Wednesday. There was ""endless speculation but little real evidence,"" she said. And in unusual criticism of the Secret Intelligence Service, as MI6 is formally known, she said a delay in reporting his death and in providing relevant evidence added to the uncertainties about the case. Some of that evidence came to her only in the last 48 hours of the inquiry, Wilcox said. The coroner appeared briefly overcome with emotion as she came to the end of reading her ruling, her voice faltering as she announced her findings. The cause of death remains unknown, but experts agreed it was either from suffocation or poisoning, she said. ""I am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Gareth was killed unlawfully,"" she concluded. Among the theories aired by UK media were that Williams might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong, neither of which was supported by the evidence, the coroner said. She also cast doubt on suggestions that he was into bondage or transvestism, fueled by the discovery of women's clothes, wigs and cosmetics in his apartment, saying she thought Williams bought them out of an interest in fashion, rather than any sexual motivation. Expressing her sympathies to his family, Wilcox said the inquest could not bring him back, but she hoped it had at least allowed them to see the evidence out in the open. A lawyer for Williams' family said that losing a much-loved son and brother would have been a tragedy in any circumstances but that the nature of Williams' death had made it all the worse. ""Our grief is exacerbated by the failure of his employers at MI6 to take even the most basic inquiries as to his whereabouts and welfare, which any reasonable employer would have taken,"" he said. ""We are also extremely disappointed at the reluctance and failure of MI6 to make available relevant information."" The family has called for the Metropolitan Police to review the role of the intelligence services in the investigation. MI6 head John Sawers apologized ""unreservedly"" to Williams' family for the service's failure to act more swiftly and said measures have been put in place to make sure it doesn't happen again. The detective leading the police investigation, Jackie Sebire, said new lines of inquiry had resulted from the inquest and would now be ""actively pursued."" ""His naked body was found in the most suspicious of circumstances,"" Sebire said. ""It is highly likely that a third party was involved in Gareth's death, and I urge anyone who knew Gareth or who had contact with him to search their conscience and come forward with any information about what happened that night."" Inside the court, a picture emerged of a man who had few friends but was very close to his family, highly intelligent and physically fit thanks to his love of cycling. A math prodigy who had completed his mathematics degree and master's by the age of 21, he was someone who relished a challenge and had received an award for his ""world-class"" work for the intelligence services. Summing up the evidence, Wilcox said it was ""extremely unlikely,"" but not impossible, that Williams had worked out a technique to get into the bag -- measuring just 32 inches by 19 inches (81 by 48 centimeters) -- and lock it from the inside. But, she said, there was no evidence of footprints or handprints on the walls of the bathroom or the bath itself, as might have been expected if he had done that. He was not a risk taker, she said, and that made it unlikely in her view that he would have put himself into the bag even as a personal challenge without making sure he could get out. Of the four keys belonging to the padlock that secured the bag in which Williams was found, one pair was found inside it with him. A second pair was found on a key ring in his apartment, Wilcox said. There was no sign that evidence had been tampered with, such as traces of bleach. There was also no sign of a break-in or robbery in his neat, tidy apartment, she said. She described his body as ""peaceful"" and said there was no indication of a struggle. Wilcox also said there were no indications that Williams was feeling suicidal. However, tests that might have revealed unusual or volatile poisons were ruled out by the decomposition of the body. Traces of alcohol and a chemical matching the party drug GHB were found, but both can occur naturally as part of the decomposition process, she said. British media have reported that Williams' Internet history showed an interest in sex games and bondage, but Wilcox said the codebreaker had made only a handful of visits to bondage sites. The coroner said there was no evidence of interest in claustrophilia, a fetish for enclosure in very confined spaces. His apartment contained 20,000 pounds ($32,000) worth of high-fashion women's clothing, unworn and packed as purchased, Wilcox said, but she said she found no connection between his death and his interest in fashion and women's shoes and clothing. There also was no indication that his death was connected to his work, she said. He had not taken on any high-risk operations, and he worked only in the UK. There was no evidence of threats arising to him from his work, his employers testified. Wilcox was highly critical of Williams' line manager, who did not report that he was missing for about a week after he died August 16. She said the inability of the manager to recall certain key bits of evidence concerning the week of Williams' death ""is beginning to stretch the bounds of credibility."" When questioned, the manager said he assumed Williams was absent for a legitimate reason that he had forgotten about, even though he missed several meetings. They worked on a small team of four people. The manager and other SIS employees testified from behind a screen and were identified only as SIS, plus a letter. Williams was finally reported missing by a co-worker August 23, more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work. ""I can only speculate as to what effect this had on this investigation,"" Wilcox said. The decomposition of Williams' body was hastened by the fact it was in a top floor apartment, where the temperature soared in the summer heat. The heating was mysteriously also turned on, despite it being a hot August, she said. Police did not secure the scene until eight or nine days after Williams died. Reports about the ""body-in-a-bag spy"" describe how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether Williams, who was athletic and of medium height, could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the North Face holdall bag, with a key to the padlock inside. Video provided to the court shows one of them, Peter Faulding, folding himself laboriously into an identical bag placed in a bathtub. Faulding, who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces, told the inquest that he had tried to lock himself into the bag 300 times without success. A second expert witness, also of a size and build similar to Williams, tried 100 times to re-enact the feat without succeeding. Neither ruled out definitively the possibility that Williams could have somehow done it alone. But a small trace of someone else's DNA was found on the bag, helping spawn all kinds of theories about who else might have been there. Williams was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university, working with Government Communications Headquarters before MI6. The nature of his work and questions around why his spy agency bosses took so long to raise an alert about his absence have added to the intrigue surrounding his death. Concerns about national security have been a factor in the 20-month delay in holding Williams' inquest, and an agency more used to working in the shadows has had an uncomfortably bright light shone into its practices. A series of photographs provided by the Metropolitan Police show the tidy, impersonal interior of the spy's Pimlico home and the small white-tiled bathroom where his body was found. A bicycle parked in the hallway is a clue to Williams' passion for cycling. A glimpse through a bedroom door shows a bed half-made, clothes lying on it. But little else can be gleaned from the images. The Metropolitan Police says it is continuing its investigation, particularly in light of the coroner's findings and the concerns raised by his family. But for now, the identity of the unknown person who apparently put the bag holding Williams into the bath, exactly how he died and the reason why, remain as much a mystery as ever.

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong bestrode the sport of cycling like a colossus between 1999 and 2005. His feat of winning seven consecutive titles at the Tour de France -- arguably the world's toughest sporting event -- was like the demigod Hercules completing his ""Twelve Labors."" Armstrong's achievements seemed all the more extraordinary given his against-the-odds recovery after being diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1996. His best-selling autobiography ""It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life"" in 2000 helped give birth to the Armstrong legend, as it recounted his fight for life against a disease that had spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain before he underwent radical treatment and went on to win his first Tour in 1999. This was a sporting story that gave hope to millions across the world. The Texan's battle with cancer led him to set up the Livestrong foundation in 1997, which according to its website has raised close to $500 million in the battle against the disease -- thanks in no small part to the charity's iconic yellow wristbands.

But then came the fall from grace. A demise that is like a Greek tragedy, which is now only awaiting an act of contrition or recognition (anagnorisis) from the 41-year-old, who is expected to admit to his transgressions when a pre-taped interview with U.S. chat show queen Oprah Winfey airs on Friday. Armstrong is expected to face up to the extraordinary body of evidence the United States Anti-Doping Agency put together before releasing more than 1,000 pages of evidence in October 2012. A positive test for a banned substance during his first Tour de France win in 1999 was explained away by a prescription for a cream to treat saddle sores, but the doubts and rumors surrounding Armstrong refused to go away. The 2004 book ""L.A. Confidential: The Secrets of Lance Armstrong"" by journalists David Walsh and Pierre Ballester alleged the use of performance-enhancing substances. Read more: Armstrong appeals to supporters . A key witness for Walsh and Ballester, and then the USADA, was Emma O'Reilly -- formerly a masseuse/personal assistant to Armstrong and his cycling team, U.S. Postal Service. She told the agency she engaged in clandestine trips to pick up and drop off what she assumed were doping products, and said she was in the room when Armstrong and two other team officials came up with a plan to backdate a prescription for corticosteroids for a saddle sore to explain a positive steroid test result during the 1999 Tour de France. ""Now, Emma, you know enough to bring me down,"" she says Armstrong told her after the meeting. ""The quote has got a bit dramatized,"" she said. ""History has shown that I didn't have enough to bring him down, and I never wanted to bring him down. Never, ever wanted to bring Lance down."" Doping was commonplace in cycling in the '90s, O'Reilly said, as integral to the sport as the bikes that bore riders up and down the challenging French hillsides. She said she tried to distance herself from doping activities but felt some pressure to co-operate. Read more: Should you wear a Livestrong bracelet? She said she first came across doping by U.S. Postal in 1998, when she said a man gave her a package that he described as testosterone for team cyclist George Hincapie. The man, whose name is redacted from the affidavit, warned her not to travel to the United States with it, O'Reilly said. Hincapie acknowledged using banned substances in his affidavit to the USADA and in a statement released the same day. That same year, she says, Armstrong gave her a small plastic-wrapped package after a race in the Netherlands and asked her to dispose of it. O'Reilly said Armstrong told her it ""contained some things he was uneasy traveling with and had not wanted to throw away at the team hotel."" O'Reilly also recounted buying makeup for Armstrong to conceal what she said he described as bruise from a syringe injection during a race. While O'Reilly said she never saw Armstrong use banned substances -- though she felt sure that he did -- Tyler Hamilton had a different story, saying ""the first time I ever blood-doped was with Lance"" and that his teammate was well aware and involved with everything that happened. The publication of ""L.A. Confidential"" led to a raft of lawsuits. Armstrong sued British newspaper The Sunday Times, which published an article referencing the book, before eventually reaching an out-of-court settlement. The Sunday Times is now suing Armstrong for $1.5 million it claims he ""got by fraud"" using ""Britain's draconian libel laws against us."" The paper also took out an advert in the Chicago Tribune listing 10 questions that Oprah should ask Armstrong. It was signed by its chief sports writer Walsh, who was named UK journalist of the year for his 13-year investigation into Armstrong's activities. Cycling's governing body the UCI could seek to reclaim the millions he secured in prize money during his halcyon years, while reports have suggested Armstrong -- who was dropped by major sponsors such as Nike and Oakley -- may agree to pay back some of the sponsorship funding that his U.S. Postal team received. Read more: U.S. Postal team doping 'predates Armstrong' Over time, a host of riders who had raced alongside Armstrong with the team between 1998 and 2004 began to cast doubt on his unparalleled achievements. In 2010 Floyd Landis, a disgraced former rider who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title for doping offenses, claimed he and Armstrong had both taken prohibited substances while teammates at U.S. Postal Service. Landis launched legal action against Armstrong in the form of a whistleblower suit, claiming he had defrauded the U.S. government by accepting money from the Postal Service. Armstrong remained staunch in his denial of doping allegations, but former colleagues such as Hamilton continued to make claims of wrongdoing. The American, who has since been stripped of the gold medal he won at the 2004 Olympic Games, admitted to doping while also pointing the finger at Armstrong. The drip of allegations refused to go away, until it become a flood with the report released by the USADA. It accused him of being part of ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" The report included evidence from 26 people -- 11 of whom were Armstrong's former teammates. Read more: USADA - 'Evidence overwhelming' Armstrong maintains that he has been subjected to 500 drug tests and failed none, but the fallout from USADA's 202-page report has been catastrophic for the Texan. In addition to losing the Tour titles he won between 1999 and 2005, he also faces being stripped of bronze medal he won at the 2000 Olympic Games. Livestrong has not emerged from the scandal unscathed, with Armstrong forced to step down from his role as chairman. At first he put on a brave face, telling his supporters at a Livestrong charity event in Texas: ""I've been better, but I've been a lot worse."" But, on the day he taped his interview with Winfrey, Armstrong visited the charity's staff and reportedly made a ""sincere and heartfelt apology for the stress they've endured because of him."" Armstrong's words might be true, but there can be no doubt that the sport he seemingly did so much for has never been in a hole quite as deep as the one his fall from grace has created.","Lance Armstrong stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by cycling's ruling body .
