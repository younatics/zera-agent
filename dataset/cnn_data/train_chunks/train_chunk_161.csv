"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- An American diplomat has described the violence in Kenya's Rift Valley as ""clear ethnic cleansing"" aimed at chasing out members of the Kikuyu tribe who are loyal to President Mwai Kibaki. However, U.S. envoy Jendayi Frazer said she did not believe the ethnic clashes that have brought Kenya to its knees following disputed elections last month could be classed as genocide. The violence she saw this month while visiting the Rift Valley, where Luos people are fighting Kikuyus, ""was clear ethnic cleansing,"" she told reporters at an African Union summit in Addis Ababa on Wednesday. ""The aim originally was not to kill, it was to cleanse, it was to push them out of the region,"" she said, according to The Associated Press. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday pleaded with Kenya's government to take ""extraordinary measures"" to protect civilians hours after an opposition lawmaker was killed outside his home. Hundreds have died in fighting sparked by last month's presidential election, which opponents insist was rigged to ensure Kibaki's re-election. ""Kenya, which has long been a stable and peaceful country, today is in turmoil with innocent men, women and children being hounded and killed,"" Annan told Kenya's National Assembly before heading into talks with Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga. Annan's speech came as police and demonstrators clashed in Nairobi and hours after gunmen killed opposition lawmaker Mugabe Were in a car outside his house.   About 100 supporters also gathered in Kisumu, Kenya's third-largest city, in a show of anger over Were's killing, prompting police to fire tear gas and bullets to disperse them, the Kenya Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Watch as CNN's Nic Robertson describes unrest in western Kenya's Naivasha » . The western city of Kisumu is a stronghold of the opposition Orange Democratic Movement that has accused the president of rigging the December 27 vote. Odinga said he suspected ""the foul hands of our adversaries"" in the shooting death of Were, a parliament member from the Orange Democratic Movement, according to The Associated Press.  See dramatic photos following Were's killing » . During his assembly address, Annan called on Kenya's leaders to stop the ""downward spiral into chaos that is threatening this beautiful country."" ""There is only one Kenya. We all have multiple identifies, but I hope you all see yourself as Kenyans first,"" Annan said. ""[We] must stress our common humanity and uphold respect for human rights and the dignity of others."" The United States is considering imposing sanctions against members of the Kenyan government and opposition figures involved in the recent violence in that country, senior State Department officials told CNN. Although no decisions have been made, visa and travel bans are among the measures being considered. They do not expect the sanctions to target Kibaki or Odinga, the officials said, but rather those on both sides who are instigating the violence. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice voiced concern Tuesday about Kenya's violence, saying she planned to speak with Annan soon about possible solutions. Since the election, a spasm of political violence has taken on ethnic overtones as supporters of Kibaki, a member of the Kikuyu tribe, battle with followers of Odinga, from the Luo tribe. Bloody street battles often have involved machetes. The government says 600 to 650 people have been killed, while the opposition says at least 1,000 have died. The Kenyan Red Cross Society puts the number at 863. More than 200,000 people have been displaced in the turmoil, according to the Red Cross. ""Right now there is nothing,"" said tailor Margaret Njambi, who fled with her four children and took refuge in a police station in Kakamega after rioters burned her house and shop. ""The house is no more. There is nothing left there for me."" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Elise Labott, Saeed Ahmed, Stephanie Halasz and Zain Verjee contributed to this report. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"(CNN) -- Fierce fighting between rebels and Syrian troops raged on the embattled capital's doorstep Saturday, opposition forces told CNN. Free Syrian Army rebels traded gunfire for mortar rounds from President Bashar al-Assad's troops along a critical fault line separating the suburb of Jobar from Damascus itself, said Baraa, a spokesman for the local Revolutionary Military Council, who gave only his first name for safety reasons. ""There are heavy ongoing clashes at Eight Azar. If we capture the area it means we have reached the heart of the capital. It means we can cross into Damascus,"" Baraa told CNN. Rebels appear to be inching closer to a decisive battle for the capital, al-Assad's stronghold, but after nearly two years of fighting the opposition remains wary. ""We are still several hundred meters away and there are many snipers positioned on the buildings and tanks in the area. We expect very intense fighting over the next several days,"" Baraa said. The Free Syrian Army is embroiled in near-constant clashes along three front lines on the western edge of the suburb of Jobar -- the Eight Azar entrance, a military air force building, and the vital 6 Tishreen Road dividing the government-controlled suburb of Qaboun from Jobar. Western powers set to increase aid for Syrian rebels . Reinforcements are arriving from eastern Ghouta and other suburbs, Baraa said, and are being dispersed evenly to all three front lines. The opposition Damascus Media Office told CNN on Saturday that the Free Syrian Army was now in control of a majority of Jobar. Clashes are constant along a thin line leading to the edges of Abassiyeen Square, it said. The regime has stepped up its offensive using fighter jets and missiles to shell the suburb, it said. For civilians pinned down by the heavy fighting, survival is a daily struggle and escape a distant possibility. ""There are still civilians here and they tell us, where can we go? All of Syria is a battle ground -- there is nowhere to hide,"" Baraa said. Historically, the suburb of Jobar has been a holy site for Jews, drawing pilgrims to one of the oldest standing synagogues in the world. Now bodies line the streets toward the central Abassiyeen Square, Baraa claimed, and the 2,000-year-old Jobar Synagogue sustains artillery attacks. ""Just as the homes and mosques are being struck, the synagogue was struck, too. The regime's random shelling does not distinguish between buildings -- it can hit anything,"" Baraa said. Syrian state media reported fighting in the Damascus suburbs, claiming government armed forces were pursuing armed terrorist groups in the area and had inflicted heavy losses after a string of operations. CNN cannot confirm opposition and government accounts of death tolls as access by international journalists is severely restricted. 'Chess game' Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem held talks Saturday with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, in Tehran. Iran has been a constant ally of the embattled al-Assad regime. In a joint news conference on Iran's state-run Press TV, Muallem said the Syrian army was acting to defend the people and was doing so within the framework of the law. Syria must ""eliminate the sources of terrorism"" and defend its sovereignty, he said. Syria will not turn into a ""chess game"" for the international community, he added, reiterating the government's rejection of what it views as foreign interference in its affairs. Both Muallem and Salehi questioned Western support for rebel groups, saying such fighters were the cause of bloodshed in Syria. Salehi said Iran believes dialogue is needed to bring an end to the violence. The Syrian government is ready to talk, he said. Their remarks come two days after the United States promised to send food and medical supplies -- but not weapons -- to rebels in the first such move since the conflict began nearly two years ago. At the same time, European nations began to explore how to strengthen rebel fighters short of arming them after a European Council decision allowing aid for civilian protection. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking after meeting opposition leaders at a Friends of Syria conference in Rome, said the aid would help fighters in their effort to topple al-Assad. He did not say how much aid, but did announce that the United States would separately give $60 million to local groups working with the opposition Syrian National Council to provide political administration and basic services in rebel-controlled areas of Syria. That's on top of $50 million in similar aid the United States has previously pledged to the council, as well as $385 million in humanitarian assistance, Kerry said. The European Council carved out an exception in its sanctions against Syria on Thursday to allow for the transfer of nonlethal equipment and technical assistance for civilian protection only. It did not specify what kind of equipment could be involved. City bombarded . Meanwhile, violent clashes have been taking place in al-Raqa province, near Syria's northern border with Turkey, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition group. Fighting began Saturday morning between fighters from many rebel battalions and regime forces, around the al-Raqa city, the Mashlab and Furusiya checkpoints and the Hajana building in the city, the group said. The sound of explosions rocked the city and smoke rose overhead, where helicopters hovered, the Observatory said. Several areas in the city and its outskirts were bombarded by government forces. The group reported dozens of deaths on both sides. Saturday, 133 people were killed across Syria, including 36 in Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Local Coordination Committees for Syria, a network of opposition activists. The unrest began in March 2011, when al-Assad's government began a brutal crackdown on demonstrators calling for enhanced political freedoms. The protest movement eventually devolved into an armed conflict, one that has devastated cities and towns around the country and has already claimed nearly 70,000 lives. It has also spurred more than 950,000 Syrians to flee to neighboring nations, according to the United Nations' refugee agency. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","133 people were killed across the country Saturday, opposition group says .

"(CNN) -- For the 56th year, World Press Photo announced the winners of its annual contest Friday. The jury gave prizes in nine themed categories to 54 photographers of 32 nationalities for what is considered one of the most prestigious photojournalism honors. Photos: Selection of World Press Photo's 2012 winners . This year's Photo of the Year, taken by Paul Hansen, is a striking image of the bodies of two young children carried through the streets of Gaza City after an Israeli airstrike on their home, the photographer said. They are being taken to a mosque for burial, their father's body carried on a stretcher behind them. Their mother was hospitalized. The photograph humanizes what some may see as a politically charged situation. But contest jury chair Santiago Lyon told CNN that there was no talk of it being controversial. Lyon is the vice president and director of photography for The Associated Press. In two weeks, more than 103,000 images were narrowed down to about 10,000 in a first round of judging. A second round determined first, second and third place for one of nine themed categories. This year's final round of judges were a global mix, Lyon said. There were three things jurors were looking for in a winning image -- a photograph that reached the intellect, heart and stomach. The Gaza City photo accomplished that, Lyon said. Photos: First place photographers react to winning World Press Photo prizes . ""The strength of the pictures lies in the way it contrasts the anger and sorrow of the adults with the innocence of the children. It's a picture I will not forget,"" Mayu Mohanna, a jury member from Peru, said in a World Press Photo press release. The final images were discussed for several hours, and an anonymous vote cast Hansen's image as the picture of 2012. ""I thought it was a prank call,"" Swedish photographer Hansen said about hearing he'd won. ""I have mixed feelings about it. It's a horrible picture."" The story behind the photo started the day before it was shot, he said. He and a colleague were talking to a Norwegian doctor in a hospital. The doctor told the story of a Gaza City family whose home had been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike. Two young boys and their father were killed, and their mother was sent to the intensive care unit. The next day, on November 20, 2012, Hansen and his colleague set out to cover a funeral. It was for the woman's sons and husband whose bodies were marched through the neighborhood, their destroyed home unable to house grieving relatives. The picture is one of 12 of the day's events, taken for a Swedish daily newspaper, Dagens Nyheter. When asked about the image's possible controversy, Hansen said it truthfully portrays the situation. ""You can see that they're dead, but it's not gruesome in any other way besides emotion,"" he said. The ability to portray something in a manner that doesn't make the reader turn away takes conscious balancing, Hansen said, adding that it's something for which he strives. The emotion of the photograph remains strong for Hansen as well. He said he later cried. ""Crying is part of the job,"" he said. ""If you're not there as a person first, why are you there?"" Lyon, the jury chair, said the judges looked at the photograph for its power. ""We felt that was the reality of the scene,"" he said. ""It is very powerful. We don't shy away from showing reality.""","Image of bodies of two children carried in Gaza City wins World Press Photo's top prize .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Days after the death of a Palestinian in an Israeli prison, a rocket fired from Gaza landed in southern Israel on Tuesday, the first such attack since a cease-fire took hold in November. Israeli police said they did not receive any reports of injuries from the rocket. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a Gaza militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack, which damaged a road outside the town of Ashkelon, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Gaza. The brigades made the claim in an e-mail to CNN. Last week, militants in Gaza warned there would be retaliation if a prisoner died or was harmed while in Israeli custody. Arafat Jaradat, 30, died Saturday, inciting Palestinian officials to once again decry Israeli prison conditions. ""The prisoner martyr Jaradat went to prison to come back a corpse, but we are determined to find out how it was done and who did it,"" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Monday, according to the state news agency WAFA. ""We know how we will act, and we will not let them (Israelis) drag us to their square, and they should bear the responsibility."" The rocket fire prompted the Israel Defense Forces to close the Kerem Shalom Crossing near the Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian borders. The Erez Crossing between Gaza and Israel will be open only for medical cases, humanitarian aid or exceptional cases. The government said it will send out a directive when it opens the crossings to full activity. Israel seized Gaza during the 1967 war, and withdrew settlers from there in 2005. In the ensuing years, militants in Gaza have regularly launched rocket attacks into southern Israel. In November, Israel launched what it called the Pillar of Defense operation, a series of military strikes on Gaza designed to stop the constant rocket fire. Eight days of round-the-clock warfare followed between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian movement that controls Gaza. As Israel targeted Hamas military commanders and weaponry, Palestinian militants continued to fire rockets into Israel, battering the southern region and reaching Israel's two major cities -- Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel called up reservists and massed its forces on the Gaza border, threatening a ground invasion. Many feared a repeat of Israel's Operation Cast Lead offensive against Palestinian militants in late 2008, an operation that led to a bloody three-week war. The fighting in November took its toll: More than 160 Palestinians, many of whom were civilians, were killed. Six Israelis died, including civilians and soldiers. Hundreds were wounded. The fighting ended after Egypt and the United States helped broker the cease-fire that lasted until Tuesday. A Palestinian official sent a warning Sunday to U.S. President Barack Obama, who plans to make his first trip to Israel as president next month. ""If President Obama wants to visit the region peacefully, he should exert pressure on Israel to release the prisoners -- especially the ones who are on hunger strike -- or else he will visit while Palestine is on fire,"" Minister of Prisoner Affairs Issa Qaraqe said. Israeli officials Sunday called on the Palestinian Authority to calm the territories, where there have been large protests in recent days over the conditions of Palestinian prisoners.","NEW: The IDF sets strictures on two crossings .

"(CNN) -- A political clash over the legitimacy of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's next term loomed as the announcement came that he will be unable to attend his inauguration. With Chavez unable to be sworn in, a number of constitutional questions have become central: Can the president be sworn in on another day? And who should be in charge in the meantime? The disagreement hangs a cloud of uncertainty over Venezuela, as political forces disagree on whether Chavez will be a legitimate president or whether someone else should assume power and call for new elections. Officials on Tuesday confirmed that medical treatment in Cuba will keep Chavez from being sworn in for his new term this week. At the same time, supporters and opponents of Chavez are bracing for a legal battle over whether the inauguration can be postponed. Chavez: Survivor and Venezuela's long-serving president . A statement from Venezuela's vice president read before lawmakers Tuesday said that the constitution authorizes ""at a later date, the swearing-in before the Supreme Court."" ""The process of post-surgical recuperation must continue past January 10 of this year, so he will not be able to appear on that date before the National Assembly,"" the statement said. The 58-year-old Venezuelan president has been treated for cancer in Cuba for the past month, most recently battling respiratory complications. Read more: Venezuela: As Chavez battles cancer, Maduro waits in the wings . A fierce debate . Tuesday's formal announcement sparked a fierce debate in the assembly, intensifying a political battle that has been playing out for weeks in news conferences, on the country's airwaves and in social media posts. The constitution says Chavez can be sworn in before the Supreme Court, but the wording is not clear about whether that swearing-in must occur Thursday or who should run Venezuela in the meantime. The president of Venezuela's Supreme Court is scheduled to speak to reporters Wednesday. Supporters and critics of Chavez both point to the country's constitution but offer wildly different interpretations of what it says. Opposition lawmakers said in Tuesday's debate that Chavez should be declared temporarily absent from his presidential post to avoid a power vacuum. They argued that Diosdado Cabello, the head of the National Assembly, should temporarily assume the presidency while Chavez recovers. But Cabello, a close Chavez ally and member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, said that would be unconstitutional. ""There is no way to interpret (the constitution). It is extremely clear,"" he said. ""Everything else is a wish."" Julio Borges, an opposition lawmaker, said Chavez's supporters were fighting among themselves and putting the country's future in jeopardy. ""You are denying the application of the constitution ... and what is unjust is that the Venezuelan people are paying the price of your internal fight while the (country's) problems are still alive and kicking,"" he said. Tuesday's debate became so heated that one member of the opposition accused Chavez's supporters of hurling a copy of the constitution at him. Supporters of Chavez pumped their fists in the air and gave a standing ovation after passing a resolution affirming that Chavez could remain president and be away from the country for as long as necessary to deal with his illness. The resolution backed the interpretation of the constitution held by Chavez's supporters. Opposition leader calls for action . Henrique Capriles, the man Chavez defeated at the polls in October, said earlier Tuesday that the Supreme Court must clarify the confusion. Read more: With Chavez ill, uncertainty reigns in Venezuela . ""There is a conflict here,"" Capriles said. ""What is the Supreme Court waiting on?"" As far as the opposition is concerned, Capriles said, the constitution is clear that the president's term ends on January 10 and a new period begins. If Chavez is unable to be sworn in, it creates a leadership vacuum that must be filled by the National Assembly president, and the possibility of new elections arises, Capriles said. Cabello has said that he has no intention of assuming power if Chavez is not sworn in. ""When (the opposition) talks about a power vacuum, they are proposing a coup,"" Cabello said, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Maduro: 'The popular will is what prevails' The government says that Chavez's new term begins automatically because he was re-elected and that the inauguration could be held later. In remarks broadcast on national television Tuesday night, Vice President Nicolas Maduro said the inauguration date ""is a formality."" Speaking to Venezuela's military leaders, he said that declaring Chavez temporarily absent from his post ""would be crazy because the popular will is what prevails."" Voters have re-elected Chavez, he said, calling on the military to help continue Chavez's revolution. There is no such automatic continuity of power, Capriles said, arguing that ""the only thing that has continuity are the country's problems."" ""If the constitution is not followed, or there is a conflict of interpretation, the Supreme Court has to take a position,"" he said. Capriles expressed concern about unrest or political crisis in the absence of a decision by the high court. Chavez has not been seen in public and officials have not released any photographs of him since he arrived in Havana for his fourth cancer operation in early December, fueling speculation that his health is worse than the government is letting on. Last week, a government spokesman said Chavez was battling a severe lung infection that has caused respiratory failure. Ernesto Villegas said the president was following a strict treatment regimen for ""respiratory insufficiency"" caused by the infection. His condition remained unchanged Monday, the government said in a statement. ""Treatment has been administered permanently and rigorously, and the patient is supporting it,"" the statement said. CNN's Paula Newton and Esprit Smith contributed to this report.","Officials say Hugo Chavez will not be in Venezuela for inauguration day .

"(CNN) -- Could wild beach parties fueled by spring break tourism from the United States be in Cuba's future? They might be if Sen. Jeff Flake has anything to say about it. The Arizona Republican weighed in on the issue during Sen. John Kerry's secretary of state confirmation hearing on Thursday. ""I've often felt that if we want a real get-tough policy with the Castro brothers,"" Flake said, ""we should force them to deal with spring break once or twice."" Flake said there was a serious message behind his quip. ""The best way to foster change and progress toward democracy is to allow travel, free travel of Americans, to let them go as they wish,"" he said. Later in Thursday's hearing, another lawmaker said U.S. policy toward Cuba is no laughing matter. ""To suggest that spring break is a form of torture to the Castro regime, unfortunately, they are experts of torture as evidenced by the increasing brutal crackdown on peaceful democracy advocates on the island,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Human rights organizations have repeatedly criticized the Cuban government's handling of dissidents. But Cuban officials told the United Nations last year that the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power also put an end to authorities' use of torture. After Castro took power in 1959, Cuba went from being a favorite getaway for Americans to a forbidden destination. Diplomatic relations and direct travel between the United States and Cuba were cut off. U.S. citizens spending money on the island faced hefty fines for ""trading with the enemy."" While a decades-long trade embargo remains in place, travel is one part of the U.S. policy toward Cuba that has changed in recent years. The Obama administration has reinstituted legal travel to Cuba as a way to reach out to the Cuban people. Under the U.S. Treasury's ""people to people"" travel guidelines, tour operators have to plan nearly every moment of the trip, and ""people-to-people"" travel, at least in theory, excludes relaxing by the pool with umbrella-topped beverages. The relaxed travel restrictions are a good step, said Flake, who has long opposed the U.S. trade embargo and limits on travel to Cuba. But he encouraged Kerry to push for more travel opportunities for Americans in the island nation. ""I don't think that that's a weakness or any capitulation at all,"" he said. ""I think it's a way to show strength."" CNN's Jill Dougherty and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Florida A&M University band director Julian White, who had been under pressure to step aside after the hazing-related death of a band member, is retiring, his attorney announced Thursday. White, 71, is stepping down just days after 13 people were charged in connection with the November 2011 hazing death of FAMU Marching 100 drum major Robert Champion. White was placed on paid administrative leave shortly after Champion's death. FAMU's board of trustees is scheduled to meet on May 14 to discuss the future of the band. Champion, 26, died within an hour of his being badly beaten during a hazing incident on a band bus following a football game in Orlando, Florida. The ritual, called ""Crossing Bus C,"" is an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle while being assaulted by senior members, according to some university band members. An autopsy found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" and ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" medical examiners reported. As recently as last week, White had asked for full reinstatement as director of the famed university band. White, who had been with FAMU for 40 years, had tried to root out hazing for the past 22 years, his attorney Chuck Hobbs said. ""Dr. White remains disappointed that barely 48 hours after meeting with band members, that Robert Champion was killed in an extreme, horrific and illegal act of bullying,"" Hobbs said in an earlier statement. The death prompted the university board of trustees to approve an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate. Currently, 13 people are charged in Champion's death, 11 are facing felony hazing charges and two others are charged with misdemeanor hazing. Champion's death brought renewed public scrutiny to the practice of hazing, which has gone on for years despite what the Tallahassee university said were efforts to stop it. Champion's mother, Pam, has called for the FAMU band to be disbanded. ""They need to clean out the filth to move forward. How can they allow the band out there?"" she said last week. ""They haven't done anything to safeguard students -- certainly not my son. My son was murdered.""","FAMU's band director steps down after 40 years .

"(CNN) -- Never underestimate the power of Oprah or a free meal. Customers were left hungry and unhappy after Oprah Winfrey's endorsed coupon campaign overwhelmed KFC. That seems to be the lesson KFC is learning after talk-show titan Oprah Winfrey took to the airwaves Tuesday with an offer of a free grilled chicken two-piece meal. Hungry consumers could visit Oprah.com, where for the next 24 hours they were supposed to be able to download a coupon for the meal that included two pieces of the company's new grilled chicken menu item, two side orders and a biscuit. What ensued was a coupon craze that was for some a headache. Customers flooded KFC restaurants, and many had long lines and even longer wait times. iReport: Watch a video on the frenzy . Bloggers took to the Web in waves to report on the frenzy. Customer complaints ranged from the inability to download the coupon because of the site's high traffic to some restaurants simply not honoring the deal. ""I'm a big girl,"" Shannon Edwards told CNN affiliate WBAL-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, on Thursday after she was turned away from a KFC. ""I like to eat. So I'm kind of disappointed I have to go to McDonald's now."" Charlotte Beal, a food and beverage consumer strategist at the consumer insights firm Iconoculture, said it was a perfect storm of the astronomical influence of Winfrey and the recession. ""In this economic environment, anything free you can't beat it, and it's just so enticing,"" said Beal, who added that her company has been tracking the increase of coupon usage, especially those available online. ""It's a well-known fact that Oprah's been transparent about her own struggles with weight and diet so when she partners with a company that's trying to offer a healthier product, consumers really listen.""  Watch Winfrey discuss the reaction » . ""Not only are you attracting the people who are strapped for cash and want a free meal, but you also are enticing the whole Oprah audience that relates to her own struggle of trying to find something healthy to eat,"" Beal said. Alan C. Marcus, president and chief executive officer for public relations firm the Marcus Group Inc., said the situation had all the ingredients of a public relations nightmare. ""If you make a commitment and you don't produce on that commitment, you lose your credibility and that ripples throughout the company,"" Marcus said. ""It hurts your brand, and it hurts your position in the marketplace."" Winfrey is ""a powerhouse"" whose fans cannot be denied, he said. ""I think they underestimated Oprah,"" Marcus said. ""She's got a lot of influence, and she has earned a following over many years."" In a press release Thursday night, KFC said that after the ""unprecedented and overwhelming response"" restaurants would no longer honor the coupon but would provide a rain-check program for customers. ""We would like to apologize to our customers who have been inconvenienced by the overwhelming response to our free Kentucky Grilled Chicken offer,"" said Roger Eaton, president of KFC U.S. ""The lines of customers wanting to redeem their coupons have been out the door and around the block, so we're unable to redeem customer coupons at this time."" Eaton appeared on Winfrey's show Friday via Skype to sort out what she referred to as the ""chicken caper."" Winfrey acknowledged some of the issues surrounding the campaign, and called the download of 10.5 million coupons and giveaway of $42 million worth of free food from KFC ""quite a hookup."" Eaton said 4 million meals had been redeemed by using the coupons, with 6.5 million meals from rainchecks still needing to be distributed. Winfrey said the reaction to the chicken coupon surpassed even her giveaway of cars to audience members a few years ago. ""I was really deeply moved, first of all, by all the people who sent thank you's for the chicken,"" Winfrey said. ""You know, I actually got more thank you's for the chickens than we did for the cars, which is so amazing."" The coupon craze is not the first time chicken lovers have gotten fried over a good deal. Recently, KFC competitor Popeyes experienced a similar problem when some of its franchises ran out of chicken during a promotional eight-piece deal for $4.99.","Frenzy for new KFC grilled chicken sparked after Oprah Winfrey offer .

"(CNN) -- The director of public security in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, was gunned down Wednesday night, officials said, though details of the incident remained scarce. Gen. Manuel Farfan Carreola, who served as police chief, was shot near his office by unknown assailants, said Everardo Sanchez, a spokesman for Mexico's attorney general's office. He had been in the position since a new administration assumed city leadership on January 1. Rumors of how many others were killed along with the police chief swirled in Nuevo Laredo Thursday, but city officials declined to go on the record with details surrounding the incident. The state government, which is leading the investigation, was expected to hold a news conference Thursday evening. ""Obviously, the news about his death is out, but the circumstances have been in the shadows,"" said Joe Baeza, a spokesman for the Laredo, Texas, Police Department. The Laredo Police Department keeps in touch with its cross-border colleagues. The investigation is an ongoing process, Baeza said, though early reports that have reached his department were that five of Farfan's security team were killed in the shooting. The Laredo Police Department received several reports of sporadic gunfire on the Mexican side of the border, possibly related to the fallout of the killing, Baeza said. ""There's reported instability on the Mexican side,"" he said. Nuevo Laredo is one of the battlegrounds that is being contested by rival drug cartels. The Gulf cartel and its former enforcers, Los Zetas, have been fighting over the territory and its lucrative smuggling routes. The Sinaloa cartel also has been fighting for years to get a foothold in the area. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Gen. Manuel Farfan was killed in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico .

Cooper is stepping into a role that was previously played by Willem Dafoe, who unfortunately had to spend half of 2002â€²s ""Spider-Man"" in a green exoskeleton that made him look like Lord Zedd's lame step-brother. Paul Giamatti in talks to play Rhino in 'Spider-Man' sequel . It's unclear exactly how big a role Cooper will play in the sequel. The movie's nominal villain is Jamie Foxx's Electro, plus maybe also Paul Giamatti's Rhino, and that's not to mention new arrivals like Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn and Shailene Woodley's Mary Jane Watson. (Shockingly, there are no rumors about the possibility of casting Jennifer Lawrence as Felicia Hardy, unless even saying that there are no rumors counts as a rumor.) Assuming they're planning to go Full Saga with the ""Amazing"" franchise, it seems likely that Cooper will appear as a minor character in the sequel, setting up a very Goblin-ful threequel. The point is, there are now at least three Oscar winners in the cast of a ""Spider-Man"" movie, proving that we live in a golden age of ... well, something. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Flamboyant former NBA star Dennis Rodman and three members of the famed Harlem Globetrotters arrived in North Korea Tuesday to ""entertain and inspire"" with their basketball skills while they film a TV show. ""I come in peace. I love the people of North Korea!"" Rodman, 51, said on Twitter Tuesday. The weeklong visit comes at a time of heightened tension between the United States and North Korea, a result of Pyongyang's pursuit of a nuclear program. Just days ago, North Korea threatened ""miserable destruction"" in response to routine military exercises planned between South Korea and the United States. North Korea provoked Western condemnation earlier this month with an underground nuclear test that was preceded by the launch of a long-range missile capable of transporting a warhead in December. Could Rodman's visit, which a statement from the Harlem Globetrotters calls ""ambassadorial,"" help cool down this international hot spot? Rodman tweeted that he was ""looking forward to sitting down with Kim Jung Un,"" known to have been a huge basketball fan when he was a teenage student in Switzerland. ""The whole world for him was just basketball all the time,"" a former classmate of North Korea's supreme leader told CNN after he assumed power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. He is believed to be about 29 years old. Rodman, whose nickname is ""Worm,"" said he was ""honored to represent The United States of America."" ""I'm not a politician. Kim Jung Un & North Korean people are basketball fans. I love everyone. Period. End of story,"" he tweeted. His knowledge of geography and geopolitics may be a little off, though, judging from one message. ""Maybe I'll run into the Gangnam Style dude while I'm here,"" he said. Psy, the artist who made the smash hit song and video, is from South Korea. ""Our aim is to entertain and inspire children everywhere,"" Globetrotters CEO Kurt Schneider said. ""Every child deserves that opportunity."" It was unclear whether Rodman, who is accompanied by Globetrotters Bull Bullard, Buckets Blakes and Moose Weekes, will be taken to North Korea's countryside, where aid groups say malnutrition is rampant. According to Human Rights Watch, hundreds of thousands of people remain enslaved in prison camps, which are ""notorious for horrific living conditions and abuse."" The trip was arranged by the producers of an HBO show that premieres in April, the team said. The documentary series is hosted by Vice magazine founder Shane Smith and executive produced by HBO commentator Bill Maher. When Rodman finishes his North Korean mission, he'll travel to New York to work with a reality TV supreme leader, Donald Trump, for a season of ""All-Star Celebrity Apprentice.""","The United States and North Korea are at odds over North Korea's nuclear ambitions .

"(CNN) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush was doing well Wednesday following her surgery late Tuesday night to repair and seal a perforated ulcer, according to the surgeon who performed the operation. Former first lady Barbara Bush is recovering in intensive care after her surgergy. ""She is up in a chair. She's very vigorous. She is in charge,"" said Dr. Patrick Reardon. ""The first thing she did when her lips worked was to tell a joke."" Bush, 83, showed up at the emergency room of Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, Tuesday night, complaining of severe abdominal pain, Reardon told reporters. ""She declared this was the worst pain she ever had, many times worse than childbirth,"" the doctor said. ""This is not something that she had any doubts there was a problem with."" After examining her and doing some diagnostic tests, doctors determined Bush had a perforated ulcer in her duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine after the stomach, Reardon said. In the operating room, doctors thoroughly cleaned her abdominal cavity of any contaminants that had leaked through the hole, described by the hospital as being 1 centimeter. Then, doctors repaired the ulcer and used a piece of the omentum, living fat tissue in the abdomen, to sew on top of it to seal it, Reardon said. Bush remained in the hospital's intensive care unit Wednesday, standard procedure following such surgery. She likely will be there at least 24 to 48 hours, he said. She likely will be hospitalized for at least a week, Reardon said, and won't be able to have any food by mouth, as it might stretch the newly repaired ulcer. She also requires intravenous antibiotics to counteract any bacteria released into the abdomen through the hole. ""She's awake and completely alert,"" he said. ""She's been visiting with the family and looks very good."" The condition was caught early, as Bush recognized there was something wrong, Reardon said. He suggested anti-inflammatory medication Bush takes may have caused the ulcer -- a rare but not unheard-of complication. ""It's uncommon, but it's not so uncommon that we don't know how to treat it,"" he said. The ulcer was biopsied and is benign, he said. ""If there were any concerns, the operation would have been a different operation."" Former President George H.W. Bush was with his wife, Reardon said. ""They're very affectionate to each other. I hope my marriage is that good, that far into it. He's got a very positive attitude."" The mother of President George W. Bush, Barbara Bush was first lady from 1989 to 1993. Born Barbara Pierce in New York in 1925, she married her husband in 1945. She is a distant cousin of Franklin Pierce, who served as president from 1853 to 1857. She and the former president split their time between Houston and Kennebunkport, Maine.","NEW: ""She is up in a chair. She's very vigorous,"" says her surgeon .

"(RollingStone.com) -- The estate of Jimi Hendrix has released a new statement speaking out against a biopic purported to star Outkast's AndrÃ© 3000 as the iconic guitarist. ""Experience Hendrix, LLC, the family-owned company entrusted with safeguarding the legacy of Jimi Hendrix and administrator of the Jimi Hendrix music and publishing catalog, has made it known many times in the past that no such film, were it to include original music or copyrights created by Jimi Hendrix, can be undertaken without its full participation,"" reads the statement. The response follows new reports that the long-stalled biopic, tentatively titled ""All Is By My Side,"" is moving forward once again after being blocked last summer. The biopic aims to explore Hendrix's life between 1966 and 1967, when he released his landmark debut, ""Are You Experienced?"" Pre-production is said to be underway in Ireland, with principal photography expected to start in three weeks in Wicklow and Dublin. John Ridley, who penned the scripts for ""Three Kings,"" ""U-Turn"" and most recently, ""Red Tails,"" is both writing and directing the film. While Janie Hendrix (Jimi's sister, and the CEO of Experience Hendrix) and the Experience Hendrix board have not ruled out the possibility of a Hendrix biopic altogether, the estate has refused to license music out to several other planned Hendrix biopics in the past, including one by Paul Greengrass (""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" ""United 93""). In its latest statement, the estate reiterates that Experience Hendrix would have to be involved from the get-go with any film that plans to use Hendrix's original music.

"(CNN) -- After word broke of a hoax about the death of star Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o's ""girlfriend,"" it didn't take long for ""Te'o"" to become the top-trending term on Twitter on Wednesday night. After the website Deadspin published the allegations, most online comments seemed to be doubting Te'o's innocence in the matter, and more than a few were jokes at his expense. The Deadspin article implied Te'o was involved in making up a season-long story about his long-distance relationship with a Stanford University student who died of leukemia just before underdog Notre Dame played Michigan State early in the season. However, both Te'o and the university say he was a victim. Jack Swarbrick, director of athletics at Notre Dame, told reporters that Te'o was the victim of an elaborate hoax. ""And he will carry that with him for a while,"" Swarbrick said. In a separate statement, reported by ESPN, Te'o said: ""To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating."" ESPN analyst Jemele Hill tweeted, ""Sorry, my spidey senses aren't completely buying Manti Te'o's side of the story."" Hill questioned the details of the player's and the university's denials. Who's who on the Internet? Who knows . ""So Te'o never Skype'd, no Face Time, Gmail chat, nothing? Boy, this feels like an episode of Law and Order: Criminal Intent."" Hill's colleague Mike Greenberg, on the other hand, seemed to be leaning Te'o's way after listening to Swarbrick's statement: . ""Just watched Swarbrick. Fully supported Te'o, which is telling. They have a lot to lose if wrong, no doubt they've been careful. #MantiTeo . Ball State University student Josh Cook was in Te'o's corner: ""I believe in Te'o & his character. I believe he was played & tricked."" Doubters wonder if Heisman Trophy a factor in hoax . Twitter user Adam Knorr posted: ""Manti Te'o just pulled the 3rd grade, 'I have a girlfriend. She goes to another school,' prank on the entire United States."" Bleacher Report reader Bill Rinaldi was willing to give Te'o the benefit of the doubt: ""There is no proof he was in on it. People get tricked ALL the time in online relationships, just watch Catfish on MTV, or even the movie itself."" (""Catfish"" is a reality show that chronicles the pitfalls of online dating.) Another Bleacher report reader, Pierre Conrad, was not so credulous: ""He said he met her at Stanford. Wouldn't he have said the photos on TV and the internet were not of her? Stop attempting to defend the indefensible."" 'Catfish' focuses on fake Internet relationships . Parker Wentzel, also on Bleacher Report, was circumspect: ""I hope this was just a hoax played on Manti. If he was in on this, then I lose a lot of respect for him (because) the whole story fueled this season for Notre Dame and his Heisman run. Either way it's a shame."" Many Internet denizens took the opportunity to bash Te'o's performance on the field. A few examples: . ""I think Manti Te'o himself is a hoax. They tell me he played in the BCS Championship and yet I didn't see him at all."" -- tc4012, CNN.com reader . ""Roll Tide. He looked like a deer in the headlights when the Crimson Tide pushed him all over the field like a puppet. He was shellshocked. Well, maybe they can open up an investigation by the DOJ into it and he can come on Oprah with a tell all...."" -- trski, CNN.com reader . ""Y'all Te'o wasn't missing tackles against Bama, he was hugging his girlfriend"" -- Josh Jones on Twitter . ""Now I know why Manti Te'o always bit on the play action fake"" -- Gary Cinello on Twitter . Numerous commenters pretended to be Lance Armstrong and thanked Te'o for distracting the media from the cycling champion's doping scandal. A Tumblr showed pictures of men posing with invisible girlfriends, instantly coining the term ""Te'oing."" One photo showed an empty chair on a beach, with the words, ""Look how hot Teo's girlfriend is!"" ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Seth Myers admonished online comics: ""These Te'o jokes are all very funny but let's all try and remember that a person who never existed is dead."" Te'o in his own words .","Name of player tied to hoax rockets to top of online trends .
Majority seem to think Te'o was either in on it or just plain stupid .

"(CNN) -- On December 30 2007, incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was announced the winner of Kenya's highly contested presidential elections. Against a backdrop of decades of economic frustration and simmering ethnic tensions, the violence that ensued, largely along ethnic lines, shocked both the nation and the world, threatening to set progress of the development community's golden child back by decades. The violence shook Kenya's national identity to the core. More than 1,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the chaotic bloodbath that followed. Gangs took to the street armed with clubs, machetes, bows and arrows, hacking people to death, burning homes and destroying the country's infrastructure, so critical to the region's stability. On March 4, Kenyans will once again cast their votes for president. And despite tremendous efforts to prevent a repeat of the previous catastrophe, pre-election tensions are mounting. In August 2012, at least 50 people were killed in a land dispute between the Pokomo and Orma people in the Tana Delta region, and in September, deadly riots were triggered by the killing of a Muslim cleric in Mombasa, sparking fears that a bloody election could be repeated. Yet Kenya's tech-savvy activists are determined to prevent their nation slipping into chaos and with up to 93% of Kenyans using mobile phones, they're harnessing the power of technology to monitor elections, report incidents of violence and encourage a peaceful process. Read also: Kenyan DJs go without food for peaceful elections . Following the 2007/8 election violence, an ad-hoc group of bloggers and technologists developed Ushahidi (meaning ""Witness"" in Swahili) in just two days. The Ushahidi crowdmap enabled citizens across the nation to report incidents of violence by SMS or email. Reports were compiled into an online map, providing the most comprehensive picture of the true situation in an environment where official sources were understating its true extent. The Ushahidi team have ramped up their efforts in preparation for this year's elections. In partnership with a Kenyan NGO, the Social Development Network, they've developed Uchaguzi, which has already been deployed for the Kenyan constitutional referendum and elections in Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. As well as enabling citizens to monitor elections in near real-time, they have engaged more traditional election observers who are able to verify and amplify messaging to security personnel and electoral authorities in the event of outbreaks of violence. By engaging with authorities and making their responses visible, it is hoped that the platform will shine a light on the electoral process and enable greater public scrutiny and more rapid response. Aware of the powerful influence that new media such as online forums and the blogosphere had in both inciting and dampening violence in the last election, Nairobi's iHub, a hothouse for tech innovation in Kenya, is piloting an initiative called Umati, which is monitoring and reporting hate speech that could trigger violence this year. Incidents will be integrated into the Uchaguzi platform with the hope of limiting or thwarting the harm they may cause. Read also: Navigating Kenya by Twitter . In order to better inform the public, Nairobi broadsheet the Daily Nation has produced a dedicated election site focusing on the candidates, and Mzalendo, developed in partnership with mySociety, enables voters to rate their candidates and access critical information on MPs and parliamentary proceedings. The Indigo Trust, of which I am executive, is a grant-making foundation that funds technology-driven projects that bring about social change in Africa. We have also been supporting a number of interventions that we hope will contribute towards mitigating violence in Kenya this year. We've funded the development of a platform being hosted by Youth Agenda, which uses SMS messaging to encourage youth to select leaders on the basis of their attributes and policies as opposed to along tribal lines. The platform also collates the responses of young people, using them to initiate debate around key political issues affecting them and to inform and lobby those in charge. Read also: Can tech revolutionize African elections? We also fund the Sisi Ni Amani, a Kenyan partner of the PeaceTXT initiative, conceptualized by PopTech. Built on a violence-interruption approach that has been used in contexts as differing as Baltimore and Baghdad, the intervention combines targeted SMS with intensive on-the-ground work by existing peace builders and community leaders to target potential flashpoints of violence. As well as encouraging users to vote, the platform sends out violence-prevention messages, provides civic education and updates communities about relevant peace-building activities, with the aim of de-escalating tensions and reducing the potential for conflict. Several international interventions are complementing this wide range of home-grown initiatives. Google's Kenya elections hub enables voters to register online, receive SMS confirmation and locate polling stations on a map, while YouTube has launched a dedicated Kenya Election 2013 channel, in collaboration with Storyful. Social media is also contributing towards a transparent and accountable process. Over 25% of Kenyans are now online. Kenya has an estimated 11, 000 bloggers and almost 2.5 million Tweets were sent by Kenyans in just the last three months of 2012 -- many based around political messaging. Social media has been shown to influence government, with the #140friday discussions around the fairness of government tenders being credited with an increased allocation of government contracts to Kenyan companies. MP Ferdinand Waititu was identified as an alleged inciter of violence through a video clip captured by mobile phone at a rally. Significant challenges still remain. It is well known that alternative media often doesn't reach poorer communities, which include the slums where there were severe outbreaks of violence in the aftermath of the last elections. Both social and traditional media also greatly contributed to inciting and escalating the violence in 2007/8. Whilst it's impossible to predict how Kenya's March election will be acted out, one can be certain that any atrocities will be committed under the public scrutiny of a tech-savvy society. And as Africa's most technologically innovative nation goes to the polls, we can only hope that tech-driven interventions will contribute towards a peaceful process. Follow Indigo Trust on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- What would you do if you ran into a future version of yourself? For author Charles Yu, ""When it happens, this is what happens: I shoot myself. ""Not, you know, my self self. I shoot my future self. He steps out of a time machine, introduces himself as Charles Yu. What else am I supposed to do? I kill him. I kill my own future,"" he said. This is the dilemma posed in Charles Yu's debut novel, ""How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe."" Yu's genre-defying story of time travel is receiving critical praise for being a quirky mix of string theory, ""A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and Philip Roth. Yu's appearance at this summer's San Diego Comic-Con won him a slew of new fans and generated buzz for the book. ""How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe"" features a down-on-his-luck time machine repairman, living in Minor Universe 31. It's an alternate reality similar to our own. He's got a crush on his computer operating system, named Tammy, and has the great misfortune of getting stuck in a time loop. Underneath the science fiction, the story deals with a slightly dysfunctional family and their attempts to reconnect with one another. CNN recently asked Yu about his book and this often-debated science fiction ""what-if?"" CNN: So this is not your typical time travel story. Yu: The book, although sometimes lighthearted, also tries to take on heavier subjects. I wanted to look at how a family is a kind of four-dimensional system, a system not of physical forces but emotional forces, like memory and regret, and how, over time, a family creates its own story of itself. At its core, this is a story of a marriage and of a father-son relationship. I wanted to ask some of the age-old questions about time and identity and self, but I wanted to articulate those questions in new ways. CNN: In a sense, your book is something of a time machine. Yu: I've always thought of a novel, just the idea of what a novel is, as an amazing technology. I wanted to play around with the idea of a novel as a time machine. So it really started with the time machine itself, the TM-31 Recreational Time Travel Device, and the guy inside of it, a time travel technician. The time machine is a small, shower-sized box inside of a bigger box, Minor Universe 31. With both boxes, I wanted to evoke a place that feels as much psychological as it does physical. In terms of the plot, the main character is stuck in a time loop (as a result of his having done something very dumb). So he's stuck in this box, stuck in a time loop, stuck between the past and the present, unable to move on with his life. Just plain stuck. CNN: This is a book sci-fi geeks will love, but you don't have to be a fanboy to enjoy. Yu: I do love science, and so researching ideas and concepts that I could play around with in the book was certainly fun. And there were moments that felt like discovery, like I had stumbled into a real place in Universe 31, and I was exploring and creating simultaneously. Those fun moments were fleeting, though. For the most part, writing it was hard, as it always is for me. Thomas Mann said, ""A writer is a person for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people."" I might even go further and say that a writer is a person for whom writing is slightly more painful than bleeding from the ear. CNN: The main character in the novel is also named Charles Yu. Is he similar or different from the real you? Yu: Despite the fact that I named the character after myself, there's really not a lot that is autobiographical in the book, at least in terms of events or other seemingly factual details. If there is a commonality, it's that I have always been very close to my family, and as a result, I have tried to pay attention to the complicated dynamics inside a family, the stresses and strains that any family goes through. CNN: What writers influenced you? Yu: I have always admired Philip Roth, Nicholson Baker, Richard Powers, just to name a few. One book I go back to a lot is ""Six Walks in the Fictional Woods,"" which is a series of lectures that Umberto Eco gave. He breaks open the black box of narrative and shows you how it works, the magic and technology inside a story. In some ways, though, comic books and video games have influenced me, too, especially the latter. A video game is an environment where there are rules and constraints, where the laws of classical mechanics may or may not apply, but even if they don't, there are underlying forces and logic and consistency. In writing ""How to Live Safely,"" I tried to create some of the same feel, of this environment, this minor universe where the main character felt constrained in some ways, yet unnervingly free in other ways, as if he realized he was trapped in a story, and yet at the same time he was creating the story through his choices. CNN: You are an award-winning young writer, a lawyer, and you have a family. How do you find time to keep up with everything? Yu: My wife was very supportive, and my kids are good sleepers! Those were the keys. I wrote ""How to Life Safely"" in two- and three-hour chunks at nights and on weekends. There were plenty of nights where I fell asleep at the keyboard. I'd wake up with a second-degree burn on my legs from my computer overheating on me. CNN: You were a big hit at Comic-Con. Yu: It was my first time, and I really enjoyed it. My publisher, Pantheon, made all of these cool stickers and posters and flyers, and they also made a completely metal version of the novel. I really enjoyed talking to so many fans of science fiction and of stories in general. Because that's really what Comic-Con is, and I never really thought about it before, but it's this four-day extravaganza that is fueled by the passion people have for fictional worlds of all kinds. CNN: What's next? Are you working on a new novel? Yu: Yes, definitely working on a new novel. In addition to that, I'm also excited about another idea I have been developing, which I hope will work as a serial and/or comic book. It's sort of spun-out of the universe of ""How to Life Safely,"" not really in terms of the main story or characters, but out of a concept from that universe. CNN: Could we see ""How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe,"" the movie? If so, who would you want to play you? Yu: I would love to see it. It'd be exciting to see how someone else would visualize such a self-referential, conceptual world. I mean, it's literally a metaphor-driven time travel device. It'd be very cool to see my own brother, Kelvin, who is an actor, because I think he'd do a great job. Then again, maybe he'd do too good a job, and it would be too close for comfort. In which case, I'll just say Matt Damon. Is that too weirdly specific? He's just good in everything. CNN: Any words of wisdom? Yu: If you ever find yourself face to face with a future version of yourself, don't shoot! You may regret it.","Charles Yu's trip to Comic-Con has science-fiction fans buzzing about his new book .

"(CNN) -- When a 'Yellow Dragon' roars, Beijing listens. The Forbidden City in Beijing was enveloped by floating sand and dust on March 18, 2008. These huge, sky-blackening dust storms sweep across Asia in March and April, bringing with them millions of tons of sand from inner Mongolia and depositing it in China and on across the Korean peninsula to Japan. During the past few years the storms have grown in ferocity and scale, and they are at the vanguard of an advancing Gobi desert that threatens more than 400 million people in the Chinese provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The economic toll has been estimated to cost the Chinese economy $6.5 billion per year. But desertification is not limited to China and it is fast becoming a serious global problem that will only be exacerbated by climate change. In the Chinese provinces of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang the causes are reasonably straightforward, and in many ways they area is an exemplar of the situation in developing countries worldwide. Rapid population growth has put enormous pressure on agricultural systems that have been pushed towards unsustainable farming practices in order to cope with demand. In China livestock numbers have nearly doubled in the last 30 years, from around 200 million in the early 1970's, to 427 million in 2002. As a result huge amount of marginal land has been taken in as pasture, overgrazed to the point of exhaustion, and now farmers are being forced to watch the topsoil literally blow away on the spring winds. In Africa demand for water has shrunk Lake Chad by 95 percent since the 1960s, leaving only sand and scrub. In Kazakhstan desertification has meant that nearly 50 percent of cropland has been abandoned since 1980. The Sahara is advancing into Ghana and Nigeria at the rate of 3,510 square kilometers per year. In Iran, fierce sandstorms are believed to have buried more than 100 villages in 2002. But this is only expected to get worse. Across the world climate change is set to exacerbate problems where poor land use and population pressure is already putting an immense strain on finely balanced ecologies. Africa may only be able to feed 25 percent of its population by 2025, according to the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa. Many countries in the Mediterranean basin could face a future of significant food and water shortages as climate change bites and deserts spread. Already desertification is estimated to cost Spain US$200 million per year. Predicting the regional effect of climate change is always difficult, but some scientists are suggesting a four degrees rise in the Mediterranean by 2100, with an associated 10 percent to 40 percent drop in rainfall. A change on this scale would cause existing areas of desert to spread and exacerbate the problems associated with erosion, wildfires and the salinization of the water table. Already water supplies In Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia are at or close to 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, which is widely taken as a benchmark for water scarcity. Globally crop yields are likely to fall substantially as the area of desert grows across Africa, the Middle East, the United States and Europe and this, coupled with associated rising prices for key crops such as maize and soybeans, could threaten food security in some countries. Scientists also predict that water shortages could increase the risk of supply contamination and associated diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Because desertification is often caused by population pressure, effective control is hard to achieve and many solutions are focused on dealing with the symptoms rather than the root cause of the problem. The Chinese government is creating a forest belt stretching 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) to block the advancing sands of the Gobi desert and diminish the effect of the sandstorms. The African Union is seeking support to fund a similar ""Green Wall"" to hold back the Sahara. In Algeria officials hope that the inauguration of the 250,000 hectare Taghit National Park will slow the advance of the sands. But for such schemes to work they will need to take account of local context and build what Camilla Toulmin, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, calls ""a mosaic of local innovations."" She cites the regeneration of trees around fields in central Niger, and the terraces for soil and water conservation in Burkina Faso as perfect examples. Many ecologists argue that it is small, simple, localized changes towards more sustainable patterns of land-use that will offer effective long-term solutions. For example, in many areas of the world the search for fuel for cooking fires puts enormous strain on the landscape: as trees are cut down, erosion increases and deserts spread. But the shift towards using cheap, fuel-efficient 'rocket stoves' and solar cookers could cut the amount of wood needed dramatically. Leguminous plants, such as beans, which 'fix' nitrogen from the air can be used to help restore fertility in already damaged areas. Belts of trees and grass can be used to reduce wind velocity and stop sand spreading, and provide a managed resource for local communities. In Spain, Sunseed Desert Technology, an organization that ""aims to develop, demonstrate and communicate accessible, low-tech methods of sustainable living in a semi arid environment"" has had enormous success renovating abandoned 1,000-year old Moorish irrigation systems. They believe that similar systems, alongside ""appropriate technology"" such as solar heaters and biogas producers, may offer a way to slow desertification in many other countries. What is becoming clearer year-by-year is that we can't fight the advancing desert - only by looking after the land can we expect it to look after us.

"Washington (CNN) -- Depending on whom you ask, either Democratic efforts to force big-dollar donors out of the shadows are a smokescreen that hides union clout, or Republicans opposing the efforts are just blowing smoke in an attempt to ensure well-heeled donors stay anonymous. ""Right around an election, when the campaigns start rolling in the money, we're going to hear about disclosure from whichever side is getting less,"" said Lisa Rosenberg, a government affairs consultant who lobbies for financial transparency for the Sunlight Foundation. ""Whichever party is feeling beaten up is going to say, 'We need to fix it.'"" Keenly aware that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has out-raised President Barack Obama in direct contributions for the past two months, Democrats twice brought a Senate bill to the floor aimed at unmasking wealthy, secret donors to outside groups -- the kind that have thrown their weight behind Republican candidates this election cycle. Nearly 700 independent political groups have poured more than $187 million into 2012 campaigns nationwide so far, according to FEC records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. More than $41 million of that has come from groups that disclose only a limited amount of information about their donors, or none at all. CNN Money: Top super PAC donors . About $140 million of the total has been spent by conservative groups, with most of that laid out during the Republican presidential primary battles, according to the group, which runs the campaign-finance website OpenSecrets.org. It's Democratic concerns about that kind of money that led to two votes this week on a bill called the Disclose Act, which would have required organizations that spend money on politics to name donors who give more than $10,000. Republicans successfully filibustered the measure both times, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accusing Democrats of seeking to cow President Barack Obama's opponents into submission by making activist groups name their high-dollar donors. ""Democrats can call this bill whatever they want, but they cannot conceal its true intent, which is to encourage their allies and discourage their critics from exercising their first amendment right to speak their mind,"" McConnell said. Republicans also complained that the measure gave an unfair break to labor unions, which typically contribute to Democrats. Unions have to disclose their expenditures, but individual members' dues would most likely fall below the $10,000 threshold for disclosure. ""What is the final difference between one $10,000 check and 1,000 $10 checks?,"" asked Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, co-author of a bipartisan 2002 campaign finance law. ""Other than the impact on trees, very little. So why should one be free from having to disclose its origin?"" Senate Republicans block DISCLOSE Act for second straight day . Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, says the power of unions is ""incontrovertible."" But unions already disclose the amount they spend, and its source -- members' dues -- is a known quantity, she said. ""What we don't know is who is bankrolling these patriotic-sounding but vague and unfamiliar groups which are funded to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by individuals, by corporations and trade associations,"" she said. ""... We don't have good enough and routine enough information about union spending to these outside groups, but we have no information from the other side."" Labor groups now have to report political expenditures of more than $5,000, though they don't have to disclose individual members whose dues are pooled to provide that money. Philadelphia labor lawyer Richard Poulson told CNN that's not a break for the unions, just a reflection of the comparative wealth involved. Opinion: Why Democrats need labor unions . ""The Republicans are essentially crying foul because individual union members are not wealthy enough,"" said Poulson, whose firm of Willig, Williams and Davidson has represented several public- and private-sector unions. ""If we were to go back to square one, I don't think anyone on labor's side of the fence is particularly happy the floodgates have been opened with respect to political spending,"" Poulson said. But he added, ""Workers are never going to have as much money as the bosses, and that's just a fact. And you shouldn't punish workers for banding together to get some sort of a voice in the process."" Democrats say legislation is necessary to stanch the tide of money that has been pouring into American politics since the 2010 Supreme Court decision in the Citizen United case. That ruling struck down some long-standing limits on campaign spending by corporations, unions and other groups. A previous version passed the House of Representatives in 2010, but also fell to a GOP filibuster. Reid: ""...there is nothing free about an election purchased by a handful of billionaires for their own self-interest."" ""Instead of standing up for the American people, Republicans stood with big banks and oil companiesâ€”special interests that certainly don't need more clout in Washington,"" President Obama said Monday in a statement released after Republicans successfully blocked the Disclose Act. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the $10,000 limit was added at the request of the National Rifle Association, the GOP-leaning gun-rights lobby. ""We thought that perhaps with the NRA having so much power on the Republicans, that we would raise that to $10,000, which we were told would make them happy,"" the Nevada Democrat said before Tuesday's vote on the legislation. ""But it didn't make any difference to the Republicans."" A longtime foe of any campaign finance legislation, McConnell has argued that full disclosure of campaign donations is ""the best disinfectant,"" as he told NBC in 1997 -- but he's also qualified that call by saying it should be limited to groups directly involved in politics, not ""issue advocacy"" groups like those unleashed by the court's ruling in the Citizens United case. But the opposition had some high-profile opponents on the left as well. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed both the 2010 and 2012 versions, noting that some features it supported in the previous bill -- such as making corporations disclose their political spending to shareholders and requiring broadcaster to provide low-cost airtime -- weren't included this year. ""Measures intended to root out corruption should not interfere with freedom of expression by those wishing to make their voices heard, and disclosure requirements should not have a chilling effect on the exercise of rights of expression and association, especially in the case of controversial political groups,"" several of the ACLU's top lawyers wrote in March. And Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican who has supported earlier overhauls of campaign-finance law, dismissed the Disclose Act as an election-year stunt by Democrats. ""I have long believed that Americans have the right to know who is contributing to political campaigns, and I share the serious concerns of so many who believe that outside, third party groups, should not be allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money without revealing the names of donors,"" Collins said in a statement to CNN. ""That is why it is so frustrating that we find ourselves, once again, being asked to consider a partisan bill that would not fix the real problem."" Meanwhile, Obama and Romney have benefited from the deluge of campaign cash pouring in from the ""super PACs"" spawned by the Citizens United decision. Pro-Obama super PAC raises $6.1 million in June . The pro-Romney Restore Our Future Fund has raised more than $61 million, according to OpenSecrets and spent $53 million of that. The Obama-allied Priorities USA Action has raised nearly $15 million and spent about $10 million, while during the GOP primaries, the super PAC that backed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's failed campaign raised nearly $24 million and spent all but a few hundred thousand. Pro-Romney super PAC brings in $20 million in June . All unions combined have put about $52 million into the 2012 elections so far, according to OpenSecrets. About $30 million of that has gone to Democrats, roughly $4 million to Republicans and the rest to independent groups. Rarely do big-dollar donors to either candidate rush forward to give their names and declare how much they've contributed. ""Money is never going to run short in our political system,"" the Sunlight Foundation's Rosenberg said. ""Where it does run short is (what's fair) for the average voter and the average citizen ... if you are a voter and you're being bombarded with negative ads and you don't know whose behind them."" Does big money spell big trouble in campaigns? CNN's Joe Johns and Ted Metzger contributed .","Democrat and Republican leaders are battling over disclosing big-dollar donors .

"(CNN) -- Republican Sen. Rob Portman gets so into character playing Barack Obama during debate prep that his performance four years ago sparring with then-GOP presidential candidate John McCain made his wife, Cindy, run out of the room crying. ""Part of your responsibility in these debates is to be tougher so the candidate you are helping is ready for the worst of it -- so you have to be mean. You need to get under their skin. Sometimes the candidate you are working with doesn't appreciate it, and even more often, their family doesn't appreciate it,"" Portman told CNN in an exclusive interview. Portman is the Republicans' go-to sparring partner for mock presidential debates. Since 2000, he has played the roles of Al Gore, Joe Lieberman, John Edwards and Barack Obama. 5 things to watch in tonight's debate . Portman was careful not to discuss his current debate prep with Mitt Romney, since it is ongoing. Still, he said he has never agreed to an interview about his recurring Democratic role, until now. Portman said he spends hours reading, studying and watching everything he can get his hands on to best embody Democrats and to prepare Republicans for debates. Though he declined to portray his Obama imitation, those who have seen it say it is uncanny. ""He gets the style down, he gets the substance down, and he can really make you believe that he's Barack Obama,"" said Brett O'Donnell, a GOP debate coach who has worked with Portman over the years. ""He works very hard to understand every line of argument that the president might make and between those two characteristics, there isn't anyone better,"" O'Donnell said. GOP sources say Portman's no-holds-barred style has been especially important during his countless hours with the former Massachusetts governor, since Romney sources admit one of his potential weak spots is becoming overly defensive, which can result in a gaffe. A Romney adviser tells CNN his mock debates with Portman have gotten so intense that they make a point to build in breaks for him to decompress with his family. Inside Romney's mock debates, which began a month ago at a friend's home in rural Vermont, aides say they do their best to create what spokesman Kevin Madden calls ""game-day conditions."" That means practicing the best way to talk policy, but also making sure the room is set to feel as close to the real thing as possible: two podiums and a moderator, played by longtime Romney adviser Peter Flaherty. Members of Romney's inner circle, including Beth Myers, Stuart Stevens and Ed Gillespie, then dissect the answers and look for areas of improvement. In debates, presidential candidates' tics and tells matter . O'Donnell says it's impossible to underestimate the importance of the psychological aspect of debate prep. ""There's three things that you have to do to prepare a candidates: they have to know the policy material, they have to know the answers to the questions. The second thing is they have to know the strategy and how to execute it. But the third thing and probably the most important is they have to be mentally prepared. ""It's just like preparing an athlete, if they're not mentally prepared for the worst of the worst then something will take them by surprise and so those mock debates are extremely important because I look at it like a batter in the on deck circle, they swing a heavy bat or a bat with a weight on it so that when they get in the batter's box the bat feels lighter,"" O'Donnell explained. Part of the prep is not just what Romney says; it's how he acts and reacts. Portman remembers preparing to play Al Gore in mock debates with George W. Bush during the 2000 campaign, and noticing that Gore got unusually physically close to his opponent, Bill Bradley. So Portman, acting as Gore, invaded Bush's personal space during rehearsal. ""Governor Bush's reaction was, 'He is not going to do that, that is ridiculous,' and sure enough in that last debate, which was the one we were prepping for, Al Gore did just that. I saw Governor Bush smile. I wonder if he was smiling saying 'Darn, Portman was right' or if he was just smiling at Al Gore, but he handled it well,"" Portman recalled. O'Donnell, who was brought into the Romney campaign after a few underwhelming debate performances during the GOP primaries, says the candidate is extremely responsive to critiques. John King: Debate all about trust for Romney . ""He is a great student of political debate. He works very hard at it, so I think that he is absolutely coachable. He was able to do things across the debates, change a strategy, that let him win a majority of these debates,"" O'Donnell said. O'Donnell considers the CNN debate in Jacksonville, Florida, one of Romney's great debate moments -- when Newt Gingrich refused to criticize Romney about lacking transparency as the former speaker had so often done on the campaign trail. Romney jumped in and asked, ""Wouldn't it be nice if people didn't make accusations somewhere else that they aren't willing to defend here?"" ""It took Gingrich's argument and showed the absurdity in one line,"" O'Donnell said. ""It created a moment in the debate where through one line, he could capture the imagination of the press, capture the imagination of the audience, and make a point -- make a strong point that crystallized that entire debate in one line, and that's what Governor Romney has to be looking for now,"" O'Donnell said. GOP sources say Romney has been working up a few one liners to get his points across, but O'Donnell also said he hoped the Romney campaign isn't also practicing ""zingers"" as The New York Times reported over the weekend. ""It's not about zingers,"" O'Donnell said. ""A zinger might be just something funny, a comedic line, something to sort of break the monotony of the debate to try and capture the imagination,"" he said. ""It's something that's sort of shoehorned into the debate. ""But a good line, Reagan's line about his opponent's youth and age, not making that an issue, a good line is a substantive line that does capture the imagination of the press and the audience, to overrun and deliver the message that you want and do it at the expense of your opponent.""

"(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, his two sons and his former interior minister will be retried April 13, Egypt's state-run news agency Mena said Sunday. Mubarak is serving a life sentence for his role in the killings of peaceful protesters during the revolution that eventually deposed him. He and his former interior minister Habib al-Adly appealed their life sentences. And a judge agreed. The judge also said that others facing charges should also be retried, including six interior ministry deputies. Essam El-Erian, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, said in January that the government looked forward to a second trial. ""God willed the retrial would take place under Morsy's rule, with new evidence and new defendants,"" El-Erian said. Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, was found guilty in June of ordering the killing of protesters and was immediately transferred to Tora prison in southern Cairo to serve his life sentence. The 84-year-old has suffered a range of physical problems since he was driven from office in February 2011, following weeks of protests by Egyptians demanding more freedom and reforms. He attended his trial later that year on a gurney. In December, Mubarak was transferred to a military hospital after suffering a head injury and a bruised chest when he slipped in a prison hospital bathroom, Egyptian state-run media reported.","Mubarak is serving a life sentence, which he appealed .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Police are questioning a suspect in connection with an acid attack that disfigured the artistic director of Russia's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow authorities said Tuesday. Sergei Filin was doused with acid by a masked assailant in January, an attack that caused severe burns. Russian authorities gave little more detail on the investigation. In January, doctors fought to save Filin's sight and said it may take at least six months for him to recover from the third-degree burns to his face and eyes. He was coming home around midnight January 17 when the unidentified attacker flung concentrated acid at him on a Moscow street, the state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. The agency reported Filin had suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls and the slashed car tires. Shortly before the acid attack, somebody attempted to hack his Facebook page, RIA Novosti said. Filin took up the key role at the world-renowned ballet company in 2011 after three years directing Moscow's Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater.","An masked attacker doused acid on Sergei Filin, causing severe burns .

"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- Torrential rains and landslides in Guatemala have killed at least 37 people, and could claim as many as 100 lives, the country's emergency services agency said Sunday. In addition, it reported 30 people were injured and 23 were missing after heavy weekend rains caused hillsides to collapse. President Alvaro Colom declared a national emergency Saturday. He told reporters that authorities closed parts of the Inter-American Highway after rains washed out entire sections of the road and caused at least two accidents over the weekend. The first, near kilometer marker 82, claimed 12 lives when a bus was buried, according to Colom's office. Landslides also fell at kilometer marker 171, knocking a number of vehicles and a bus off the road. When nearby residents rushed to the scene to help, a second mudslide crashed down on the exact same spot, said the emergency agency. Throughout the country, authorities have recovered 37 bodies but more are expected, officials have said. Thousands of homes, in addition to infrastructure and fields of crops, also were damaged by the heavy rains. Nearly 42,000 people have been affected and more than 10,000 have been evacuated from the area, said emergency spokesman David De Leon Villeda. Nearly 7,000 people are housed in shelters. The torrential downpours come several months after more than 150 people died when Tropical Storm Agatha hit Guatemala in May. Destruction from that storm was widespread throughout the nation, with mudslides destroying homes and buildings and burying some victims. At least nine rivers had dramatically higher levels and 13 bridges collapsed, Guatemala's emergency services agency said. The May downpours created a sinkhole the size of a street intersection in northern Guatemala City. Residents told CNN that a three-story building and a house fell into the hole. Journalist Miguel Escalona contributed to this report.","The death toll could reach 100, national emergency agency says .

"(CNN) -- Guatemala's Constitutional Court has barred the country's former first lady from running for president -- shaking up the political landscape a month before the election. The court's Monday ruling means Sandra Torres, who divorced Guatemala's current president in an attempt to circumvent a nepotism law, has now exhausted her appeals. The seven justices voted unanimously that Torres was not eligible to be on the ballot because close relatives of the president are constitutionally barred from running. Three of the judges had additional arguments for the decision. Their decision upheld a Supreme Court of Justice ruling issued last month. Torres slammed the ruling Tuesday, saying it left Guatemala's neediest citizens without anyone to represent them in the country's highest office. ""Without any legal basis, they made decisions that were political, not legal,"" she told reporters Tuesday. ""For me, it is anti-democratic, this political lynching, this lynching in the media,"" she added. Torres filed for divorce from President Alvaro Colom on March 11; the divorce was finalized in April. The country's Supreme Court ruled last month that the divorce was used to avoid the constitutional prohibition, and that in trying to get around the law, Torres committed fraud. She appealed to the Constitutional Court, which has final say in all constitutional matters. The Constitutional Court said that Torres was a close relative of the president and thus not eligible to run, but it dissented by rejecting that legal fraud had occurred. Some followers of Torres, who were gathered outside the court, cried when they heard the news. Torres said Tuesday that she had not decided whether to support another presidential candidate. She urged her followers to support congressional and mayoral candidates from the coalition of parties behind her candidacy, saying they would protect social programs. In her statement before the Constitutional Court last week, Torres accused the supreme court of having politicized justice. More than 1.7 million Guatemalans had signed a petition saying they wanted her as a candidate, she said, arguing that the people's voice should be heard. ""Democracy is built with more democracy,"" she told the judges. In her argument she reiterated that she was ""not married to anyone"" and suggested that there was discrimination against her because of her gender. Torres, 55, is a former businesswoman and clothing exporter. She was the candidate of the coalition of the National Unity for Hope Party (UNE) and the Grand National Alliance (GANA). The end to her candidacy could boost the presidential aspirations of the front-runner, retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the Patriotic Party. According to a Prodatos poll released in late July, 37.6% of those surveyed said they would vote for Perez Molina in the September 11 elections. Torres came in second with 17.2% of the vote. The poll also asked who they would vote for if Torres' candidacy was rejected. With Torres out, Perez Molina's numbers rose to 41.2%, and former congressman Manuel Baldizon, of the Democratic Renovated Liberty Party (Lider), was a distant second with 13.6%.","NEW: Sandra Torres says judges made their decision ""without any legal basis""

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Intense security marked the start of court proceedings against 94 detainees in the United Arab Emirates' capital of Abu Dhabi. The detainees are accused of trying to overthrow the government. They are also accused of being political activists connected with Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned in the UAE . ""They launched, established and ran an organisation seeking to oppose the basic principles of the UAE system of governance and to seize power,"" Attorney General Salem Saeed Kubaish said in a January statement published by state media. Their trials started Monday amid widespread scrutiny of how the UAE would handle the proceedings. Only local media were allowed inside the court, where only two members from each detainee's family were allowed in. Others had to wait outside. Asma Al-Siddiq, 26, said both her husband and her father were among the 94 detainees accused. ""The proceedings taken by the court today are not fair,"" she said. ""The women were forced to remove their niqab (face cover). My sister had to remove her niqab to get in. My brother Ibrahim Al-Siddiq was arrested today while in his car ... for having a badge with a picture of the detainees on it."" ""My brother's arrest today is a complete act of oppression towards us,"" she added. Mohammed Al-Naimi's brother is also facing the charges. ""They kept extending his detention with no reason,"" Al-Naimi said. The trial began the same day John Kerry arrived in Abu Dhabi on his first visit to the Middle East in his new role as U.S. secretary of state. Human Rights Watch released a statement calling for Kerry to address the plight of the 94 detainees, claiming 64 had been held at undisclosed locations for up to a year and denied access to lawyers until the last two weeks. The group claims the detainees include two prominent human rights lawyers, Mohammed al-Roken and Mohammed al-Mansoori, as well as judges, teachers and student leaders. ""Emirati citizens have a lot to fear when their government can detain them without charge for months and then deny them due process in trials that can't be appealed,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Secretary Kerry should urge UAE authorities to end these shameful practices and ensure a fair trial for these activists."" Of the 94 defendants, 10 are still at large and are being tried in absentia, the state news agency WAM reported. The court adjourned Monday to consider the pleas entered so far, WAM said. Another hearing is set for March 11. Many believe UAE authorities are clamping down on freedom of expression since the Arab Spring swept across the Middle East staring in early 2011. Unelected ruling families in oil-rich Gulf countries such as Barhrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have sought to prevent popular uprisings. But countries such as Bahrain have also received criticism for their heavy-handed use of force. While there has been little protest in the majority Sunni and hugely wealthy UAE, authorities are taking no chances. Political parties and demonstrations are banned in the UAE, and last week an academic from the London School of Economics and Political Science was barred entry to the country. The academic was set to speak at a conference on the political situation in Bahrain.","The 94 detainees are accused of trying to overthrow the government .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Police have captured a man they allege is one of the main producers of methamphetamine for Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, authorities said. Police detained Jaime ""JH"" Herrera in Culiacan, Sinaloa, said Eduardo Pequeno, the head of the anti-drug department of Mexico's Federal Police. Authorities seized roughly $2 million worth of methamphetamine during his arrest, Pequeno said. Herrera was arrested Monday, as a result of intelligence work by federal police, Mexico's ministry of public security said. Herrera, 43, is a fugitive in the United States, where he is wanted on several criminal counts, the ministry said, without giving further details. Authorities trace his alleged criminal history to 1996, as a dealer of synthetic drugs in Los Angeles, and the following year began to produce methamphetamine in his hometown of Culiacan, where he carried out operations until 1999, the ministry said. Herrera moved his operations closer to the United States, to the border town of Tijuana, before returning to Culiacan by 2002, the public security ministry alleges. At this time, he began working for the Sinaloa cartel, led by one of the world's most wanted drug traffickers, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. By that time, there was a shortage of chemicals for the production of methamphetamine, which led Herrera to branch out directly to Colombian traffickers, as well as to suppliers in China and Guatemala, the ministry alleges. He is accused of transporting the drugs to the border area with a fleet of three planes and using ground routes to smuggle the drugs to Los Angeles, the ministry said. Following his arrest, he told authorities that he moved several tons of drugs into the United States between 2008 and 2009, the ministry said.

"(CNN) -- As any ex-jock can tell you, any time you try exercising a muscle that has gone unused for a decade or more, something predictable happens: It barks like hell. This is what we're seeing in this last pathetic run-up to the forced spending cuts agreed to by Congress and the president in July 2011 as a fail-safe in case the federal government couldn't agree on a totally necessary but politically difficult settlement to address the country's long-term fiscal unsustainability. ""Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings,"" President Barack Obama warned. (PolitiFact verdict: half true. ""There is no indication that Americans will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester,"" said PolitiFact, but added ""pretty close to 'hundreds of thousands'"" could lose flu vaccinations and cancer screenings.) A trio of Republican senators (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte) jointly bemoaned ""the calamitous effects that budget sequestration would have on our nation's economy and security."" Politicians have been trying to outdo each other in deploying what the neoliberal Washington Monthly founder Charles Peters coined in 1976 as the ""firemen first"" principle -- the notion that ""the public will support (the Clever Bureaucrat's) valiant fight against the budget reduction only if essential services are endangered. Thus, C.B. always picks on teachers, policemen, firemen first."" So an already rattled nation is being spooked by horror stories of three-hour airport security lines, delayed background check for gun purchases and criminals running freely through the streets. All this for a spending cut that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will be around $44 billion in 2013, a tiny sliver of the federal budget. Imagine the squeals if it included significant cuts. Zelizer: GOP will get blame for cuts . No doubt there will be those who find such fear-mongering persuasive. But for the rest of us, it suggests a rather pressing and relevant question: Just what, precisely, did we get from doubling the cost of the federal government between 2000 and 2010? If the bureaucrats can't produce an explanation for the price increase of government, then they should not expect their budgets to be rubber-stamped by an already suffering public. So the squawking you hear is from a government money-machine having difficulty adapting to a political universe that no longer accepts automatic annual increases. And we'll keep hearing it until the moment politicians have the courage to align government expenditures within miles of revenue. The Nobel Prize-winning economist James Buchanan, who died in January, warned us three decades ago about the ""permanent disconnect"" between revenue and spending, brought about by politicians scared of charging taxpayers full freight for government goodies. Opinion: The fairy tale on spending cuts . ""The attractiveness of financing spending by debt issue to the elected politicians should be obvious,"" he wrote. ""Borrowing allows spending to be made that will yield immediate political payoffs without the incurring of any immediate political cost."" We are living with the results: National debt greater than 100% of annual gross domestic product and no end in sight, just as the baby boomers stop working and start sucking down expensive federal entitlements. Even if borrowing costs remain at their historic lows in perpetuity, this kind of debt overhang is more dangerous than any mild bureaucratic shuffle necessitated by the 1% trim. Why? In their controversial April 2012 National Bureau for Economic Research working paper, economists Carmen M. Reinhart, Vincent R. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff concluded that when countries carry debt of more than 90% of GDP for five or more consecutive years, economic growth gets chopped down by more than a whole percentage point each year for decades. What's the best method for reversing a debt crisis? In a 2009 paper (PDF), Harvard economists Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna examined more than 100 debt-reduction efforts worldwide since 1970, and asserted that ""spending cuts are much more effective than tax increases in stabilizing the debt and avoiding economic downturns."" The authors found ""several episodes in which spending cuts adopted to reduce deficits have been associated with economic expansions rather than recessions."" Opinion: Cuts will turn off voters GOP is courting . Taxpayers shouldn't be fearing the forced spending cuts, they should be fearing that the cuts don't go nearly far enough. And politicians should realize that short-term debt service and long-term entitlements are going to keep shrinking the money left over for doling out goodies. Like other things that can't go on forever, fiscal irresponsibility won't. Time to get those muscles in shape.

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- The finance minister of Honduras has resigned after police arrested his wife. Authorities said they found a stash of money totaling more than $57,000 in her car. After resigning Wednesday, former Finance Minister Hector Guillen told CNN affiliate Televicentro that the money was obtained as part of a loan. But authorities said they were investigating whether his wife, Dinora, was laundering money. ""Here in this country, it's not that it's prohibited to carry money. But what is prohibited is not having proof of where the money came from. I can't say whether they are money laundering. The law is clear and is being applied,"" said Juan Carlos Bonilla, the nation's police chief. In Honduras, the law requires anyone transporting the equivalent of more than $10,000 to declare it before authorities and establish where it came from. Guillen's wife was transporting 1.12 million lempiras, worth more than $57,000. A special prosecutor for organized crime is handling the case. ""What the prosecutors ... will look for objectively is whether the money was acquired in a legal manner,"" said Carlos Vallecillo, a spokesman for the office. Police say the former finance minister's wife could not prove where the money came from when she was stopped by police Tuesday. Guillen resigned the next day, but he told CNN affiliate Televicentro that no one in his family had committed a crime. The money was a financier's loan that was intended to be used to buy dollars and pay a supplier in Guatemala who provides products for a bed store the former finance minister owns, he said. ""My wife and my son did not know they were carrying the money until they were stopped by the police. Only the driver was aware of the situation because it was a last-minute thing,"" Guillen said. ""It will be the courts that determine this situation,"" he added, ""and in order to protect my family and my honor I have taken the decision to resign from my post in order to face life, as I always have done, honestly and fully."" If the family cannot clarify where the money came from, they could be charged with laundering money and face up to 20 years in prison.","Hector Guillen resigns as finance minister, but says his family committed no crime .

"(CNN) -- It's a case that has become emblematic of the risks involved in international adoption. The case involves a now-6-year-old girl, two countries (the United States and Guatemala), and two families who, in addition to th girl, have been deeply affected by what a Guatemala woman describes as her daughter's kidnapping five years ago. Loyda Rodriguez, a 26-year-old Guatemalan mother, says she was arriving home in Guatemala City in November of 2006 with her three children when a woman grabbed her then-2-year-old daughter and got into a waiting taxi. After months of posting flyers, visiting orphanages and talking to strangers, Rodriguez says she found her daughter by staging a hunger strike and pressuring Guatemalan authorities to show her international adoption records. As she was patiently reviewing about 2,000 files in 2008, the mother's heart sank.  Her little girl had been offered for adoption under a false name and adopted by an American family in Liberty, Missouri. The mother-daughter relationship was confirmed through DNA -- a DNA sample is taken from every Guatemalan child adopted internationally, and the sample from the girl matched Rodriguez. After a three-year legal case, a Guatemalan judge issued a ruling that is expected to test the limits of international law: an American couple must return the girl they adopted to her biological mother in the country of her birth. When Rodriguez learned about the decision in late July, she broke down in tears.  For the first time the judge was giving her the possibility of seeing her daughter again.  Would she remember her after such a long time? ""I have fought so hard for this.  It's been almost five years and this surprising ruling makes me very happy,"" Rodriguez said. She also had a message for the American couple who adopted her daughter.  ""All I want to tell them is to return my girl.  I don't have anything against them because perhaps they took my daughter without knowing that she had been stolen from me.  That's why I want to ask them to return her to me because I have been suffering for five years,"" Rodriguez said. The American couple apparently had no idea that the girl they were adopting was kidnapped.  They haven't made any public statements.  But Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for the adoptive parents, issued a written statement saying :""The family will continue to advocate for the safety and best interests of their legally adopted child. They remain committed to protecting their daughter from additional trauma as they pursue the truth of her past through appropriate legal channels."" Eight people are behind bars in Guatemala in connection with this case, including the judge who allowed the adoption to take place. He is accused of taking bribes in exchange for expediting cases. All eight individuals have trials pending. Usha Smerdon, vice president of Ethica, a nonprofit corporation that monitors adoption practices throughout the world, called the case of the Guatemalan girl ""an absolute tragedy."" Speaking to CNN affiliate KCTV in Missouri, Smerdon added that ""if something like this is what it takes for there to be real reform and oversight over the international adoption process, that portion of it is a good result; but I would never wish this on anyone."" Claudia Maria Hernandez, assistant director of a Guatemalan non-governmental organization known as Survivors Foundation, says this case should send a message to authorities in charge of monitoring adoptions throughout the world. ""More than anything,"" Hernandez says, ""this case is about a child's right to live with their true family, the parents' right to raise their own biological children which in this case was clearly violated, and the respect to the rule of law."" The ruling issued by the Guatemalan judge says the girl must be returned to her biological parents within two months.  Advocates for the biological family in Guatemala say that because this could be considered a human trafficking case under international law, if the girl is not returned, Interpol could be asked to assist in taking the girl back to her native country. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday she had seen reports on the case. Her only comment was that the situation ""speaks to the complicated nature of these foreign adoption cases.""","Loyda Rodriguez says her 2-year-old daughter was kidnapped .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- You'll have a hard time finding another city in Europe whose recent history has been more influenced by the United States than Berlin. In the German capital near the Brandenburg Gate -- right where the Wall used to divide this town into communist Eastern and capitalist Western sides -- the U.S. Embassy recently set up a plaque commemorating Ronald Reagan's 1987 speech where the 40th president called on then Soviet leader Mikhael Gorbachev to, ""tear down this wall."" Just a ten minute drive away you reach the former Checkpoint Charlie, the scene of a major standoff between American and Russian tanks in 1961 that brought the world close to nuclear war. And just another ten minutes away you find the city hall of the district of SchÃ¶neberg, where John F. Kennedy held his famous speech in 1963, pledging allegiance with this city on the front line of the Cold War and finishing with the famous words, ""Ich bin ein Berliner."" My own history is reflected in this special relationship Berlin has with the U.S. as well. In the late 1970's and early 1980's my father worked as the East Berlin correspondent for West German TV. I went through the Berlin Wall every morning from East to West to get to kindergarten. In 1982 we moved to Washington D.C, where America embraced us immediately and we embraced American culture. Today, my family and I live in Berlin. Germans have a lot to thank America for. Berliners have a lot to thank America for. They know that. It does not mean they have to like all American policies or the current state of American politics. Clemens Wergin, foreign editor of Die Welt newspaper, says most Germans are well informed about the state of the election campaigns. ""Given that America is still the superpower, people tend to inform themselves quite regularly about the states and U.S. politics,"" Wergin told CNN, noting that a vast majority of Germans would vote for the incumbent president if given the option. ""This is because Democrats usually are seen to be more in tune with some core European beliefs regarding welfare, the use of military force, the role of religion in society or social issues such as abortion or gun rights."" Furthermore, many Germans equate Mitt Romney with the policies of the Bush administration -- and positions he staked out during the primary season have toughened many Germans' views of the Republican nominee. Many believe Romney will further cut social programs in the U.S. and repeal Obamacare -- not the most popular stance in a country like Germany, which has a very large public health care system. In 2008, then-Senator Obama used Berlin as a stage for a major foreign policy speech. More than 200,000 Berliners and expats showed up to watch the man promising change after eight years of George W. Bush alienated many Germans -- and led them to fundamentally question whether the U.S. and Europe were finally drifting apart for good. Now, four years later, the mood is more subdued and the Obama hype has cooled down. ""He has lost some of his appeal and people realized that he couldn't deliver the change he promised,"" says Wergin, an assessment many Berliners would agree with. Interest in American politics and the upcoming election is waning not only due to a perceived decline of American power, but also because Germany and Europe are grappling with a financial crisis that has propelled Germany into the leadership role the country has tried to avoid since the end of World War II. Therefore, it is no surprise that the race for the White House only rarely makes it to the top of the news agenda in Germany. It was may have been front page news after the presidential and vice presidential debates, but the campaign remains buried deep in the ""international news"" sections on most other days. The U.S. has been all but absent as the European Union deals with the biggest economic and identity crisis in its history. Meanwhile, Germany is awkwardly finding itself in the role that the U.S. used to fulfill for many Europeans: the major power, hated for seemingly bullying smaller countries to follow its lead, but also admired because it is the only one with the stability and financial firepower to come to terms with the crisis. Strangely, a tour around Berlin illustrates this new balance of power as well. The plaques, monuments, and historical sites that illustrate America's sacrifices for this country and this city are still here, but they're from an era that has passed. A new Berlin has risen and forged for itself a new and very unique identity as a major political and cultural center in the heart of Europe. Germany and its capital city have grown up and evolved. They will take note of American politics, but ultimately American politics will not steer them away from the course they are charting for themselves and for Europe.","Few cities' recent history has been more influenced by the U.S. than Berlin .
While Berliners have a lot to thank U.S. for, that doesn't mean they like U.S. policies .
American policies will not divert Berlin from charting course of Europe ."
"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- When Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election in 2008, people in Islamabad exchanged congratulatory text messages. As he delivered his famous ""yes we can"" victory speech in Chicago, people in Islamabad eagerly watched the entire live telecast, cheering or exclaiming every sentence. Some ended up crying tears of joy. Pakistan's melodramatic response to American politics was exclusive to that time. It was, and still is, an exception rather than the rule. Postcard: Baghdad places little faith in election . So far, this year's U.S. election has only featured in the international news segment of flagship bulletins, the inside pages of English-language newspapers, and the occasional mention on late-night current affairs programs. It is not something people discuss with friends and colleagues. Some feel compelled, because of the nature of their work, to stay informed of world events. There are some whose interests are tied to the decisions made in Washington, D.C. These are the only people who follow the U.S. election story. The people of whom I speak can loosely be termed the ""civil society"" of Islamabad. They are well-meaning people, but people who mean different things. There are students and teachers among them, leftists, modern Islamists, artists and writers, business people and professionals, people who want a revolution in Pakistan now and people who are resigned to the fact that it's not happening in their lifetime -- and they are very few in number. Postcard: ""Ignore us at your peril,"" Afghans say . For the middle and lower middle-class majority of Islamabad, the U.S. presidential race is only of marginal interest. The man on Islamabad's streets is fairly clear in his conviction that the United States is one, or several, of the following: the Satan, the bully, the flag carrier of brutal capitalism, the enemy of Islam, the friend and benefactor of Israel, the blinding light of modernity, the abyss of moral depravity, the ugly face of imperialism, and other epithets given from the pulpit of mosques, pronounced on street banners and graffiti, and echoed in Op-Ed pages of Urdu-language newspapers. It is a measure of success for the anti-U.S. agenda that the public hatred for America overrides facts as conveniently today as it did in the 1980s. Postcard: Athenians fear what follows U.S. election . When Salman Rushdie's novel ""The Satanic Verses"" came out -- and was promptly banned by Pakistan -- thousands of people vented their anger against the British author of Indian ancestry (whose book was published in England) by demonstrating at the U.S. mission in Islamabad. When some ""hurtful"" cartoons are published in Norway, a few Pizza Huts will be burnt down in Karachi and Lahore. When a man purported to be a Coptic Christian based in the United States makes a cheap spoof of a film about Islam -- presumably to stoke the fire of religious hatred in Middle East -- two dozen Pakistanis die during the ensuing protests, trying to reach American diplomatic and cultural missions in the country. Pakistanis are also quite resigned to the fact that the government in Islamabad -- which is led alternately by the right-leaning Muslim League or the ""progressive"" Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) -- is always more loyal to the United States than its own people, and that every U.S. government -- be it Democrat or Republican -- always supports the military or civilian despots in Islamabad and is therefore always pitted against the common Pakistani. But then 2008 was different. Postcard: Should U.S. raise fist to Cuba? Pakistanis had just gotten rid of General Pervez Musharraf, and had voted in a PPP-led coalition government. Politicians of all shades were speaking as one for the common man; reconciliation, consensus, and change were the buzzwords. Democracy was being touted as the best revenge against undemocratic forces. A mass movement, led by lawyers, sought the restoration to office of nearly 60 superior court judges who had been placed under house arrest by Musharraf. The movement was gaining momentum and it seemed only a matter of days before the rule of law was established. Come the election in November and the wind of change blew in the faraway United States as well. The unthinkable happened. Obama -- a black, first generation immigrant -- had been elected to lead the sole superpower. For Pakistanis, the timing and the lead-up to Obama's victory was too tempting to be ignored as just a coincidence. Pakistan was changing, and the U.S. was changing -- for the better. More: Get latest news at CNN Election HQ . The world was finally going to be peaceful and prosperous for all. And what Obama said in Chicago, addressed exclusively to Americans, was taken as spoken to Pakistanis: ""This is our moment. This is our time -- to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids, to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace."" Fast forward to 2012. Pakistan remains in tatters and without hope. Rampant corruption, pathetic incompetence and callousness towards the plight of the people are the defining attributes of the last episode of Pakistan's ""return to democracy,"" renewing the public's cyclical appetite for military rule. Across seven seas, Obama's presidency too has brought disillusionment. In the minds of many Pakistanis, the U.S. has proved to be the same two-faced hypocrite they always thought it was -- defending free speech when it comes to anti-Muslim propaganda like the Mohammed film, yet at the same time condemning anti-Semitism and coming down hard on government whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. Postcard: Why India longs for U.S. election . At the same time, U.S-Pakistan relations are at an all-time low. Here in Islamabad, we are where we have always been: A state living on the edge of being labeled a failure, with a population that largely believes America is indeed the Satan, the bully, the oppressor, working in league with our government and our military, against us. Change is a mirage, as they say. Hope is dope. Life is miserable and death comes cheaply. Interest in U.S. elections? Pakistani politicians will have a hard time getting people interested in their own elections, due in a few months time.

"(CNN) -- A medical examiner is investigating the death of a 48-year-old stable worker named Adan Fabian Perez, a Guatemala native discovered in the back of a barn at Churchill Downs one day after the storied Louisville racetrack hosted the Kentucky Derby. There are no suspects at this time, Louisville Police Lt. Barry Wilkerson said Monday, noting that police are investigating several altercations that occurred at the track. It is not clear if those altercations are related to Perez's death, which police are treating as a possible homicide due to his wounds and the location of the body. Workers discovered the body around 5 a.m. and notified track security, who called police, said police spokesman Robert Biven. Perez worked for veteran horse trainer Cecil Borel, who is the brother of three-time Derby winning jockey Calvin Borel. ""Those folks are devastated,"" said Churchill Downs spokesman John Asher. Perez had been working for Borel since 2008, and was found at Barn No. 8, which was not where he normally worked, Asher said. About 400 people were located Saturday night in the rear of the racetrack, he said. ""So we are trying to speak with as many people as we possibly can. We do have a few leads coming in."" Biven described the track's backside as ""like a mini-city,"" with 48 barns, workers' dormitories and areas where trainers live. ""It's a 24-hour operation,"" he said. Perez was working at Churchill Downs along with his 19-year-old son, who identified his father's body.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Richard made landfall just south of Belize City Sunday night, said CNN Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. She said the eye of the hurricane hit land around 7:45 p.m. CT (8:45 p.m. ET), some 20 miles (35 kilometers) south-southwest of Belize City. The storm known as Richard intensified in the Caribbean from a tropical storm into a Category 1 hurricane as maximum sustained winds increased to 90 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center reported. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves inland. Monday, it is seen moving across northern Guatemala and into southern Mexico. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization said Sunday all public buses have stopped running and advised private cars to also get off the road. It urged people living in Dangriga, a town in southern Belize, and in vulnerable parts of Belize City to seek shelter immediately. All vessels should remain in port, the organization also advised. Belize, a small country in Central America popular among tourists for its pristine beaches and coral reefs, has a hurricane warning in effect, the National Hurricane Center reported. A hurricane watch is in effect for areas along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. Along with hurricane force winds, the main threat from the slow-moving Richard is the large amounts of rain it will dump on Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula. It is expected to produce three to six inches of rain with local amounts totaling 10 inches. These rains could produce life-threatening flash floods and mud slides, especially in the mountainous terrain. Hurricane Richard is expected to weaken over land and reemerge in the Bay of Campeche as a tropical depression. Conditions are not favorable for redevelopment in the extreme southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center expects Richard to continue to dissipate into a remnant low. ""It is not a concern for the U.S.,"" said John Cangialosi with the hurricane center. ""Even if it does get into the southern Gulf of Mexico, a very strong wind sheer of that area will continue to weaken the system."" A wind sheer is caused when winds go in different directions, causing the storm to weaken. CNN Meteorologist Monica O'Conner and CNN Radio's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","NEW: Hurricane Richard makes landfall with sustained winds of around 90 mph .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. defense chief called on President Hamid Karzai to thank Americans for the sacrifices of those who fought and died in Afghanistan rather than level criticism at the United States. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's comments Friday followed accusations by Karzai that the United States is not doing enough to fight terror in neighboring Pakistan. Karzai also said the United States is failing to supply Afghan forces with weapons it needs to fight insurgents. ""Look, we have made progress in Afghanistan because there are men and women in uniform who have been willing to fight and die for Afghanistan's sovereignty,"" Panetta told reporters shortly after landing in Lima, Peru, for a meeting with Latin American defense officials. Latest Afghan attack: A troubling first? ""Those lives were lost fighting the right enemy not the wrong enemy, and I think it would be helpful if the president, every once in a while, expressed his thanks for the sacrifices that have been made by those who have fought and died for Afghanistan, rather than criticizing them."" The sharp reaction from Panetta, a rare public dressing down of the head of a country, came a day after Karzai accused the United States and NATO of attacking insurgents in Afghanistan rather than targeting the support they receive from Pakistan. ""The U.S. and NATO should go to the places where the roots of terrorism exist. They are saying one thing but acting contrary to that,"" Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul, according to CNN affiliate Tolo TV. Karzai also threatened to turn to Russia and China among others if the United States did not supply Afghanistan with equipment needed to fight the insurgency. ""I asked the U.S. government to equip our air force with weapons, intelligence and transport planes -- we still haven't received a response from them,"" he said. ""Our discussions will continue next week as well, and if they show no interest in this, we will decide whether to purchase from Russia, China, India or any other country."" 5 ways to help fix Afghanistan . Karzai's criticism of the United States come as relations between Kabul and Washington have steadily eroded in recent months, pushed in part by the accidental killing of civilians and the U.S. military's refusal to surrender a number of prisoners to Afghan control. Tensions have been further exacerbated by attacks against coalition troops by Afghan troops or insurgents disguised in security uniforms that have left dozens dead. The timing of Karzai's criticism comes as the United States surpassed a military casualty milestone last month, with more than 2,000 U.S. troops killed in the 11-year war. Karzai laid some of the blame on the United States for the shelling of Afghanistan's eastern border provinces by insurgents inside Pakistan, saying his forces were not sufficiently equipped to respond and the United States should have stepped up. ""According to the Afghan-U.S. strategic pact, the U.S. is committed to defend Afghanistan against any such foreign threat until the Afghan forces find the ability,"" he said. ""We asked them several time but they never accepted that these attacks were occurring."" Panetta said the United States remains committed to timetable to withdraw American combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

"Washington (CNN) -- Acting at the request of an air traffic controller, the pilot of a Southwest Airlines B-737 pulled within one-tenth of a mile of a small, four-seat aircraft last month to check on pilot of the smaller plane, who had not responded to radio calls, the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday. The March 27 incident was publicized days after it happened, when Federal Aviation Administrator Randy Babbitt suspended the air traffic controller, for ""compromising the safety"" of the planes' occupants. But the details released Friday for the first time show just how close the two planes came. According to the NTSB, the planes came within 0.1 miles of each other, far closer then the required separation of three miles. They also were separated by 100 feet in altitude, less than the 1,000 feet required, the NTSB reported. The incident happened 11,000 feet over central Florida, when controllers at the Central Florida TRACON, a regional radar facility, were unsuccessful in contacting the pilot of the Cirrus SR22, which was en route to Kissimmee, Florida. The plane had been out of radio contact with the Jacksonville Center for more than an hour. A TRACON controller sought the assistance of Southwest Airlines flight 821, which was then 10 miles from the smaller aircraft, asking the Southwest pilot ""to attempt to verify the condition of the occupants"" of the Cirrus, the NTSB said. The Southwest pilot ""obliged,"" and controllers guided the jetliner towards the unresponsive plane. A separate radar scope was set up and a single frequency was used by a front-line manager who provided instructions to the Southwest jet. When the Southwest jet was about five miles from the smaller plane, the pilot reported seeing the plane visually and on a collision avoidance system. The jet ""maneuvered on his own alongside of"" the smaller plane, the NTSB said. The crew reported seeing ""two occupants in the Cirrus and no apparent movement from them"" before being vectored away to its Orlando destination. The FAA said both planes landed safely. Southwest Airlines reported in March that it had suspended the pilot of the jetliner pending an investigation. Both the FAA and NTSB are investigating. Neither has issued any findings or conclusions. Aviation authorities say the protocol for intercepting unresponsive aircraft is to scramble military jets. ""By placing this passenger aircraft in close proximity to another plane, the air traffic controller compromised the safety of everyone involved,"" FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a statement in March. ""This incident was totally inappropriate."" ""We are reviewing the air traffic procedures used here and making sure everyone understands the protocols for contacting unresponsive aircraft,"" Babbitt said. Southwest Airlines said the flight had 137 passengers and a crew of five.","The March 27 incident was publicized days after it happened .

"(CNN) -- Walking through a hushed cemetery at night with only a flashlight to guide your way can be a stirring experience for amateur ghost hunters this Halloween. ""A lot of paranormal societies use graveyards for training grounds,"" said Alan Brown, author of more than 20 books on the subject. ""If you get an EMF reading in a graveyard, there is no electricity there, so it has to be coming from some other source."" Oftentimes, the spirits you may encounter in a cemetery aren't kind or frightening but rather full of grief in this final resting place. ""Oddly enough, a lot of cemeteries aren't that haunted,"" said Richard Senate, a historian and ghost hunter of 33 years. ""People haunt where they loved. The idea of haunting a cemetery outside of someone who is grieving -- that's what we're picking up, the grief of a person, rather than their spirit linked to a site."" However, there are still an abundance of spirits roaming their final resting place, he said. Senate shared what he regards as some of the most haunted cemeteries in America. Visiting one of these historic sites just may introduce you to someone, or something, waiting on the other side. St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, New Orleans . Rich with history and lore, New Orleans' above-ground cemeteries have been inspiration for storytellers and authors alike. Before these elaborate tombs were built, the ground often gave up the recently buried during floods or heavy rains. Because the city is situated below the water table, burial was not a practical option, and the small cities of above-ground tombs began. Cemetery No. 1 is perhaps the most famous of New Orleans' cemeteries. Visitors have witnessed phantom figures, Civil War ghosts and yellow fever victims restlessly stalking through the maze of crypts, Senate said. But perhaps the most well-known spirit is that of Marie Laveau, the city's own voodoo queen. She is often seen walking the grounds. ""She haunts her tomb,"" Senate said. ""If you go there, take along a piece of chalk, make 3 X's on her tomb, and if you ask a prayer or request, she will help you get it. Always bring your chalk."" After pausing, Senate added, ""It's a pretty creepy place. I don't know if I want to be there at night."" Resurrection Catholic Cemetery, Chicago . Not all cemetery hauntings involve walking through a graveyard at night. Chicago's most famous spirit is really just looking for some company, and a way home. The locals call her ""Resurrection Mary,"" Senate said. She is seen not only within the cemetery but just outside of the gates. If you're driving through the area, she just may try to hitch a ride. Over the years, thousands of people have reported a young woman who flags down passing cars for a ride home. When they ask for an address, she supplies that of the cemetery. Often, ""Mary"" vanishes in the car or steps out at the cemetery and fades into darkness, Senate said. During the '30s, a Polish woman between the ages of 17 and 22 was on her way back from a dance at the O'Henry Ballroom when she was killed in a car accident. She was buried in Resurrection Cemetery, and locals believe that this is ""Mary."" She is always seen wearing a vintage ball gown and seems incredibly lifelike -- until she vanishes. Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood, California . Not only is this cemetery full of Hollywood legends from the silent film era to our recently departed celebrities, Senate says it is also full of ghosts. And they don't just come out at night; you can see Hollywood's ghosts during the day. Before Rudolph Valentino died, he made a habit of visiting hospitals and spending time with children. He spoke to one little girl who was going to have an operation and offered her words of encouragement. The girl survived her operation and recovered. When Valentino died, she vowed to visit his grave each year and place a red rose on his gravestone. She became known as ""the lady in black,"" and she was quite visible in the '30s. But when the lady in black died, her ghost carried on the tradition. Both her and Valentino's ghosts have been seen by his grave, Senate said. Of course, these are just a couple of the site's rumored hauntings. Boothill Cemetery, Tombstone, Arizona . Once a rollicking silver rush town, Tombstone is now the true embodiment of a ghost town. The scenes of incredible violence that took place in its lawless streets still resonate, especially the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral among the Clantons, the Earps and Doc Holliday. Three of the Clanton gang were killed in the fight, which only lasted about 30 seconds. They now rest in Boothill Cemetery, alongside gamblers, smugglers and outlaws, Senate said. There are dozens of ""boot hill"" cemeteries across the country, especially the West. The name refers to those who ""died with their boots on"" or in a violent way. But Tombstone's cemetery, and the entire town, is considered to be one of the most haunted. Ghosts of outlaws and the Clanton gang are often seen in the cemetery, hoping to avenge their death. ""Tombstone is a true place for ghost hunters to go,"" Senate said. ""It is chock full of haunted sites, and the cemetery is but one."" Gettsyburg Cemetery, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania . The site of one of the deadliest battles in American history is naturally still haunted by the vestiges of war, where families clashed and broke apart on the battlefield during a staggering three-day campaign. The battlefield itself became a burial ground for thousands of men, many of whom were later relocated to proper graves. The Gettysburg Cemetery offers a final resting place for all of the men who never made it home. Shadowy phantom figures in both Union and Confederate uniforms still pace the battlefield and cemetery. But Senate notes that one of the most persistent ghosts is really just there to be social. In the cemetery, a man is often seen wearing a black hat with a star, symbolic of one of the Texas regiments fighting with the Confederates at Gettysburg. He often tries to converse with tourists and on several occasions has posed with families for photos or takes a photo of family if they request it, Senate said. During photo development or even on the camera's screen, the man disappears. For an encapsulating haunted experience, Senate recommends staying in the Farnsworth House Inn. Confederate snipers hid in the house during the battle, and their ghosts roam the rooms today. If you go . Should you decide to stop by any of these cemeteries and go on your own ghost hunt, Senate has a few words of advice. Remember to be respectful of those who have passed on, and don't disturb any grave to try to incite a ghost. ""You should be like a ghost: No one should know you've even been there,"" Senate said.","This Halloween, visit some of the most haunted cemeteries in the country .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Some 48 Syrians, most of them soldiers, and nine Iraqi soldiers were killed Monday in an attack near the western Iraqi town of Ar Rutbah, an official said, raising concerns that Syria's civil war could spill over into Iraq. The Syrian soldiers' convoy was ambushed by gunmen using roadside bombs and machine guns. ""From the beginning, we have warned that some militant groups want to move the conflict in Syria to Iraq,"" said Ali al-Mussawi, adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. ""Militant groups are very active on the border areas between Iraq and Syria. Some of these groups affiliate with al Qaeda in Iraq,"" he added. Al-Mussawi said that many of the Syrians killed in the ambush had earlier received medical treatment in Iraq. They were wounded during a battle at the Yaarabiya-Rabia border crossing a few days ago. The point is called Rabia in Iraq; Yaarabiya in Syria. According to security officials in Ramadi, Iraq, several Syrians were wounded in that battle between the Free Syrian Army and Syrian soldiers. Dozens of Syrian soldiers and officials took refuge in Iraq by surrendering to that country's army on Friday after rebels took over the Yaarabiya post, the officials said. They added that the convoy had been headed from Rabia to the al-Waleed border crossing in Iraq's Anbar province when it was attacked. The United Nations has estimated that about 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's civil war, which began roughly two years ago. Just on Monday, at least 149 people were killed, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group. The deaths include 40 in and around Damascus, 35 in Raqqa province and 25 in Aleppo.","Most of the 48 Syrians were soldiers; nine Iraqi soldiers were also killed .

"(CNN) -- Tragically, another celebrity has died after years of struggling with addiction, personal demons and multiple stints at rehab. Country singer Mindy McCready's death is in the headlines, but similar tragedies happen every day and you never hear about them. Take the case of Wyatt D., who went to rehab at least 12 times for treatment of heroin addiction and whose family notified me last summer of his death from drug-related causes. Caroline R. went to rehab five times before medical complications related to severe alcoholism took her life. And Marnie M. died from a cocaine overdose after attending more than one famous rehab where she never received any professional psychological counseling for her troubled past. These aren't their real names, but sadly, they were real people. All these people desperately wanted to overcome their drug and alcohol problems and, like McCready, they sought help. They attended some of the most recognized facilities in the country, only to be offered the same type of treatment over and over and to have it suggested that something was wrong with them when treatment failed. Just this week, Drew Pinsky, who treated McCready on the third season of his show ""Celebrity Rehab,"" said in reaction to her death, ""Unfortunately, it seems that Mindy did not sustain her treatment."" TV show hosts offered the typical platitudes: ""Stay in treatment; treatment is effective; please get help."" I'll speculate that something else might have been going on with McCready, as it was for many of the more than 100 people I interviewed who had recently experienced the American addiction treatment system. I visited 15 addiction treatment programs across the country -- from celebrity rehabs to high-end 12-step facilities to outpatient programs that treat indigent people. The stories I heard illustrate what some studies show to be shortcomings of our drug and alcohol treatment system -- that the approaches tend to be one-size-fits-all, even at expensive residential rehabs -- and that patients often receive very little individual counseling. Instead, they participate in some form of group activity for around eight hours a day, not including meals, even though there is no evidence that group treatment is best for addiction recovery. Some outpatient programs provide no one-on-one counseling at all. Many said they weren't comfortable sharing problems with peers and couldn't get sober until they found one-on-one treatment. Although about seven out of 10 alcoholics who are encouraged to go to Alcoholics Anonymous during treatment drop out in less than a year, the 12 steps of AA are included in some form in the great majority of addiction programs. Research shows there are other ways to recover and many clients said AA didn't work for them. Still, they weren't told about other options, such as Women for Sobriety or SMART Recovery. Rose T. thought her relapse after her first treatment might have been prevented had she been told about Women for Sobriety. She found the organization on her own and said, ""To sit in a room with others like me makes me feel less alone."" At AA, if addicts relapse, they're often told they must start over, losing their sober time, which can be a setup for a drug or alcohol binge rather than a fresh start. Many programs are not using approaches that scientific studies find to be effective. For instance, only about two out of 10 programs use one of the FDA-approved medications for treating drinking problems, such as Naltrexone or Antabuse. And some prominent programs that treat opioid addictions, heroin or prescription painkillers such as OxyContin, refuse to send patients home with the very medications that can help keep them sober or ""clean."" Research shows these medications, such as Suboxone and methadone, are the most effective approach for opioid addiction, and that they both lower the death rate and the relapse rate. I have talked with people who had struggled for years and finally found an end to their drug obsession when they received such long-term treatment. A recent report in the journal Substance Use and Misuse that analyzed Dr. Drew's ""Celebrity Rehab"" found that ""although many patients had histories of opioid use, there were no positive messages"" about Suboxone or methadone -- in fact, the medications were portrayed as unacceptable treatment options. The authors believe that this further stigmatized methadone and Suboxone use and that many opportunities to provide science-based information were missed. For people to get well, treatment for psychological problems or ""demons"" must be integrated into care for addictions, and by qualified professionals. Unfortunately, the standards for gaining the credentials to be addiction counselors, who provide most of the care at treatment programs, are woefully inadequate. According to a 2012 report by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia, 14 states don't require licensing or certification of all counselors, only six states require a bachelor's degree and just one requires a master's degree to gain credentials. We'll never know if another episode or type of treatment would have saved Mindy McCready, but we do know that, for a significant number of Americans, business-as-usual addiction treatment isn't working. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne Fletcher.","Anne Fletcher: Tragedies similar to Mindy McCready's addiction and death happen often .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army said Monday it ""regrets"" an incident in which a U.S. solider was shot after allegedly refusing to stop for South Korean police, leading to a car chase through Seoul late Saturday night. The 23-year-old private first class was shot in the shoulder after midnight on Saturday during the incident, according to Yonhap, a government-affiliated South Korean news agency. South Korean police claim the soldier tried to run over a police officer on a dead-end street, according to Yonhap. The officer fired a warning shot and three shots into the car, but the car sped away and was later found near the Yongsan Garrison, home of the 8th U.S. Army in South Korea, Yonhap said. The shooting victim -- whose name has not been released -- is in stable condition at the Brian Allgood Community Hospital in Seoul, according to the 8th U.S. Army Public Affairs office. U.S. forces received a subpoena Monday morning for the two other individuals involved in the incident, U.S. military officials told CNN. The pair met with South Korean police later in the day, officials said. The U.S. Criminal Investigation Command, who is responsible for investigating criminal incidents among U.S. forces anywhere in the world, are helping the Korean National Police with the investigation, the spokesperson said. The serviceman was tested but ""initial results do not indicate the presence of alcohol,"" the army said. ""Although the details of this incident are unclear, we take all incidents involving U.S. service members in the local community very seriously and will work closely with the Korean National Police as they continue their investigation,"" said Brig. Gen. Chris Gentry, Eighth Army deputy commanding general, in a news release. The incident began when police received calls American soldiers were threatening people with an air rifle near Itaewon subway station, local police told Yonhap. The soldier, a U.S. Army staff sergeant and his wife then fled in a vehicle, beginning a high-speed pursuit with local police. A police officer and two bystanders suffered minor injuries and four cars were damaged in the chase, Yonhap reported. ""Eighth Army's relationship with the Korean community is very important and we regret this unfortunate incident,"" the 8th U.S. Army Public Affairs office said in a news release. ""We are thankful for the continued support to our soldiers and families by our Korean hosts as we continue to enforce the highest standards of professionalism among our service members."" There are about 28,500 U.S. soldiers in South Korea, a military ally of Washington. U.S. troops have been in the region since the Korean War, in which an armistice was signed in 1953 but a peace treaty never ratified. Tensions still flare on the Korean peninsula, as seen by the recent North Korean rocket launch and underground nuclear testing.","The U.S. Army said Monday it ""regrets"" an incident in which a U.S. solider was shot .

"(CNN) -- The New Orleans Saints' defense had a bounty program that paid players for injuring opponents and for making interceptions and fumble recoveries, the National Football League said Friday. The program involved as many as 27 defensive players, at least one assistant coach, and was active during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons, said the league. ""The payments here are particularly troubling because they involved not just payments for 'performance,' but also for injuring opposing players,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. ""It is our responsibility to protect player safety and the integrity of our game, and this type of conduct will not be tolerated. We have made significant progress in changing the culture with respect to player safety and we are not going to relent,"" he added. Goodell has received the results of an NFL investigation into the Saints' program and will decide on discipline, which could include fines, suspensions and forfeiture of draft choices, the NFL said. Saints owner Tom Benson released a statement acknowledging the probe and calling its results ""troubling."" ""I have offered and the NFL has received our full cooperation in their investigation. While the findings may be troubling, we look forward to putting this behind us and winning more championships in the future for our fans,"" he said. According to the NFL, Saints players regularly contributed cash to a pool, the total of which may have been as high as $50,000 or more at its peak. They were paid $1,500 for a ""knockout,"" when an opposing player was not able to return to the game, and $1,000 for a ""cart-off,"" when an opposing player had to be carried off the field. In some cases, particular players on the opposing team were targeted, the NFL said. The program was administered by then-defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, with knowledge of other coaches, said the league. Head coach Sean Payton did not directly participate, nor was he involved in the administration of the program, however, he knew about the allegations and failed to stop it, the NFL said. Williams, who is now defensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams, released a statement on the allegations, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported Friday. ""It was a terrible mistake, and we knew it was wrong while we were doing it. Instead of getting caught up in it, I should have stopped it. I take full responsibility for my role. I am truly sorry. I have learned a hard lesson and I guarantee that I will never participate in or allow this kind of activity to happen again,"" the newspaper quoted him saying. SI: Saints look at severe penalties for bounty system . Saints players were also allegedly paid for interceptions and fumble recoveries. Payouts doubled and tripled during the playoffs, the NFL said. The New Orleans Saints won the Super Bowl after the 2009 season. ""There is no question that a bounty program violates long-standing league rules. Payments of this type -- even for legitimate plays such as interceptions or fumble recoveries -- are forbidden because they are inconsistent with the Collective Bargaining Agreement and well-accepted rules relating to NFL player contracts,"" said the league. It informed the NFL Players Association about the Saints' investigation earlier Friday. The NFLPA said it would review the information and stressed that health and safety issues are ""paramount."" The NFL has been under fire of late as hundreds of former players and their families are currently suing the league for alleged negligence, claiming that it didn't do enough to mitigate the risks despite what many say is an inherently dangerous sport. An attorney for former Philadelphia Eagles fullback Kevin Turner, Stephen F. Rosenthal -- whose Miami-based firm represents 137 other players and their families who've filed a class-action suit against the league -- said Turner has likely suffered from undiagnosed concussions. He accused the league of deliberately withholding information deemed critical to player safety. Stars such as former quarterback Jim McMahon, as well as running backs Jamal Lewis and Dorsey Levens, have filed similar lawsuits in states across the country. Attorneys representing Lewis and Levens accuse the league of having used a ""hand-picked committee of physicians"" to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma, particularly concussions. The league denies the claims and released a statement saying it ""has long made player safety a priority and continues to take steps to protect players and to advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions."" ""The NFL has never misled players with respect to the risks associated with playing football,"" the statement added. ""Any suggestion to the contrary has no merit."" The league has in recent years also made strides to strengthen rules that govern on-the-field conduct, while adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- to more independently evaluate injured players. In 2005, the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads, a move commonly referred to as a ""horse-collar"" tackle, after concluding it commonly resulted in injury. It also strengthened a 1979 rule prohibiting players from using their helmets to butt, or ""spear"" players during a tackle -- a rule that critics often complained had lacked enforcement.","NEW: NFL: The program was administered by then-defensive coordinator Gregg Williams .

"(CNN) -- It may as well be the 11th Commandment: Leave nature as you found it, the National Park Service says. So imagine the horror of a little girl named Eve -- no, Evie, to be exact -- when she violated the Eden that is Yosemite National Park. Her sin: She took home two sticks. Park Ranger Matt Holly learned of this transgression during a routine day opening hundreds of letters from visitors awed by Yosemite. The handwritten note from Evie read: . ""Dear Park Rangers, . ""I am a Yosemite Junior Ranger. I went to Yosemite recently and accidentally brought home two sticks. I know I'm not supposed to take things from the park, so I am sending them back. Please put them in nature. ""Thank you, . ""Evie"" Touched by her innocence, Holly taped the two sticks to her letter and temporarily hung it over his desk. It's been hanging there for almost a year, he said. ""We all loved it,"" the public information officer told CNN this week. ""It was so moving to see how small the sticks were."" He contacted the family, who are park regulars, and told them of how Evie's note moved all the park rangers. They are now preparing to reunite the sticks with their home.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Unions at Spain's flagship airline Iberia began a second week of strikes on Monday, with 1,300 flights canceled and most passengers re-assigned to other flights. Iberia and three smaller airlines that it provides with ground services -- Iberia Express, Vueling and Air Nostrum --- have been impacted by the action, an Iberia spokesman said. Cabin crews, pilots and ground staff are protesting Iberia's plans for 3,800 layoffs, about 19 percent of the staff, and salary cuts for the remaining workers. Iberia, which merged with British Airlines in 2011, has been trying to reduce its losses, which exceeded $350 million last year. The strike began February 18, running from Monday to Friday, and Iberia said it lost about $19 million that week. It expects to lose another $19 million during the second week of industrial action. A third week of strike is set to start on March 18. Iberia says it has relocated 38,000 passengers to other flights this week, and is issuing refunds for another 2,000 passengers affected by the disruption. Negotiations between the airline and the unions have stalled, despite Spanish government pressure and the appointment of a mediator. Unions are now threatening to extend the strike to the lucrative Easter Week, which they had previously said would be off limits. Read more: Welcome to Madrid, city of protests . ""There could be a strike during Easter Week and there could be an indefinite strike every Monday and Friday,"" Manuel Atienza, of the General Workers Union (UGT), told CNN on Monday. ""Those are among the possibilities being considered."" The Iberia spokesman, who by custom is not named, said just the threat of an Easter Week strike could cause flight and hotel cancellations in Spain's key tourism sector, which is already suffering from the nation's recession and economic crisis. On February 18, the first day of the first strike, five people were arrested for going beyond a police line at Madrid's Barajas airport, the government said. Since then, the police presence has been increased at the airport's Terminal 4, where Iberia and British Airways flights are based. A protest was planned there for later Monday. Unions have criticized the downsizing of Iberia, which has already seen the elimination of flights from Madrid to Athens, Cairo and Istanbul. In April, Iberia will stop flying from Madrid to Havana, Santo Domingo, Montevideo and San Juan de Puerto Rico. Unions say that Iberia has been suffering since 2011, as the junior partner in the merger, while majority shareholder British Airways has expanded. Union leaders say the strikes are the biggest in Iberia's history, because they are the first time that all three units -- pilots, cabin crews and ground personnel -- have joined forces, and the first time so many days of action have been announced at one time.","Workers at Spain's Iberia airline join forces for second week of strikes .

"Rome (CNN) -- More than 140 Catholic cardinals met Monday at the Vatican, where the process of selecting a new pope edged toward beginning. The cardinals met twice during the day, in the morning and in the evening. After the evening session, most left by car, though some departed on foot. Few spoke as they left the meeting. After the morning session, a decision had not been made on when the conclave to select Pope Benedict XVI's successor would start, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi told reporters. ""It's on the table, but no decision has been reached,"" Lombardi said. The General Congregations meeting is a key step before the conclave, in which all cardinals younger than 80 are to meet in the Vatican to vote for the next pope. CNN Radio: Betting on the new pope . Of the 142 cardinals who attended Monday morning's session, 103 were cardinal electors, Lombardi said. Another 12 cardinal electors were expected to arrive later Monday and Tuesday, he said. During the afternoon meeting, four more cardinals joined those who had already been here; the group decided that congregations on Tuesday and Wednesday would take place in the morning only, he added. And the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, preacher to the Pontifical Household, held the first meditation as outlined by the Apostolic Constitution, Lombardi said. Benedict announced his intention to step down on February 11 and resigned Thursday, becoming the first pope to do so in 600 years. The transfer of papal power has almost always happened after the sitting pope has died. Normally, the College of Cardinals is not allowed to select a new pontiff until 15 to 20 days after the office becomes vacant. However, Benedict amended the 500-year-old policy to get a successor into place more rapidly. The cardinals may to be able to do so before March 15, Lombardi has said. What's in a name? Clues to be found in next pope's moniker . This would give the new pontiff more than a week to prepare for the March 24 Palm Sunday celebrations. Some gambling houses are offering odds on who will next lead the Catholic Church. Favorites include the archbishop of Milan, Italy, Cardinal Angelo Scola; Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone of Italy; Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, who would become the first African pontiff since Pope Gelasius I died more than 1,500 years ago; and Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Canada, who would become the first North American pope. One former cardinal who won't participate in the conclave is Keith O'Brien of Scotland, who resigned last month. O'Brien apologized Sunday for sexual impropriety, without specifying any incident. ""To those I have offended, I apologize and ask forgiveness,"" he said in a statement. The Vatican refused to answer questions on Monday about whether it will discipline O'Brien. In response to questions from British journalists, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Thomas Rosica read the statement that O'Brien released on Sunday. ""That is all we can say, is what's been said,"" Rosica said. Chinese Catholics pine for open-minded pope to heal rifts . But others did comment. ""It looks as if the incidence of abuse is practically zero right now as far as we can tell, but they are still the victims and the wound therefore is deep in their hearts and minds very often,"" Cardinal Francis George, archbishop of Chicago, told reporters in Rome. ""As long as it's with them, it's with all of us and that will last for a long time, so the next pope has to be aware of this."" Philip Tartaglia, the archbishop of Glasgow and apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, will administer O'Brien's archdiocese until a new appointment is made. ""The most stinging charge which has been leveled against us in this matter is hypocrisy, and for obvious reasons,"" Tartaglia said in prepared remarks slated for delivery Monday night in his sermon at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Glasgow. ""I think there is little doubt that the credibility and moral authority of the Catholic Church in Scotland has been dealt a serious blow, and we will need to come to terms with that."" He added, ""As for the Church's mission in our country, yes, our credibility and moral authority have been undermined. It will take time, perhaps a long time, to recover these intangible but important realities. But we cannot be defeatist. The answer to this sad episode is not to throw in the towel. We need, rather, to renew our faithfulness to Jesus Christ and to go about our business humbly."" While Benedict has no direct involvement in the selection of his successor, his influence will be felt: He appointed 67 of at least 115 cardinals set to make the decision. Cardinals must vote in person, via paper ballot. Once the process begins, the cardinals aren't allowed to talk with anyone outside of the conclave. They cannot leave until white smoke emerges from the Vatican chimney -- the signal that a new leader has been picked. Lombardi said Monday that 4,300 journalists have been accredited to cover the papal conclave. How is a new pope elected? CNN's Richard Allen Green reported from Rome. CNN's Mark Morgenstein reported from Atlanta. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Our credibility and moral authority have been undermined,"" says Archbishop Tartaglia .

"Delhi, India (CNN) -- There are more elephants in India than Mormons. Five of the rare Mormons are in a Bible class in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which occupies a portion of a red residential building in south Delhi. The class has just been disrupted by me with a weird question. All the five Mormons are adolescent girls, almost modern at first glance in jeans and skirts and t-shirts. For some reason the question has made them burst into giggles and to make eyes at each other. Only one of the girls knows the answer. ""Mitt Romney is a presidential candidate,"" she says in a mumble. Others nod to indicate that the name is now familiar. But they look surprised when they are told he is a Mormon. In this church, as in the rest of Delhi, there has been very little interest in the American presidential primaries. In the last several months, the Indian media has been joyously preoccupied with substantial domestic scams, scandals and political tremors. Even after Romney emerged as Barack Obama's challenger, the Indian media has viewed the presidential battle as peripheral news. Tokyo postcard: Enjoying the U.S. political ""matsuri"" No doubt, as the campaign escalates, the U.S. election will become the predominant news in India but for now it is not a popular topic of discussion. In Sheraton Hotel's Pan Asian restaurant, an upper middle-class family of about 30 people has arrived to consume the buffet and celebrate the birthday of a woman who is a doctor trained in both Western medicine and homeopathy. (Almost every Delhi family has at least one loveable homeopath, usually a woman, who will diagnose the ailing relative over the phone and home-deliver the sugar pills.) An elder lights up a cigarette even though it is against the law to smoke in any of Delhi's restaurants. The waiter pretends that he has not seen it because he knows he will be abused if he tried to stop. The young, many of whom have studied in America, flock together and chat about an impending wedding in the family. They are very aware of American politics, and they admire Obama, but the elections do not interest them yet, probably because the media is yet to show them the way. But one of them, who is an executive with a healthcare firm, is interested. ""I can't stand Indian news channels anymore,"" he says, ""they have no news. They just scream all the time. So I have started watching CNN and BBC. So I can't help it, I follow the American elections."" Paris postcard: Marvelling at Obama's ""coolitude"" You ask a crowd of this type, the young especially, who they would like to see as the next American president, and their answer will be unambiguous -- Obama. For them, the American presidential election is somehow a war between good and evil. Democrats are good, liberal and very New York and California. Republicans are evil, too Christian and Texas. But the scholarly view in Delhi has long been different: Democrats may be handsome and clever, but Republican presidents suit India better. Not surprisingly, last month, an editorial comment in the largest English newspaper in India, The Times of India, announced: . ""Barack's got a bee in his bonnet about India - the current president does go on a bit about India being, ahem, a threat to American professionals, Indian children studying maths earnestly while the Yankees doodle their days away, the US getting 'Bangalored', supposedly losing jobs to harder-working Indians. To charge his people into action Barack's not above reviving the Injun spectre once again, targeting this time the Punjabi rather than the Shoshone. In contrast, Romney doesn't say much anyway - and when he does speak, it's not about India. Surely that's a blessing. Traditionally too, the Republican leadership doesn't care overly much about kid stuff like school grades - their business is with business, so a Mitt in the White House might mean more dollars for Delhi. But then, there's a flip side - we may need to learn robot language."" For Indians, the elimination of Osama bin Laden last year by U.S. Navy SEALs was as significant as where he was found -- in a mansion in the heart of Pakistan, in the happy company of his large family, including a wife who has been frequently described as ""young."" The subsequent collapse of the arranged marriage between Obama's administration and Pakistan's military leadership, is viewed in Delhi as a good development for India's security. Yet the general perception in the capital is that Republicans will be tougher on Pakistan than the Democrats. It is a view that will be repeated many times this year by political experts in the newspapers, on chat shows and in the nocturnal congregations of journalists and think-tank scholars, of whom there are many in Delhi. But even they will find it hard to deny their love for Obama, the articulate non-white from Harvard. It is an affection they share with the capital's powerful, including politicians. When Obama visited India for the very first time, in 2010, a senior politician personally supervised the design of the new uniform that the Parliament's security officers were to wear, and she also briefed the members of the parliament how they should behave in Obama's presence so that they looked elegant. (There was a near stampede when Bill Clinton had visited in 2000 and it was all very embarrassing.) Cairo postcard: A cynical eye on the U.S. election . Indians look at the two-party system of America with the ache of longing. Indian national elections, which are due in 2014, unless the government lead by the Indian National Congress falls before its time, is a festive circus of dozens of parties, most of which are actually family businesses which will be transferred by the elders to their children. There is probably not a single political journalist in the country who can name, without looking at reference material, all the political parties that contest in the national elections. But there are some similarities between the American system and the two major political rivals of India. The Indian National Congress has overt and covert socialist tendencies. It is willing to help the poor at the expense of the middleclass. The party is, in theory, liberal. In fact, it has interpreted secularism to mean equal opportunity for thugs from all religions. The other major party, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, is largely a conservative, capitalist, middle-class force that is often baffled over why it is so hard for people to accept that India is fundamentally a Hindu country. There must be something about human nature that divides the species into Democrats and Republicans.","Many admire Obama, but Delhi academics say Republican presidents are better for India .

"(CNN) -- The dreadful shooting sprees of the past few months, which claimed dozens of innocent lives, shocked and unnerved millions of Americans. The specter of some heavily armed madman turning a theater, a temple, a mall or a school into his personal battle zone has become all too real and terrifying. The latest episode still unfolding in Southern California implicates, oddly enough, a former Los Angeles police officer, 33-year-old Christopher Jordan Dorner, who allegedly is seeking redress for perceived mistreatment by the LAPD. Dorner was a member of the department for three years before losing his badge in 2008, reportedly for lying about a fellow officer. When he was unable to win back his job, murder became, as a manifesto attributed to Dorner put it, ""a necessary evil"" for him to prevail in the face of racism and injustice. LA cops talked by suspect, and brutal past . Other than the alleged gunman's former profession, this case is actually quite prototypical of the nearly two dozen massacres that occur each year in the United States. It is a story that my Northeastern University colleague Jack Levin and I have seen time and time again in our several decades of research on this extreme form of violence. By looking closely enough, one can usually make some sense of seemingly senseless behavior. The notion of a deranged gunman who suddenly snaps and goes berserk is more myth than reality. Rather, mass murderers act methodically and with purpose. And unlike the shooting sprees in Aurora, Newtown and elsewhere, in which victims who were unknown to their assailants had the horrible misfortune to be in the worst place at the worst time, most mass murders involve people specifically targeted for specific reasons. Mass murderers tend to be middle-aged men who see themselves as victims of injustice. Although bitter, resentful and full of despair, they see others, often the former boss or supervisor, as the people who are to blame for their miserable existence. Indeed, the workplace is one of the more familiar venues for mass murder, going way back to the 1980s when ""going postal"" became part of our everyday vernacular. Manhunt reminiscent of D.C. sniper case . Typically, we see a former employee in public service or private industry who feels mistreated and wronged. Believing that his firing is patently unjust, and with nothing left to lose, he decides sooner or later to become the powerful one who will do the ""firing."" When he is deprived of his financial security, sense of purpose and dignity, the idea of getting even becomes all consuming. As I write this on Day Six of the L.A. area manhunt, the terror enveloping the region is combined with anxious uncertainty over when the threat will finally be over and, more critically, whether the victim count will rise before the alleged assailant is found dead or alive. Already five people have been shot -- the daughter of the union representative who participated in Dorner's unsuccessful grievance hearing and her fiance were fatally wounded, as was one of three police officers gunned down in the continuing rampage. These five victims are actually surrogates, in what is known as ""murder by proxy."" Even when the primary targets are not readily available, others may be viewed as guiltyâ€”and may be assaulted-- simply because of their association. Meanwhile, dozens more among the alleged gunman's hit list of enemies remain on edge and in hiding until it is safe to resurface. Not surprisingly, one of the more prominent features to the usual mass-murder profile is access to a powerful enough weapon to achieve an expansive deadly plan. Particularly frightening in the ongoing L.A. drama, of course, is the marksmanship skills that Dorner undoubtedly acquired through his careers with the Navy and in law enforcement, giving added significance to the phrase, ""armed and dangerous."" Alleged cop-killer's manifesto details threats . Adding insult to injury, the man at the center of attention is likely thrilled. If he is like most mass murderers, it is not the spotlight that he is enjoying, but the satisfaction of payback. Others have been made to suffer, as he has in the past. The big question is how many more will be harmed in his methodical and deliberate quest for revenge. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Alan Fox .","James Fox: LA rampage case is typical of mass murders; like most, planned, methodical .

"(CNN) -- It was strange -- and strangely creepy -- to discover that the former California cop accused of murder has so many opinions about cable pundits and anchors. The 11-page manifesto from Christopher Dorner is filled with dark and disturbing thoughts, and his comments about television provide a macabre form of comic relief. What was equally troubling, at least to me, was an explosion of conservative comments on Twitter trying to tie his alleged rampage to ... liberals. That's right, even with three people dead, one wounded and a manhunt under way, the ugly game of ideological finger-pointing was under way. ""This is very telling that you've got a direct association of liberal luminaries with this killer,"" Brent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, told Fox's Sean Hannity. Actually, it's not telling at all. At least Bozell added that the luminaries should not be held responsible for Dorner's actions just because his screed invoked their names. Watch: Should we care that Dorner likes liberal pundits? Dorner seems all over the map. He wants Hillary Clinton to be president, but calls Chris Christie his second choice and praises George H.W. Bush and Colin Powell. Some of the television figures he hailed clearly lean left, others are hard-news anchors and reporters. One -- ""Morning Joe"" host Joe Scarborough -- is a former Republican congressman. ""Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad O'Brien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite's lead,"" the manifesto says. And it offers advice: ""Willie Geist, you're a talented and charismatic journalist. Stop with all the talk show shenanigans and get back to your core of reporting."" Watch: Did Chris Christie bully the doctor who dissed him on TV? At CNN, Dorner loves Piers Morgan but wants Fareed Zakaria deported. He mailed Cooper a DVD related to his termination from the Los Angeles police force and a coin with three bullet holes. The idea that we should take the detritus of this diseased mind seriously is ludicrous. After I tweeted a link to a colleague's Daily Download story about the manifesto, I asked whether we should care what Dorner writes. Some on the right went haywire. ""Would you care if he loved Fox News, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh?"" one Twitter user asked. ""My guess is you would, hypocrite."" And: ""Entire MSM would feed on this if it were linked to any right-wing cause."" Oh, and someone said I was ""a sick, twisted freak and a liar"" for saying that Scarborough, the former Republican congressman turned MSNBC host, is a conservative. Watch: Should CBS have banned revealing outfits at the Grammys? Some blatantly promoted the notion of payback: ""You guys smeared Palin over Tucson. Now it's your turn to be linked to a murderous madman. Only this time the link's legit."" In other words, if Dorner admired some liberal media figures, they're somehow to blame for inspiring the murders. Now it's true that some on the left tried to tar Palin when Jared Loughner opened fire in a Phoenix shopping center, killing six people and wounding Gabby Giffords. Palin's team had posted a map with crosshair targets representing Democratic lawmakers, including Giffords, that she was singling out for defeat in the 2010 midterms. On the day of the shooting, I wrote on The Daily Beast: ""This isn't about a nearly year-old Sarah Palin map; it's about a lone nutjob who doesn't value human life."" The use of the crosshairs imagery was dumb, I said, but there was no place for a ""sickening ritual of guilt by association."" And the same goes for the case o fChristopher Dorner. The man is accused of killing a police officer and a couple in a parking lot. What possible difference does it make which journalists and politicians he likes or loathes? The Giffords shooting sparked an important discussion about the need to tone down incendiary rhetoric, but that's a far cry from accusing people of complicity in crime. Watch: Does Donald Trump have a $5 million case against Bill Maher? There is also the question of whether the manifesto should have been published. In 1995, I covered the controversy when The New York Times and The Washington Post, where I then worked, published another manifesto, this one a 35,000-word ramble by the mass murderer known as the Unabomber. His real name was Ted Kaczynski, and he threatened to keep on killing unless the papers acquiesced. The publication prompted Kaczynski's brother to tell the FBI of his suspicions. In the wired age, there was no question that Dorner's words would instantly ricochet around the world. No newspaper publisher can act as a gatekeeper; the Web serves as a platform even for the poisonous words of alleged killers. But that doesn't mean we should take those words and use them to rope in public figures who have the misfortune of being named. Killers are responsible for killing, no matter which television anchors they happen to like. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","An 11-page manifesto from accused gunman comments on TV personalities .

"(CNN) -- A movie that offended almost no one, transgressed no historical fact or sociopolitical milieu and inspired every craftsperson in Hollywood to build his or her own giant pussycat (or some rough equivalent) proved to be the biggest surprise of Sunday night's Academy Awards -- without winning best picture. ""Life of Pi"" did win four Oscars, including the best director prize for Ang Lee that probably should have gone to Ben Affleck (his movie, ""Argo,"" got the best picture Oscar everyone expected it to get, along with one for best adapted screenplay and one for best editing.) And by the way, here's a flash for you people who think best picture really means best picture. There are, and always have been, two criteria for a movie getting the Academy Awards' top prize and they have little, if anything, to do with whether it's really the year's best movie ... or even a very good movie. Either: . 1. It's a movie whose success will somehow benefit as many people in the movie industry as possible. Or ... 2. It's a movie that somehow reflects Hollywood's best image of itself. When both these factors are in play, the movie is unstoppable. So it should have been obvious from the beginning that ""Argo"" was going to nab that one, even without its pre-Oscar haul of prizes from such trade organizations as the Screen Actors, Producers and Directors guilds. Its issues of historical accuracy aside (and conceded from the start by Affleck and others), the movie's a crisp little nail-biter that easily sells itself to the international marketplace, which remains the final frontier for American commercial cinema. That takes care of criterion No. 1. And as for No 2 -- well, duh! Movie producers are the heroes who help save the lives of helpless Americans trapped in revolutionary Iran. What's more flattering to Hollywood's self-image than that? Ex-Iran hostages hope 'Argo' win boosts quest for reparations . If not for that, it's entirely possible that Lee's adaptation of Yann Martel's mystical adventure would have picked everyone's pocket Sunday night. Even Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" whose focus on how the idealistic-but-pragmatic president battled intransigent legislators over constitutional banishment of slavery, carried enough contemporary resonance to make it an early favorite in the year of Barack Obama's re-election. But ""Pi's"" bargain-basement metaphysics is like organic fruit salad to the collective Hollywood mindset, irrespective of ideology. And the various trades in movie land from the production designers to the boom operators were likely jazzed by ""Pi's"" technological achievements, notably the digitally enhanced Bengal tiger that even the movie's harsher critics believed to have stolen the movie from its human actors. The only other (mildly) unexpected incident Sunday night came with Quentin Tarantino's Oscar for best original screenplay for his cheeky, incendiary antebellum satire, ""Django Unchained."" Most of the flak Tarantino caught for the movie came from African-Americans, who believed he was at best presumptuous and at worst defamatory in playing fast and loose with the history of American slavery. Those who stood up to cheer the most emphatically when presenter Dustin Hoffman announced Tarantino's name were African-American actors in the film, including Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington. As usual, we'll have to wait another 20 years to see which of these movies endures beyond their varied contemporary controversies. Oh and by the by -- Sunday night's Oscar telecast was as embarrassing as it always is, and not even host Seth MacFarlane's attempts to cover up the embarrassments by commenting about how embarrassed he was couldn't conceal the fact that, yet again, the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences has failed to make its annual pageant appealing to younger audiences without alienating its older patrons. It would seem the only way to pull that off would be to play things safe while seeming to be rebellious. And Hollywood's usually pretty good at playing pretend games like that -- except when it's not. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: It's no surprise Hollywood picked ""Argo"" for best picture Academy Award .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York state lawmaker said Monday he's sorry if he offended anyone by dressing in blackface for a Purim party, but a colleague says his apology doesn't go far enough. Assemblyman Dov Hikind wore an Afro wig, an orange jersey and had his face painted brown by a professional makeup artist for a weekend party celebrating the Jewish holiday at his home. He told The New York Times that he was supposed to be ""a black basketball player."" The Brooklyn Democrat initially tried to dismiss complaints about his costume as ""political correctness to the absurd,"" but reversed himself by Monday afternoon in the face of mounting criticism. ""Anyone who was offended, I am sorry that they were offended,"" Hikind told reporters at a news conference. ""That was not the intention, and that is really all I can say. I just have to reiterate it was Purim. Purim is when people get dressed up."" But Hikind's fellow Brooklyn Democrat, Assemblyman Karim Camara, said the costume was ""callous and repugnant."" ""I don't think what he has said so far is sufficient,"" Camara told CNN. ""It is a beginning, but we need to have a dialogue with him."" He said the use of blackface ""brings back the memories of African-Americans being reduced to buffoonery just to gain access to the entertainment industry."" And Kenneth Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told CNN that Hikind ""didn't take into account the history and context of what this is all about."" ""That is the most disturbing part -- what he failed to think,"" Jacobson said. Earlier this month, Hikind criticized another public figure for a questionable outfit. During New York Fashion Week, designer John Galliano was photographed in a dress that Hikind said made Galliano look like ""one of the Hasidic people I represent."" Galliano was convicted of making anti-Semitic comments in a Paris cafe in 2011, a crime under French law. ""There are many Hasidic groups. Not all of them dress in an identical fashion, but there was no doubt in my mind when I looked at the entire picture of what Galliano was wearing that he looked like one of the Hasidic people that I represent,"" Hikind had told CNN. ""In light of his past, it was shocking."" Jacobson said that given those comments, Hikind should have been more aware of how his costume would be perceived. ""Part about standing up for one group is to be more sensitive about other groups, especially as a public official,"" he said. CNN's Deborah Doft contributed to this report.","Brooklyn Democrat Dov Hikind dressed in blackface for a Purim party .

"(CNN) -- A wildfire jumped a road in central Florida, scorching homes and wiping out trees as it charred more than 1,900 acres, a fire official said Sunday. Some 24 structures in Marion County had been burned by what's being called the Hopkins Prairie Fire, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Susan Blake. Ten of those buildings were homes, according to a tweet from the National Weather Service. The blaze around Ocala National Forest was 80% contained as of early Sunday evening, Blake added. About 100 local, state and federal firefighters were on site. Video from CNN affiliate WCJB showed ground smoldering, with most trees singed or felled, even as a few somehow still stood tall. One picture posted on the Marion County Sheriff's Office's Facebook page featured little more than the frame of what appeared to be a charred trailer obliterated by the blaze. Another depicted a home in Sportsman's Haven -- newly purchased with a new roof in the plans -- that had been reduced to ash and rubble, spare some of its concrete walls. The fire caused the partial closure of State Route 19, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Marion County includes the county seat of Ocala and sits south of Gainesville. No injuries tied to the wildfire have been reported. A fire line has been set up around the blaze, and crews are optimistic about the situation, said Blake.","A wildfire burns 24 structures, including 10 homes, in Marion County, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- A Nigerian militant group previously linked to the kidnapping of a French citizen claimed responsibility Monday for taking seven workers from a construction company's offices in northeastern Nigeria. In an e-mail sent to reporters, Ansaru said it had kidnapped the seven workers Saturday because of ""transgression and atrocities"" against Islam in Afghanistan, Mali and other locations. Those kidnapped included workers from Italy, Greece and Lebanon, those governments confirmed. Nigerian police said a Briton was also kidnapped; British authorities said they were aware of such reports and were making inquiries. Opinion: Nigerians still waiting for their 'African Spring' Gunmen took the workers from the offices of Setraco, a construction company in Jama'are, in Bauchi State, police said. The company is based in Abuja and is involved in many major road construction projects in northern Nigeria. The gunmen first attacked a prison, burning two police trucks, public service broadcaster Voice of Nigeria reported, citing state police spokesman Hassan Muhammed. They then killed a guard at the Setraco workers camp before kidnapping the workers, Muhammed told the broadcaster. In December, the group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of a French citizen near the border with Niger and for an attack on a prison in Abuja in November. U.S. officials say Ansaru is an offshoot of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which Nigerian authorities say is behind a recent rash of killings and kidnappings in the country. Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege"" -- has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria, according to Human Rights Watch. Incidents have included the killings of three North Korean doctors in northern Yobe and the killings of nine people working for a government polio vaccination program in the northern city of Kano this month. Nigeria launched a military crackdown on Boko Haram in January. Security forces have since captured one of the group's leaders and killed 17 suspected Boko Haram members. Opinion: Why are Nigerians numb to slaughter? In the past, the group attacked other Muslims who it said were on an immoral path. But it has increasingly targeted Christians with numerous attacks on churches, as well as striking police stations. Boko Haram and other Muslim groups say the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the Nigerian government. But the U.S. State Department has accused the group's leaders of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist network and of hoping to drive a wedge between Nigeria's Christian and Muslim communities. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers and journalist Hassan John contributed to this report.","NEW: Militant group Ansaru claims responsibility for kidnapping of 7 foreign workers .

"(CNN) -- A man believed to be at the center of a global football match-fixing ring is co-operating with authorities in Singapore, it was announced on Friday. Singaporean businessman Tan Seet Eng, also known as Dan Tan, is thought to be a key figure in an ongoing investigation into corruption in soccer by global law enforcers Interpol. The news follows Thursday's arrest of Admir Suljic in Italy, a 31-year-old Slovenian who has been accused of being directly involved with a transnational criminal group targeted by Interpol's ""Last Bet"" investigation. The group, thought to be composed of individuals from Singapore and the Balkans, is said to have influenced the results of Italian league matches in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons. ""The Singapore authorities have been offering assistance and sharing available information with affected countries and will continue to do so,"" read a statement from Singapore police. ""Dan Tan Seet Eng, a Singaporean who has been named in reports so far, is currently assisting Singapore authorities in their investigations."" Police in the Asian country passed on information to Interpol which made possible the arrest of Suljic, who had been a fugitive since December 2011. The statement continued: ""In response to media queries, the Singapore Police Force confirms that it had informed Interpol National Central Bureau (NCB) Rome and Interpol's Command and Coordination Centre at Interpol HQ in Lyon, France of the travel plans of a person wanted by the Italian authorities for investigations into match-fixing.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Monday that White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley is stepping down and will be replaced by Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew. Two senior Obama aides told CNN that Daley will stay in his job through January, including the State of the Union address. The chief of staff is in charge of White House staff and operations and is a senior adviser to the president. A senior Obama campaign aide told CNN on Monday that Daley will serve as one of the co-chairs for Obama's re-election campaign. The other co-chair will be announced in coming weeks, the aide said. ""He's got a ton of political experience, knowledge and contacts, and we look forward to leveraging those assets and working closely together to re-elect the president this year,"" the campaign aide said of Daley, who was the campaign chairman for Al Gore's presidential run in 2000. No love lost between Daley, Senate Democrats . In a previously unscheduled statement Monday to reporters at the White House, Obama said Daley came to him last week and talked about stepping down to spend more time with his family. Obama asked Daley to reconsider, but Daley decided to resign and recommended Lew as his successor, the president said. ""There is no question that I'm going to deeply miss him by my side here at the White House,"" Obama said of Daley, who became chief of staff a year ago when Rahm Emanuel resigned to run for mayor of Chicago. Daley, 63, was chosen as chief of staff last year to bring a moderating influence to the White House in an attempt to seek a middle path with Republicans on contentious budget issues. A Chicago native, Daley was widely regarded as the force behind getting the NAFTA agreement passed through the Republican-controlled Congress when he served as Commerce secretary in the Clinton administration. With Obama now involved in election-year politics, the president has taken steps to appeal to his Democratic base, such as his recess appointment of Richard Cordray as head of a new consumer protection agency. According to a senior Obama aide, Daley told Obama last week that it was best for the president and the White House if Daley stepped aside. A top Democratic congressional aide told CNN that Daley's relations with Democratic legislators were strained. According to the aide, congressional Democrats believed Daley did a poor job of reaching out to legislators and listening to their ideas during contentious budget and debt ceiling negotiations last year. In particular, the aide said, relations grew tense after Obama tried to cut a major deficit reduction agreement with U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and congressional Democrats learned of it by reading about it in the news media. The aide also said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Obama to complain about Daley after a controversy over the scheduling of the president's jobs speech to Congress. The speech was rescheduled after Boehner complained about the initial date requested by the White House in a dispute characterized as emblematic of dysfunction in Washington. In his resignation letter dated January 3, Daley praised Obama's efforts to address the nation's long-term fiscal problems and said the president ""made Americans aware and supportive of a balanced approach"" that is needed. He also cited Obama's determination in ending the war in Iraq and ""bringing Osama bin Laden to justice,"" as well as the president's efforts in getting new free-trade agreements through Congress. ""I have been honored to be a small part of your administration,"" Daley's letter said. ""It is time for me to go back to the city I love."" According to multiple Democratic sources, Daley found it hard to break in at a White House where Obama already received advice from long-time aides. In addition, Daley was unable to get Obama to agree to staff changes that Daley thought were necessary to make the White House function better, Democratic sources said. The Democratic sources also said that Obama's campaign focus, which positions him as champion of working Americans, made one of Daley's roles -- improving White House relations with the business community -- a lesser priority. Lew, meanwhile, will remain in place for now to finish the 2013 budget proposal, which is due in early February, said Kenneth Baer, the Office of Management and Budget communications director. ""Whatever decision the president makes about who is to lead the agency (after Lew departs), there will be a continuity of leadership at the highest levels,"" Baer said of the OMB. Lew became OMB director in November 2010, succeeding Peter Orszag. Lew also held the post in the Clinton administration and later served as deputy secretary of state for management and resources in the Obama administration. He will be the third chief of staff under Obama, after Emanuel and Daley. In addition, Pete Rouse briefly served as interim chief of staff between Lew's two predecessors. CNN's Tom Cohen and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: Democratic sources cite reasons for Daley's decision to step down .

"(CNN) -- A toxic cloud that formed after 300 gallons of hydrochloric acid leaked at a southeast Texas storage facility sent nine people to hospitals and forced thousands of residents indoors, an emergency management official said Thursday. Four firefighters were among those who were hospitalized for exposure after a tank ruptured at a storage facility near the Port of Texas City, Bruce Clawson of the local emergency management office said. More than 45,000 residents of Texas City were ordered by emergency management officials to remain indoors, turn off air conditioning units and make sure all windows and doors were closed until the vapor cloud dissipated. The order was expected to be lifted by 6 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), Clawson said. Officials did not immediately detail what caused the tank to rupture late Wednesday at the Dallas Group of America's facility near the port. A telephone call by CNN to the New Jersey-based company early Thursday morning was not immediately returned. City officials were working to clean up the leak, Clawson told CNN affiliate KTRK. None of those exposed to the chemical cloud sustained life-threatening injuries, according to KTRK. It wasn't immediately known what the chemical was being used for at the facility. Hydrochloric acid has a number of industrial uses. It also has a corrosive effect on human tissue, with the potential to damage the lungs, eyes, skin, and intestines. It is not the first time the residents of Texas City have dealt with a threat from a chemical leak. In March, an acid leak was reported at BP's refinery in the port city. And last year, several dozen homes were evacuated when 250,000 gallons of gasoline spilled following a pipeline rupture. CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials expect to lift the stay-indoors order at 6 a.m. local time .

"Rome (CNN) -- The cardinals who will elect the new pope following the historic resignation of Benedict XVI are continuing to make their way to Rome, the Vatican said Saturday, with some likely to arrive only Monday or Tuesday. The first of a series of meetings known as general congregations takes place Monday morning -- and a priority for the cardinals attending will be setting a date for the special election, or conclave, held to pick the next pope. The Vatican has said it's not sure whether a date will be agreed on as soon as Monday. If cardinals are still arriving as the general congregations start, the timetable may be delayed. A look at possible papal contenders . The cardinals will also hold important discussions on the future direction of the Roman Catholic Church, which has been beset by scandal in recent years, and the kind of leader they want to see at the helm. All the cardinals attend the general congregations, but only cardinals who are younger than 80 are eligible to vote for the new pope in the conclave. They are expected to number 115, the Vatican has said. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Saturday that 75 cardinals normally live in Rome and another 66 have arrived or are in the process of arriving, making 141 in total. Most of the cardinals who live in Rome are retired and/or over the age of 80, and therefore are not entitled to vote for the new pope. It's not clear how many of the cardinals now in Rome are among those who can vote. How is the next pope elected? The Sistine Chapel, where the cardinal-electors meet for the secretive conclave, is not yet being prepared for the process, Lombardi said. Tourists and pilgrims are continuing to visit the Sistine Chapel -- famed for the ceiling painted by Michelangelo -- at the moment, Lombardi said. Benedict resigned Thursday evening, the first pope to do so in six centuries, and will probably never be seen in public again. Now known as pontiff emeritus, he will spend the next few weeks at the papal summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, before moving to a small monastery within the Vatican grounds. He spent the first day of his retirement reading and praying, following a good night's sleep, Lombardi said Friday. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Some cardinals will only arrive in Rome on Monday or Tuesday, Vatican says .

"(CNN) -- A powerful winter storm left thousands of travelers stranded Thursday, particularly in the Northeast, as scores of flights were canceled or delayed. More than 400 flights within, into or out of the United States were canceled early Thursday, according to the tracking website flightaware.com. Some flights arriving at New York's LaGuardia Airport were delayed an average of an hour Thursday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Sixty flights were canceled Thursday at Philadelphia International Airport, after 300 flights were grounded the day before, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. Some smaller airports were also hit hard. Syracuse Hancock International Airport in upstate New York was open, but only about half the flights were getting off the ground, officials told CNN. FAA: Flight delay information by airport . Many roads throughout the Northeast were treacherous. In Massachusetts, more than 1,000 crews were clearing streets, where pavement temperatures were below freezing, the state's Department of Transportation said. Vermont authorities warned of difficult driving conditions. In Maine, the National Weather Service warned of ""very hazardous traveling conditions"" because of heavy snow and powerful winds. State offices were closed. Authorities in New York and New Jersey reported train delays and local traffic accidents. The Federal Emergency Management Agency called on people to update their vehicles' emergency kits for cold weather. The kits should include blankets, gloves, first aid materials, a shovel and a battery-powered radio, the agency said on Twitter. The mix of snow, rain, and winds left many people holed up at home this week as the storm worked its way eastward. Among the most frustrated are those stuck at airports -- and not just passengers. Comments by an American Airlines pilot have given the weather a new twist. On Tuesday evening, his plane sat for nearly seven hours at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. ""I have no words to tell you to how sorry I am. This is way, way above our heads, by people who obviously -- in my humble opinion -- don't have a clue what they're doing,"" the pilot told passengers after they sat for hours without taking off for Las Vegas, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The station happened to be interviewing a frustrated passenger on the plane by phone when the pilot made the announcement. American Airlines has said it was focused on deicing the plane and ensuring everyone's safety. The airline added that ""Tuesday was obviously a very challenging day at DFW."" ""We had a significant number of delays and cancellations due to winter weather and icy conditions in the North Texas area. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience,"" an airline statement said. The pilot is not expected to be punished, airline spokesman Matt Miller said. The company's website says that for domestic flights, passengers can deplane before a ground delay exceeds three hours. It was not immediately known whether all the procedures were followed. Winter storm advisories are in place from central Pennsylvania to Maine, with snow accumulations of up to a foot expected by Friday morning, CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider said.

"(CNN) -- Heavy snow in northern Japan claimed the lives of eight people over the weekend, while a blizzard forced a high-speed bullet train to derail. In one incident, a woman and her three children were found dead on Saturday after becoming trapped in their car in Nakashibetsu, a town in eastern Hokkaido prefecture, police told CNN. Authorities believe they died of carbon monoxide poisoning as the car's engine was left running and filled with exhaust fumes. The vehicle's exhaust pipe and windows were buried under snow. A 23-year-old woman, also from Nakashibetsu, died Sunday after she was found collapsed on farmland near the town. Police said she had abandoned her car, which was found a few hundred meters away. Elsewhere in the region, a 53-year-old man and his nine-year-old daughter were discovered unconscious after being buried in snow on farmland near Yubetsu in Monbetsu district. The father was pronounced dead at hospital, but his daughter is now conscious and does not have any life-threatening injuries, police said. The two went missing after leaving their home Saturday afternoon in a truck to visit a friend of the father. Police and rescue workers found the truck on a road Saturday evening and the man and his daughter Sunday morning. According to local media, the father had covered his daughter with his body to try to warm her under heavy snow. The bodies of two other men -- ages 74 and 54 -- were also found outside Sunday. They are believed to have gotten lost after leaving their snow-trapped cars, and police say the elder man froze to death; the other's man's death is under investigation. Meanwhile, a six-car bullet train en route from Tokyo to Akita on the high-speed Akita Shinkansen line derailed on Saturday afternoon after the front wheels of the train's first car left the track in blizzard conditions near Daisen in Akita prefecture. Nobody on board was injured, and the service resumed on Monday, a spokesperson for operator JR East told CNN. Local media reports said the train remained in the same spot for six hours in snowy weather with 130 passengers stranded inside. Investigators from JR East are looking into the cause of the incident.","Woman and her children found dead in their snow-trapped car .

"(CNN) -- Shinji Kagawa scored a hat-trick as champions-elect Manchester United crushed Norwich City 4-0 at Old Trafford in the English Premier League on Saturday. It was a 39-year-old Welsh winger that was expected to hog the headlines this weekend but Ryan Giggs, who was due to play his 1,000th game, was left out of Alex Ferguson's squad. Instead, it was the 23-year-old midfielder from Kobe whose face will be plastered over the back pages of Sunday's newspapers. The Japan international opened the scoring with a fine volley in first-half stoppage time before grabbing a second, then a third in the 76th and 87th minutes as United finished another game in rousing fashion. Wayne Rooney added a fourth in injury time to complete the rout to send the Red Devils 15 points clear at the top of the table and coasting towards a 20th League title. Rafa Benitez's week finished in more positive fashion as Chelsea beat West Bromwich Albion at Stamford Bridge -- Demba Ba getting the only goal of the game in the 28th minute.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Eight months ago, the international community stifled a snigger when North Korea's hyped rocket launch ended with a fizzle. At the time, Pyongyang surprised just about everyone by actually admitting its failure, a departure from previous efforts to project success at all costs. But this time, they've succeeded. No one is laughing now. Object seen in orbit after launch . ""The world is not falling apart, like some would say, but at the same time this is not a joke. There was a lot of pre-media coverage that said that North Korea was not good at missile technology and were sort of ridiculing them,"" said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshare Fund and a former adviser to the U.S. government. ""Are we that much less secure right now?"" he asked. ""Marginally, but at the same time, this is something that we have to worry about."" What we know is that just before 10 a.m. local time, North Korea launched the long-range Unha-3 rocket carrying ""the second version of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3"" from the Sohae Space Center in Cholsan County in the country's west. It soared over Okinawa, dropping debris into the sea off the Korean Peninsula, the East China Sea and waters near the Philippines, according to the Japanese government, which slammed the launch as ""unacceptable."" ""The success of the launch -- which most analysts assume is a clandestine missile test -- brings North Korea one step closer to demonstrating a viable and reliable long-range delivery vehicle for a nuclear warhead,"" said Benjamin Habib, lecturer in Politics and International Relations School of Social Sciences at La Trobe University. ""If the missile technology is mastered, the last technical hurdle remaining is miniaturization of a nuclear warhead that can be deployed on the Unha-3 rocket."" Yun says that's still some way off. ""There's still a lot of work that needs to be done if they're actually going to mount a nuclear device or a weapon on a rocket,"" he said. ""The good news is we have a fair amount of time. The bad news is that if we're not proactive, and if we don't figure out a way to curtail North Korea's actions, they're going to continue to develop and learn more and over the long term we're going to have to deal with it in a much more difficult situation,"" he said. Read more: The cost of the launch . In the short term, one analyst said that Wednesday's successful test was likely to encourage Pyongyang to attempt another nuclear test. ""We don't know if the one in 2009 was a nuclear device rather than a weapon itself. They might need additional refinement and testing of a weaponised as well as a miniaturized version that can fit on a warhead,"" said Bruce Klingner, Senior Research Fellow for Northeast Asia in the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation. ""More concerning would be an explosion that used a uranium-based warhead because the plutonium program is largely capped. ""We don't think they have any more available plutonium but the uranium path is really wide open. So if they have a uranium-based explosion, that will cause a great deal of concern in the U.S. and its allies that there is an uncapped nuclear weapons program,"" he said. Read more: North Korea shouts 'look at me' with rocket . The missile that North Korea fired Wednesday appeared to be a four-stage rocket based on old Soviet technology, much less advanced than the rockets being used across the border in China, said Homer Hickam, a former NASA engineer and the author of ""Rocket Boys."" ""What the North Koreans have done is taken the technology the Russians developed 50 years ago and upgraded it a little bit and they're trying to use that old technology to cause a splash in the international scene and to get paid attention to,"" he said. It seems to have worked. International condemnation has been building since the launch, which came just days after North Korea admitted that technical problems could cause a delay. Multiple theories have been given for the launch's timing, but most analysts agree that a combination of domestic and international pressures and priorities came into play. After the humiliation of the failed April launch, leader Kim Jong Un was desperate to assert his leadership credentials, some analysts say. A rocket launch was also seen as a fitting tribute to mark the first anniversary of the death of his father, former leader Kim Jong Il. Analysts have also pointed to the curious timing of the launch, which came just days before national elections in Japan and South Korea, where the candidates' stance on North Korea is dominating debate in the final days of campaigning. Chung Min Lee, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University, says the launch was also designed to send a message to the United States and China. ""Kim Jong Un has told President Obama and Xi Jinping, 'I am not going to do business as usual. I'll go down this particular path, come what may.' This sends a very negative signal and puts the Chinese into a box. Xi Jinping must react either way. I believe that the Chinese will be a lot stronger on North Korea this time than on any other previous occasions,"" he said. It's not a view shared by Dean Cheng, research fellow in Chinese Political and Security Affairs at The Heritage Foundation. Why did North Korea launch a rocket? ""Frankly, I don't expect very much from Xi,"" he said. ""This new Chinese leadership looks to be extraordinarily weak, in part because of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Five of them will have to retire by 2017, which means that the jockeying is already under way for the next succession."" He said the government is likely to take a ""wait-and-see"" attitude while the rest of the international community seeks to exert pressure on North Korea through the United Nations Security Council. ""If North Korea develops longer-range ballistic missiles, China doesn't think that they'll be aimed at Beijing. So from China's perspective, it has very little interest or need to come down very hard on North Korea until the U.S., Japan and South Korea make it clear to China that allowing North Korea to do this is going to be more costly than cracking down on them,"" Cheng said. In a statement Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei expressed regret about the launch. ""China has always insisted on bringing peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula through multilateral dialogue. We hope relevant parties stay calm in order to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. China has traditionally been a stumbling block in efforts by the international community to pressure North Korea with sanctions imposed through the U.N. Security Council, Klingner said. ""When the U.S. and South Korea went to the U.N. working group after the April launch with a proposed 40 additional entities, China rejected all but three,"" he said. He added that the U.S.'s ability to convince Beijing to back its efforts on North Korea will be a real test of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice and the Obama administration's policy toward China.

"(CNN) -- Criminal investigators from the Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration were at a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company on Tuesday with a search warrant, a company spokesman said. Federal officials say that more issues have been reported with drugs from the New England Compounding Center, or NECC, which has been linked to a deadly multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis. FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson confirmed that criminal investigators were on site, but declined to answer questions regarding a warrant. U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz similarly said that personnel from her office and law enforcement partners were investigating allegations concerning the company. She added that it was ""entirely premature"" to suggest what the results of that probe may be. Fifteen people have died from the noncontagious meningitis associated with injections of a contaminated steroid produced by the NECC. As part of the ongoing investigation into the center, a patient with possible meningitis has been identified who received an injection of another NECC product, triamcinolone acetonide, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday. Also, a fungal infection from Aspergillus was reported in a transplant patient who received cardioplegic solution from NECC, the FDA said. Cardioplegic solution is used to induce paralysis of the heart during open-heart surgery. ""An investigation of this patient is ongoing; and there may be other explanations for their Aspergillus infection,"" the FDA said. The health care facility initially reported two transplant patients having infections from Aspergillus, the FDA said. The heart transplant patient received the cardioplegic solution in August, and the patient who received the triamcinolone injection was treated on September 19 -- both before NECC recalled its products, according to an official at the federal Centers for Disease Control, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. The NECC announced a recall of all its products October 6. The FDA said ""the sterility of any injectable drugs ... produced by NECC (is) of significant concern, and out of an abundance of caution, patients who received these products should be alerted to the potential risk of infection."" The CDC reported Monday the number of meningitis cases increased from 205 to 214, spread across 15 states. Two of the cases are a ""peripheral joint infection"" that specifically affects a joint such as a knee, hip, shoulder or elbow, officials said. The cases have been linked to injections of a contaminated steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, produced by the NECC. Some 14,000 people may have received the injections, the CDC estimated last week. Meningitis outbreak: What are compounding pharmacies? A Minnesota woman, Barbe Puro, filed a lawsuit Thursday -- which may be the first from the outbreak -- against tthe NECC. In it, she alleges she was injected in September with a tainted batch of steroids from the NECC. Meanwhile, members of Congress expanded an investigation into the outbreak. In a letter to the director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy, leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce noted the FDA sent the NECC a warning letter in 2006 ""detailing significant violations witnessed"" by investigators the previous year. Woman sues over outbreak . Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also accused the NECC last week of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide. Plus, the state's pharmacy board mandated that all Massachusetts compounding pharmacies sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens, such as fungi in this case, according to the CDC. Steroid injections common for back pain sufferers . Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. CDC: Tests may not detect meningitis fungus . CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.","NEW: Justice, FDA investigators at facility tied to meningitis outbreak .

"(CNN) -- A chemist accused of failing to follow protocols at a Massachusetts crime lab had been involved in testing some 50,000 drug samples, potentially opening the door to a swath of legal challenges, officials said Wednesday . The list of samples was turned over to prosecutors and public defenders on Tuesday. The samples were tested during Annie Dookhan's nine-year term at the facility, state authorities said. The samples were from an estimated 34,000 cases Dookhan worked on during her career, authorities said. ""Fifty-thousand drug samples in question could mean numerous wrongful convictions, vacated sentences, dismissed cases, overturned convictions and so on,"" said Anne Goldbach, forensic services director Committee for Public Counsel Services. ""Whether or not all those samples were affected, we don't know."" Goldbach said investigators first learned of a breach in protocol in February over a June 2011 incident in which samples were incorrectly catalogued. ""This is going to be a huge amount of work for both defense and prosecution attorneys and a huge drain in resources in attempting to figure out the extent of the situation,"" Goldbach said. The Boston lab certified drug samples for Massachusetts law enforcement before Gov. Deval Patrick ordered it closed August 30 in the wake of an investigation into the scandal. ""This is deeply troubling information,"" Patrick said in statement last week. ""No breach this serious can or will be tolerated. The State Police will continue their investigation to determine what happened and who is responsible so that we can hold those accountable."" The state's Department of Public Health said it had ""placed an additional lab supervisor on leave pending the outcome of our investigation."" ""Our job now is to continue to work with the Attorney General's Office to get to the bottom of what went wrong, assign accountability where it is warranted and prevent this type of breach from happening again."" Dookhan could not be immediately reached comment.","List of samples is turned over to prosecutors and public defenders on Tuesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- A new report blasts Amtrak, the nation's largest passenger rail carrier, for dangerously overlooking drug and alcohol use by its employees. The report released Thursday, an internal audit by Amtrak's Office of Inspector General, says drug and alcohol use by employees has steadily risen since 2006. The majority of employees who failed drug tests were reported to have tested positive for cocaine and marijuana, according to the report. Amtrak's employees failed drug and alcohol tests at a staggering 51% higher rate than the rail industry average, the report said. Amtrak officials estimate that they've spent $1.5 million to screen employees in 2012 alone, but employees have exceeded industry averages failing drug tests in each of the past five years. Federal regulations requiring railroad companies to implement drug and alcohol testing were put in place after a deadly 1987 Amtrak collision with a freight train in Chase, Maryland. In that accident, investigators concluded that a Conrail freight train engineer was under the influence of marijuana and ran three signals before colliding with the passenger train, killing 16. Employees in safety-sensitive positions are subject to closer federal regulatory scrutiny when it comes to drug and alcohol testing. But the inspector general's report suggests that Amtrak officials have turned something of a blind eye toward enforcing its own policies for testing employees and complying with regulations. In a blistering criticism of the role senior management at Amtrak has played in its failure to curtail the problem, the inspector general noted, ""Amtrak's current senior management's lack of knowledge about the extent of drug and alcohol use, the lack of engagement in the program, and the limited response to (the Federal Railroad Administration's) concerns about its physical observations raise serious questions about Amtrak's commitment to controlling drug and alcohol use."" Officials are required to physically observe each employee for signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use once every three months, on average, the report said. Amtrak is required to randomly perform drug testing on at least 25% of its employees in safety sensitive positions and alcohol testing on at least 10% of safety-sensitive positioned employees each year. Employees who are in safety-sensitive positions have maximum hours-of-service regulations and minimum off-duty hour requirements between shifts. Amtrak has more than 4,400 employees who meet those requirements, including locomotive engineers, conductors, train dispatchers, signal maintenance employees and mechanics. The report suggested a number of ways Amtrak could prevent employees from showing up to work drunk and on illegal drugs. The recommendations include increasing the frequency of drug and alcohol testing, reviewing results and comparing them to industry averages, demonstrating that drug and alcohol control is a priority for Amtrak senior management, improving the physical observation of employees and increased training of supervisors. Amtrak's Office of Inspector General conducts and supervises audits, inspections, evaluations and investigations for the rail company. It provides reports to customers, the public and Congress. The Amtrak inspector general is responsible for preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse and reviewing security and safety policies in agency programs and operations. 2011 was a record year in terms of ridership for Amtrak. It carried nearly 30.2 million passengers, an average of more than 82,000 passengers on 300 trains daily. According to Amtrak, its ridership has increased in eight of the past nine years.","Inspector general's report says Amtrak managers overlook substance abuse .

"(CNN) -- An 11-mile stretch of the Mississippi River near Greenville, Mississippi, was closed Monday to most vessel traffic because of low water levels, idling nearly a hundred boats and barges in the stream, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

"(CNN) -- Whipped by high winds, wildfires in central Washington state have scorched 28,000 acres and destroyed at least 60 buildings, officials said Tuesday. One of those structures was the home of Elaine Burt. After she left her home near Ellensburg she received terrible news from a neighbor; she'd lost more than a home -- all her dogs had died, too, CNN affiliate KING reported. ""They're all dead, and my house is gone,"" she said as her neighbor phoned her with an update. ""Those poor little doggies."" Burt's chihuahuas were on the porch when the flames of the fast-moving fire came. ""All my mamas and all my big sows, all of them, they're all dead,"" she said. Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire declared Kittitas and Yakima counties to be in states of emergency, according to a written statement from her office. The Washington National Guard will provide air support to the Department of Natural Resources, which is in charge of statewide firefighting efforts. The fire raging near Cle Elum is one of several Western fires burning this week. Colorado paid the price earlier this summer. Now, new wildfires are burning through sagebrush, grass and beetle-killed lodgepole pines in California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington and Idaho. In all, 62 fires, including 16 new large fires, were burning as of Tuesday, the U.S. Forest Service reported. They have destroyed dozens of homes and are threatening many more. Washington's Taylor Bridge Fire began as a brush fire Monday afternoon. By Tuesday afternoon more than 20,000 acres, or 31 square miles, were burned. Authorities have already evacuated between 900 people near the Taylor Bridge Fire, the governor's office said. There was no report of any injuries. ""The fire behavior I would classify as extreme,"" Rex Reed, the incident commander, earlier Tuesday. ""Extreme fire conditions. We expect a very busy day. Very rapid rates of spread. There are multiple heads on this fire."" He said authorities were working to activate National Guard troops to assist in the operation in Kittitas County. In Idaho, a blaze has killed a 20-year-old firefighter. Two other firefighters have been injured in Oregon and California. Anne Veseth died Sunday while fighting the Steep Canyon Fire near Orofino, said Phil Sammon of the Forest Service. He said the death was accidental but could not confirm how it happened. However, CNN affiliate KTVB said Veseth was killed by a falling tree. Residents of Veseth's hometown, Moscow, remembered the young college student as someone who always gave back to community. ""This is a stark reminder of how dangerous the business is that we are in,"" Sammon said. ""We are extremely saddened by this loss."" Residents evacuate as hundreds of firefighters battle California wildfires . On Tuesday, the fire danger spiked with searing temperatures and single-digit humidity across Western states. In some places, winds were gusting up to 40 miles per hour. More than 750 firefighters and support personnel were working in Oregon and Nevada to corral the 418,235-acre Holloway Fire, the largest of the Western wildfires ignited by a lightning strike on August 5. ""We saw huge fire whorls all night,"" said Fred Kaninski, fire behavior analyst for the Holloway Fire. ""It was burning like daytime."" In California, a pair of fires north of San Francisco in Lake County burned 7,000 acres and were 30% contained Tuesday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Two buildings were destroyed and one was damaged, CNN affiliate KGO reported. An additional 480 homes are threatened, and a firefighter was injured while battling the flames, said Julie Hutchinson of the state's forestry and fire department. She did not have information on the status of the injured firefighter. Meteorologists predict the dry heat will last into next week -- not good news for firefighters. Any thunderstorms that pop up could present more bad news than good, since lightning strikes could spark more flames. However, rain doused the killer Waldo Canyon Fire that blazed out of control through parts of Colorado for many weeks this summer. On Tuesday, Colorado was not on the national map for large fires.

"Washington (CNN) -- When Superstorm Sandy rocked the Eastern Seaboard earlier this week, uncertainty over Tuesday's election began to creep into the minds of those who have spent months organizing it. Though polling places up and down the East Coast were still without power Friday, Sandy's impact is most noticeable in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, scene of widespread flooding, power outages and hurricane-force winds. Elections officials from counties across New Jersey -- especially in the hardest hit areas on the coast and around Manhattan -- are concerned that turnout in Tuesday's presidential election will be affected by the damage. While many county clerk officials reported lobbies full of people waiting to vote early and take advantage of extended registration windows, polling places across the state have been consolidated -- leading some to worry that confusion could reign Tuesday. Powerless in New Jersey . ""I think it will affect turnout,"" said John Currie, a board of elections commissioner in Passaic County. ""When people are worried about where they are going to live tomorrow, some people have more important things to think about."" In an effort to give people more time to cast an early, the Secretary of State's office in New Jersey directed all county clerk offices to stay open this Saturday and Sunday. In Bergen County, 327 locations have been consolidated to make up for those areas that still don't have power. At each displaced polling place, election organizers hope to have officials directing voters to the correct polling place. The hope is that these officials will ease confusion and help smooth the balloting process. Why Election Day won't be postponed . ""People are interested,"" said Patti DiCostanzo, superintendent of elections in Bergen County. ""We are moving forward the best we can and giving the voters every opportunity to vote in this election."" In Sussex County, out of the 76 original locations, 31 have been consolidated and some have been moved to completely new locations. Marge McCabe, administrator of the Board of Elections in Sussex County, said there will be notices posted at closed locations about where voters should go. ""I do think it will affect the way people are voting,"" McCabe said. ""I think that everyone has their priorities, and for those who have power and have heat, their priority may be different than those who don't."" ""We are trying to make it as easy as we can for folks to vote,"" said McCabe. ""That is our No. 1 goal."" Many electronic voting machines -- used now by two out of every five counties nationwide, according to the Voting Technology Project -- often require consistent power to work for the long hours they are needed on Election Day, even though some have battery power. Poll organizers in New Jersey say that generators and battery-powered poll machines will ensure that power is not an issue at polling places. Admittedly, says Joanne Arena, deputy administrator of the Union County Board of Elections, the batteries ""only last a few hours."" If electricity remains out in some areas Tuesday, officials may have to scramble to find alternatives, including paper ballots. Hacking the vote: Internet systems remain insecure . That may be the case in New York, another state rocked by Sandy, where many houses are either without power or underwater. New York uses optical scanners, a process that doesn't necessarily need power at each polling station -- although that would be desirable. If power were not available, voter's ballots would be kept in a lock box underneath the optical scanner, and at the end of the day the box would be transported to a ballot office with power. The issue: That sort of balloting would noticeably delay the reporting of election results. ""That is unavoidable,"" said John Conklin, spokesperson for the New York State Board of Elections. ""The local boards are assessing their poll sites as we speak. They are looking to see what the power situation is, whether the site is accessible to the general public and whether the board can move voting machines in and out of the site,"" Conklin said. ""When they are done with that assessment, they will start making plans for alternate poll sties."" The state board's goal, however, is to minimize the number of poll sites that need to be consolidated and moved. Although moving some sites is ""completely unavoidable,"" Conklin said, ""even if it is lacking power and we can still use it, we are going to use every effort to do that."" Like other officials, Conklin realizes that voter turnout may be affected by the damage Sandy has left in its wake. ""I think it is really difficult to predict that, but obviously there are some people who have had a major disruption in their life,"" Conklin said. ""Voting is not going to be the major priority in their life."" In Connecticut, between 90 and 95 polling locations were still without power, according to the Secretary of State Denise Merrill. That number is an improvement: Thursday upward of 100 polling locations were out of power. ""We still have some polling places that lack electricity, and both power utilities have assured us they are working very hard to restore power to these locations as soon as possible,"" Merrill wrote in a press release. ""We will be ready to vote next Tuesday no matter what, and the preferences would be not to move or consolidate any polling locations unless absolutely necessary."" Merrill and her staff have been working with local, state and federal officials -- including President Barack Obama -- to ensure the validity of the voting process. One concern expressed by Merrill is that in an effort to get life back to normal -- and get children back to school -- many local schools have decided to open on November 6, the same day as the election. This was ""a change from previous plans to close school for Election Day so the school facilities could be used as polling precincts,"" says a press release from her office. Even with possible problems at the polls, the likelihood that the election will be moved -- or an extension given for the affected counties -- is slim. Only Congress can change Election Day, according to an 1845 law. If it opts to alter the timetable -- something never previously done -- every state would have to be included. The same law also says that if a state ""shall fail to make a choice"" on Election Day, then electors to the Electoral College may be appointed on a ""subsequent day"" as determined by state law.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two hours after first being notified of an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, a government e-mail to the White House, the State Department and the FBI said an Islamist group had claimed credit, according to a copy obtained by CNN. An initial e-mail was sent while the attack was still underway, and another that arrived two hours later -- sent from a State Department address to various government agencies including the executive office of the president -- identified Ansar al-Sharia as claiming responsibility for the attack on its Facebook page and on Twitter. The group denied responsibility the next day. However, the e-mails raise further questions about the seeming confusion on the part of the Obama administration to determine the nature of the September 11 attack that left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead. Two White House officials, speaking on condition of not being identified on Wednesday, said the government e-mails about the attack were not an intelligence assessment. They also noted that there was conflicting information about Ansar al-Sharia denying responsibility. Read what U.S. intel sees is an al Qaeda in Iraq link . ""They were a part of the many different reports we were receiving that day,"" one of the White House officials said of the e-mails. ""There are always multiple and conflicting reports in the initial hours of an attack. That's why you have an investigation."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advised reporters to wait until a review panel she appointed to investigate what happened completed its work. ""The Independent Accountability Review Board is already hard at work looking at everything, not cherry picking one story here or one document there but looking at everything, which I highly recommend as the appropriate approach to something as complex an attack like this,"" Clinton said Wednesday. ""You know, posting something on Facebook is not in and of itself evidence. I think it just underscores how fluid the reporting was at the time and continued for some time to be,"" Clinton said. She repeated her earlier pledge to ""take whatever measures are necessary to fix anything that needs to be fixed, and we will bring those to justice who committed these murders."" Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jay Carney noted the e-mail about the claim of responsiblity ""was an open-source, unclassified e-mail referring to an assertion made on a social media site that everyone in this room had access to and knew about instantaneously."" Carney added that ""the whole point of an intelligence community and what they do is to assess strands of information and make judgments about what happened and who was responsible."" The day after the attack took place, President Barack Obama referred to it as an ""act of terror."" What the administration has said . But in the following days, Carney maintained there was no evidence suggesting the attack was ""planned or imminent."" In attack aftermath, disagreement over how it began . The administration also suggested that an anti-Muslim video produced in the United States likely fueled a spontaneous demonstration in Benghazi as it had in Cairo, where the U.S. Embassy also was attacked. Clinton, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, all cited the video as a motivating factor in the attack. On September 13 -- two days after the attack -- a senior U.S. official told CNN that the violence in Libya was not the work of ""an innocent mob."" ""The video or 9/11 made a handy excuse and could be fortuitous from their perspective, but this was a clearly planned military-type attack,"" the official said. However, it wasn't until September 19 that Matthew Olsen, the nation's counterterrorism chief, told senators that it was a terrorist attack. The next day, Carney also said it was ""self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack."" The e-mails obtained by CNN provide additional insight into the Benghazi attack. The first one, sent at 4:05 p.m. ET, or 10:05 p.m. in Libya, described a diplomatic mission under attack. ""Approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well,"" the e-mail said. Stevens and four other mission staff were in the compound safe haven, it added. Less than an hour later, at 4:54 p.m. ET, another e-mail reported ""firing at the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi has stopped and the compound has been cleared."" It said a search was underway for consulate personnel. The final e-mail, at 6:07 p.m., noted the claim of responsibility for the attack. The subject line said: ""Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack."" ""Embassy Tripoli reports the group claimed responsibility on Facebook and Twitter and has called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli,"" the e-mail said. The Facebook claim of involvement was subsequently denied by the group at a news conference in the following days, but not very convincingly. ""We are saluting our people for this zeal in protecting their religion, to grant victory to the prophet,"" a spokesman for Ansar al-Sharia said at the time. ""The response has to be firm."" It is common for one or more claims of responsibility to follow high-profile attacks on U.S. targets, and intelligence officials analyze them for validity before declaring any legitimate. For example, groups make false claims to seek publicity and raise their profile. Analysts examine a group's history, whether it made previous claims that were legitimate, whether it has the capacity to carry out such an attack, and whether known members of the group participated in the attack in assessing the validity of claims of responsibility.

"(CNN) -- Criminals who file fraudulent tax returns by stealing people's identities could rake in an estimated $26 billion over the next five years because the IRS cannot keep up with the amount of the fraud, Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said Tuesday. ""Our analysis found that, although the IRS detects and prevents a large number of fraudulent refunds based on false income documents, there is much fraud that it does not detect,"" said George's prepared testimony before a joint hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittees on Oversight and Social Security. George's report is the first detailed analysis of the tax refund fraud problem, which could affect any legitimate taxpayer. His projection of $26 billion is larger than any other estimate of identity theft tax fraud. In a statement issued following George's testimony, the IRS said it ""believes that the five-year estimate is far too high."" ""The estimate was based on 2010 figures, which took place before the IRS instituted major changes with the way it handles identity theft cases,"" the IRS statement read. ""Our expanded screening on issues such as W-2 matching, Schedule C information, interest income and Social Security income have had a major impact on our ability to reduce identity theft fraud."" Those efforts, according to the IRS, have lead to ""stopping more refund fraud than ever before"" and ""are not reflected in the five-year projection"" by the Treasury inspector general. Last year, according to the Treasury Inspector General's Office, the IRS reported that of the 2.2 million tax returns it found to be fraudulent, about 940,000 returns totaling $6.5 billion were related to identity theft. In its investigation, George said, auditors found another 1.5 million undetected tax returns with more than $5.2 billion in fraud. ""The primary characteristic of these cases is that the identity thief reports false income and withholding to generate a fraudulent tax return,"" George said. ""Without the falsely reported income, many of the deductions and/or credits used to inflate the fraudulent tax refund could not be claimed on the tax return. The individuals whose identities were stolen may not even be aware that their identities were used to file a fraudulent tax return."" Making the problem worse, George said, the IRS is hampered by limited resources. ""Even with improved identification of these returns, the next step of verifying whether the returns are fraudulent will require resources,"" he said. ""The IRS has faced budget cuts, a hiring freeze and staffing reductions during the same time it has encountered a significant surge in identity theft refund fraud. Without the necessary resources, it is unlikely that the IRS will be able to work the entire inventory of potentially fraudulent returns it identifies. The IRS will only select those tax returns that it can verify based on its resources."" The scope of the problem is illustrated by what George said his auditors found for tax year 2010, in which 48,357 Social Security numbers were used multiple times as a primary taxpayer identification number. ""When the identity thief files the fraudulent tax return, the IRS does not yet know that the individual's identity will be used more than once,"" George said. ""As a result, the tax return is processed, and the fraudulent refund is issued. These instances result in the greatest burden to the legitimate taxpayer."" As of last month, the IRS reported that it had stopped the issuance of $1.3 billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns. The IRS says it determined these returns were potentially fraudulent through a sampling of returns, and it does not believe any legitimate returns were included. George said more should be done to ensure that fraudulent tax returns are not deposited into bank accounts. In addition, thieves commonly get the refunds put on debit cards. ""Direct deposits should not be made to debit cards issued by financial institutions and debit card administration companies that do not take sufficient steps to authenticate individuals' identities,"" George said. To make matters worse, the IRS is not effectively helping the victims of identity theft, George said, adding that it can take more than a year to resolve these cases. ""The IRS acknowledges that it does not know the exact number of identity theft incidents or the number of taxpayers affected by identity theft,"" George said. ""It also has not been able to quantify the amount of improper payments resulting from identity theft."" In an investigation into tax refund fraud, CNN reported in March that criminals have purchased luxury cars, jewelry and plastic surgery with the money. First, thieves obtain Social Security numbers and other personal information from insiders at hospitals, doctor's offices, car dealerships or anywhere the information is stored. Then, they file an online tax return using the real taxpayer's name and a fictitious income. In most cases, the criminals buy a debit card so the IRS can issue the refund on that card, although some thieves have also gotten their returns on actual Treasury checks. The thieves know that the IRS does not verify the employer W-2s sent with the return until after the refund is issued. The IRS maintains it has certain filters in place at the start of the tax filing season to prevent and detect identity theft and fraud, and it says it has recently trained additional employees across the country to deal with the problem. It has also issued special personal identification numbers, or PINs, to identity theft victims when they are filing future returns. But in testimony before Congress last year, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said those filters ""inevitably block large numbers of proper refund claims"" since there ""is no easy way to distinguish proper claims from improper ones."" In testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing, Deputy IRS Commissioner Steven Miller said the agency cannot stop all identity theft. ""However, we have improved, and we are committed to continuing to improve our programs. We can and will continue to work to prevent the issuance of fraudulent refunds, and we can and will continue to work with innocent taxpayers to clear their accounts and/or get them money faster in a courteous and professional manner."" At the same time, Miller said, there is a ""delicate balance"" in the ""need to make payments in a timely manner with the need to ensure that claims are proper and taxpayer rights are protected."" In the past four years, he said, the IRS has identified more than 490,000 taxpayers who are the victims of identity theft. ""Various new identity theft filters are in place to improve our ability to spot false returns before they are processed and before a refund is issued,"" Miller said. The IRS has issued special identification numbers to taxpayers whose identities have been stolen and clamped down on abuses in filing returns under deceased taxpayers' identities and prisoners. The agency also started a pilot program in April to help local law enforcement in obtaining tax return information related to ongoing criminal investigations. ""I cannot tell you that we will beat this problem in one year,"" Miller said. ""I can tell you that we have committed our talents and resources to prevent the issuance of fraudulent returns and have developed processes to minimize the pain felt by those who have been victimized.""","The Treasury's estimate is the first detailed analysis of the ongoing problem .
With budget cuts, the IRS cannot deal with the fraud, according to inspector general .

"(CNN) -- Search crews fanned out across the vast backcountry of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Friday after severe thunderstorms the night before killed two people and injured eight, park officials said. An unknown number of hikers and campers may have weathered the Thursday night storm on the dozens of trails and isolated primitive camping sites in the most hard-hit western portion of the park, spokesman Carey Jones said Friday morning. ""We have no idea how many people are in the backcountry,"" he said. ""We're just now getting people onto trails."" Officials have no indication that anyone was hurt or is in distress in the most isolated portions of the park, which straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. But the park's backcountry has no cellular telephone service, and the storm hit during a busy time, noted Chief Ranger Clayton Jordan. Jordan identified the dead as Ralph Frazier, 50, of Buford, Georgia, and 41-year-old Rachel Burkhart of Corryton, Tennessee. Frazier, who was on a motorcycle, died when a tree limb fell and struck him on the head, Jordan said. A passenger on the motorcycle was not injured, Jordan said. Jordan said Burkhart died when she was struck by a tree at a popular swimming hole near the park's Abrams Creek campground. She was apparently among a number of swimmers who were scrambling to get out of the water when the storm roared through and toppled a tree that knocked them back into the water, Jordan said. Three members of another family were also injured in the incident, including a 7-year-old girl who was trapped under water by the tree, Jordan said. Bystanders performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and revived the girl, Jordan said. She and her father -- who sustained serious injuries including back injuries, broken ribs and a collapsed lung -- were flown to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. The girl's mother was also injured, but less seriously, and was taken by ambulance to the same hospital, Jordan said. Their conditions were not immediately available. Meanwhile, authorities were working to evacuate campers who survived the storm without injury but were stranded by fallen trees, Jordan said. Those campers chose to stay behind overnight while others were led out by vehicle caravan through an emergency route cut through fallen trees, Jordan said. About 38 people spent the night in a Red Cross shelter, he said. Hundreds of motorists were stranded throughout the park by fallen trees, Jordan said. Many had been rescued, he said. Forty miles of roads in the park remained closed Friday due to downed trees, Jones said. The storm, which struck suddenly during the busy Fourth of July holiday week, stressed the ability of park rangers and outside emergency crews to respond, Jordan said. ""To have such a wide swath of the park at a very busy time of the year to be impacted by such severe storms is highly unusual,"" he said. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were visiting the park when the storms hit, Jones said. Hundreds of thousands without power brace for more blistering heat . The area near Cades Cove, an isolated valley that offers some of the best wildlife viewing opportunities in the park, was one of the hardest hit by the storm, Jones said. The area, which is accessible by only one road, remained closed to visitors Friday. Several other park roads and campgrounds also remained closed, Jordan said. Park officials have been too busy with rescue efforts to assess damage to park facilities, Jordan said. In addition to the park, the storm also caused extensive damage to a marina and a hardware store in Sevier County, Tennessee, according to John Matthews, the county's emergency management agency. The county had to evacuate its juvenile detention center when part of the hardware store's roof blew onto the building, he said. No one was injured, he said. In Blount County, the storm caused no injuries but knocked down many trees, emergency management director Bart Stinnett said. The storm also knocked out power to 56,000 customers of the Knoxville Utilities Board in Knoxville, Tennessee, just north of the national park, the utility said in a statement. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . Power outages around Knoxville were down to about 13,000 as of 11 a.m. Friday, according to the utility. Crews were coming from Ohio to help in the around-the-clock effort to restore power, which could take several days, the utility said. The weather that hit the area began as a cluster of thunderstorms that formed along the Ohio River moving south. The storms continued to intensify as they got into more heat and humidity, and converged on the foothills of the Smokies. Straight-line winds of 70 mph were recorded. Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which straddles the Tennessee and North Carolina border, is the most-visited national park in the United States. Between 8 million and 10 million people visit the park each year, according to the National Park Service. The park covers more than 800 square miles in the Southern Appalachian Mountains and boasts a diversity of plants and animal life, and is known for its beauty. Is severe weather happening near you?

"(CNN) -- Two farms have been quarantined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the agency continues to investigate last month's discovery of mad cow disease at a California dairy farm. Authorities also have launched an investigation at a calf ranch where the initial infected cow was raised 10 years ago, according to a statement released late Wednesday by the USDA. Last week, the USDA documented the fourth confirmed U.S. case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) -- a brain wasting disease affecting cattle -- known commonly as mad cow disease, at a rendering facility in central California. USDA officials said the cow was never presented for human consumption and was not a threat. The farm where the cow was initially discovered has been under quarantine since the discovery, agriculture officials said. Wednesday's announcement of a second quarantine involves a farm closely associated with the dairy where the sick cow was discovered last month, the USDA said. The agency is still trying to determine if any at-risk cattle are present at either of the two farms. Eating contaminated meat or some other animal products from cattle that have BSE is thought to be the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s. Learn more about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . In people, symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes, movement deficits, memory disturbances and cognitive impairments. BSE can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression, difficulty in coordination and standing up, decreased milk production or weight loss. It is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein, which is fed to other cattle. In this case, the Agricultural Department reported that the cow had a rare form of BSE not likely carried by contaminated feed. Since 2004, the USDA has removed the brain and the spinal column, the parts suspected of causing mad cow disease in humans, from the food system. The USDA says that since the discovery of the infected cow, they have identified 10 different feed suppliers that delivered animal feed to the farm. Determining if the cow became sick from feed is an area where investigators are focusing close attention. Authorities have determined the infected cow gave birth twice. One calf was stillborn and the other was located on a farm outside of California. That cow was subsequently euthanized and tested negative for mad cow disease. Unlike most other meat-borne illnesses, such as those caused by E.-coli bacteria, cooking does not kill the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease. Consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the Web-based consumer advocacy group Consumeraffairs.com, which advises the avoidance of brains, neck bones and beef cheeks, bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone. The group also says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store. ""Evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent BSE are working, as are similar actions taken by countries around the world,"" said John Clifford, the Agriculture Department's chief veterinarian. Last year, 29 cases of BSE were reported worldwide, down 99% from the peak of 37,311 cases in 1992. ""This is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease,"" he said last month. The Agriculture Department confirmed the first case of mad cow disease in America on December 23, 2003, in a cow born in Alberta, Canada, in April 1997, only four months before the United States and Canada began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed. A second U.S. case was confirmed June 24, 2005, and a third on March 13, 2006.","The quarantined farms are in California .

"(CNN) -- Dutch authorities have joined the FBI in conducting criminal investigations into the discovery of needles in six sandwiches aboard four Delta Air Lines flights from Amsterdam to the United States, a military police spokesman in the Netherlands said Tuesday. One person was injured when he bit into a sandwich containing a needle, Delta and Dutch officials said. That passenger, James Tonjes, said he thought the object was a toothpick at first. ""When I pulled it out, then I found out it was a needle,"" he said Tuesday. Tonjes said he has been placed on medication to prevent HIV. Tainted food on planes nothing new . A second passenger aboard the same flight, Jack Drogt, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that he not only found a needle, but he also discovered after landing that his son found one in his sandwich aboard another flight from Amsterdam. Unsavory truths about airplane food . The objects were discovered in the sandwiches as the planes were flying Sunday from Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands to Minneapolis, Seattle and two flights to Atlanta, according to Delta spokeswoman Kristin Baur. Two of the needles were found by passengers, she said. An air marshal aboard another flight found a needle. Officials initially reported that four needles had been found. Baur said the two additional needles reported Tuesday were not new incidents but a clarification of earlier information. U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a brief statement Tuesday saying it had seized at least one item of food containing a ""foreign object"" and turned it over to the FBI, which has said it is conducting a criminal investigation. On Tuesday, Robert van Kapel, spokesman for the military police in Schiphol, said detectives there were looking into who put the needles into the sandwiches and why. Military police provide police services at civilian airports in the Netherlands, according to the Defense Ministry. Gate Gourmet, which provided prepared sandwiches to Delta, said the sandwiches originated at the firm's facility in Amsterdam. The company has been in business since 1992. Airline drops salads from flights in food scare . ""This is a terribly upsetting situation,"" Gate Gourmet spokeswoman Christina Ulosevich said. ""First and foremost is the safety of the traveling public. There's nothing more important to us at all than the safety of the passengers and crews."" Tonjes said it was about an hour before the flight was scheduled to land in Minneapolis when the flight crew served him a turkey and cheese sandwich. He described the needle that punctured the roof of his mouth as being about an inch long. He said it looked like a sewing needle but did not have an eye. ""It happened so quick,"" he said. ""I called the flight attendants, and they immediately took it. They didn't make an announcement, but they did go around and collect (the sandwiches),"" he said. FBI officials declined to comment Tuesday. On Monday, Transportation Security Administration spokesman David Castelveter said the agency had notified all U.S. airlines with flights from Schiphol to the United States of the situation. Castelveter said on Tuesday the agency has developed catering security procedures for airlines and their contractors, but he said he could not disclose those measures. TSA conducts inspections to ensure compliance, he said. It was unclear who is responsible for inspecting catered food loaded on airplanes and how and where it is screened. The International Air Transport Association, an airline trade group, said each country is responsible for setting its own rules governing catering. International Air Transport Association spokesman Perry Flint said the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, also has standards and guidance on catering security. Why air travel snacks matter . Castelveter said the TSA evaluates the effectiveness of security protocols at international locations. Delta is now serving sealed prepackaged food on the Amsterdam flights instead of the sandwiches, and no other needles have been found, said Baur, the Delta spokeswoman. ""Delta requires all its in-flight caterers to adhere to strict criteria in order to offer our customers the very best onboard meals,"" Baur said in a statement. ""The safety and security of our passengers and crew is Delta's No. 1 priority."" Ulosevich said Monday that Gate Gourmet provides food to other airlines but that it had not received any other reports of tampering. ""We are absolutely cooperating fully with federal and local authorities who are involved, and concurrent with that, we'll be conducting our own full-scale investigation."" Frequent flier Gary Leff, who rakes in more than 100,000 miles each year, said he's taking a ""wait and see attitude"" but isn't planning to change the way he thinks about airline food. ""I mean, this isn't going to be the first thing ever found in airline food and certainly not the first thing found in restaurant food,"" he said. Leff is a frequent domestic flier for work and redeems his miles for international vacations, sharing his cheap travel expertise on his blog, View from the Wing. He expects others to be bothered by this incident ""for about 15 minutes,"" Leff said. He referenced a number of occasions when unwanted ingredients or objects have been discovered in foods and medicines over the past few decades, incidents no one seems to worry about or even remember, he said. ""I think most people are just so happy to be served food in the sky that they'll forget it pretty quickly,"" he said. Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director, said he believes the incidents are ""along the lines of a serious prank,"" rather than a terrorist act. The discovery of needles does raise questions about oversight of off-site food preparation, where numerous people have access to food before containers are locked, he said. Among those questions, Fuentes said, are, ""Who is watching the people who are preparing the food? What kind of background checks are they going through? What kind of security exists at those locations?""

"(CNN) -- Three people -- a surgeon, a medical technician and a pilot -- were killed Monday when a medical helicopter crashed in Florida, the Mayo Clinic said. The helicopter crashed at about 5:23 a.m. ET about 12 miles northeast of Palatka, Florida, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. The clinic said the helicopter was carrying two employees to the University of Florida in Gainesville to harvest organs when the crash occurred. It identified those employees Monday as cardiac surgeon Dr. Luis Bonilla and procurement technician David Hines. ""A helicopter pilot who was not employed by Mayo also died in the accident,"" the clinic said in a statement. The helicopter was owned and operated by an outside company, and the clinic did not release the name of the pilot. No patients were on board, the clinic said. ""Mayo is working internally to support the family and employees of those lost in this unfortunate tragedy,"" the clinic said. Palatka is about 45 miles east of Gainesville. The helicopter was owned by SK Jets, according to the FAA. The company has not commented on the crash. ""As we mourn this tragic event, we will remember the selfless and intense dedication they brought to making a difference in the lives of our patients,"" said John Noseworthy, Mayo Clinic's president and CEO, in the statement.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials used Cyber Monday to announce court orders shutting down 150 domain names of commercial websites they say were selling ""many millions"" of dollars worth of counterfeit goods. Sports jerseys and uniforms, DVDs, shoes and handbags, golf sets and exercise equipment were among the more popular purchases of ""knock off"" versions of name brand products, officials said. Investigations show the majority of those engaged in defrauding rights-holding companies and consumers are from China, but the phony goods are also produced in other countries, according to top law enforcement officials. The officials say they conduct undercover purchases with the help of legitimate rights holders to confirm the goods are bogus. They acknowledge the operators of the websites are beyond the reach of U.S. agents, and when the sites selling counterfeit goods are shut down, the same criminal enterprises sometimes simply change domain names and continue to prey on customers. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, the FBI and U.S. attorney offices cooperated in the investigation, dubbed Operation In Our Sites. This marked the second annual Cyber Monday crackdown. Last year, the government shut down 80 websites. ""We will not tolerate those who seek to profit by abusing the Internet and stealing intellectual property at the expense of authors, artists, and inventors,"" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. Breuer and ICE Director John Morton said that despite the challenges, increased international cooperation is helping to wage war on the theft of intellectual property. The operation they announced Monday is designed in part to educate consumers to be wary of websites that appear to be offering name brand products at substantially reduced prices. Authorities say they are unable to provide estimates of losses from cyber criminals, but are concerned that some of the millions of dollars in proceeds may end up in the hands of organized crime. The government places banners on the seized websites explaining why they were shut down. Last year, the banners registered 77 million hits, so authorities are hopeful public awareness of the criminal nature of the problem is increasing. ""This is simply downright theft,"" Morton said. Beyond clothing and electronic knock-offs, he said, officials are especially worried about the threat to safety and health when counterfeit goods involve such things as air bags, drugs, car batteries and engine parts. ""If the price is too good to be true, it probably is,"" said Morton, who added consumers can help themselves by being on the lookout for misleading labels and spelling errors to avoid getting ripped off. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","""Many millions"" of dollars worth of counterfeit goods were being sold, officials say .

"(CNN) -- California's Oakland port terminal re-opened on Tuesday after Occupy protestors shut the facility down overnight, but the disruption ""cost the Port and City of Oakland vital resources,"" a statement from officials said. ""They hurt the many businesses that pay taxes and help us create jobs,"" Robert Bernardo, communications manager for the port, said. Bernardo said port officials were committed to ""regaining the confidence of partners who bring business to Oakland and the region."" On Monday, a statement from the port authority said there were ""some delays of truck traffic"" but said the port remained operational. But by Monday night, the protests had disrupted workers ability to get to work and impaired the port's ability to operate, officials said. Officials said the disruptions resulted in a backlog of of work to get through, cost workers shifts and wages, and caused a negative ripple effect for people up and down the West Coast. Port of Oakland Executive Director Omar Benjamin suggested the Occupy movement should focus on ""real solutions to the problems plaguing our economy."" On a normal night, several hundred people would be working the graveyard shift, port spokesman Isaac Kos-Read told CNN. ""What has this accomplished?"" he asked. ""This is disrupting the 99%."" The Occupy movement has rallied against what it describes as corporate greed while asserting that the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99% of the population. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan concurred with Kos-Read, saying the Occupy movement isn't thinking of the consequences of its actions and whom it is actually hurting. ""They are saying ... they have to get the attention of the ruling class. I think the ruling class is probably laughing and people in this city will be crying this Christmas,"" Quan said. ""It's really got to stop."" Oakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group; police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union -- which represents 15,000 dockworkers -- has distanced itself from the protest movement. The union ""shares the Occupy movement's concerns about the future of the middle class and corporate abuses,"" ILWU President Robert McEllrath wrote to locals last week -- but he urged the movement to stay out of its dispute with the port of Longview, Washington, and warned against ""outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda."" In Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, three people claiming ties with the Occupy movement blocked the main door of House Speaker John Boehner office. The men, who said they were in the 120th hour of a hunger strike, sat together with stickers that read ""Taxation without representation"" taped over their mouths. They said they were demanding full voting rights for residents in the District of Columbia. Elsewhere, police moved into the Occupy Baltimore encampment at around 3 a.m. Tuesday to remove protesters that had been in McKeldin Square for the last two months, according to CNN affiliate WMAR. Local reports said officers were out in full riot gear, and police cars surrounded the area, but there were no major incidents reported. Reports showed the city of Baltimore recently denied a permit extension for the camp and cut off its power supply, and that several incidents -- including a stabbing -- had occurred at the encampment recently. In a statement released Tuesday morning, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said people are free to assemble and demonstrate, but ""our public parks and green-spaces should not be treated as permanent campgrounds."" Rawlings-Blake said her administration will provide ""outreach and assistance"" to the homeless. Tuesday's actions followed Occupy protests -- and police reactions -- in several cities on Monday. In Houston, police arrested 20 protesters after dozens of police on foot and on horseback confronted a somewhat larger group of Occupy protesters who blocked an interstate on-ramp, authorities said. In Long Beach, California, protests caused isolated traffic delays but did not hinder port operations, according to Police Chief Jim McDonnrell, who added that two arrests were made. About 80 protesters demonstrated outside the gate of San Diego's port Monday but caused no disruption, port spokesman Ron Powell said. Four people who sat down in the road were arrested, he said. The demonstrations that began Monday in port cities were part of a nationwide Occupy effort in the aftermath of efforts by cities across the country -- including New York, Boston and Oakland -- to clear demonstrators from encampments they had set up in public parks and other locations. ""We are occupying the ports as part of a day of action, boycott and march for full legalization and good jobs for all to draw attention to and protest the criminal system of concentrated wealth that depends on local and global exploitation of working people, and the denial of workers' rights to organize for decent pay, working conditions and benefits, in disregard for the environment and the health and safety of surrounding communities,"" Occupy organizers said on their website.

"Birmingham, Alabama (CNN) -- Severe weather tore across the Southeast early Monday, killing at least two people, injuring more than 100 and spreading damage through several states, emergency officials said. The two fatalities reported were near Birmingham, Alabama, according to Sgt. Jack Self of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. One was a 16-year-old in Clay, northeast of the city, and the second was an 83-year-old man in the Oak Grove community west of Birmingham, Self said. The two were identified as Christina Heichelbech and Bobby Sims. The teenager was a female, Self said, although the fatality was initially reported as a male. Authorities believe the same storm, which struck about 3:30 a.m., was responsible for both deaths, he said. At least 100 injuries were reported, from cuts and bruises to broken bones, Self said. And at least 211 homes were destroyed and 218 suffered major damage in Jefferson County, according to Alabama Red Cross spokesman Chris Olson. That number is expected to rise. Did you witness the damage? Please share images and footage, if it's safe to do so . Emergency crews were working to locate people who may be trapped or injured and to clear roads, several of which were impassable, the sheriff's office said. Video from the Center Point area, also northeast of Birmingham near Clay, showed numerous downed trees, some on top of homes. People had to step over trees as they made their way down a residential street. An EF-3 tornado struck the town of Clay, the National Weather Service confirmed late Monday. Wind speeds from the twister were estimated at 150 miles per hour. ""The whole house just shook,"" Mary Mann told CNN affiliate WVTM. ""We were all in the back bedroom praying to God to put his angels around us. We made it out, but ... the devastation."" One resident told WVTM he and his family had sought shelter in his home's basement when the house's front door came ""flying by us. We made it just in the nick of time."" The man, who was not identified, grew emotional as he told the station, ""We've lost our house, but at least ... we've got our family, and that's all that matters right now."" A photo from one Clay subdivision showed a number of homes heavily damaged or destroyed, with debris strewn across the neighborhood and trees snapped in half. Several organizations, including the Salvation Army and the Red Cross, said on Twitter they were sending teams to aid storm victims. Several shelters were open in Jefferson County, the sheriff's office said. Terri Nichols spoke to CNN in Clay, where she was helping neighbors sort through the debris. ""As bad as it looks, they're fortunate that they have their lives,"" she said, standing amid piles of wood that had once been homes. Damage was also reported in Perry and Chilton counties, south of Birmingham in the central part of the state. Some 14 homes were destroyed and 38 homes damaged in the Chilton County town of Maplesville, the county's emergency management agency said, but no one was injured. Art Faulkner, director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, told CNN officials are focused on several areas, including Center Point, Oak Grove and the town of Trussville, also northeast of Birmingham, as well as Maplesville. Search and rescue operations were ongoing, he said. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency for all of Alabama's 67 counties, meaning state resources can be called upon to assist local officials, Faulkner said. Seven Alabama counties reported storm damage, with the majority in Jefferson and Chilton counties, said Yasamie August of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. By Monday evening, 12,300 customers statewide were without power -- the majority in Jefferson County -- Alabama Power said on Twitter. The outages peaked about 5 a.m. at 45,400, Alabama Power spokeswoman Hallie Bradley said. Utility poles and power lines were reported down. Several school systems closed for the day, according to officials and affiliate reports. Damage was also reported near Tuscaloosa -- which was devastated by a tornado nine months ago -- as well as south of Birmingham, officials said. Three reports of ""minor structural damage"" were received, said David Hartin of the Tuscaloosa County emergency management agency. The majority of reports concerned downed trees and power lines, and the damage reports were north of Tuscaloosa, he said. Hartin said he was not aware of any injuries. Tuscaloosa was ravaged by an EF-5 tornado in April 2011. An EF-5 is at the extreme end of the tornado classification scale, with winds of more than 200 mph. The twister was part of a record-breaking tornado outbreak -- 178 tornadoes over April 27-28, the largest recorded tornado outbreak in U.S. history. In Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, 61 people died in the tornado on April 27. At least 243 people were killed by twisters statewide, and 39 of Alabama's 67 counties were designated for disaster assistance. ""The one thing that we can say is thank goodness we're not looking at what happened in this state last year in April,"" Faulkner said. ""We do not have that kind of catastrophic damage. However, any loss of life or destruction of property is a bad thing, and we will be there to make sure we're able to assist our citizens with any cleanup that may need to be done after the search and rescue is over."" Asked whether the new storms posed a setback to rebuilding efforts, Hartin said he did not believe so. ""There's a lot of building going on,"" he said. Bentley told CNN the state has made a ""rapid recovery"" from the April storms. He said he had planned to announce a commission Monday set up to provide recommendations on improving the response to severe weather, but the event was canceled with the report of Monday's storms. The Oak Grove community was hit hard by a tornado in April 1998. Thirty-two people were killed in Jefferson County and two more in St. Clair County in that storm, according to the National Weather Service. The storms were moving eastward into Georgia, but were decreasing in intensity because of a stable air mass in place over Georgia, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. In Arkansas, an EF-2 tornado touched down on the northern edge of Fordyce, in the south-central part of the state, the National Weather Service confirmed Monday afternoon. An EF-2 tornado has winds of up to 135 mph. The twister caused ""significant damage"" to homes northwest of Fordyce, along with a country club and a set of transmission towers, the weather service said. One person who sustained minor injuries was treated and released at a hospital, said Jim Johnson of the Dallas County, Arkansas, Emergency Management Office. Another woman was trapped in her home briefly, but she was not hurt, he said. About 40 homes were damaged, with 10 of those destroyed, said Tommy Jackson, spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Emergency management. A shelter was set up at a Fordyce hotel, he said. ""As we assess the damage this morning, it looks like we dodged a pretty good bullet when you look at places like Alabama,"" Jackson said. Power outages, which peaked at 3,700, were down to about 1,300 just before daybreak, Johnson said. Crews were doing their best, he said, but ""so many of the wires are twisted in the treetops."" Possible tornadoes were also reported in Mississippi and Tennessee, according to the National Weather Service. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said one person was reported injured in Bolivar County. Several homes were reported damaged in Bolivar and Quitman counties, and several farm buildings were damaged in Coahoma County. Trees and power lines were reported downed in all three counties, the agency said. ""Our sympathies go out to those whose homes were damaged and those who were injured,"" said Robert Latham, agency director, in a statement. ""But while the damages were not catastrophic in our state, we only have to look at the destruction in Alabama from the same storm system to realize we were very fortunate. ""I hope many of our residents took time to prepare their families and homes prior to the storms reaching them,"" Latham said. ""The next time we may not be as lucky.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Five active and three retired officers of the New York Police Department are among 12 people charged Tuesday with conspiring to transport and distribute firearms and stolen goods, according to federal authorities. ""A group of crime fighters took to moonlighting as criminals,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a press conference. The defendants are charged in an alleged conspiracy to transport and distribute untraceable firearms across state lines. and conspiracy to transport supposedly stolen and counterfeit goods including cigarettes from Virginia and slot machines from Atlantic City, New Jersey. The criminal complaint accuses the defendants of participating in the illegal transportation of goods with a street value estimated at more than $1 million. The charges stem from an extensive undercover investigation that began in 2009, conducted by FBI and investigators from the NYPD's internal affairs bureau, Bharara said Tuesday. The investigation included a confidential informant, undercover law enforcement officers, surveillance, and telephone taps, according to court documents. According to the official criminal complaint against the defendants, and the sworn deposition of FBI Special Agent Kennent Hosely, the current or former NYPD officers charged are William Masso, Eddie Goris, Ali Oklu, Gary Oritz, and John Mahony, all active-duty officers in Brooklyn; Joseph Trischitta and Marco Venezia, who were active-duty NYPD officers at the time of the alleged crimes but are now retired; and Richard Melnik, a retired NYPD officer. Also charged, federal authorities said, are Anthony Santiago, a New York City Department of Sanitation police officer; David Kanwisher, a New Jersey corrections officer; and Michael Gee and Eric Gomer, who court documents list as ""associates"" of Santiago. None of the defendants' lawyers were available for comment Tuesday. The criminal complaint alleges the lead defendant, Masso, met the confidential informant in 2009 and brought several of his fellow officers into the conspiracy to pull off various illegal schemes. According to Bharara, four other officers who were not charged or listed in the criminal complaint but who had contact with Masso are on modified assignment as the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau investigates their actions. As the charges were announced Tuesday, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, ""This is very disturbing and disheartening for members of the department and the public."" According to the charges filed Tuesday, the defendants were engaged in the theft and transport of over 200 cases of cigarettes from tractor-trailers in Virginia. The cigarettes were valued at over $500,000. Some defendants, authorities allege, helped undercover agents break into the trailers, some transported the illegal goods, and some helped sell them in New York. Authorities said undercover agents contacted Masso on two separate occasions about the transport of purportedly stolen slot machines from Atlantic City to Port Chester, New York. The criminal complaint alleges the defendants traveled to pick up the stolen goods. While some drove vans carrying the slot machines, others acted as a sort of security entourage, following the vans to insure they reached their destination charges federal authorities. The complaint alleges Masso instructed the other officers to carry their badges in case they were stopped by law enforcement. In the case of the firearms, court documents say defendants drove the guns, along with cigarettes, in rented vans and their own personal vehicles into New York form New Jersey. Many of the weapons had the serial numbers altered or scraped off, rendering them untraceable. According to the complaint, as Masso drove his personal vehicle into New York with two bags full of firearms, ""Masso's NYPD jacket was displayed in the window of his vehicle."" Prosecutors said that while the defendants all believed the items they transported were stolen; they had in fact been provided by the FBI. The firearms were never a danger to the public, authorities said, as they had been rendered inoperable. ""These crimes are without question, reprehensible -- particularly conspiring to import untraceable guns and assault rifles into New York,"" said Janice K. Fedarcyk, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York division. ""The public trusts the police not only to enforce the law, but to obey it. These crimes, as alleged in the complaint, do nothing but undermine public trust and confidence in law enforcement.""","The charges stem from an undercover investigation that began in 2009, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- A member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle club was facing charges including assault with a deadly weapon Sunday after a brawl between club members devolved into a gunfight that left one person dead. Police identified the victim of the shooting at John Ascuaga's Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada, as Jeffrey Pettigrew, 51, president of the San Jose, California, chapter of the Hell's Angels. Two other people, both of California and members of the Vagos motorcycle club, were in stable condition at hospitals after being shot in the abdomen and the leg, respectively. Cesar Villagrana, 36, was arrested after surveillance video showed him ""shooting into the crowd"" during the Friday night melee, Sparks police said in a statement. ""However, it cannot be confirmed at this time if any of the projectiles struck the victims."" Besides assault with a deadly weapon, Villagrana also faces charges of carrying a concealed weapon; aiming a firearm at another; aiming or discharging a firearm where a person is endangered; and possession of stolen property/firearm, jail records show. His bail was set at $500,000 cash only. Authorities appealed to bystanders who may have photographed or videotaped the event to contact police. A second shooting occurred at 10:49 a.m. Saturday, police said. A motorcyclist was traveling down a street when a car pulled alongside him and he was shot in the stomach. The name of that victim was being withheld, but he was in stable condition, authorities said. Witnesses said a black four-door BMW with two people inside was seen speeding away just after the shooting. ""We are unable to definitively link the two shooting incidents at this time,"" police said. The incidents occurred during the Street Vibrations Fall Rally, an event that began Wednesday and was expected to continue into Sunday. After the shootings, however, the Sparks portion of the event were canceled through the weekend, the city announced Saturday. The mayor of Sparks also declared a state of emergency. ""Whenever you have people who enter our city with bad intentions, bad things are going to happen,"" Sparks Mayor Geno Martini said Saturday. Police said they have increased the number of foot and mobile patrols in the city. Authorities reported that as many as 30 people took part in the casino brawl. Police responded with assistance from overhead helicopters. There has been no violence since the Street Vibrations rally expanded into Sparks, police said. ""The Sparks Police Department wants to acknowledge the acts of these two motorcycle clubs do not represent a majority of the motorcycle enthusiasts that come to the Street Vibrations event,"" authorities said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Scaffolding that collapsed during a storm and killed seven people during the Indiana State Fair last year was not up to standard, and the fair's commission did not have adequate emergency planning in place, according to two investigative reports presented Thursday. ""Calculations and in-situ physical testing determined the Jersey barrier ballast (support) system had grossly inadequate capacity to resist both the minimum code-specified wind speed (68 miles per hour) and the actual wind speed that was present at the time of the failure (approximately 59 miles per hour),"" according to a report by Thornton Tomasetti Inc., an engineering firm. The findings were presented by representatives from the firm and officials from Witt Associates, a public safety and crisis management consulting group. The National Weather Service had estimated winds of 60 to 70 mph were raking the area when the incident occurred in August. A massive gust of wind brought down the stage, killing five people and injuring dozens. Two others later died as a result of the collapse. ""A big gust of wind came through. You could see a lot of people panicking. All the scaffolding and speakers -- all that came crashing down -- and the whole stand just collapsed,"" said Aaron Richman at the time, who witnessed the collapse. Sugarland, the country music duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush who were scheduled to perform during the fair, issued a statement Thursday saying that, ""In all the back-and-forth between the lawyers, the suggestion's been made that we've somehow been trying to avoid having to answer questions about last summer's terrible tragedy."" ""This is simply not true,"" they said. ""There is no one who wants to get to the bottom of what happened more than we do, which is why we're ready, willing, and able to give these depositions today and tomorrow."" They added that they ""want all the facts to come out, not only for the sake of all the victims and their loved ones, but also so we can make sure that nothing like this ever happens again."" Allan Mayer, the group's spokesman added: ""The fact is that Jennifer and Kristian never told anyone not to delay the concert because of the weather. They care deeply about their fans and, as they've said, nobody wants to get to the bottom of what happened more than they do."" Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said his administration ""will insist on immediate and complete implementation of the recommendations in this report."" ""But it's also now clear that most, if not all states, have been deficient in this area and have much to learn from this tragedy,"" he said in a statement. ""We will share freely all these findings and suggestions with any state who will listen, starting later this month at a national meeting in Indianapolis about national safety standards for outdoor temporary stages and structures."" In February, the Indiana Department of Labor announced penalties totaling $80,800 following a worker safety investigation into the collapse. The largest fines -- totaling $63,000 for what the agency said were three ""knowing violations"" -- were levied on Mid-America Sound Corp., which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the Indianapolis fairgrounds on August 13, 2011, right before Sugarland was to perform.","The scaffolding that collapsed called substandard .

"(CNN) -- The first U.S. case of mad cow disease in six years sparked fears of illness that prompted at least one major South Korean retailer to suspend the sale of American beef. However, public health officials said the risk of Americans contracting the disease is low, given that the affected dairy cow in central California never entered the human food chain and did not contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy through contaminated animal feed. ""It was never presented for slaughter for human consumption, so at no time presented a risk to the food supply or human health,"" said John Clifford, the Agriculture Department's chief veterinarian. What you need to know about mad cow disease . In South Korea, one of the world's largest importers of U.S. beef, the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy led retailer LotteMart to remove American beef from store shelves. ""Currently, the sale of U.S. beef is temporarily suspended to ease our customers from anxiety,"" LotteMart said. The South Korean government said it will step up checks on U.S. beef imports but not halt them for now. In 2010, South Korea imported 125,000 tons of U.S. beef, a 97% increase from the year before, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Sarah Klein, food safety attorney for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there is no need for consumers to take precautions based on this case. ""A case of a single cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy is not a reason for significant concern on the part of consumers, and there is no reason to believe the beef or milk supply is unsafe,"" she said. ""If the cow were exposed to the typical strain of BSE via animal feed -- and the government says that's not the case here -- that would have represented a significant failure,"" she said. She said the government would have had a difficult time tracking down other cattle that may have been eating the same feed because the nation lacks an effective animal identification program. Elisa Odabashian, the director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union, said the government's testing program is not sufficient to ensure that U.S. beef is safe. ""The USDA tests only about 40,000 of the 35 million cows that are killed every year,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""That's just a tiny fraction. ... They're not looking very hard for mad cow disease, and so they're not finding it very often."" In a statement issued to CNN in 2006, the USDA said it does not support 100% testing because the disease is difficult to detect in young cattle, the primary source of beef in the United States. ""Recognizing the international scientific consensus that BSE (Mad Cow Disease) is a disease that is not detected in young animals, there isn't any nation in the world that requires 100-percent testing for BSE,"" the statement said. But Odabashian said the agency has also vetoed efforts by private companies to carry out their own testing, at their own expense, and then labeling their product as BSE-free. ""Those companies in the United States that want to test their own meat have been prohibited from doing so by the USDA,"" she said. ""We think that's wrong."" The cow's carcass was at a Baker Commodities Inc. rendering facility in Hanford, California, according to company Executive Vice President Dennis Luckey. The company renders animal byproducts and had randomly selected the animal for testing on April 18, he said. ""We are in the business of removing dead animals from dairies in the Central Valley,"" he said. ""As part of that program, we participate in the BSE surveillance program."" The sample was sent to the University of California at Davis for initial testing, which came back inconclusive. It was then sent to the Department of Agriculture's laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where it tested positive, the agency said. The carcass was in quarantine Wednesday. ""We're waiting now for USDA to tell us how to dispose of it,"" Luckey said. A USDA spokesman, Larry Hawkins, said the agency was not releasing the name of the dairy ""because it's our policy not to when we are in the middle of the investigation."" But Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, said it was from a dairy farm in Tulare County. ""We did trace it back to a farm,"" Nunes said, adding that the discovery ""demonstrates the strength of our surveillance system."" In a statement, California Department of Food and Agriculture Secretary Karen Ross said CDFA veterinarians were working with the USDA to determine whether other cows are at risk. ""Feed restrictions in place in California and around the country for the last 15 years minimize that risk to the greatest degree possible,"" she said. Eating contaminated meat or some other animal products from cattle that have BSE is thought to be the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s. Learn more about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . In people, symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes, movement deficits, memory disturbances and cognitive impairments. BSE can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression, difficulty in coordination and standing up, decreased milk production or weight loss. It is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein, which is fed to other cattle. In this case, the Agricultural Department reported that the cow had a rare form of BSE not likely carried by contaminated feed. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday that he remains confident in the health of the national herd and the safety of beef and dairy products. ""This is an atypical case, which means it's not connected in any way, shape or form to feed. ... A very rare circumstance and situation,"" Vilsack said. ""It can just sort of come up and pop up -- sometimes it's genetic."" Since 2004, the USDA has removed the brain and the spinal column, the parts suspected of causing mad cow disease in humans, from the food system. Unlike most other meat-borne illnesses, such as those caused by E.-coli bacteria, cooking does not kill the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease. Consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the Web-based consumer advocacy group Consumeraffairs.com, which advises the avoidance of brains, neck bones and beef cheeks, bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone. The group also says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store. ""Evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent BSE are working, as are similar actions taken by countries around the world,"" said the USDA's Clifford. Last year, 29 cases of BSE were reported worldwide, down 99% from the peak of 37,311 cases in 1992. ""This is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease,"" he said. The Agriculture Department confirmed the first case of mad cow disease in America on December 23, 2003, in a cow born in Alberta, Canada, in April 1997, only four months before the United States and Canada began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed. A second U.S. case was confirmed June 24, 2005, and a third on March 13, 2006. The infected California cow confirmed Tuesday was America's fourth case of mad cow disease.

"(CNN) -- A DNA test on the remains of chess legend Bobby Fischer has determined that he is not the father of a Filipino girl, the girl's lawyer told CNN on Wednesday. Results of the test ""excluded"" the possibility that Fischer, who died in January 2008, was the father of Jinky Young, lawyer Thordur Bogason said. ""This brings about the end of this paternity case,"" he said. In June, Iceland's supreme court ruled in favor of a request by Young to exhume Fischer's remains in order to settle the question of paternity. Fischer's body was exhumed in early July and reburied shortly after DNA samples were taken, law enforcement officials said. Police in the Icelandic town of Selfoss, where Fischer is buried, said at the time of the exhumation that Young was 9 years old. Fischer was 64 when he died in January 2008. A child prodigy and chess master by the time he was 15, Fischer achieved international fame in 1972 when he defeated chess grandmaster Boris Spassky of Russia during the height of the Cold War, becoming the world champion. The tournament was considered a symbolic battle between the two greatest powers in the world. It was held in Iceland, midway between the United States and the Soviet Union. Soviet chess masters had held the title since World War II -- until Fischer won. The victory, unequaled by an American since, was followed by tens of millions of chess fans around the world. But Fischer's genius proved eccentric. Years after his historic win, Fischer gave up the title in 1975 and refused to defend it. He vanished and lived in a self-imposed exile for decades. He resurfaced in Yugoslavia in 1992 for a rematch against Spassky. It was another victory for Fischer, one that earned him $3.5 million. The U.S. government claimed Fischer's participation had violated U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed to punish Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, and revoked his U.S. passport. Fischer again disappeared. He was not heard from again until 2004, when he was arrested in Japan for traveling on an expired passport. When Iceland granted Fischer citizenship in 2005, he moved to that country and lived there until his death in a hospital.","Results show Fischer is not the father of a Filipino girl .

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- A medical group in Argentina is asking for more drug-testing regulations in the South American country after a officials fined pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline for alleged irregularities in a pediatric pneumonia vaccine trial. The Argentinian Federation of Health Professionals accuses drug maker GlaxoSmithKline of misleading participants and pressuring poor families into joining a trial for the Synflorix vaccine, which the company says protects against bacterial pneumonia and meningitis. ""They recruited children in an irregular manner. ... They did not do what they were supposed to. They did not inform. There were not independent witnesses. They pressured the mothers of poor children,"" said Jorge Yabkowsky, the federation's director. But GlaxoSmithKline, the world's second largest pharmaceutical company, denies those accusations and says it will appeal a judge's approval of Argentina's National Administration of Medicine, Food and Medical Technology's fining the company and two doctors a total of nearly $240,000 for irregularities in documentation of the trial. In a statement, GlaxoSmithKline said it conducts clinical studies all over the world, respecting laws and meeting the highest standards of ethics and quality. ""The ruling has to do with procedures, with the form of documenting procedures of the studies. ... None of the patients that were included in this study were included without their appropriate consent,"" said Rosana Felice, medical director of Glaxo Argentina. Felice said official investigations by Argentina's drug administration, known as ANMAT, and ethics reviews have not turned up any irregularities in the vaccine's safety. GlaxoSmithKline's statement said there are no cases alleging fraud or corruption in the study. The deaths of 14 children who reportedly died after participating in the trials, have drawn widespread attention in Argentinian media. Their deaths are under investigation, but there has been no evidence linking deaths to the vaccine or irregularities in the studies. Felice said GlaxoSmithKline categorically denies that the vaccine caused the deaths. ""In no case was it related to the administration of the vaccine, and this has been sufficiently demonstrated, proven and evaluated by ANMAT,"" Felice said. But the health professional federation pointed to the children's deaths in its call for increased regulations on drug testing. The trial included 24,000 children, Felice said, including 14,000 children in Argentina and 10,000 others in Colombia and Panama. The Synflorix vaccine has been approved by regulatory agencies in more than 85 countries, based on more than 40 clinical studies, GlaxoSmithKline said.","Argentina's drug administration has fined the company and two doctors nearly $240,000 .

"Washington (CNN) -- By all accounts, it started innocently. An airport screener missed a bag. But by the time it was over, authorities had shut down an airport terminal for two hours, airlines delayed almost a dozen flights and scores of air travelers probably were wondering whether they should have taken the train. The shutdown of the A-2 terminal at Newark Liberty International Airport on Wednesday is probably typical in many ways. But a Port Authority police report gives a detailed account of the breach, the TSA's response, and some of the behind-the-scenes confusion that led to the two-hour closure. The mistake . It happened at 11:04 a.m. According to the TSA, an X-ray machine detected a suspicious object in a bag, and a screener was told to conduct a hand search. But, for reasons still unclear, before the officer turned his or her attention to the task, the passenger left the checkpoint, along with the bag. The Port Authority Police Department report gives a slightly different account. It says the TSA screener picked up and screened the wrong bag. When the mistake was discovered shortly thereafter, the traveler had already left the checkpoint, and the screener could not describe the passenger. Authorities shut down the checkpoint, and a breach of security was issued, the Port Authority report says. The response . At 11:18 a.m., TSA screeners looked at recordings captured by the closed circuit television cameras. They told police they figured out who the unidentified passenger was. They gave police a description of a black female traveling with a black male. But when the two travelers were located and rescreened, it was found that they were not the folks involved in the breach. The confusion . The TSA then gave a description of a tall black male carrying a black laptop bag, according to the police report. That person was also found, and ruled out. ""This process continued three more times,"" the police report says. Police found, and then ruled out, a white woman traveling with two children in a stroller, a 6-foot white male wearing a brown shirt and jeans and carrying a suitcase, and a white male with curly brown hair wearing a JetBlue uniform. After the fifth false identification, authorities ordered the terminal area shut down and cleared. All passengers, flight crews and employees were told to leave for rescreening. The end . At 12:22 p.m., more than an hour into the incident, a screener stopped a female JetBlue employee believed to be the owner of the bag. Upon rescreening, it was determined that her bag was allowed to pass through security unchecked. But because of the lapse of time, and the possibility she could have taken contraband into the secure side of the checkpoint, officers continued with their inspection of the area and its occupants. They reopened the checkpoint about 1 p.m. But wait! There's a twist. While Port Authority Police Department union representatives complained that the incident was an example of TSA incompetence, a TSA official, speaking on background, said other factors may vindicate the agency. The TSA said that a woman they identified early in the incident twice denied being the woman with the suspicious bag. The woman's repeated denials prompted them to focus on other individuals, prolonging the incident. The woman may have denied having the bag, the TSA official speculated, because she had purchased some perfume in a duty-free shop, and did not have the liquid in the required one-quart plastic bag. The TSA official acknowledged the theory was speculative, but said the TSA hopes to learn more in a ""hot wash"" or review of the incident. The consequences . Wednesday's breach occurred just two days after a TSA miscommunication resulted in a scare at nearby LaGuardia airport. In that incident, a screener removed two suspicious objects from a traveler's bag, determined that they were not explosive, but placed them aside. When a later shift arrived, they feared the devices were pipe bombs and called police. ""Unfortunately, these glaring TSA security failures at our nation's busiest airports continue to undermine security, which imperils and needlessly inconveniences the traveling public,"" Paul Nunziato, president of the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association, said in a statement to CNN. ""It is a shame these security breaches have become daily events."" Nunziato said that the ""astonishing number of TSA security failures"" has led airport police organizations to ask Congress to create uniformed standards for airport security. ""Until Washington acts to mandate these reforms, this game of Russian Roulette will continue,"" he said. Responded TSA spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein: ""We screen nearly 2 million passengers a day and we are always looking for ways to improve and strengthen our processes."" Farbstein said the TSA is conducting a thorough review of the incident to see why the suspicious bag was not ""picked up and inspected right away.""","Newark International Airport terminal was shut down for two hours following a security breach .

"(CNN) -- Late last year, a video producer and I visited South Korea, which is said to be the global hub for gaming addiction, as well as gaming addiction treatment. There we met with three young men who had been in some form of treatment for their obsession with video games -- everything from ""talk therapy"" with counselors to ""virtual-reality"" treatment, which is designed to create negative associations between the player and the game they can't stop playing. We met a 17-year-old who said he felt like online games were ""pulling him"" away from the real world. Others said they had contemplated suicide or played for up to 20 hours per day. The obsessions came with real consequence for these young men. Some had damaged relationships with family members; one found himself unemployed and unable to dig out of a rut. But can these obsessions be classified as Internet or gaming addiction? For an expert opinion, I turned to Dr. Charles O'Brien, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and chair of the working group that will determine whether such disorders make an official list in the United States. The group decided to recommend that more research be conducted before Internet addiction could be listed as an official disorder in the United States. The following transcript of our conversation is edited for clarity and length: . CNN: What does the research on gaming and Internet addiction say, in general? O'Brien: That's a very good question. The DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) committee that I chair has been totally guided by research data. There are a lot of people who want us to add all kinds of conditions to the DSM. Besides Internet addiction or gaming addiction, there's jogging addiction, sex addiction, food addiction. There are all kinds of pressures, but we go by the data, and we go by data in referee journals. We think (Internet addiction) is something. I even went to Beijing to visit a hospital that is dedicated to what the Chinese call Internet addiction, and it was full of young men who had been brought in by their parents because they had been spending hours a day and neglecting their studies and their health, even, playing these various games. Typically it's ""World of Warcraft"" that they're playing. But they don't really have what we consider to be evidence (that this is a disorder). CNN: Is there anything that's known for sure about Internet addiction? O'Brien: There have been clinical studies. They're all anecdotes. As a clinician, I think I've seen a few cases, but they were very variable. And there are a lot of things we don't know. Such as, is this a phase that someone is going through? Even in my own family, I have a son who was 13 and 14 and was spending hours a day playing Internet games. They do it in groups. Their partners may be in China or Japan. They do it on the Internet. And they neglect their studies. Eventually, he kind of outgrew it, and now he's in college and is an honors student. It's not a clear enough syndrome that you can say at this point it's clearly a disease -- that it's an illness or a sickness. But we're open to that idea. Certainly, it does seem to be that way, but we have to have more evidence. CNN: What threshold would it have to cross to be its own disorder? O'Brien: We would need studies done in multiple sites. People would have to get together and decide on criteria for the diagnosis. And we put some potential criteria in the write-up, in the appendix for DSM-5. For example, a natural history. What happens to these people? How do they respond to treatment? What treatment seems to work? There are a lot, well, not a lot, but a significant number of American therapists who are treating cases like this, but they are generally writing up studies as clinical experience. This is not evidence. You have to do careful studies. CNN: Since there are people who are treating gaming addiction, do you think that's safe? Or is it potentially dangerous? O'Brien: It's not dangerous. Typically they're treating it with talk therapy. I don't know of any studies where any medications have been used. But you can't consider it science when people are just reporting interesting cases. That's not the kind of thing that we look for. CNN: Is it possible gaming or Internet addiction could be linked to other disorders, like anxiety or depression? And this is just the way the person copes or acts out? O'Brien: Exactly. There are some people who are seeing a therapist and it's interpreted that they're sort of escaping into a computer and using this to deal with their anxieties. Or maybe they have bipolar disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder. But these are just theories. There needs to be some evidence based on a significant number of cases. How are the cases similar? CNN: How long have people been looking into this issue? O'Brien: The literature really began in the 2000s. CNN: How long does it typically take for a new disorder to be accepted? O'Brien: It depends on how rare it is. Most of the disorders we have now are just age-old disorders. One of the disorders that's very prominent today is post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. And you probably saw the Time magazine cover showing one soldier or veteran commits suicide every day. But we didn't even have the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder until about 1980. And it was there. It's not as if Napoleon's troops didn't have this or Washington's troops didn't have it. But it hadn't been described. People weren't as well trained in behavioral observations and writing them up and so-forth. It was described for the first time in the 1980s and it now turns out to be a fairly common disorder and people get PTSD from various kind of trauma ... it's not just war. We've made a lot of progress with PTSD, and I think it would be a good model for Internet addiction. CNN: Is there any good information about what happens in the brains of Internet addicts? O'Brien: I found maybe five or 10 articles of brain imaging studies of Internet addicts. They found that the changes were very similar to those seen in compulsive gambling. CNN: What does that mean, exactly? O'Brien: Addiction is a learned behavior. For example, we do a lot of studies with cocaine addicts and nicotine addicts and alcoholics. And when you show an alcoholic or cocaine addict cues that look like people taking cocaine or the smell of cocaine or things like that, the brain lights up in the reward centers, or the pleasure areas, the same areas that light up when people or animals eat delicious food or have sex or engage in any behavior that leads to a feeling of pleasure. CNN: So people who have an obsession, or possibly an addiction, to games or the Internet, their brains light up in that same way? O'Brien: Exactly. And it becomes really an intense learned effect. We find that if we give them even a brief cue exposure, even before it reaches the level of consciousness, their brains are already activated. It becomes a very strong reflex, and this is why it's so hard to stop. You probably have friends who have tried to stop smoking many times, and they keep going back because it's a learned behavior. Even though they consciously want to stop, the drug has pretty much taken control of them. CNN: When you went to that hospital in China, what were the cases like? What is it like for a person who exhibits symptoms of gaming or Internet addiction? O'Brien: Well, it's just like anybody else who begins playing Internet games. It starts off like everyone else. This is a multibillion-dollar industry. People are buying these things. But then they just gradually spend more and more time doing it, and they begin neglecting other activities and their friends. Their friends are on the Internet. There was a terrible case that was in the newspapers last year in South Korea, where this couple who had a real baby were so involved with the virtual baby and doing things with the virtual baby that they neglected their real live baby and the baby died. To me that's the most dire, horrible thing that I've ever heard of. These people were clearly obsessed with it but that doesn't tell me that they had a disorder that we could define scientifically. CNN: Do you think it's possible? O'Brien: Oh yes, sure. We just don't think the way to go about doing a classification system of mental illness is that you can just put things in too readily. It took a while before PTSD was described and identified and it made it into the DSM. CNN: So it doesn't discount the reality of those symptoms or the possibility that it is a disease? O'Brien: That's right. My personal belief is that eventually it will become an official disorder because more and more people are going to do studies on it, and we're hoping to facilitate that.""","Gaming and Internet addiction are not official disorders in the United States .

"(CNN) -- A foiled plot to sneak a bomb through airport checkpoints and onto a plane bound for the United States calls attention to gaps in screening measures that are supposed to detect threats airport metal detectors miss. Outside the United States, the controversial body-scanning technology is not widely used, security experts say. But they say it is the best way to detect plastic explosives hidden on people boarding airplanes. ""Since most of these airports are not using body-scanning technology, including for American flights, I would say that this is an opening that was probably intended to be abused by (the bomb-maker) and those who planned the attack,"" said Rafi Ron, president of New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion International Airport in Israel. The latest nonmetallic bomb to be discovered never made it to an airport and posed no real threat to air travelers. It is similar to, but more sophisticated than, the device discovered in a failed attempt to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. New sophistication seen in bomb plot, lawmaker says . That attempt hastened deployment in the U.S. of advanced imaging technology, or body scanning, at airport security checkpoints across the country. There are about 700 machines in more than 180 airports nationwide. Pat-downs are used when passengers decline body screening or when a scan reveals a need for additional screening. ""It's not a perfect technology, and there are several ways that it can be bypassed,"" Ron said. ""But at the same time, it is the best technology that we have available at this time."" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said there is a ""high likelihood"" the latest bomb would have been detected if attempts had been made to slip it past U.S. airport security. Use of advanced imaging technology abroad is ""woefully inadequate,"" said Chad Sweet, a former CIA and Department of Homeland Security official and co-founder of the Chertoff Group, a security firm that has worked with clients that manufacture advanced imaging devices. ""In order to be optimally effective, we can't have gaping holes that terrorists can exploit,"" Sweet said. In addition to the 700 scanners employed by the U.S., Canada has about 50, Australia is planning to install machines in July, and the technology is in use at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport and in the United Kingdom, according to Airports Council International. The council said there is no central repository tracking the use of the technology worldwide. A spokesman for the International Air Transport Association also was unaware of exact figures and locations of the machines but said it is not a common screening method outside the U.S. ""We're not suggesting that (advanced imaging) is the magic bullet. It's one of many layers of technology, processes and people needed for a multilayered defense,"" Sweet said. He said the U.S. should step up deployment of the technology and increase the use of behavioral detection officers and bomb-detecting dogs in airports as well as employ additional analysis of passenger data before travelers even arrive at the airport. Carrying on with that layered, risk-based approach to security is exactly what the Department of Homeland Security is doing in response to the latest threat, the agency said. ""These layers include threat and vulnerability analysis, prescreening and screening of passengers, using the best available technology, random searches at airports, federal air marshal coverage and additional security measures both seen and unseen,"" the agency said in a statement. The use of intelligence to head off threats before they reach the critical airport screening stage ""has been proven very successful in this instance,"" Ron said. ""On that level, I think we have already established a good foothold."" Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said it is too soon to say whether the latest plot will lead to more stringent security measures. ""I'm not sure we're there yet,"" he said. ""Preliminarily, many believe that you won't have to have anything different than we have right now. The systems in place would have detected this. That's the good news. The bad news is a lot of people don't like the systems in place at the TSA."" And those systems have been widely criticized by privacy advocates in the U.S. and abroad. In Europe, privacy concerns have long delayed implementation of body scanning technology. International airports with direct flights to the U.S. are required to meet International Civil Aviation Organization security standards and some TSA requirements, but the use of advanced imaging machines is at the discretion of each country. Even in the unlikely event of global adoption of body scanning, the technology has its limitations. The machines are not designed to detect explosive devices concealed inside the human body, and the Department of Homeland Security has identified some ""vulnerabilities"" in the screening process, according to a summary of classified advanced imaging testing published in November. The office made eight recommendations that the TSA agreed to as a result of the testing. Details of those recommendations are classified. In March 2010, the Government Accountability Office said that ""while officials said (advanced imaging technologies) performed as well as physical pat downs in operational tests, it remains unclear whether the AIT would have detected the weapon used in the December 2009 incident based on the preliminary information GAO has received,"" noting that the results of the TSA's testing are classified. No magic bullet, indeed. What remains clear is the need for a security strategy that evolves quickly, officials say. ""Every time we think we have them, they come up with something new,"" said Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Peter King, R-New York.","Body-scanning technology to detect threats not widely used abroad .

"Washington (CNN) -- Undercover government investigators were able to get into major U.S. seaports -- at one point driving a vehicle containing a simulated explosive -- by flashing counterfeit or fraudulently obtained port ""credentials"" to security officials -- raising serious questions about a program that has issued the cards to more than 1.6 million people, Congress disclosed Tuesday. At issue are Transportation Worker Identification Credentials, or TWIC cards, now needed by truckers, stevedores, longshoreman and others for unescorted access to the nation's ports. The Department of Homeland Security has long touted the cards as one of the most important layers in its multilayered system to protect ports from terrorists. But, in a highly critical report, the Government Accountability Office said Tuesday the program does not provide reasonable assurance that only qualified people get the credentials. In tests, GAO investigators got into ports using counterfeit TWICs or authentic TWICs acquired through fraudulent means, and by stating false reasons for needing access. ""This investigation raises a disturbing question: Are America's ports actually safer now than they were a decade ago?"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey. ""Not only were they able to access the port facilities, but they were able to drive a vehicle with a simulated explosive into a secure area,"" he said. An unclassified version of the report did not state how many tests were conducted, nor how many efforts were successful. But it said the tests were conducted at some of the nation's busiest seaports. The findings are significant because a TWIC card suggests that its holder is not a security threat and potentially eases access to thousands of facilities, including airports and military installations, the GAO said. Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole defended the TWIC system, saying 35,000 of the 1.8 million applicants failed criminal background checks. Under the program, those who fail background checks can request a waiver and be granted a TWIC. Ultimately, 1,158 applicants were denied cards because of their criminal histories or immigration status, the TSA said. In addition, several were disqualified because they were on terror watch lists. But the GAO said there are ways for unqualified individuals to acquire authentic TWICs, and said the TSA had not established internal controls to protect against abuse. Further, the TWIC program does not require that applicants claiming to be U.S.-born citizens or nationals to provide identity documents that prove citizenship, the GAO said. And controls are not in place to determine whether an applicant needs a TWIC, the GAO said. ""It seems to me that a decade of work has resulted in a system that would put Rube Goldberg to shame,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi. Said Lautenberg: ""Given the critical importance of our ports, it is unacceptable that we are spending hundreds of millions of tax dollars on a program that might actually be making ports less safe."" Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, said he is upset DHS has not approved a technology to read the credentials, meaning guards must visually examine the credentials. ""TWIC is turning into a dangerous and expensive experiment in security,"" he said in a statement. ""Nearly half a billion dollars has been spent since TSA was directed to issue biometric security cards to transportation workers,"" Mica said. ""Yet today, 10 years later and with no approved biometric reader, TWICs are at best no more useful than library cards."" Sen. John Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, said he plans to address legislation in the coming months for some of the shortcomings exposed by the GAO. ""The program needs stronger fraud controls,"" he said. ""We also need to take a clear, hard look at whether we are getting enough return on our investment. Is the money we're spending on TWIC being used wisely? Are there other security programs that would cost less but work as well as TWIC? These are questions we need answers to.""","Transportation security at risk, report says .

The U.S. Coast Guard said it opened fire on the roughly 200-foot trawler Thursday after it determined the ""unmanned, unlit, unmarked vessel"" posed a hazard to mariners and Alaska's marine environment. The Ryou-Un Maru caught fire and capsized in more than 6,000 feet of water about 180 miles southwest of the port city of Sitka, said Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley, a Coast Guard spokesman. It was a dramatic end for the Japanese squid trawler. It was bound for a scrap yard before becoming part of a giant debris field generated by a tsunami that struck the island nation following a 9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011. ""It's really one of the first significant pieces of tsunami debris to make its way across the Pacific Ocean,"" Mosley said. The ship drifted undetected until late last month when a Canadian coastal air patrol spotted it several hundred miles off the Queen Charlotte Islands, an archipelago on the north coast of British Columbia. It captured the imagination of the public, which followed the final days of ""the ghost ship"" in media reports and tracked its progress on Canadian and U.S. Coast Guard websites. ""I think it captured a lot of people because it survived. It was swept away by the tsunami. It's believed lost. It's forgotten about. And it spends an entire year at sea, a summer, a winter and it makes it all the way across the Pacific Ocean,"" Mosley said. The Japan coast guard identified the trawler and its owner after Canadian officials provided the identification number on the hull of the ship. It was moored at Hachinohe in the Aomori prefecture when the tsunami hit last year. The ship drifted into U.S. waters over the weekend, traveling about a mile per hour and making its way toward the rich fishing waters of the Gulf of Alaska, Mosley said. At that point, the U.S. Coast Guard determined it posed a threat to other ships navigating the area as well as a potential environment hazard, he said. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advised the Coast Guard where the ship's sinking would have the least environmental impact. ""The potential for a pollution incident is unknown at this time, but officials have limited concerns about any biological threats due to the length of time the vessel has been at sea,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Coast Guard has been continuously broadcasting the vessel's location to mariners. It will continue the warnings through Friday morning until it conducts an aerial survey to determine its sinking left behind no potentially hazardous debris, Mosley said. The trawler's planned sinking was temporarily halted Thursday morning when the Coast Guard ship, the Anacapa, based out of Petersburg, Alaska, arrived to find a Canadian ship inspecting the trawler. ""They wanted to claim the vessel for salvage,"" Mosley said. ""At that point, there was a meeting to discuss whether they had the means to tow or salvage the vessel,"" he said. ""They determined it would be too unsafe. At that point, they were asked to leave the area."" The Anacapa opened fire Thursday afternoon with its 25 mm cannons, blowing holes into the side of the Ryou-Un Maru, the Coast Guard said. It took more than four hours for the trawler to sink. CNN's Leslie Tripp, Tina Burnside, Jake Carpenter, Jack Maddox and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","The ship sunk in more than 6,000 feet of water, an official said .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Mary Bonsor graduated from law school in London last June and is now navigating her way around the labyrinth-like offices of Marval, O'Farrell & Mairal, Argentina's largest law firm. Bonsor, 24, is spending two months interning at the firm in Buenos Aires with hopes of learning more about Argentine law, while also honing her Spanish-speaking skills. ""It is very interesting to compare the English system to the Argentinean system. It's just great experience to see how another judicial system works,"" says Bonsor. Bonsor is one of a growing number of international graduates and students looking to Latin America for internship experience to bolster their resumes. They say they are being lured here by the regionÂ´s relatively strong and stable economies, low costs, and the chance to work alongside top business, scientific and creative minds. According to student travel company STA, the international internship market is the fastest growing trend in travel right now. Historically, cities like New York, London and Hong Kong were top choices for interns, but now Buenos Aires, Bogota and Santiago are seeing an influx. ""There's been an increase of interest in the region, and you see a lot of students...with a strong interest in visiting Latin America, and getting to know the culture,"" says Sebastian Iribarne, a partner at Marval, O'Farrell & Mairal. A new company called Intern Latin America (ILA) placed Bonsor in her Buenos Aires internship. ILA was founded this year with the aim of arranging internships for foreign students throughout the region. The company had immediate success with its first venture, when it received more than 100 applications for positions it had arranged with FIFA during the Under-20 World Cup. Ten students from Russia, Germany, the UK and U.S. worked during the three-week tournament in July and August in Medellin, Colombia. The idea for Intern Latin America came to British co-founder David Lloyd, 27, after he had a hard time securing an internship for himself while living in Buenos Aires in 2006. Other internship placement companies have been operating in the region for years, but Lloyd felt a comprehensive program with connections to blue-chip companies and competitive private-sector and government posts didn't exist. He quit his job on the trading floor at Merrill Lynch in London to pursue the initiative. ""I realized there was a lot of demand from the company side and a lot of demand from the student side, but for reasons of language difference and bureaucracy...there was no way for them to realize the mutual benefit,"" says Lloyd. Now the benefits are being recognized throughout the region. The government of Chile recently awarded Intern Latin America a $40,000 grant and office space in Santiago. Soon, ILA will be placing interns at businesses, hospitals and NGOs throughout Chile, something it has already done for more than 50 interns - from countries like China, India, Sweden and Switzerland -- in Argentina and Colombia. ILA next plans to concentrate on entering Brazil and Mexico, and have already launched an office in London, which will bring interns to the British capital. ""Internships abroad are a global phenomenon. In Latin America, the growth is mainly due to the fact that it's a region in rapid development and people want to experience that, and develop language skills,"" says Lloyd. Mary Bonsor is developing her Spanish with daily, two-hour intensive classes. She is confident her time in Argentina will serve her well when she returns home to join the workforce. ""Here it is very similar to how I will work back in England. It's a similar-sized law firm, and so it's just a great experience to try and learn as much as I can here,"" she says. Most internships are unpaid, and interns have to cover their own costs, however, more scholarships are becoming available. The LIV Fund is a new initiative that offers two $500 scholarships per month to international students looking to intern, study or volunteer in Latin America. ""We want to provide a structure to the living abroad experience so that potential participants can have more of an idea of what it will entail,"" says LIV Fund founder David Garrett. With the eurozone in crisis, ongoing economic woes in the U.S., political unrest in the Middle East and Brazil's growing importance, Latin America is looking to expand its role on the global stage. As a result, many are predicting that more and more anxious interns from across the globe will be arriving soon in Latin America. ""We don't want this to be only for the well-heeled and well-connected. We firmly believe that these opportunities should be open to any young person who wants to intern in Latin America. We're working to make that happen,"" says Lloyd.","International graduates and students look to Latin America for internship experience to bolster their resumes .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. spies ""can do little but shrug"" when commanders ask for the information they need to fight the Taliban insurgency, the top U.S. military intelligence officer in Afghanistan said in a blistering report. U.S. military intelligence officers in Afghanistan spend too much time focusing on enemy groups and tactics and not enough on trying to understand Afghanistan's culture, people and networks, Maj. Gen. Michael Flynn wrote in a report published Monday. American military intelligence gathering is ""ignorant of local economics and landowners, hazy about who the powerbrokers are and how they might be influenced, incurious about the correlations between various development projects and levels of cooperation among villagers, and disengaged from people in the best position to find answers,"" Flynn wrote . Click here to have your say on the damning intelligence report . His report comes out less than a week after seven CIA officers and a Jordanian intelligence agent were killed by a double agent who set off a suicide bomb inside their base in Afghanistan. But the report is about military intelligence gathering, not the CIA's work, one of Flynn's co-authors, Marine Capt. Matt Pottinger, told CNN. ""This is primarily about improving intelligence within the Department of Defense,"" he said via e-mail . ""Our timing was independent of the tragic event in Khost Province,"" he said, referring to the attack that killed the CIA officers. Flynn co-wrote the report with Pottinger and Paul Batchelor of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency for a Washington think tank, the Center for a New American Security. Flynn's boss, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, backs the report, a spokesman for U.S. forces there told CNN. ""We support this kind of activity. Gen. McChrystal is looking for ways to make things better,"" Adm. Greg Smith said. But Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said it is ""a bit irregular"" that a report of this kind would come out through a think tank. ""I think it struck everybody a bit curious,"" he said. ""My sense is this was an anomaly and we won't see it again."" He said he was not sure Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had seen the report, though he had been provided with a copy on the day of publication. ""The most I will say is that it was an unusual and irregular way to publish a document,"" Whitman said. The report said some good work is being done on the ground, and that local intelligence officers ""know a great deal about their local Afghan districts."" But, the report said, they ""are generally too understaffed to gather, store, disseminate and digest"" information. And, critically, they do not have the resources to gather information which could give Americans a better understanding of Afghanistan, such as census data, patrol debriefs, minutes from councils with local farmers and tribal leaders, polling data, translated summaries of radio broadcasts that influence local farmers and the like. ""This vast and underappreciated body of information.... provides... a map for leveraging popular support and marginalizing the insurgency itself,"" Flynn and his colleagues argue. As a result, ""U.S. intelligence officers and analysts can do little but shrug in response to high level decision-makers seeking the knowledge, analysis and information they need to wage a successful counterinsurgency,"" they say. The report claims they cannot answer basic questions unrelated to the military fight against the Taliban, such as: ""Is that desert road we're thinking of paving really the most heavily trafficked route? Which mosques and bazaars attract the most people from week to week? Is that local contractor actually implementing the irrigation project we paid him to put into service?"" CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Pam Benson and Mike Mount contributed to this report .","Spies focus on enemy groups, not on learning Afghanistan's culture, intel officer says .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Spain and the United States have busted an international drug money-laundering ring and seized buildings, cars and cash valued at more than $140 million, the Spanish National Police said Monday. More than 20 people were arrested -- 17 in Spain and 4 in the United States -- during the operation, more than two years in the making. Authorities accuse those arrested with participating in a drug money-laundering ring that spanned three continents. As U.S. authorities tell it, cocaine was smuggled in multihundred-kilogram quantities from Colombia to Spain, where it was processed and sold. The proceeds were then sent to a man, identified by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida as Alvaro Lopez Tardon, who would allegedly launder the money with the help of at least two co-conspirators. Tardon is thought to have received more than $26 million in drug proceeds from Spain between 2004 and the present, the attorney's office said in a statement. He is accused of working with his brother, Artemio Lopez Tardon, who reportedly lives in Spain. Among the group's favorite ways to launder money was through the purchase and sale of real estate and luxury cars, authorities said. They seized 21 properties in Spain, four in the United States and 60 cars, including one thought to be worth more than $2.8 million. Spanish police said they also seized some $35 million in cash, kept in 50- and 100-euro bills, in Madrid. ""From the beaches of Miami to the shores of Spain, the fight against crime has no boundaries,"" said Special Agent in Charge John V. Gillies of the FBI Miami Division in a statement. ""This is another outstanding example of an international partnership, this time with the Spanish National Police, that disrupted a major drug organization."" CNN's Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","More than 20 people are arrested; 17 in Spain and 4 in the United States .

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of shooting two students at a Littleton, Colorado, middle school was identified as 32-year-old Bruco Strongeagle Eastwood, authorities said Wednesday. Eastwood was arrested after the incident Tuesday at Deer Creek Middle School and is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday morning, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. He is facing two counts of attempted first-degree murder, the sheriff's office said. He is accused of shooting two students as classes were letting out at 3:15 p.m. Tuesday. David Benke, a 6-foot-5 former college basketball player who is a math teacher and track coach, tackled the suspected gunman as he was preparing to fire again, CNN affiliate KMGH reported. ""[The shooter] was trying to rack another round,"" Benke told the station. ""I knew he couldn't get another round in before I got to him, so I grabbed him."" A parent who saw the incident told KMGH that the gunman kept mumbling, ""I'm fighting for freedom. I'm fighting for freedom,"" as he was being subdued. The students, a boy and a girl, were taken to Littleton Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, a sheriff's office spokeswoman said. Tuesday's shooting occurred in the same area as one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, the 1999 killing of 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School. The two gunmen in that incident, both Columbine students, then turned their guns on themselves.

"(CNN) -- A police officer and two civilians subdued an armed man who drove to a California probation office with 11 crude bombs, 70 loaded magazines and more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, police said. Michael Solano, 54, went to a California probation office with bombs and other weapons, police said. The man, Michael Solano, 54, of Sacramento, was out of jail on bail for a July 18 incident in which police said an explosive device was found in his vehicle at the probation office. ""This guy was ready for war,"" Yreka Police Chief Brian Bowles said in a written statement. ""We were very lucky this guy was stopped and nobody was killed yesterday."" The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon, when people saw Solano acting suspiciously near the Siskiyou County Probation Department and called police, Bowles said. Solano aimed a gun at an officer, police said. Two civilians then jumped into the fray and, with the officer, subdued Solano and wrestled the gun away, police said. During the scuffle, Solano repeated that he wanted to be killed and reached for the officer's gun and Taser stun gun, Bowles said. Solano was handcuffed and searched. Police found a pipe bomb in his shoe, Bowles said. A neighborhood near the probation office was evacuated after Solano told police that he had 10 bombs in his car parked nearby, authorities said. The bombs were ""fragmentation grenades,"" loaded with nails and BBs, Bowles said. In all, police discovered 70 loaded magazines, more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, one stolen pistol and two assault weapons. They also found in Solano's car three other weapons, including one with a silencer, surveillance equipment, a tactical vest and clothing with face masks, Bowles said. Solano was jailed in lieu of $2 million bail, police said. He was charged with possession of a destruction device, transportation of a destruction device and resisting police officer by force, attempting to take an officer's firearm and assault with a firearm on a peace officer.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the last two months, eight people in Cambodia have died from bird flu, a rare but deadly disease causing concern among health authorities. Six of the victims have been children. The H5N1 virus, known to be highly contagious to poultry, typically resembles the flu when contracted by humans. But it kills more than half the people it infects, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the nine confirmed H5N1 cases in Cambodia this year, only an 8-month old infant has survived. The infant had received medical attention early, said Dr. Ly Sovann, the Ministry of Health's deputy director for communicable diseases control in Cambodia. The eight bird flu deaths in the last six weeks -- considering that Cambodia has had 19 reported deaths from the disease in the last 10 years -- has sparked increased surveillance efforts. Health officials are warning people to wash their hands often, to keep children away from poultry and to avoid eating sick poultry. So far, the nine cases are not believed to be related, although most of them came from the southern region. Bird flu research resumes, but not in U.S. The eight H5N1 deaths in Cambodia occurred with a 15-year-old girl and a 35-year-old man on January 21, and a 2-year-old girl and a 9-year-old girl on January 28. In the next month, a 5-year-old died on Feburary 7, a 3-year-old girl died on February 13, a 2-year-old boy died on February 19, followed by a death of a 35-year-old man on Monday. He came from the Kampong Cham province in central Cambodia and died after developing fever, coughing and difficulty breathing earlier this month. The patients experienced symptoms such as coughing, fever, difficulty breathing, sleepiness and vomiting. Bird flu does not usually pass from person-to-person, but the disease is closely monitored because of concerns that the H5N1 virus could mutate allowing to spread more easily among people. ""We conducted investigations and found that all the cases were transmission from the poultry,"" said Sovann. ""There is no evidence of transmission from human to human at this stage."" All nine patients are believed to have been exposed to sick or dead poultry, according to health authroties. H5N1 typically spreads between birds, but can jump to humans, especially if they're living in close proximity. The greatest risk of exposure to the virus is through the handling and slaughter of infected poultry. ""Home slaughtering and preparation of sick or dead poultry for food is hazardous: this practice must stop,"" said Dr. H.E. Mam Bunheng, the Cambodian minister of health, in a statement. ""Children also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks."" Health teams are carrying out ""enhanced surveillance"" in the villages and communities where bird flu cases have been reported, according to the World Health Organization. Officials are also telling people with flu-like symptoms who have difficulty breathing to seek medical attention immediately. The disease is transmitted through the infected bird's saliva, nasal secretions or feces. It can spread in markets or places where eggs and birds are sold in crowded conditions. The recent cases prompted China to announce temperature checks on people traveling back from Cambodia, according to the country's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. China had two deaths from bird flu this year. The patients, a 31-year-old man and 21-year-old woman died in mid-February in the southwestern area of the country. Both had close contact with birds, according to Xinhua, the Chinese news agency. The only other country with a confirmed H5N1 case this year was Egypt, where a 36-year-old woman died in late January.

"(CNN) -- Bria Hunter tried to lie her way out of a meeting of the ""Red Dawg Order,"" a club within the famed Marching 100 Band at Florida A&M University. For her deceit, according to police, the clarinet player was allegedly struck more than 20 times. And for failing to memorize and properly cite information about the clique? That, according to a probable cause affidavit, resulted in a metal ruler across Hunter's leg. The cumulative injuries to her legs, according to police, landed Hunter in the hospital several days later with blood clots, deep bone bruising and a cracked femur. Getting into the ""Clones,"" another group within the Marching 100, apparently didn't come without pain, either. Ivery Luckey estimated he was struck nearly 300 times, mostly ""hard licks"" at an initiation. Of the 25 to 30 people present, most were females, and several used wooden paddles on Luckey, according to a Tallahassee police report. Luckey ended up in the hospital and had full renal failure, he said. The hazing-related death of band member Robert Champion has brought renewed public scrutiny to a practice that has gone on for years. The Hunter and Luckey cases, 13 years apart, have shed light on the types of hazing some have allegedly faced as they've tried to be a part of perhaps the most famous marching band in the land. Tuesday, three band members accused of hazing Hunter appeared in a Tallahassee courtroom. Attorney B.J. Bernstein said that Hunter, 18, who attended high school in metro Atlanta, is leaving FAMU. ""Bria was very brave -- she notified the school, she notified the police,"" Bernstein said. Just weeks before he died in what authorities say was a hazing-related incident, drum major Champion gave her some advice, Hunter said. She did not follow it. ""He would always tell me, like, don't let people do it to you,"" Hunter, 18, told CNN affiliate WFTV in late November. When asked why she participated in the hazing, Hunter answered, ""So we can be accepted. If you don't do anything, then it's like you're lame."" Champion, 26, who also attended Southwest DeKalb High School in Decatur, Georgia, died after a November 19 football game that included a halftime performance. The band returned to its Orlando hotel following the game. The drum major ""reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe,"" authorities said in a release. Champion was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No cause of death has been released. After Champion's death, some band members told CNN it may have been the result of a rite of passage called ""crossing Bus C"" -- the bus Champion was on after a game the night he died. One band member, who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, explained, ""You have to walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backwards while the bus is full of other band members and you get beaten until you get to the back."" When asked what the point is, the band member answered, ""for respect."" FAMU's board of trustees voted last week to reprimand its president in the wake of Champion's death, and the band's director has been placed on administrative leave while state police investigate. School spokeswoman Sharon Saunders on Tuesday issued a statement saying the university's ""board of trustees and President (James) Ammons hope that through these arrests, all involved in perpetuating this culture will really begin to view hazing as a serious matter."" FAMU has an anti-hazing policy. But B.J. Bernstein, Hunter's attorney, said FAMU should be held accountable for hazing behavior, even if off-campus. She called the practice an ""open secret."" ""Young people may call themselves the Red Dawgs, but any adult would know this is nothing more than a gang, with a form of initiation which essentially is a beat-down,"" Bernstein told reporters. Bernstein indicated her client most likely will file suit against FAMU. The student is giving up a four-year, $82,000 scholarship, said Bernstein. ""For any person who's a subject of hazing or a victim, this is a huge issue of why they don't come forward,"" the attorney told reporters Tuesday afternoon. ""We're talking about young people whose entire education hangs on the fact that the school is giving them a full scholarship to be part of one of what was considered to be the greatest band in the United States."" The Tallahassee Police probable cause affidavit said the three young men accused of hazing Hunter are members of the Red Dawgs clique. Sean Hobson, 23, Aaron Golson, 19, and James Harris, 22 -- are charged with hazing, a crime under Florida law. Hobson and Golson are charged with felony battery as well. WFTV : Band members arrested; 2 to fight hazing charges . The three appeared in court Tuesday, where they were ordered to have no contact with Hunter or with each other. Golson's attorney told CNN that there are inconsistencies in the probable cause affidavit. ""We feel the allegations against him are for the most part unfounded,"" said attorney Craig J. Brown. ""His stance is he was not hazed and would not do it to anyone else,"" said Brown, indicating his client will waive arraignment and plead not guilty. The affidavit says Hobson ""denied all physical abuse allegations towards Hunter or any other pledge."" It also quotes a text message authorities say Hobson sent to multiple people, including Hunter, that read, ""I apologize for the hurt I put you through. I apologize for the mental and physical strain that you have endured."" But, the affidavit says, Hobson denied sending Hunter any such message. The affidavit says Harris ""denied ever witnessing Hunter be struck during any kind of initiation meeting."" An attorney representing Harris did not return a message left Tuesday by CNN. The clerk's office did not have an attorney of record for Hobson. According to the affidavit, Hunter on October 31 falsely told Hobson that she could not attend an off-campus meeting because she had a meeting of her band section. ""For the deceit, Hunter stated that she was lined up with approximately 11 other pledges with her being at the front,"" the affidavit recounts. She said she was ordered to lift her legs up while standing, as if she was about to march, and was struck by Hobson and Golson, who were using their balled up fists ""to punch her on the top of the thighs."" After she was hit more than 20 times in the legs, Harris intervened and told Hobson and Golson to stop, the affidavit says. Three witnesses corroborated Hunter's account, and also said they were hit on the back of the head and neck, the affidavit says. On November 1, at another meeting, Hunter and other pledges were beaten again, she told investigators. She said Hobson used a metal ruler across the top of her thighs. ""Accountability and responsibility is a critical part for any student who's a part of this,"" Bernstein said. ""But even more so, Florida A&M has to change."" Incidents of hazing have followed the FAMU band for years. In 2001, a student was paddled so badly he had to be hospitalized for kidney failure, and just weeks before Champion's death, band director Julian White suspended 26 members for alleged hazing. In 1998, a Tallahassee Police Department report described Ivery Luckey as being ""severely beaten."" He and two other students were to be initiated. CNN Atlanta affiliate WXIA reported that Luckey filed a lawsuit against the Florida Board of Regents and reached a $50,000 settlement in 2004. ""Back then, you could be the best player on the field, but if you did not cross over in your section, there's no way you're marching at a game,"" Luckey told WXIA a few weeks ago. ""The hazing consisted of the group taking turns paddling each of the three continuously,"" the police report said. Luckey, a member of the clarinet section, estimated he was struck nearly 300 times at the off-campus initiation. Luckey told officers people in the group would hold him down when he tried to get up. ""He stated that mostly girls did all of the paddling and there were numerous slaps to his face."" At one point he decided the beating was too severe and started to leave, but members convinced him that it was nearly over and he should finish. The next day he was ill, and two days after the beating he was admitted to the hospital for severe bruising to his buttocks. The report said it ""was apparent that he was in fear of future violence as a result of pressing charges."" Bernstein said students who make complaints face pressure. Her client, she said, was crying and emotional before taking a final exam Tuesday. ""She experienced ridicule,"" the lawyer said of Hunter. ""My understanding is some people already tweeting that it's a lie don't believe her. But there is no lie in what happened."" CNN's George Howell, Jason Carroll, Melanie Whitley and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","Attorney for one suspect said ""inconsistencies""in account favor his client .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Authorities in North Carolina ordered the evacuation of Ocracoke Island late on Tuesday as Hurricane Earl whips closer to the United States. The mandatory order, which was issued for all visitors and residents of Ocracoke, goes into effect at 5 a.m. on Wednesday, said Lindsey Mooney, interim emergency management coordinator with Hyde County Emergency Management. He added thousands of people would likely be affected by the decision. Hurricane Earl is approaching the United States just ahead of Labor Day, a holiday weekend that many families spend at the beach. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for most of the North Carolina coast, from Surf City, North Carolina, to the state's northern border with Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. It called Hurricane Earl ""large and intense."" Earl, which quickly morphed into a Category 4 hurricane on Monday, dealt a glancing blow to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, downing trees and knocking out power lines. Tuesday, the hurricane was passing the Turks and Caicos. Earl will approach within 60 miles of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, early Friday morning, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Hurricane-force winds will be possible along the Outer Banks of North Carolina beginning early on Friday morning and lasting until at least midday, he said. Morris forecast Earl will pass within 60 miles of Nantucket, Massachusetts, as a strong Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane overnight Friday. However, sustained hurricane-force winds should not affect coastal Massachusetts as the majority of winds will be tropical-storm force beginning Friday afternoon and lasting until midday on Saturday, he said. As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Earl was about 125 miles (235 kilometers) east-northeast of Grand Turk Island and about 835 miles (1,545 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was heading northwest at about 14 mph (22 kph). The hurricane's core was ""passing well east of the Turks and Caicos Islands,"" the hurricane center said. ""Tropical storm conditions are probably affecting the vicinity of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Weather conditions will likely improve in these islands on Wednesday."" Earl's maximum sustained winds are at 135 mph (215 kph). It is a large storm, with hurricane-force winds stretching 90 miles (150 km) from its center and tropical storm-force winds extending outward some 200 miles (325 kilometers). ""Some fluctuations in intensity are likely, but Earl is forecast to retain Category 4 status for the next day or two,"" the hurricane center said. The U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, has ordered ships in its area to prepare to head to sea within 24 hours if conditions worsen, according to Beth Baker, a spokeswoman for the Navy. A separate order will be given if it's decided that various Naval aircraft in the region need to be moved, she said. The Navy also issued on Tuesday a ""Hurricane Condition 4,"" which tells people living and working around the Norfolk area to be prepared for ""destructive winds"" within 72 hours and to take the proper precautions. A FEMA team is already in North Carolina to provide support if necessary, Craig Fugate, Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, told reporters on a conference call. Additional teams have been designated for each state on the coast if needed. He urged those living in the region to prepare for the storm, stock up on supplies and have a plan if it becomes necessary. Besides FEMA's Ready.gov website, people can use FEMA's mobile application, which links to the National Hurricane Center, to stay up to date on information. Tips include developing a family communications plan, putting together a kit with 72 hours of food and water and staying informed of risks in the area. FEMA officials urged residents to heed any evacuation orders that their state and local governments might make. The federal group stressed it does not make evacuation decisions. Even without making landfall, hurricanes can trigger dangerous rip currents -- a narrow channel of water that flows seaward from beaches. The currents can be strong enough to carry even experienced swimmers into deeper water. On Tuesday, a National Weather Service coastal advisory was in effect for the eastern coast of Florida, mostly due to Earl's presence in the Caribbean. The advisory warned that dangerous rip currents and rough surf are possible. ""Dozens of rescues along with one surf-related fatality were reported over the past few days in very hazardous ocean conditions,"" the advisory said. Over the weekend, hundreds of rescues took place in Maryland and elsewhere because of rip currents spawned by then-Hurricane Danielle, which stayed well offshore. Danielle has since lost its tropical characteristics and moved out into the open Atlantic. A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, and a tropical storm watch was in effect for the southeastern Bahamas. Those areas could experience above-normal tides, along with ""large and dangerous battering waves"" on Tuesday, forecasters said. A tropical storm watch is also in effect for the North Carolina coast between Cape Fear, North Carolina and Surf City, North Carolina, the hurricane center said. Earl could dump between 1 and 3 inches of rain on the Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas, with up to 6 inches possible in some areas, the hurricane center said. But forecasters said conditions on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, including gusty winds, were expected to improve as Earl departed, and storm surge flooding and waves will diminish. ""We were quite fortunate because there was no direct hit in this case,"" Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno told CNN's ""American Morning."" But, he said, the island experienced ""lots of rain"" and some high winds. As of Tuesday morning, 174,000 customers were without power, he said, and 33,000 lacked water service. ""There are some roads that are blocked because trees have fallen,"" Fortuno said. ""Those are being removed as we speak, and hopefully we'll be able to get back to normal during the course of the day and tomorrow will be a regular working day."" Tito Hernandez, FEMA federal coordinating official, told reporters Tuesday that close to 200,000 were without power on Puerto Rico, and officials were focusing on restoration. About 160 people spent Monday night in 18 shelters on the island, he said, and 57 people took refuge in four shelters in the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, both locations ""fared very well,"" Hernandez said. Schools were expected to reopen Wednesday, he said. Transportation from Puerto Rico to the outlying islands of Culebra and Vieques had resumed, and ports in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were reopening Tuesday. A CNN iReport showed sheets of torrential rain on Puerto Rico, along with gusty winds. Other iReports showed downed trees and flooding on Montserrat and St. John in the Virgin Islands. Residents were being asked to stay home so that downed trees and power lines could be removed, Fortuno said. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands could see an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain as Earl pulls away, the Hurricane Center said on Tuesday. Another storm could be poised to deliver a one-two punch to Puerto Rico and other areas of the Caribbean. Tropical Storm Fiona developed on Monday and appeared to be following in Earl's footsteps. It remained a weak tropical storm as of Tuesday, the Hurricane Center said. However, it was enough to prompt a tropical storm warning for St. Martin and St. Barthelemy and a tropical storm watch for Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius. A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph, are forecast within 36 hours. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours. Read said Fiona is not projected to affect Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but could affect Bermuda by the weekend. ""Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor the progress of Fiona,"" forecasters said. ""Additional watches or warnings may be required for a portion of the area."" As of 8 p.m., the center of Fiona was located about 300 miles (485 kilometers) east-southeast of the Leeward Islands. It had winds of about 40 mph (65 kph) and was moving west-northwest at about 24 mph (39 kph). Some slow strengthening is possible over the next day or two, forecasters said. ""We are following what the National Weather Service is telling us"" on Fiona, Fortuno told CNN. ""They're telling us that it is not as organized as Earl. However, it could bring about some rain, and that's what concerns me. So we'll just keep a very close eye on it and see what happens."" CNN's Angela Fritz and Sean C. Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities order the evacuation of Ocracoke Island .

"New York (CNN) -- Donald Trump's offer to buy the lower Manhattan site where a Muslim group plans to build an Islamic community center is just a ""pathetic"" attempt to get publicity, said the lawyer for one of the land owners. Real estate mogul Trump made the offer Thursday in a letter to Hisham Elzanaty, an investor in the controversial Islamic center site. But Elzanaty does not consider Trump's proposal a real offer, attorney Wolodymyr Starosolsky said Thursday night. Elzanaty has received other offers, but has declined them, the lawyer said. Elzanaty thinks the property might be worth more down the road, so he might hold on to it. Trump had offered 25 percent more than the current owners paid for it. Elzanaty owns more than 51 percent of the property, and has no more than three partners, the lawyer said. Should the proposed Islamic center be built? Share your thoughts . Trump's offer stipulated that, if a mosque is to be built, it will be located at least five blocks further from the World Trade Center site. He also said he would pay cash for the site, with an immediate closing. The site is two blocks from where the World Trade Center stood before the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""I am making this offer as a resident of New York and citizen of the United States, not because I think the location is a spectacular one (because it is not), but because it will end a very serious, inflammatory and highly divisive situation that is destined, in my opinion, to only get worse,"" Trump wrote. ""Hopefully, something good can happen!"" he concluded. Trump, who starred in the U.S. reality TV show ""The Apprentice,"" has invested in New York real estate for decades. His management company, The Trump Group, owns a number of high-rises in Manhattan and operates casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, as well as several golf courses. The proposed Islamic center, known as Park51, is slated to include a variety of facilities, including a prayer room, a performing arts center, gym, a swimming pool and other public spaces. Critics of the center say it is an affront to survivors of the September 11 attacks. Supporters of the project, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, cite First Amendment rights and the need to express religious tolerance. CNN's Marcia Biggs and Ben Rooney contributed to this report.","The majority land owner didn't consider Trump's proposal a real offer, lawyer says .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese prosecutors have indicted two American sailors on charges that they raped a Japanese woman on the island of Okinawa last month, a case that has deepened tensions between local residents and the U.S. military. The arrest of the two suspects prompted outraged reactions from Japanese officials and resulted in the imposition of a curfew by the U.S. military on its troops in Japan. The two suspects, both from a base in Fort Worth, Texas, were indicted by Naha District Court on Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement from the public affairs office of the U.S. Commander, Naval Forces Japan. They were arrested last month on Okinawa, which lies south of the main Japanese islands, on allegations that they raped a woman in the early hours of October 16, leaving her with an injury to her neck. They were staying at a U.S. Air Force base on Okinawa while in transit. According to the Navy statement, Aviation Electrician's Mate Skyler Dozierwalker faces a charge of rape by group resulting in injury, and Aviation Machinist's Mate Airman Christopher Browning faces a charge of rape by group resulting in injury, as well as a charge of robbery. Both men are 23 years old. The Okinawa prosecutors' office declined to disclose information about the indictment by telephone and didn't provide a statement. The issue of violent crimes by U.S. troops in Japan has divided the two countries for decades. It came to a peak in 1995 when a U.S. sailor and two U.S. Marines were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl. Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time demanding that the United States leave the island. Relations between the U.S. military and the people of Okinawa have also been strained in recent months over the U.S. Marine Corps' deployment of MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft to a base on the island. Some Okinawa residents are concerned because the Osprey has had a reputation for crashing. The Okinawan community has long been against the presence of the U.S. military, which recently announced that thousands of Marines will be moved to a base in Guam. The rape charges against the two U.S. sailors come just months after a U.S. Marine was arrested over accusations he assaulted and molested a woman in Naha, the capital of Okinawa. And the situation was compounded last week by allegations that a U.S. airman broke into a family's home on the island and assaulted a teenage boy before jumping off a third-floor balcony. Okinawa police are investigating the incident, which appears to have taken place during the hours when the U.S. military curfew is supposed to be in effect.","Two suspects are accused of raping a Japanese woman and injuring her neck .

"(CNN) -- Two music faculty members at Florida A&M University have been placed on administrative leave due to hazing allegations related to the marching band, university officials said. The university investigation follows the high-profile suspected hazing death of FAMU band member Robert Champion in November, but the cases are unrelated. Faculty members Diron T. Holloway and Anthony E. Simons III were placed on leave effective Wednesday because of ""allegations of misconduct and/or incompetence involving reports and allegations of hazing within the Department of Music and the Marching '100,'"" according to the university. The Marching 100 is the university's nationally recognized band. Holloway is an associate professor and director of clarinets and saxophones, and Simons is an assistant professor for euphonium and tuba. The pair will receive pay while on leave, the university said. The university did not disclose details of the investigation, but said the hazing allegations stem from an off-campus incident in 2010. Tallahassee police conducted a separate investigation into the allegations against Holloway and Simons, but the case was closed last week after the state of Florida decided it would not pursue criminal charges because it could not prove that hazing occurred and because the statute of limitations likely expired. The police report, however, sheds some light on the allegations and the difficulty authorities face when investigating such incidents. Many students police sought as witnesses refused to cooperate or retained lawyers. According to the police report, the incident happened sometime in the spring of 2010, but was not reported to FAMU police until November 2011, and did not reach Tallahassee police until January of this year. In the wake of Champion's death, a band student and member of the Kappa Kappa Psi fraternity confided in a professor that he was involved in a hazing incident at Holloway's home. The professor informed band director Julian White, who went to police. The student told police that the pledges at Holloway's house were hit on their bodies and necks, and that they were paddled with ""a very thick piece of wood."" He offered details and said he suffered bruising on his buttocks from the paddling, but told police that he had no desire to press charges. ""He stated he wanted to be there and go through the ritual so he could become a Kappa Kappa Psi member,"" the police report says. The student told the police this over the phone. When the authorities tried to set up an in-person interview, the student's mother called to protest, saying her son would not give a statement. When police reached out to other potential witnesses who were there the day of the alleged hazing, the response that often came back was that they couldn't remember the incident or would have to contact a lawyer before speaking. According to the police report, some of the witnesses relented and spoke with police, but only after subpoenas were issued. The students offered conflicting accounts in which some admitted there was some hitting, but no blows that caused injury. Some said Holloway was present during the hitting, and others said he was not. Some witnesses said Simons was also at the house. No one admitted to having witnessed paddling. Holloway himself was questioned by police, and said he told the fraternity members not to hit ""in the face and don't paddle."" However, according to the police report, he said paddling may have happened outside or in the garage. He denied that he did anything resulting in bodily harm, but said, ""It's possible to say that I did do something under the circumstances... maybe I did do something."" According to FAMU President James H. Ammons, once the university's investigation is complete, it ""will take appropriate action against faculty members or students, up to and including dismissals.""","NEW: Police report describes difficulty in investigating hazing allegations .

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke has called for unity between football's governing body and local organizers as the countdown to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil continues, following tensions over preparations for the tournament. Valcke was in Rio to mark 100 days to go until the Confederations Cup, an event which serves as a test run ahead of football's four-yearly showpiece event. During his tour of the country, Valcke was accompanied by organizing committee members Bebeto and Ronaldo, two former Brazilian national team stars who tasted World Cup victory. Romario, a teammate of Bebeto's during Brazil's 1994 triumph, was named President of the Brazilian Tourism & Sports Commission on Wednesday. The former striker has been a firm a critic of Valcke in the past after the Frenchman condemned Brazil's World Cup preparations. The criticism led to calls for Valcke to be removed from proceedings, but he insists the situation has been resolved. ""I just wish him all the best,"" Valcke told CNN. ""I hope in his position he will support (us). ""I know that sometimes he has hard words on FIFA, on the World Cup, on different people, but at least I hope that he will support and is supporting the World Cup as a sporting event."" The South American country's preparations for its second World Cup -- and first in more than 60 years -- have been beset by problems. Brazilian Football Federation president Ricardo Teixeira stood down in March 2012 amid allegations of corruption, while concerns have been raised over whether stadia will be ready on time. Particular scrutiny is being paid to the construction of the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the final the last time Brazil staged the World Cup in 1950 and is due to reopen with a match against England on June 2. The eight-nation Confederations Cup, which pits continental champions against each other, will be held in the cities of Rio, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Brasilia, Fortaleza and Salvador from June 15-30. ""It's like when you're expecting a baby to come,"" Valcke told CNN. ""It is 100 days so you are a bit more nervous than you are at the beginning of the process. ""The Confederations Cup is not the same event as the World Cup. The World Cup is a bigger event than the Confederations Cup. What we have to agree and what we have to make sure of is ... we have more than enough time to test the stadium, to use the stadium, and to have a stadium ready for the Confederations Cup. ""It's very tight, that's a point -- 100 days is nothing."" Next year's World Cup marks the start of a landmark couple of years for Brazilian sport, with Rio hosting the 2016 Olympic Games.","Jerome Valcke says there is enough time for Brazil to prepare for Confederations Cup .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Obsessed fans can be a downside of stardom. It's why Whitney Houston's character hired Kevin Costner to protect her in the 1992 movie ""The Bodyguard."" The real life Houston had the FBI helping to protect her more than two decades ago when a ""loner"" in Vermont warned in 1988 that he ""might hurt someone with some crazy idea"" if the singer did not acknowledge him. Then there was the man in Holland who claimed to be the ""President of Europe."" An FBI agent based in Brussels paid him a visit in 1999 to talk about the cassette recordings and letters ""of a threatening nature"" that he sent to Houston. The FBI also investigated someone who demanded $250,000 or else they would reveal ""intimate details regarding Whitney Houston's romantic relationships"" just months after her marriage to singer Bobby Brown. None of these cases led to criminal charges, but the FBI posted online Monday the crazed fans letters and details of other investigations to protect Houston. Bobbi Kristina not happy with grandmother's book . Times have changed and fans are more likely to send tweets or post on Facebook than send letters, but these decades-old FBI files still reveal why they are called ""fanatics."" ""But because I have gotten that desperate and mad and would come up with ideas that that it scares me that I might come up with some crazy or stupid or really dumb idea that might be as bad as that or even worse than that,"" a 28-year-old Vermont man wrote. ""I might hurt someone with some crazy idea and not realize how stupid an idea it is until after I have done it. That really scares me."" This is from a letter sent to an associate of Houston by a man pleading for some acknowledgement that the singer knew he existed. HIs first 66 letters to Houston and 10 to her family and friends were unanswered. ""I am desperate to get some sort of response,"" he wrote. But this one got the attention of federal investigators. This man, whose named was blacked out from the documents, wrote that he fell in love with Houston in March 1986 -- the same month she released ""The Greatest Love of All."" ""When I first fell in love with Miss Whitney I tried to ignore what I felt toward her,"" he said in one handwritten letter postmarked in Burlington, Vermont. ""After 5 months I had to do something and so I started writing letters. I have tried to stop writing the letters and to give up twice but after a few weeks I had to start writing again. I just have to keep trying."" Although the FBI initially characterized it as an extortion investigation, the man was only asking to know ""if Miss Whitney has ever even seen one of my letters."" ""Can you help me. Can you call me and talk to me or in some way way find out from Miss Whitney if she is getting my letters or not and let me know."" He described himself as ""sort of a loner"" who liked children and small animals. ""Sometimes I will just sit and watch children playing or I will watch birds or squirrels as they hunt for food."" In his letters to Houston, he called her ""a beautiful lady and a beautiful person."" Remembering Whitney: An industry reflects . ""I really and truly am in love with you. Please believe in life and love and trust in yourself, and in your friends and trust in god. Miss, Whitney, you are a special person and a wonderful gift. Please keep singing and helping people to be happy, but most of all, Miss Whitney, Please Keep Smiling."" He wrote that he had been to nine of her concerts ""and have tried to give her flowers twice at the concerts. Miss Whitney is the first lady that I have ever given flowers to."" ""I just can't stop thinking about you,"" he wrote. ""Many times when I think of you I will start to shake. Please, Please give me a chance,"" This fan's stomach turned one day when he saw a tabloid headline suggesting Houston was secretly married, he wrote. ""I saw a headline for an article in one of those things in the supermarket saying that you were married allready. I am sure they made it up, but I allmost broke down right then and there and I have still been sick for the last several days."" But it wasn't all love talk. The man, who the FBI said was a U.S. Army veteran, talked politics. In one letter he said he wanted to raise taxes on the rich, cut taxes for anyone who does't make enough money ""to live at an acceptable level"" and give them free health care. He was also for a balanced federal budget. ""I believe that even if the rich people of this nation paid very high rates on their upper levels of income that they would still live better than over 99% of the people on this planet,"" he wrote to Houston. He worried his political views might keep her from loving him back. ""You might not think much of a guy who wants you to send most of your money to the federal government. I hope that you do not hold that against me but I will understand if you do."" After the 79th letter to Houston -- and 16 to her family, friends and business associates -- an FBI agent knocked on the door of his ""small, cluttered one-room apartment,"" the FBI files said. He explained that he would never do physical harm to anyone, but his letter's reference to doing something ""crazy or stupid or really dumb"" meant the possibility that he would go on TV's ""The Phil Donahue Show"" to talk about his love for Houston. But, ""He believed this 'crazy idea' would have hurt Houston's reputation, so he decided not to follow through with it,"" an FB agent wrote. Clive Davis: Party after Whitney Houston died 'no brainer' The FBI concluded the fan had broken no laws and the case was closed. The Dutch fan investigated by the FBI also insisted he never intended to threatened Houston. The cassette recordings he sent were songs he'd written for the singer. He told the agent he was the ""President of Europe"" and had purchased Brazil for $66 billion. He also claimed credit for the fall of the former South African government and for the election of Nelson Mandela in South Africa. The man, who worked at a plant nursery in the Netherlands, promised not to send any more, the agent wrote. Another FBI investigation centered on Houston's allegation that someone she knew was extorting her by threatening to ""reveal certain details of her private life"" to tabloids unless she paid $250,000 in November 1992. The unidentified person claimed to have ""knowledge of intimate details regarding Whitney Houston's romantic relationships,"" an FBI report said. Houston, in a December 1992 interview by the FBI, said she didn't know what the person might know, but the singer did talk about personal matters with the person, the heavily-redacted report said. A letter sent to Houston's father by a lawyer for the person warned that they had ""already turned down several offers... which are in the six figures range"" for the story. ""Therefore, we would expect a similar offer from you with respect to the sale of... exclusive rights."" Her client ""has suffered emotional stress"" from her dealing with Houston and may sue, the lawyer said. ""The fall-out will undoubtedly be negative,"" the lawyer warned Houston's father. Instead of meeting a November 23, 1992, deadline to pay, Houston's father called the FBI. The FBI and U.S. attorney decided no laws were broken and the case was closed.

"(CNN) -- Iran is not cooperating, making it difficult for the UN's nuclear watchdog agency to provide ""credible assurance"" that the country doesn't possess undeclared nuclear material, the International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano said Monday. Speaking to the IAEA's board of governors, Amano said Iran should grant access ""without further delay"" to the Parchin military complex, where the Islamic Republic is believed to have tested rockets. Since Iran has not provided such access to date, ""The Agency therefore cannot conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,"" Amano said. For about a decade, international observers have accused Iran of secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons program, which Iran consistently denies. Amano noted that Iran has recently begun installing IR-2m centrifuges at its fuel enrichment plant at Natanz, and that those high-speed devices that rotate to enrich uranium are more advanced than the previously-installed centrifuges. The IAEA board has been trying to negotiate cooperation from Iran for years. On Wednesday, diplomats from the so-called P5+1 -- the six-nation diplomatic bloc consisting of the United States, France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia -- held secretive talks with Iranian representatives in Kazakhstan, and then announced future meetings on March 18 and April 5. The Islamic Republic already faces sanctions from the United Nations Security Council for violating a U.N. resolution forbidding it from enriching uranium. But Iran says since it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it should be able to enrich uranium for peaceful energy needs. The IAEA was created in 1957 to promote ""safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies,"" its website says. Among its endeavors, the agency tries to verify that countries correctly and completely account for their nuclear material and activities. The agency says as of December 31, it had ""safeguards agreements in force"" with 179 official countries, and Taiwan.

"(CNN) -- Gareth Bale's stunning hat-trick against Inter Milan in the Champions League in 2010 announced the Welshman as a player the world should keep an eye on. That virtuoso performance ultimately came in a losing cause as the Italian side dumped Bale's Tottenham out of the European Champions League and went on to win the continent's premier club competition. Times have changed for Inter, who are struggling in Serie A and staring down the barrel of a Europa League exit after Bale inspired his English side to a 3-0 victory in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Bale nodded Tottenham in front at White Hart Lane and his opener was added to by Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jan Vertonghen as Andre Villas-Boas' side put themselves in a commanding position. They are now odds on to knock Inter out when they travel to Italy for the second leg next week, though Bale will miss the game after picking up a yellow card for diving, a theme that has dogged him in recent months. The 23-year-old has now been booked for diving six times since the start of 2012, his third yellow in the Europa League leading to a one-match ban. Bale told ITV: ""We played well and set tempo from the first whistle, we made it difficult for them. I'm enjoying playing and it gives us a good lead going into the away leg."" While Tottenham continue to flourish in Europe, their Premier League counterparts -- European champions Chelsea -- are not enjoying life in the Europa League. They won the Champions League for the first time in their history last season, but became the first defending club to go out in the group stages this year. And after limping through against lowly Sparta Prague of the Czech Republic in the last round, they sank to 1-0 defeat in Romania to Steaua Bucharest in the first leg of their tie. With the majority of Chelsea's fans vehemently opposed to the installation of Rafa Benitez as their interim manager, and voicing their displeasure at every game, another lackluster display will not do much for the Spaniard's popularity. Raul Rusescu's penalty decided the game -- he scored from the spot after being fouled by Ryan Bertrand. Fernando Torres tested Ciprian Tatarusanu with a volley just before halftime and Eden Hazard went close as the game entered its dying stages as his volley grazed the crossbar. ""It was a difficult game, you could see the atmosphere and the pitch was not the best,"" Benitez told ESPN. ""It was a soft penalty to give in this situation with so many officials. We cannot change that now. The referee gave the penalty but no red card? Strange."" English Premier League side Newcastle drew 0-0 away at Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia. The match was played at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium due to security concerns in Anzhi's home territory of Dagestan. Newcastle's returning French winger Hatem Ben Arfa had the best chance of the match but saw his effort saved while Anzhi's Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o looked dangerous for the home side. Italian outfit Lazio took a firm grip of their clash with VfB Stuttgart thanks to a 2-0 victory in Germany. Lazio, riding high in Serie A, have a formidable lead to protect back in Rome next week after goals from Ederson and Ogenyi Onazi. A late goal from Pierre Webo put Turkish club Fenerbahce in control of their tie against Viktoria Plzen of the Czech Republic. Levante and Russian club Rubin Kazan drew 0-0 in an ill tempered game in Spain. Cristian Ansaldi got his marching orders first for the visitors before Michel was dismissed two minutes later. FC Basel beat Russian side Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 in the first leg in Switzerland. Goals from Marcelo Diaz and Alexander Frei sealed the win while Zenit had Carlos Luis Neto sent off late on. An own goal from Cedric Carrasso handed Benfica a 1-0 win over French side Bordeaux in Portugal.","Gareth Bale scores as Tottenham thrash Inter Milan 3-0 in the Europa League .

""Oldest jets in the fleet, every time I board one of their planes I feel like I just time traveled 20 to 30 years. Leg room is by far the worst of any carrier. Very expensive to fly them as well."" ""Absolutely horrible airline,"" wrote a commenter using the name AKbearhugger. ""The last time I flew with them, they destroyed my bag. Completely destroyed it. I went to the claims desk, and the ""Customer Service"" agent said it wasn't covered. Let them go out of business."" ""I have over 10 million miles on American's AAdvantage program -- and I can tell you for certain their service has become a lot worse,"" wrote DeeJ. Third American Airlines flight in a week experiences loose seats . They're not all on American . ""My worse experience EVER was with Delta,"" wrote wedn28. ""They are the reason I do carry-on now. I'd take my chances with US Airways or AA if I have to, but try to use Jetblue."" Goose69 prefers American to the competition: ""Compared to most other US carriers, American was great. US Airways, Spirit, Delta and Continental are HORRIFYING experiences from start to finish. I'd take a loose seat rather then have to fly the competition. Come on American pilots, get back to work and be happy you are employed."" Foreign airlines do it better . People who fly foreign airlines say the airline crews treat their customers better than their U.S. counterparts. ""Singapore Airlines played with our children and fed them so my wife and I could eat our meals,"" wrote Scott603. ""They brought them toys once an hour and helped us get on/off the plane, on more than one trip,"" he added. ""Qatar brought my mother-in-law from the plane in JFK, through customs and immigration and right out to us, they are awesome!!"" Calling in replacements . The airline blames the increasing list of canceled and delayed flights on its pilots union, after the company persuaded a bankruptcy judge last month to throw out the pilots' contract. The company says the pilots are calling in unnecessary repairs to slow down flights. ""The NFL was just fine with replacement referees, so sure let's use replacement pilots and mechanics for American Airlines,"" wrote OhRReally. ""Maybe those brilliant corporate leaders at American Airlines should embrace the NFL model for skilled-employee labor disputes: call in the replacements! Hey, it's just a fully loaded 767!"" wrote sju36. ""AA tried to renegotiate contracts prior to this but the pilots refused,"" wrote casprd, in reponse to sju36's comment. ""Having worked there for a long time, I can say that the pilots hold the rest of the company hostage. Perspective during tough times . Some folks seem to have a broader perspective: Expressing compassion for the airline and its employees and noting its importance to U.S. airline competition. ""Whether you wish to fly them or not, you don't want them to go out of business or merge. Bad for the consumer!"" wrote Jhaza2k. ""They are definitely not worst airline though, just disgruntled employees at a trying time for this airline."" ""It's so sad to see so many people making accusatory and nasty comments about AA employees when it's clear that they know nothing about what's really going on at the airline,"" wrote cyansky. ""This past weekend, I was on two AA flights that were delayed; the first because the oxygen bottles that the pilots rely on in case of a decompression were found to be EMPTY and had to be replaced; the second because the altimeter was broken. (Kind of important stuff to fix before takeoff, I think.),"" continued cyansky. ""These flights were manned with a crew whose captain and two flight attendants all lost their homes to foreclosure within the same time frame that AA executives awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses."" An apology from an employee . A couple of posters claiming to work for American tried to offer some perspective. ""I work for AA, on the ramp,"" wrote bbrooks1963. ""And I would like to tell all of you: Sorry! Some of us really do all we can to provide the best service this airline can provide. I'm one of those unfortunate ones that just might be out of a job soon, but I still and will till the end, do my job to the best of my ability and without fail."" That comment got more than 100 ""likes"" from our readers. Better airline food could help . ""Things would turn around, if they served 'special brownies' ... made by the California Pot Growers Association,"" wrote Hermes96. ""The service would still stink, but you would not care anymore.""

"(CNN)  -- Kuwaiti security forces arrested six Kuwaitis linked to al Qaeda who planned to attack a U.S. military installation, the country's state-run news agency reported Tuesday. Troops at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait gather for a 2007 holiday show. The suspects had planned to bomb Camp Arifjan during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Kuwaiti security sources said. It is unclear when the arrests took place. Camp Arifjan, outside Kuwait City near the country's border with Saudi Arabia, is used as a logistical base and transit point for U.S. troops deploying to and from neighboring Iraq, according to the U.S. Defense Department. U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood congratulated Kuwait ""on the reported arrest of terrorists targeting U.S. forces and Kuwait facilities."" ""... Kuwait has been an outstanding host for the United States armed forces. This is evidence of the strong U.S.-Kuwait partnership against al Qaeda."" The U.S. military had no further information. ""The operation was a Kuwaiti-led one, and so the Kuwaitis have the details on the intel and the people they apprehended,"" said Navy Capt. Jack Hanzlik, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The plot also involved an attack on Kuwait's State Security Service headquarters and other government facilities, according to the Kuwait News Agency, which cited a statement from the Interior Ministry. An investigation into the alleged plot is ongoing, the news agency reported. Two suspects confessed Tuesday that they planned to attack Camp Arifjan with an explosives-laden truck during Ramadan, which begins August 21, the security sources said. The other four suspects will be interrogated Wednesday, the sources said. Camp Arifjan is the forward headquarters for the U.S. Army Central Command in the region. It is a major logistics base for the U.S. military and generally houses thousands of American troops. Most of the troops stationed there are a component of the 3rd U.S. Army, which is headquartered in Fort McPherson in Atlanta, Georgia, and supports U.S. Central Command missions in the Mideast, including Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the U.S. military. ""We take the security situation at the base and force protection very seriously and coordinate closely with the Kuwaiti government on the security of our bases,"" said Army Sgt. Major Brian Thomas, an Atlanta-based spokesman for Central Command. ""Camp Arifjan and other bases in Kuwait are very secure. The security at Camp Arifjan is no different than the security at any U.S. base in Iraq or Afghanistan.""

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- An unusual sight greeted Jerusalem police as they entered one of Christianity's holiest sites Sunday morning: dozens of monks punching and kicking each other in a massive brawl. Israeli police scuffle with an Armenian monk Sunday at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. Monks from the Greek Orthodox and Armenian denominations were preparing for a ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City when a disagreement led to a full-fledged fistfight. The fight began when Armenian clergy were holding a procession to commemorate the finding of the cross believed to have been used in the crucifixion of Jesus, according to The Associated Press. The Greek members of the clergy wanted one of their monks present, the AP reported, for fear that the procession would undermine their claim to an ancient structure built on what is believed to be the tomb of Jesus. The two sides could not agree, and when the Armenians tried to begin the procession, the Greek monks stepped in and the fighting began, the AP reported. ""We were keeping resistance so that the procession could not pass through ... and establish a right that they don't have,"" a young Greek Orthodox monk with a cut next to his left eye told the AP.  See scenes from the brawl » . Many among the dozens of monks came away with cuts and bruises, said police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld. Officers were called to the scene to break up the brawl. They detained two monks, one from each denomination, Rosenfeld said. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem is thought to be built on the site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.

"(CNN) -- Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade called rival Macky Sall to concede Sunday's runoff election, which Sall hailed as a ""victory of the Senegalese people,"" state media reported. The 85-year-old Wade faced off against his former prime minister and protege after he failed to win a majority during last month's controversial election. The two survived a field of 14 candidates during the February 27 election, with Wade receiving 32% of the vote and Sall getting 25%. Sall garnered support from several of the failed candidates, who vowed solidarity against Wade as he sought a third term. Sunday night, Sall's supporters gathered at the candidate's headquarters in Dakar, cheering and dancing to hip-hop songs in the streets. ""We want change because Senegal is poor and Abdoulaye Wade has done nothing,"" said Alpha Ba, 18, who voted for Sall. ""Today we are proud to be Senegalese."" With 5.3 million voters registered in the country, early turnout was heavy with large crowds waiting to vote in the capital city. Earlier in the day, the head of the European Union Observer team, Thijs Berman, said voting was going well and there were no signs of fraud. In the first round of voting last month, Wade was booed by much of one crowd at a polling place in Dakar. There were unconfirmed reports that he arranged for supporters to come cheer for him and intimidate opponents Sunday. Local radio reported the supporters were dispersed with tear gas when they attempted to enter the polling place. ""In the first round, the voters here spontaneously booed him and it hurt him,"" said voter Malick Sy. ""They took it upon themselves to mobilize people who don't have anything to do with this polling place to come and defend him, basically. I don't think it is a good image for Senegalese democracy."" However, the incident was thought to be isolated in an otherwise peaceful day of voting. ""Before the first round, there was huge political tension and even casualties,"" Berman said. In the second round, ""the situation is much calmer,"" he said. ""There is still a lot of political tension but there has hardly been any violence."" Senegal, a small country on Africa's west coast, has been an outpost of democratic stability in a region with a history of electoral chaos, civil wars and coups. But deadly demonstrations broke out after the country's highest court cleared Wade to seek a third term in January, and protesters demanded that Wade give up his bid for a new mandate. Opponents argue that the court was compromised and the constitution limits presidents to two terms. But Wade successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office in 2000, before the term limit was put in place. Wade once was hailed as a visionary, but his popularity has plummeted. Protesters calling for Wade's ouster have clashed on the streets in recent months. A presidential spokesman has accused opposition candidates and their supporters of fueling ""urban guerrilla warfare"" leading up to the February vote. But Wade's opponents blamed police for the escalating violence, saying they were responsible for some deaths during demonstrations in Dakar and Rufisque. Journalist Nick Loomis contributed to this report.","NEW: Macky Sall hails the ""victory of the Senegalese people""

"(CNN) -- Real estate mogul, reality TV star and possible Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told people to ""stay tuned"" for an unveiling of his net worth, promising more details as he addresses questions about his wealth. ""If I run for office, you are going to know exactly what I'm worth,"" Trump told CNN's ""In the Arena,"" which has been investigating his finances. ""You're going to know where the banks are, how much I have in the bank."" In recent months, Trump has touted his wealth as a possible asset -- and evidence of his business acumen -- as he considers whether to run against President Barack Obama in 2012. He said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that his ""net worth is many, many, many times"" that of Republican Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who has announced his plans to run. ""I built a very big net worth and I'd like to put that ability ... to work for this country,"" Trump said. On Friday, Trump continued to play up his wealth, coupled with how he has run his business. ""I have built a great company."" Trump said. ""I have built a company that has very little debt, has a lot of cash and I have one of the best locations anywhere in the United States."" Eliot Spitzer, the host of ""In the Arena,"" and CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin are digging into a sworn deposition given by Trump in a 2007 libel case calling into question his net worth. ""Hopefully you will find out, because this country is such in bad shape somebody has to do something as quickly as possible,"" Trump said. Earlier in the day, he told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti that his accountants are already hard at work on the financial paperwork required of presidential candidates. ""They're in the process,"" said ""The Apprentice"" star. Trump vowed that any financial disclosure will be released ""simultaneously"" if and when he announces that he's running for president. Forbes magazine lists Trump's net worth at $2.7 billion -- a figure that he derided as ""very, very low relative to what my real net worth is."" In 2004, Trump lost majority control of his casino business under a bankruptcy restructuring plan. The company cited a weak economy and burdensome interest payments as reasons for the restructuring. Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2009, according to court documents filed in Camden, New Jersey. Trump quit his position as chairman of that company, which had total assets of $2.06 billion and total debts of $1.74 billion. Around that same time, nine other of Trump Entertainment's associated companies filed for bankruptcy protection, including Trump Taj Majal Associates, Trump Marina Associates and Trump Plaza Associates.","Donald Trump says: ""If I run for office, you are going to know exactly what I'm worth""

"(CNN) -- A Wisconsin judge on Thursday dismissed one of three lawsuits challenging the state's controversial collective bargaining law. Circuit Judge Maryann Sumi dismissed the suit filed by Dane County and two officials, County Executive Kathleen Falk and County Board Chair Scott McDonell, saying the county lacks legal standing to assert constitutional claims against the state. ""Under longstanding Wisconsin law, an agency or arm of government lacks authority to challenge the constitutionality of state statutes,"" Sumi wrote. However, she indicated that Falk and McDonell may continue the suit as individuals and taxpayers. ""The judge's decision today states only the district attorney or the attorney general can sue the state to enforce the open meetings law,"" Falk said in a prepared statement. ""It's for this reason that I was among the first of several officials to file formal complaints with the district attorney and attorney general the very day after legislative Republicans broke open meetings laws. I applaud (Dane County) District Attorney (Ismael) Ozanne for taking up this issue."" Sumi in late March stopped the law from taking effect so she could hear one of the other two suits -- filed by Democrats who said they were not given enough time to vote on the law they were fighting. Thelaw would curb the collective bargaining rights of most state employees. The Democrats' suit, filed by Ozanne, alleges that Republican legislators violated the state's open meetings law by calling a committee meeting to amend GOP Gov. Scott Walker's budget bill without providing the public with the necessary 24-hour advance notice. State Democrats said they were given only two hours notice for a vote. The amended bill, which had been stalled for weeks by 14 Democratic state senators who left Wisconsin to prevent a quorum -- and thus a vote on the measure -- then sailed through an easy full state Senate vote on March 9. The state House of Representatives then passed the bill, and Walker signed it into law on March 11. The public brouhaha over Walker's $137 million budget repair bill all but shut down the Wisconsin Legislature for weeks. It also drew protesters by the tens of thousands, among them union supporters and public employees, who called the proposed measure an attack on workers. ""While the judge ruled the county isn't the proper jurisdiction to file this suit, her ruling doesn't affect her outstanding restraining order in the district attorney's case that blocks implementation of the legislation that eliminates the rights of public workers,"" Falk's statement said. ""Her decision also doesn't dismiss the questions of open meetings and quorum violations. ... it just says Dane County isn't the proper entity to sue the state over those violations,"" Falk said.","Judge Maryann Sumi said Dane County lacks standing to sue .
She has put the law on hold and will hear another suit .

"Rustenburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans wept, sang somber hymns and prayed at memorial services Thursday to mourn 44 people killed during labor protests in the nation's mining heartland. At the main service, traditional leaders and church officials in flowing robes led the prayers near the site of the clashes at the Marikana mine, operated by Lonmin, one of the world's largest platinum producers. Some grief-stricken mourners fainted and had to be carried out of the ceremony by relatives and friends. Various government officials attended the main ceremony, but police officers were not welcome, at the request of the miners. Of the dozens killed at the Marikana mine, 34 died in a hail of gunfire from police officers, who said they shot at the machete-armed protesters in self-defense on August 16. At least 78 others suffered injuries. What's behind the Marikana massacre? Lonmin was closed to allow miners, some of whom have returned to work despite the strikes, to attend the memorial services. Company officials said no incidents occurred at the mine overnight. Strikes at the mine started two weeks ago when thousands of rock drillers demanded higher wages. Lonmin rejected the demand and called the strike illegal. Violence intensified last week when police fired live ammunition into a crowd of protesters, killing 34 people and sparking a national outcry. The protesters, armed with machetes and sticks, defied orders to lay down their weapons, posing a threat to police officers, according to authorities. Ten others died in the earlier days of the protests, including two police officers who were hacked to death. A rivalry between two unions that wield a lot of power and influence in the nation added to the tension. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. Thousands protest at scene of mine shootings . The memorial service comes as workers at two more platinum companies in the northwest echoed Lonmin workers, signaling spreading labor discontent. About 1,000 workers gathered at nearby Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine on Wednesday to voice their discontent. They returned to work a day later. ""We congratulate the workers for refusing to be misled by people with political ambitions and for returning to work"" said Sydwell Dokolwana, a regional secretary for the company. Across the street from Marikana, at a mine owned by Anglo American Platinum mine, a group of workers gave management until Friday to respond to a list of demands. The company said workers have not made any threats to go on strike. South African President Jacob Zuma addressed the miners at the Marikana site Wednesday and said he has launched a commission of inquiry to investigate the killings. ""We want the truth,"" Zuma said. ""This is painful to all of us. It is not acceptable for people to die where talks can be held."" Grievances, fears of instability spread to other South African mines .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Aniston is getting married and this seems to be a matter of intense interest to women around the world. Why do we care? To begin, there is the incredible proliferation of mass media, the huge amount of coverage on celebrities and the self-exposure stars are willing to endure -- even prefer -- these days. ""Stars"" have changed from glamorous, unfathomables, to ""friends"" we follow on Twitter, in intimate, unguarded photos in entertainment magazines (which we don't even have to buy; the headlines and pictures capture us in our doctors' offices and at the check out counter). We turn on the TV talk shows and learn more than we should as heartbroken or apologetic celebrity guests share details of their romantic misadventures. Women like Jennifer Aniston become girlfriends, or friends of friends, who we listen to, judge, identify with and commiserate with. The wall separating us from stardom has been replaced by a penetrable surface, with celebrities just one tweet or book group away. She is no longer Jennifer Aniston, the star; she is Jennifer, a friend once removed and we talk about her among friends as if she were one of us. News: Jennifer Aniston engaged to actor Justin Theroux . She is not, though, so why do we feel so strongly about what happens to a movie star who has no apparent connection to our lives? Two reasons. First, we know enough about her travail to identity with her and project ourselves into her situation. Here is a woman, who, like many of us, has wanted someone very badly, made mutual vows of fidelity and loyalty, and had that person leave for another lover -- in this case, an exceptionally talented and gorgeous woman, who now lays claim to everything she (or we) ever wanted. There are few women who haven't lost someone they loved -- and they immediately take up her cause, and her feelings, as their own. Secondly, we follow her life because in a strange way, it comforts us. If a man could be unfaithful to such a lovely, successful and nice woman, we can know that perhaps we weren't left because we weren't pretty enough or sexy enough or witty enough, but because some men just fall in love with someone else. We can see that regardless of why our own mate left, there was nothing about it that should wipe out our self-esteem and there wasn't necessarily anything we could have done that would have saved our relationship. Peering into various celebrity real melodramas rather perversely cheers us up! In 2008, millions of women were riveted to the divorce trial of Christie Brinkley, whose husband, Peter Cook, betrayed her with a teenage employee. Well, we thought, if a man could do that to Christie Brinkley, of course we shouldn't feel that a husband or boyfriend left us for not being pretty enough or sexy enough. Look what happened to one of the most gloriously gorgeous women on Earth! Jennifer Aniston's men . Then there is an additional twist in Aniston's story that reassures us. Her failed marriage says to us that someone even more glorious than ourselves can be left, but her engagement tells us that there can be a Cinderella story at the end of the road: a mate who truly loves us, who wants to create a family, who will deliver security and unconditional love at last. Sure, it may last as long as the next headline, but we deeply hope love stays the course for her, because we want to believe that our own dreams will result in triumph over disappointment. This is why we care in a seemingly unreasonable way about what happens to Jennifer Aniston. Nice girls might not finish last. Justice might prevail. Sure, we care about Jennifer, but we follow her life, and the life of other celebrities, mostly because they are now in our ""friendship circle,"" however illusory this perception is. Aniston's ""fairy tale ending"" is a stand-in for the fairly tale ending we want for ourselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Pepper Schwartz: Many are interested that Jennifer Aniston is engaged. Why?
She says after years of tabloid scrutiny of her marital travail, many women relate to her .
She says that Aniston is finding love lets other scorned women feel they can find it, too .
Schwartz: We follow her story, delight in her triumph because it gives hope for our own ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The top Senate Republican on Tuesday laid out a hard-line negotiating stance on upcoming budget battles, rejecting any tax increases and demanding ""significant"" reforms in exchange for his vote to raise the debt ceiling. ""We're going to require as a condition for raising the debt ceiling something really important about the debt,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters. Without providing specifics, McConnell said it would take ""something the markets would view as significant, something the American people would view as significant, something foreign countries would view as significant"" in order for him to vote to increase how much the United States can borrow. Congress must reach an agreement on the debt ceiling before the United States reaches its legal borrowing limit of $14.29 trillion. McConnell said the Treasury Department has indicated the nation would reach its debt ceiling ""sometime between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July."" He called for ""something real, something measurable"" that will begin to reduce the national debt. McConnell also made clear that he opposes generating more revenue through higher taxes to tackle the deficit and debt problems. ""From my point of view, taxes are not on the table because we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem,"" McConnell said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, suggested mandatory caps on government spending and a balanced budget amendment as possible reforms to accompany a measure raising the debt ceiling. ""We're only talking about doing this if we can be assured there are guarantees in place that spending doesn't get out of control again,"" Cantor said of allowing more borrowing by the federal government. A few minutes after McConnell spoke, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, noted that Republicans and Democrats have widely differing views on how best to strengthen the nation's fiscal situation. Reid accused Republicans -- including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, who has released a 2012 budget proposal -- of seeking to protect the wealthy and their special interests. ""The only thing Republicans fought to protect were the richest of the rich,"" Reid said of last week's budget negotiations on a spending plan for the rest of the current fiscal year. ""It is clear once again that the two parties' priorities are significantly different,"" Reid said of Ryan's proposal, adding it would provide no help for the middle class. Obama, who is presenting his long-term debt reduction plan on Wednesday, should address inequities in the tax code that benefit moneyed interests, Reid said, calling for a halt to subsidies for oil companies and deductions for companies that transfer jobs overseas. Reid also said additional revenue must be part of any long-range fiscal solution. He didn't give specifics, but Democrats generally favor increasing the tax rate for families earning more than $250,000 a year to the levels of the 1990s, before tax cuts implemented by the Bush administration. In addition, Reid rejected the contention that reforming Social Security must be part of deficit reduction strategy, saying: ""That has nothing to do with the deficit. Zero. Social Security has not contributed one penny to the deficit."" As Washington battles over spending cuts, the Treasury Department reported Tuesday that the deficit for the first six months of the 2011 fiscal year has reached $829.4 billion. According to the latest monthly figures from Treasury, in March the federal government took in $150.9 billion, but outlays were $339 billion, for a monthly deficit of $188.2 billion. That's slightly better than the $222.5 billion deficit in February, probably because the looming tax filing deadline increased receipts. Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who is part of the Democratic caucus, said the deficit issue requires a comprehensive approach in which ""everyone is going to have to take some loss."" ""We can't keep spending a trillion and a half more every year than we're bringing in, even though it's hard now to say we have to cut these programs,"" Lieberman said. ""If we don't begin to do that, and at some point think about raising taxes, the whole American economy will come close to collapse."" CNN's Scott Spoerry, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: Rep. Cantor suggests mandatory spending caps and a balanced budget amendment .

"New Braunfels, Texas (CNN) -- Judy Young stoops down to point out her favorite feature of the sidewalk: a thick, bronze ring attached to the curb, about the size of a bracelet, weathered and rusted. The sidewalks of downtown New Braunfels, Texas, are lined with them at inconsistent intervals. They are remnants of the days when European immigrants farmed the lush countryside known as the Texas Hill Country, she says. Farmers of predominantly German heritage rode into town and tied their horses to the rings while they conducted business in stores like Henne Hardware, which still stands, and claims to be ""Texas' oldest hardware store in continuous operation"" since 1857. Why there's no messing with Texas . The rough, weathered rings are the real deal, products of German ingenuity, says Young, a native of New Braunfels who exudes the requisite boosterism you'd expect from the Chamber of Commerce Convention and Visitors Bureau director, but with a genuine sense of pride. ""When the Germans built stuff, they built it to last,"" Young said, laughing. Many residents of this waypoint between San Antonio and Austin grew up speaking German in their homes and remember when the hometown paper, the Herald-Zeitung, was written entirely in German. Some are fifth generation who can trace their roots back to 1845, when the first settlers arrived after Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, Germany, founded the town on the Comal River under a German charter. KXAN: Comal River overflowing -- with people . Germans were originally lured to the Republic of Texas when it offered public land to Americans and Europeans to pay off war debt and weaken political ties with Mexico. This offer, combined with political strife in their home country, enticed a group of German noblemen to form an immigration company, and German immigrants began arriving in 1844. But times have changed, and now some residents say New Braunfels, sister city to Braunfels, Germany, isn't ""German"" enough. Sure, it has a German-American society, a shooting club, polka dances and Naegelin's Bakery, Texas' ""oldest continuously operating bakery"" since 1868, which serves fresh pfeffernüsse and streussel. The town also has Wurstfest, an annual festival that features German food and music. But as the town grows, 56.4% from 2000 to 2010, it wants more visible evidence to let those from outside the area know what New Braunfels is about: a sign that says ""Wilkommen,"" street signs in German, building facades adorned with fachwerk, or timberframe. What's behind the rise of Texas? ""We would like to see the town look a little more German. This town wouldn't be here if it weren't started by the Germans. It's a historical fact,"" said Diane Moltz, who grew up on a farm 15 minutes outside New Braunfels in a German-speaking home. She cited tasteful examples such as Leavenworth, Washington, and Frankenmuth, Michigan, known as Michigan's ""little Bavaria,"" and less tasteful examples, like Helen, Georgia (""Helen's a little over the top,"" she said). ""San Antonio is predominantly Hispanic, it's their heritage, and you can see it in the streets, the buildings. It's celebrated there. We feel like we could play on our heritage."" Guenter Dirks, the owner of the biggest German restaurant in town, Freisenhaus, has been asking the chamber for several years about playing up the town's German roots. ""People come here looking for a German town and they're disappointed. People come in here and ask where can I buy lederhosen and I don't know what to tell them. There's nowhere,"" said Dirks, a tall, imposing businessman who moved to Texas with his wife, Cornelia, and two sons in 2004 from Freisen, Germany. He opened Freisenhaus in 2005. The restaurant serves traditional dishes as well as others like Texas schnitzel, made with spicy jalapeño. Americanizing an ancient faith in Texas . Young said the chamber is responding to feedback such as Dirks' and is working on a larger promotional campaign to play up New Braunfels' German heritage. She acknowledges the impetus comes from a desire to draw businesses and tourists, but it's also just a part of growing and sustaining the community, she said. ""We've always had a brochure and used our German heritage as marketing tools, but we've discovered our German heritage is not in your face like people expect it to be,"" she said. ""Our heritage is the combination of 1,500 years of German society and our frontier-immigrant roots married together. Where is it? We're walking it and living it. But we need to show it off more."" Case in point: Schlitterbahn, the flagship water park that has sprouted three satellite locations since it opened in 1966. Occupying more than 65 acres on the eastern banks of the Comal River -- and growing -- the business is second-generation family owned and operated. With ride names such as Blastenhoff, Surfenburg and Tubenbach, and a replica of the guard tower in Braunfels looming over the park, visible from blocks away, park spokesman Jeffrey Siebert says kitsch is part of Schlitterbahn's charm, but says it's also part of paying homage to New Braunfels' German roots. Otherwise, authentic evidence of New Braunfels' German roots is subtly tucked into curbs, stamped into building facades and embedded in its civic fabric. The hometown newspaper lists community events in the ""Stammtisch"" section, which loosely translates to ""table reserved for regulars."" The best BBQ in Texas . New Braunfels also boasts several organizations dedicated to preserving its German heritage, including the New Braunfels Schuetzen Verein, a shooting club that traces its roots back to 1849, and the German-American Society of New Braunfels, which says it has more than 700 members. The group, a co-sponsor of the Edelweiss Kinder Chor, or children's choir, organizes annual events like Maskenball (costume ball) and Weihnachtsfest (Christmas Party) as well as less formal events like games of ninepin bowling and skat, a German card game. Helgard Suhr-Hollis, a co-founder of the society who moved to New Braunfels from Germany in 1962, said it grew out of a desire to bring together the disparate singing societies and social clubs under the banner of German pride. ""Germans are a very proud people. They're known to be hard-working, self-reliant, don't take handouts and they believe strongly in education,"" she said. Since helping start the society in 1978, Suhr-Hollis' has continued to contribute to German social life in New Braunfels. She is a member of the walking club and a docent at several museums and sites dedicated to the town's German heritage. One of them, the Lindheimer Home, is one of the oldest structures in town and the place where ""father of Texas botany"" Ferdinand Lindheimer lived and died in 1879. The Lindheimer Home is within walking distance of the Comal River, which feeds into the larger Guadalupe River, providing sources of leisure in the summertime. Families walk down the streets lugging inner tubes to the nearest drop-in point, with Landa Park among the most popular. During the day, families park on the banks of the river under shady oak trees while children wade in the water or ride a train that meanders through the park, or visit the Comal Spring. As Young walked through the park barefoot, picking up trash and spouting off facts about its origins, she waved at the conductor of the train, an elderly man named Harvey Soechting, who she said was following in his father's footsteps. Young revealed that she is not German: ""Dutch-Irish."" But she said she was grateful for what the Germans had done here. ""You don't really start thinking about it until you have children. But it's like my second-grade teacher Mrs. Naegelin (of the Naegelin Bakery) told us: It's our responsibility to preserve and enhance our community so future generations won't have to leave. We have to tell our own story and build up our own community, or people from the outside with lots of money will come in and do it for us.""","Residents say New Braunfels, Texas, sister city to Braunfels, Germany, isn't ""German"" enough .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed the budget agreement covering federal spending for the remainder of the current fiscal year on Friday, bringing an end to any remaining fears of a government shutdown. The bipartisan deal, which won approval Thursday from both the House and Senate, cuts $38.5 billion in spending while funding the government through September 30. In a White House statement, Obama expressed his objection to two sections of the agreement, which prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States and to move detainees into the custody of foreign countries unless specific conditions are met. ""Despite my continued strong objection to these provisions, I have signed this act because of the importance of avoiding a lapse in appropriations for the federal government, including our military activities, for the remainder of fiscal year 2011,"" the president said. ""Nevertheless, my administration will work with the Congress to seek repeal of these restrictions, will seek to mitigate their effects, and will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future."" The president also said his administration would interpret a section of the agreement so as not to strip him of the right to fund some senior White House adviser positions. With its passage, White House and congressional leaders now turn their attention to what are expected to be more rancorous battles over the budget for the next fiscal year and the upcoming need to raise the federal debt limit. The deal covering the current year was announced by key leaders shortly before midnight last Friday, a mere hour before what would have been the start of a partial shutdown. Spokesmen on both sides of the aisle portrayed it as a step toward controlling America's skyrocketing debt. The measure passed the Republican-controlled House on a 260-167 vote. The bill would not have passed, however, without support from members of both parties. Fifty-nine members of the GOP majority opposed it, showing the challenge faced by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in keeping his conservative Tea Party-infused caucus unified amid politically perilous tax and spending negotiations with the Democrats. The House vote also reflected growing liberal angst and anger over the impending spending reductions. Only 81 Democrats backed the measure; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, voted no. In the Democratic-controlled Senate, the final vote was 81-19. House passes sweeping GOP budget cuts . Under the deal, $38.5 billion will be cut from the budget, including funding from a wide range of domestic programs and services such as high-speed rail, emergency first responders and the National Endowment for the Arts. As part of the agreement, Congress also voted Thursday on measures to de-fund Planned Parenthood and Obama's health care overhaul. As expected, both passed the House and were defeated in the Democratic-controlled Senate. One point of concern for conservatives was a report released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showing that of the $38.5 billion in savings, only $352 million will actually be realized this fiscal year. Boehner insisted Thursday that all of the cuts will take effect eventually, but conceded that the analysis caused a degree of ""confusion"" among House members. ""I'm disappointed,"" said freshman Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Illinois. ""I just think we could have gotten more.""","President Obama signs the spending deal covering the rest of the current fiscal year .

"Washington (CNN) -- As they furiously typed computer code through the night in a small Capitol Hill office, little did they know they were about to change the way Americans would view what has become known as the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. The handful of staffers from Rep. Ed Markey's now defunct Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming had just received word from oil giant BP that they would be given a live feed of the underwater cameras monitoring the spewing oil from 8,000 feet below the Gulf of Mexico. The date was May 19, 2010, nearly one month to the day that the Deepwater Horizon well had exploded, killing 11 workers and causing oil to stream unabated into the Gulf. ""This was like a tornado but under the water, which people could not see,"" Markey, D-Massachusetts, told CNN this week. Up to that point, BP had only released short snippets of video from the robotic cameras. Markey and other congressional Democrats had been pressuring BP to allow them to see the live pictures. Photos: Gulf oil disaster a year later . As Markey's staff worked to post the live feed on their website, they debated what to call it. Finally it was decided that ""spillcam"" was the most descriptive. By 9 a.m. the next day, the video feed went up on the committee website. Within 24 hours a million people had seen it. The demand was so high, it not only crashed the committee's website but the huge volume also temporarily crashed the House of Representative's Web system. ""Spillcam"" was a game-changer. ""Once they saw it, once they could understand the damage that it was doing to the environment and to the livelihoods of the people in the Gulf of Mexico, that's when the spillcam became something that changed the whole course of the way in which the government and BP was responding to this disaster,"" Markey says. The video eventually was viewed by many more millions around the world as CNN and other networks broadcast the images. Estimates of just how much oil was gushing into the Gulf ballooned. Initially BP and the government announced 1,000 barrels a day was leaking into the Gulf from the well. Those estimates continued to climb from 5,000 barrels a day to 12,000 to 19,000 and eventually up to 60,000 barrels a day. Spillcam allowed teams of government scientists to calculate better estimates. Gulf oil disaster still puzzles scientists . But one year after the Macondo well explosion, Markey, who became the face of Congress trying to hold BP accountable, says nothing has changed. ""Congress has not passed any legislation yet to respond to the lessons which we have learned from that spill,"" he says. Markey blames Republican senators and the Senate rules requiring 60 votes to pass legislation to strengthen safety rules regulating offshore drilling. But, when pressed, he concedes that some of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate joined the majority of Republicans to defeat the House bill in the last Congress. The oil industry itself and the Department of Interior have taken the lead in putting new safety and preparedness measures into place since the explosion. The much-maligned Minerals Management Service, previously under investigation for being too cozy with the oil industry it regulates, was shaken up in the wake of the spill. Now the newly named Bureau of Ocean Energy, Management, Regulation and Enforcement has split its regulatory divisions so the people who monitor safety and leasing for oil drilling are not the same division that collects royalties. The government has also implemented new, tougher standards for well design. In addition, oil companies must now certify to the government that they can respond to a spill. Some of the technology developed in trying to cap the BP spill is now part of some of those certification plans. Rig survivors' wives, kids also victims . But Markey, whose party is now in the minority in the House, lost another battle in February. That is when the Obama administration once again decided to allow deepwater drilling with the support of Republicans and some Gulf-state Democrats who argued that drilling means jobs. Markey thinks the administration might have moved too quickly. ""I am saying that they have to be very careful. It (deepwater drilling) should only be limited, it should only be out to certain depths, and it should only be with a guarantee that they can go out and to cap it as quickly as possible."" He says he still has real concerns about safety. ""The reality is that there are still inherent problems with blowout preventers, that an accident can still occur and that we haven't been able to pass all of the safety legislation necessary that would serve as a deterrent to a repetition of what happened last year."" Stories from the Gulf, one year on . This month, Markey's Republican colleagues passed three new bills out of committee that would allow oil companies to get permits faster to drill offshore, open new areas of the United States to offshore drilling and increase offshore drilling in the Gulf. With gas prices approaching $4 a gallon, Republicans say these bills strike a balance between safety and the demand for oil. Markey says they're acting as if the spill never happened.","Spillcam changed the way BP, government responded to Gulf oil disaster .

"Washington (CNN) -- In many ways, the debate over taming the nation's spending and deficit beasts can be compared to a family's hand-wringing over what to cut, and what to keep, in tough times. It may be easy to nix ""luxuries"" like vacations and eating out. But should ""essentials"" like a car or a home be downsized or gotten rid of to save money? Tough choices about what to keep, kill or cut back on are the kinds of things the nation's lawmakers are considering as they try to trim a $14 trillion debt. Should familiar yet costly ""essentials"" -- entitlements like Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the nation's poor -- be phased out or dramatically overhauled? House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan laid out the Republican plan last week. It would radically overhaul Medicare and Medicaid while lowering top tax rates. President Obama on Wednesday laid out his plan for long-term deficit reduction, renewing his call for ending the Bush-era tax cuts for families making more than $250,000 while strengthening Medicare and Medicaid. The Tea Party's mantra to ""stop the spending"" largely refocused the national conversation on spending. Is it willing to see entitlement programs fundamentally changed? Levi Russell, a spokesman for the Tea Party Express, says one way to reduce spending is to cut waste, overlap and excess in government programs. And yet Russell also partially endorsed Ryan's plan, which would dismantle the current Medicare program starting in 2022 in favor or a voucher program, though it would not affect anyone who's 55 or older now. ""[The Ryan plan] addresses the fact that people who have paid their whole lives, that you don't want to put them into a hardship, through no fault of their own,"" Russell said. ""At the same time, we need to make changes to the plan, for people who are younger."" ""Medicaid is something we talk about like it's a God-given right, when it's only been around since the 1960s. It's a program that we phased in. We can easily start to phase it out,"" he said. FreedomWorks, another prominent Tea Party group, echoed similar sentiments. Adam Brandon, a spokesman, told CNN, ""The first thing you have to do is roll back entitlements you can't afford. Second is moving them towards solvency. One of the best ways to do that -- especially for younger workers -- is through some kind of voluntary personal accounts."" And yet, Brandon acknowledged that his and other Tea Party support organizations would have a tough time selling such ideas to everyday Americans. ""It's part of our job to get out there and to educate and make sure that voters have a choice and understand what we're talking about,"" Brandon said. ""We're not talking about throwing Grandma out on the street. What we are talking about doing is making hard, difficult decisions that are going to get the country, the fiscal house in order."" A fresh CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, released Wednesday, shows how steep the hill may be. The poll finds that while Americans are nearly evenly split on whether Republican proposals to cut spending go too far, only three in 10 think the GOP budget treats all groups in society fairly, while seven in 10 believe that Republican proposals favor some groups over others. Meanwhile, FreedomWorks advocates going beyond radically reforming familiar entitlement programs and calls for the elimination of some very familiar government functions. Specifically naming the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, Commerce, Agriculture and Energy, Brandon said, ""I think you could pretty much do away with the entire departments ... just eliminate them."" Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, doesn't think that will happen. ""I don't think you're going to find much appetite for that,"" he said. Ornstein also criticized calls for dramatic overhauls of Medicaid and Medicare, especially as seen in the Ryan plan. ""You're really talking about ... shifting the cost of health care from where seniors pay about 30% to where they pay closer to 70%,"" he said. ""My guess is, at best, you're going to get a mixed reaction from that group to this set of proposals."" Though Ornstein feels that now is a good time to discuss the nation's debt problem, he equated lawmaker support for Ryan's plan to ""falling on a grenade."" It ""doesn't take a dime from Defense, or takes very little from Defense. And cuts taxes for the wealthy and for companies, even as it takes a lot out of Medicare and Medicaid. So it becomes a question of whether this is seen as fair,"" Ornstein said. As many lawmakers frame the debate around protecting future generations, one noted historian says it's worthwhile to look at the past. ""Cutting and balancing budgets is never really, in the end, that big of history stuff,"" Rice University professor of history Douglas Brinkley told CNN. ""If I asked you, 'What did [President] Grover Cleveland do with his budget? What did [President] Benjamin Harrison do with his budget? What was [President] Taft's budget?' -- you wouldn't know. Because 100 years from now, people won't think about budget fights so much. But they're going to know, 100 years from now, that America pushed through civil rights acts in '64 and '65, America created Medicaid and Medicare ... NASA sent a man to the moon. Big stuff that happens in history is being done by the federal government, not by people just carping about it all the time."" Brinkley continued: ""This sort of gutting mentality that the Tea Party has, a kind of visceral hatred of the federal government, it comes out of a lack of historical understanding and appreciation."" Calling Medicaid and Medicare ""wildly successful programs,"" Brinkley said that the Republican Party has been trying roll them back for decades. ""I think if they're given a magic wand, they would melt them away."" And Brinkley had a warning and prediction. ""Not just Congressman Ryan, but if the main Republican candidate for president said he wants to shut down Medicaid and Medicare, if that happened, welcome to the second Obama term.""","Lawmakers consider what to keep, kill or cut back on as they try to trim a $14 trillion debt .

"(CNN) -- South Africa have toppled England from the top of the world Test rankings after clinching a 2-0 series victory on the final day at Lord's. The Proteas dominated play on day five to win by 51 runs, having won the opening match of the three-Test series by an innings and 12 runs and drawn the second encounter. The start of the final Test, which England needed to win to stay top of the rankings, was overshadowed by claims that key batsman Kevin Pietersen sent negative texts about his teammates to their South African rivals. The former national captain, who scored 149 in the second Test, was left out of the squad after refusing to sign a letter confirming he did not send the derogatory messages. Pietersen row overshadows battle for cricket's number one ranking . Resuming on Monday at 16-2, the home side struggled to make any significant headway towards the 346 runs required to secure an unlikely victory and salvage the No. 1 ranking, and were 120 runs off the target with just three wickets remaining before the start of the final session. Ian Bell and James Taylor both fell for four as England crumbled to 45-4, but Jonathan Trott and Jonny Bairstow added 89 for the fifth wicket to revive faint hopes of victory. Bairstow, called in to replace Pietersen, made 95 in the first innings and he again impressed with a quickfire 54 off 47 deliveries faced in his second knock before being bowled by spinner Imran Tahir. South Africa-born Trott was the next to go with the score on 146 as he fell to pace bowler Dale Steyn for the second time in the match, on this occasion succumbing to a superb diving catch at second slip by Jacques Kallis as he posted 63 off 159 balls. Matt Prior, another England player born in South Africa, made a defiant 73 before being the ninth man to fall as he edged a ball from Vernon Philander to captain Graeme Smith. Philander then dismissed tailender Steve Finn for no score to end with figures of 5-30, and seven wickets for the match. Smith dedicated the victory to Mark Boucher, the team's former wicketkeeper who was forced to retire from international cricket after suffering a serious eye injury in a warmup match ahead of the series. ""This is a message from all of us,"" said Smith, who wore a shirt reading ""We miss you Bouch."" ""He's been part of us for 147 games and this was meant to be his 150th. This victory was for him and for everything he has done for us."" England captain Andrew Strauss, who was reportedly the subject of some of Pietersen's text messages, paid tribute to the tourists and acknowledged his team's struggles in the past year since taking the No. 1 ranking from India. ""South Africa were the better side over the course of the series and thoroughly deserved their victory,"" he told reporters. ""They were just better than us. I don't look back on our time as number one with a great deal of fondness, as we had some tough times. ""That can be a good thing, though, as Test cricket tests you when you're number one. We've learned a lot and it's a shame to hand it over, but they deserve to be number one and we will come back."" South Africa will next tour Australia for a three-Test series starting in November, while England will go to the sub-continent to take on India again. Pietersen's future remains in doubt, and he is unlikely to be selected for the World Twenty20 competition starting next month. After being dropped, he was dismissed for no score in a limited-overs match for his county team Surrey. In a bid to limit damage to his selection hopes, last week he posted a video apology on the internet and later issued a contrite statement following his omission. ""The texts were meant as banter between close friends. I need to rein myself in sometimes,"" he said. ""I apologize to Straussy and the team for the inappropriate remarks at the press conference and for the texts. I truly didn't mean to cause upset or tension particularly with important games at stake."" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), however, has refused to say whether Pietersen will ever play for England again. ""We are in receipt of Kevin's apology, but further discussions need to take place to establish whether it is possible to regain the trust and mutual respect required to ensure all parties are able to focus on playing cricket and to maintain the unity of purpose that has served us so well in recent years,"" said ECB managing director Hugh Morris.","South Africa end England's one-year reign as cricket's top-ranked Test team .

"London (CNN) -- Rafa Nadal may wholeheartedly believe that hardcourts are ""too tough"" on players' bodies, but there is currently no proof to back up his claims, a leading sports scientist has told CNN. ""The evidence isn't there, which is surprising considering (how long serious sport has been played). But the proper randomized controlled trials simply haven't been done,"" says Edward Winter from the Center for Sport and Exercise Science at the UK's Sheffield Hallam University. ""Most of the evidence is anecdotal -- by that I mean identifying trends of injuries which can be related to surfaces or equipment is difficult to disentangle from individual anecdotes that athletes or others make,"" he added. Nadal, who has struggled with knee problems during his career, criticized the ATP saying they ""worry too little about players' health"" adding that officials should consider reducing the number of tournaments played on hard surfaces in a bid to prolong sports activity on and off court. ""After ending the career, it would be nice to be able to play football with friends, or tennis ..."" the 11-time grand slam champion said, speaking at the Brazil Open in Sao Paulo on Tuesday. his second tournament this year following a seven-month absence due to an injury to his left knee. Read: Knee injury continues to 'bother' Rafael Nadal . ""The ATP should start thinking about ways to lengthen players' careers. I can't imagine footballers playing on cement, I can't imagine any other sport involving aggressive movements such as tennis being played on such aggressive surfaces such as ours. We are the only sport in the world making this mistake and it won't change,"" added Nadal, who as youngster learnt the game playing on claycourts. But Winter, a professor of the physiology of exercise, says there are many factors in play when it comes to assessing player health. ""As standards of performance increase so the demands also increase. There have been suggestions that this foreshortens people's careers, but alternatively -- and tennis is a good example -- you have Masters players continuing to play major competitions well into their 30s, 40s and 50s,"" Winter said. Read: Unbeaten in 10 years, wheelchair tennis ace retires . ""Identifying trends is still very difficult, but I know of no convincing evidence to suggest that there is an increasing problem that more players are now becoming more seriously injured."" Winter isn't without sympathy for the 26-year-old, who he says has suffered a lot during a seven-month layoff from the game, but a knee jerk-type reaction by the tennis authorities is unwarranted. ""To what extent is this an expression of disappointment and to what extent is this an expression of a general trend?"" added Winter. ""For what it's worth, my money is on the former more than the latter. It is heartfelt and sincere expression of disappointment which one should sympathise with, but it is not an accurate comment on a general trend."" The ATP declined to comment on the matter.","Rafa Nadal says ATP ""worries too little about the players""

"(CNN) -- TV sets, computers and smartphones are hard to find in Sangano, Malawi, but farmers here are using an age-old mass communication tool to learn the tricks of their trade: radio. In a country where the vast majority of the population lives off the land, scores of smallholders in rural communities tune in to Farm Radio Malawi to get valuable information and share ideas on how to improve their yields -- from fertilizing techniques and cultivation tips to harvesting practices and weather forecasts. ""Most of our farmers ... are illiterate,"" says Rex Chapota, executive director at Farm Radio Malawi. ""They're not able to read newspapers or pamphlets or booklets, and even televisions are not out there in the community. So radio is actually the only source of critical information to our farmers, and statistics are showing right now that over 60% of the rural populace at least own a radio."" Farm Radio Malawi is one of the partner stations of Farm Radio International, a non-profit organization that's been teaming up with African radio broadcasters since the late 1970s. The Canada-based group offers its hundreds of partners in sub-Saharan Africa a wide array of resources, including a weekly electronic news service and an online community that connects broadcasters across the continent. It also researches and writes radio scripts covering issues such as crop production, farm management and community health. The scripts, which are offered for free, are translated in local languages and read in 38 countries, according to the group. In rural parts of Malawi, farmers often gather at radio listening clubs to tune in and discuss what they've heard. ""The issue of radio listeners' clubs is very critical to our model,"" says Chapota. ""We do understand that when farmers come together in a group to listen together to a radio program, thereafter they are able to discuss and dialogue on what they've listened to and then they're able to use that in their various fields,"" he adds. Malawi, a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, has one of the largest rural populations in the continent. Agriculture accounts for about 80% of the country's labor force, which is why local farm programming can make a big difference in people's lives. ""Right now we are promoting groundnut growing, not only for food, but for income,"" says Chapota. ""So we say that if our farmers are able to produce good groundnuts, which can fetch good prices at the market, then that is very beneficial to their income security."" One of the groundnut farmers who benefited from receiving the station's audible agriculture advice is Benjamin Masiya, who relies on his agriculture income to pay for his children's school fees and clothing. He says he expects his harvest to increase this year after following the radio station's advice, which enabled him to plant two groundnut rows on a ridge instead of one. Malawi's head of state: 'Why I'm selling presidential jet' Patrick Chimuvi, a government agriculture advisor in Malawi, says the radio programs have been very successful in helping farmers improve their skills and harvest their produce at the best time. ""Most often they used to harvest in June, but after listening on the radio they ... harvest their crops in May, which was very important because whenever there's a late time of harvesting, there's a loss of products,"" says Chimuvi. From preventing the loss of produce to increasing harvests, the broadcasters believe that the lessons learned over the radio airwaves can help fight food insecurity and improve lives in Malawi's rural communities. ""We know that if they improve their famine situation, then their income improves, but also the nutrition improves, and their whole livelihood changes for the better,"" says Chapota.","Farmers in Malawi are tuning in to radio programs to get vital information .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It would be news enough in itself -- the departure of one of business education's brightest young stars to the private sector -- but Joel Podolny's announcement that he is to stand down as dean of the Yale School of Management carries a wider impact. Back to school? An Apple store in downtown Munich, Germany . Podolny, still only 43 and credited with helping applications to the school rise by 50 percent in his four-year tenure, is leaving to become the first ever dean of the so-called Apple University. The computer and tech company has yet to say exactly what Apple University is -- an Apple spokesman called it only an ""exciting new project"" -- but many people assume it is likely to be an in-house executive education and training facility for employees. If confirmed, Podolny's move highlights the way in which increasing numbers of corporations set up their own ""corporate universities,"" designed to provide tailor-made training to staff. According to one academic study of the phenomenon, by 2001 there were already around 2,000 corporate universities around the world. These are not necessarily intended to replace MBAs or EMBAs at traditional business schools. They tend instead to be far more narrow in focus and specifically geared to the individual needs of the corporation in question. And yet, corporate universities have increasingly borrowed ideas and methods from business schools, a trend which with Podolny's departure has now apparently extended to poaching staff. Podolny was seen as a hugely successful dean for Yale, overseeing a revamp of the school's curriculum as well as a notable boost to its reputation. In an email to staff and students announcing his departure, Podolny spoke of his regret but said he had long harbored a passion for all things Apple. ""While there are many great companies, I cannot think of one that has had as tremendous personal meaning for me as Apple,"" he wrote. ""I remember writing my first computer program on an Apple II, remember pulling an all-nighter to watch the Laserwriter (attached to my 128K Mac) print my undergraduate thesis at seven minutes per page."" So what will the former professor of economic sociology, who was at the Stanford and Harvard schools before Yale, be doing at Apple? The Yale Daily News quoted unnamed Apple ""company insiders"" as saying Podolny would mastermind executive education programs within the computer company. This would not be a first for Silicon Valley. While the most famous corporate universities have been in industry and the service sectors, most notably the 47-year-old Hamburger University, which has trained generations of McDonald's managers, technology firms have taken this idea a stage further. Animation film studio Pixar -- where Apple boss Steve Jobs was formerly CEO -- runs a huge range of courses for staff at its own corporate university. Pixar University is intended to teach more than just the nuts and bolts of modern day computer animation, but to inspire employees' creativity with a wide range of classes, more than a dozen a week, which staff are permitted to miss work to attend. ""We offer the equivalent of a B.A. in fine arts through our courses,"" says Pixar University's dean, Randy Nelson.","Joel Podolny, dean of Yale School of Management, is to step down .

The fifth session of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is taking place in Seoul, where representatives from over 170 international parties will focus on reducing the demand for tobacco. High up the agenda are pricing and tax measures, proposals on limiting tobacco-growing areas, as well policies on economically viable alternatives to the crop. Delegates kick-started the proceedings Monday by adopting a new treaty setting the rules for fighting illegal trade in tobacco products. The procedures are being watched closely by the tobacco farming industry across the world. In the southeastern African country of Malawi, where tobacco is the top exports earner, many farmers are worried that some of the restrictions could be devastating for them and their communities. ""To stop growing tobacco would be like killing me and my whole family,"" said Steve Msambira, a Malawian farmer who has been growing tobacco for over four decades. ""I have been raised through this business -- I went to school, even my children, my brothers and sisters went to school because of growing tobacco,"" he added. Read: Oil search fuels tension over Lake Malawi . WHO says that the FCTC proposals are designed to help governments around the world deal with an expected decline in demand for tobacco. Some welcome the move. ""The point of the WHO convention is to say 'how do we help farmers?'"" said Yussuf Saloojee, from the National Council Against Smoking in South Africa. ""This provision is forward looking. It's saying, as fewer and fewer people smoke the demand for tobacco leaf will reduce and we will need to then provide farmers with an alternative way of earning a livelihood. ""The treaty does not wish to harm farmers -- in fact the treaty wants agriculture in Africa to prosper."" Watch: Creative solutions for Africa's farmers . But the International Tobacco Growers' Association (ITGA), which represents an estimated 30 million tobacco growers, sees the move by the WHO as a part of a wider anti-smoking campaign aimed at cutting tobacco production. ""Tobacco is an easy scapegoat,"" said Francois van der Merwe, Africa Chair of the ITGA. ""It's an industry where they can go in and regulate and tax and try to show the world that they are doing good and we do not accept that. ""We will keep on doing what we believe is right to do. It's a legal product with harmful effects so governments should rather focus their attention on educating people rather than going and trying and demonize the industry, drive extreme regulation, drive extreme taxation and now even right down to the most vulnerable in value chain, which are the farmers, the soft underbelly of the sector."" In Africa, it is estimated that there are more than one million tobacco farmers. Last May, farmers from across the continent declared their opposition to the plans, saying that they could hurt local economies and threaten jobs in many countries. In Malawi, seven out of 10 workers are either directly or indirectly employed by the sector and tobacco represents 70% of the landlocked country's foreign exchange earnings and 15% of its total GDP, according to the ITGA. This reliance on one export makes Malawi vulnerable, particularly when production levels decline. Last year, the country's export revenues fell as tobacco earnings declined 5.5% to $410 million as a result of lower prices and a poor quality crop, according to data from African Economic Outlook. The government is trying to reduce its dependence on tobacco by encouraging farming diversification into other crops and bolstering the tourism industry. ""My government is already on the program of diversifying away from tobacco,"" said Malawi's agriculture minister Peter Mwanza. ""But this is not something you can do overnight."" Malawi's head of state: 'Why I'm selling presidential jet' Commenting on the tobacco controls discussed at the Seoul convention, Mwanza said: ""Our view is the FCTC protocol, particularly Articles 17 and 18 ['Provision of support for economically viable alternative activities' and 'Protection of the environment and the health of persons' respectively], are rather unfair to Malawi and other tobacco-growing countries. He added: ""The best they could have done was to consult the farmers and also put up measures that would help for them to diversify away from tobacco. ""We are not opposed to people being protected from tobacco but if people are going to be hungry then they will die even faster than smoking because people would starve and they would have no income."" But for the anti-smoking lobby, growing tobacco only compounds the economic and social ills of countries like Malawi. ""Malawi has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,"" said Saloojee. ""Tobacco farming in Africa and in particular in Malawi is in crisis. It perpetuates poverty, it harms the environment, harms workers and is based on unfair labor practices -- child labor is rife on the tobacco farms in Malawi."" Read: Bin Laden bread a hit for Malawi bakers . The industry acknowledges child labor is used in the tobacco sector but says it is a problem being addressed. Bruce Munthali, chief exeutive of the Tobacco Control Commission of Malawi, said the practice is not only confined to tobacco growing. ""Child labor occurs in other commodities, mining, other commodities you can think of,"" he said. ""As an industry we have taken some corrective measures to address some of the concerns relating to child labor."" Msambira, who employs about 50 people, said he never uses children in his fields but relies on workers from nearby villages and Zimbabwe. He said he knows that tobacco offers him and his country an uncertain future, but for now he sees no alternative and doesn't believe the WHO is offering one. ""This is a good business,"" he said. ""No tobacco, no life in Malawi.""","WHO proposals to restrict tobacco farming threaten the industry, say farmers .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel insists the Interlagos circuit in Brazil that will host his Formula One title showdown with Fernando Alonso will suit Red Bull as he bids to secure a third successive world title. The German is tantalizingly close to matching a feat accomplished only twice in the sport's history, by Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher ,but failed to lock down the championship in Austin. The 25-year-old came second at the United States Grand Prix behind McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, Alonso finishing third to keep his hopes of a third career F1 crown alive. Now the teams head to Sao Paulo for the final race of the season, with Vettel needing only to finish in the top four to take title. And the double world champion has fired an ominous warning to his Spanish rival, claiming the Interlagos circuit is one that he likes, and one that suits his car. ""We know that the car works and that is a good basis to build on,"" he told a press conference after the first U.S. GP for five years. ""So I am looking forward to next weekend. I like that track and the track suits us and we have always done well there. I think anything can happen. ""We've been very quick in Brazil the last couple of years so plenty to look forward to. On top of that, we increased our lead in the championship so I think we are in the best possible position. ""We have been in the game long enough to know how quickly the winds can change -- not only for us -- but also for our competitors. ""What we have to do is go into the race as focused and as determined as we were this weekend. We have to squeeze everything possible out of the race!"" Alonso has a big fight on his hands to win his first world championship since 2006 and lost ground in Texas but he said Ferrari would be giving everything to spoil Vettel's history-making hat-trick. ""We will try to go to Brazil with the possibility to fight for the world championship which is something that we fight for all through the year and we arrived in that fantastic position,"" he said. ""Only Sebastian is in a better position than us but we should be proud of ourselves so try to enjoy the Brazil race and do our best, fight all the race and see what is the outcome at the end."" Alonso was given a helping hand at the Circuit of the Americas by his teammate Felipe Massa, after the gearbox on the Brazilian's car was deliberately broken, giving him a five-place grid penalty. That meant Alonso jumped from eighth on the grid to seventh and got to start on the clean side of the track rather than the dusty side near to the pit lane. It helped the Spaniard gain three places going into the first corner and though the move was seen as unsporting in some quarters, team boss Stefano Domenicali insisted it was made in the spirit of the rules. ""Yes, otherwise I wouldn't have done it,"" he told reporters. ""I prefer to be transparent. You can easily simulate something. I felt it was more correct to say the truth. ""When you work for the Ferrari team you know the team was the center of the decision. I have to thank Felipe for that. It is something that is within our possibility to do it. ""We knew before the race that the difference between the two sides of the grid was very high and we knew that if we were thinking of trying to achieve Brazil as the last race it would have been very important to be the front car for the first couple of laps otherwise the race would have been more difficult. ""I have to thank Felipe for that. He drove extremely well all weekend and this is something that is positive for Brazil because we need both our drivers doing a great race if we want to challenge Vettel to win the drivers' title.""","Sebastian Vettel insists the Interlagos track in Sao Paulo suits Red Bull team .

"New York (CNN) -- I have chosen 10 films which, I feel, begin to tell our stories in our own words and belong in the annals of international cinema. Some are classics, some are audience favorites, some reconnect us to our past, some reflect deep societal trends. They show Africa's unique brand of storytelling and add a distinct African flavor to modern and universal themes. They have swept me away. I am sure they will also touch you. Sex, Okra and Salted Butter (Mahamat Saleh Haroun, Chad/France, 2008, 81m) This is a must! A truly hilarious film that shows we Africans also like comedy and know how to turn the lens on ""the other."" Hortense, a 40-year-old nurse originally from the Ivory Coast, leaves her family for her lover, Jean-Paul, an oyster farmer in the area of Bordeaux, France. Her husband -- a macho, very traditional man -- sees his whole world turned upside down. His son, who turns out to be homosexual, the arrival of his sister-in-law from Abidjan, all provide many surprising and funny twists to the story. Guelwaar (Ousmane Sembene, Senegal, 1993, 115m) We revere Sembene, who is the master of storytelling. ""Guelwaar ""(""The noble one"") revolves around the mysterious death and disappearance after death, of a philandering patriarch and pillar of the local Christian community. Guelwaar's errant corpse was mistakenly buried in a Muslim cemetery. This sets off a tempest of bureaucratic red tape, family conflicts and religious factionalism, culminating in a tense standoff at the disputed grave site. Guelwaar is many films in one. Forgiveness (Ian Gabriel, South Africa, 2004, 112m) ""Forgiveness"" is the story of Tertius Coetzee, an ex-apartheid policeman, who resigned from the South African police force after giving evidence at the Truth and Reconciliation Hearings. He is tormented and his search for the family of one of the victims he ""eliminated"" triggers a ferocious series of revelations as events rapidly spiral out of control. Yeelen/Brightness (Souleymane CissÃ©, Mali, 1987, 105m) ""Yeelen"" is an adaptation of an ancient oral legend from Mali, and it is one the most acclaimed and widely seen African films ever made. An Oedipal story mixed with magic, Yeelen is visually stunning. Set in the powerful Mali Empire of the 13th century, Yeelen follows the journey of Nianankoro, a young warrior who must battle the powerful Komo cult. He travels through the arid Bambara, Fulani and Dagan lands of ancient Africa, as his own father, a corrupt wizard, uses his dark magic to try to destroy his son. Cosmic Africa (Craig and Damon Foster, South Africa, 2002, 72m) Astronomer Thebe Medupe embarks on a quest to reunite his science with the origins of celestial knowledge in Africa with these words: ""I know so much about the stars, yet I know so little about my own continent and how my people are connected to the sky."" His journey takes him to the ancestral lands of the Ju/'hoansi in Namibia, to the Dogon people of Mali, and deep into the Sahara, where a cosmic clock attests to the African origins of astronomy. A beautifully shot, densely layered meditation on the influence of the cosmos on our daily lives. The Colonial Misunderstanding (Jean Marie Teno, Cameron, 2004, 78m) We lost our own history. Teno reminds us in this documentary feature that we must reclaim ourselves and our heritage, through the knowledge of our traditional culture. This film sheds light on the complex and problematic relationship between colonization and European missionaries on the African continent. It reveals how colonialism destroyed African beliefs and social systems taking away our ""minds and souls"" and reveals that the genocide of the Herrero people was indeed a launching pad for the Second World War and is a neglected aspect of contemporary history. Mossane (Safi Faye, Senegal, 1996, 105m) I love this film. It is one of the most beautiful tragic love stories ever made! Faye's gorgeous film begins as a detailed study of contemporary, Wolof life and unfolds with the mounting force of ancient tragedy. Mossane, whose mythic beauty is tied to her family's future, has been betrothed to a rich man but is in love with Fara, a student with no prospects. Unable to follow her dreams and bound by tradition, Mossane takes action and tragedy ensues. Cuba: An African Odyssey (Jihan El Tahri, Egypt / South Africa, 2007, 118m) ""Cuba"" shows how a film can be incredibly informative about little-known historical facts and full of brilliant humor. It will also keep you on the edge of your seat. It is the previously untold story of Cuba's support for various African revolutions, one of the Cold War's most vigorous contests over resources and ideology. This film attempts to understand the world today through the saga of these Cuban fighters who won every battle but ultimately lost the war. HyÃ¨nes / Hyenas (Djibril Diop Mambety, Senegal, 1992, 113m) An extraordinary example of how a famous play by a Swiss author, Friedrich DÃ¼rrenmatt, ""The visit,"" set in Europe in the 1950s, can be revisited to fit the African landscape. An aging, wealthy woman returns to her village and lavishes luxuries in exchange for the murder of a shopkeeper who abandoned her after she became pregnant at 16. Hyenas adapt a timeless parable of human greed into a biting satire of today's Africa. Rostov Luanda (Abderrahmane Sissako, Mali/Mauritania, 1997, 70m) Director Sissako travels to Luanda, in search for his old friend, the Angolan freedom fighter Bari Banga and embarks with us on a voyage of discovery of the landscape and people of Angola. This is turbulent African history written in actual flesh and blood, as Sissako captures the painful stories of the habitues of all colors of the Biker Cafe, located in the heart of Luanda. The opinions in this piece are solely those of Mahen Bonetti.","Ten films chosen for exhibiting the words and voice of African people .

"(CNN) -- A former coal company executive pleaded guilty Thursday and identified his old boss as part of an effort to cover up safety violations before the worst U.S. mine disaster in decades. David Hughart, who was president of a Massey Energy subsidiary, pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts before a federal judge in Beckley, West Virginia. He's the highest-ranking official to admit wrongdoing in the investigation that followed the 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia, which killed 29 workers. The 53-year-old Hughart has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the ongoing probe stemming from the disaster, the worst American mining catastrophe since 1972, according to his plea agreement. Asked during his plea hearing who he conspired with above him, Hughart replied, ""The chief executive officer,"" CNN affilliate WCHS reported. Massey's former CEO, Don Blankenship, was an outspoken critic of federal mine regulators, but Hughart did not name him directly. In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Blankenship attorney William Taylor III said Blankenship ""did not conspire with anybody to do anything illegal or improper."" ""To the contrary, Don took every step to make the mines under his responsibility safer,"" Taylor said. ""We are not concerned about Mr. Hughart's recollections. People often remember untrue things when they are attempting to reduce a possible prison sentence."" Hughart faces up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine after admitting that he and others at Massey conspired to hide safety hazards inside the company's mines between 2000 and 2010 -- a period that spans Blankenship's time at the company's helm. His sentencing is set for June 25. His lawyer, Michael Whitt, would not comment on the statements made in court, and U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin told CNN through a spokesman, ""I'm not going to comment on the direction of the investigation."" Hughart was the president of Green Valley Resource Group, a different Massey subsidiary than the one that operated the Upper Big Branch mine. In his plea agreement, prosecutors state that he and others worked to conceal mine hazards from federal inspectors ""in part because of a belief that consistently following these laws would decrease coal production."" Massey was the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States and the largest mine operator in Appalachia at the time of the Upper Big Branch explosion. But it had racked up an extensive list of violations before the disaster, and a 2011 report by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration found that Massey had a history of ""systematic, intentional, and aggressive efforts"" to evade safety regulations. The company kept two sets of books to mislead miners and inspectors, tipped off crews before surprise inspections and intimidated workers to prevent them from reporting violations, the report found. Massey was bought by another company, Alpha Natural Resources, after the disaster. In December 2011, it settled with the Justice Department for a record $209 million in fines, penalties and compensation for families of the men killed at Upper Big Branch. 2010: Mine disaster board members survive attempt to oust them . Another Massey manager, Gary May, admitted helping conceal hazards from inspectors in 2012. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison in January.

"London (CNN) -- A year ago, Gisella Asante and her daughter Jan Asante found themselves standing in tears in the middle of broken glass, scattered clothes hangers, bits of wedding dresses and burnt pieces of fabric. Their small shop in south London had been targeted by a mob of looters during the city's worst riots in two decades. It happened a few days after they celebrated the 20th anniversary of opening their business -- Gisella's, a fashion workshop with designs inspired by the owners' African roots. In just a few hours of riot madness, Gisella and Jan Asante lost 20 years' worth of work. A display of valuable dresses made for high-profile celebrities: gone. Unique accessories, some from remote parts of the world: gone. Handmade jewelry: gone. Wedding dresses ready to be picked up by brides-to-be: gone. The overall loss is hard to estimate -- on top of all the things lost and damaged, business slowed down for months. ""We were boarded for three months, that's how long it took,"" Jan said. ""People thought we folded, it felt like we were in prison,"" Gisella added. They estimate a loss of £30-40,000 ($55,000-65,000), but say it's hard to put a number on it. ""The things are worth so much more. We made them all, they are irreplaceable,"" Jan said. Fast forward a year and the place looks like nothing had ever happened. The only visible reminder of last year's events is a couple of wooden boards leaning against the wall. They used to cover the smashed windows. Watch video: London riots one year on . Now they serve as a notice board, with pictures and supportive letters from customers that flooded the boutique after the riots. ""People sent messages, emails, they phoned to say they were sorry,"" Jan said. The reaction was overwhelming. ""A friend of mine had to come in for a week just to answer the phone and reply to messages. It was like bereavement."" The revival of the boutique is down to the Asantes' loyal customers. ""Lots of our regular customers made an effort to help. They didn't really need anything, and they would still come and buy something. Our customers are amazing,"" Jan said. There was a point, they say, when they wanted to leave the shop closed and walk away. But the customers kept coming. ""Having the customers, the work, it kept us going, we were on autopilot,"" Jan said. ""It was exactly as the British say: 'Keep calm and carry on.'"" Thank-you notes from clients are displayed all around Gisella's. Many include wedding and honeymoon photos, as the boutique has long been a hotspot for brides who want something special. ""For the brides, weddings are about culture,"" Jan said. ""They want to express their heritage, even if they are very modern, and they always ask us how they can show where they come from and who they are."" The traditional-meets-modern is the key to their success. Gisella, originally from Tanzania, came to London from Kenya, where her daughter Jan was born to a Ghanaian father. It may sound complicated, but the multicultural heritage of the two women is exactly what makes their clothes special. ""We are inspired by modern Africa,"" Jan said. ""We consider ourselves African, but are also Londoners, and that shows in our designs."" Their dresses are a mixture of modern cuts, African-inspired prints and precious fabrics from all around the world. Picking up a beautifully shaped dress, Jan points out the fabric. It comes from a remote area in Nigeria, where it was handmade. Together with a Western-style cut, it makes for a special piece of couture. ""I always talk to our customers about the story behind fabrics,"" she said. ""It's nice to walk around knowing where your clothes came from."" The mother-daughter pair work as a team. Jan talks to the customers and prepares the designs, while Gisella is the one cutting the fabric and sewing. The workshop is strictly divided in two zones. Each woman has her own territory, where she rules. They say it works perfectly, even though they both admit there are clashes from time to time. ""She is my mum, you always have to do what your mum tells you to,"" Jan admitted. ""But we are also business partners. We have to negotiate and agree on everything. Sometimes it stretches your relationship to the limits."" On the one-year anniversary of the looting the boutique was unusually quiet, and there was time for reflection. ""I couldn't ask for a better daughter,"" Gisella said, doubting she would have been able to cope without her during the long months of recovery. Then suddenly, she turned to Jan and said: ""You have more strength than I thought you have. I've seen you rise so much. I am proud of you -- I never had the time to tell you.""","""Gisella's"" boutique in London was destroyed by looters in last year's riots .

"(CNN) -- They are the ""big four"" of men's tennis: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Between them they have won every grand slam title since the start of 2010, and 30 of the last 31 dating back to 2005. However, there is a groundswell of opinion that four will become two in 2013, as No. 1 Djokovic and third-ranked Murray continue their ascendance while their older rivals fall away. ""With Nadal being seriously injured and Federer not getting any younger, I see the top two players being Djokovic and Murray, they have time on their side,"" six-time grand slam champion Becker told CNN ahead of the Australian Open. Nadal has not played competitively since last year's Wimbledon in July, struck down by recurring knee problems. A stomach virus then prevented the Spaniard's comeback in 2013's opening grand slam in Melbourne, which starts on Monday. It is the second extended injury layoff of the 26-year-old's remarkable career. After similar problems in 2009 he returned with a vengeance, claiming five more grand slams for 11 in total, including the French Open title last year for a record seventh time . Federer is still going strong in his 32nd year, and during 2012 regained his No.1 spot in the rankings after winning his record 17th grand slam by claiming the Wimbledon title. Djokovic beat the Swiss maestro in the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in London in November as he went back to the top of the global tree, also beating Murray in their round robin group match. Federer then upset home favorite Murray in the semifinals, and former world No. 4 Greg Rusedski told CNN that his performances during last season had ""defied logic"" after appearing to be on the decline in 2011. Murray, buoyed by his gold medal victory over Federer in the Olympic final and his later U.S. Open success, was expected to beat him again at the O2 Arena, but instead was swept aside in their last four clash. The Scot had been set to again battle with his longtime friend Djokovic, with whom he had a series of classic matches in 2012. The first came in the semifinals of the Australian Open, beaten in five sets by the Serbian, who then overcame Nadal in another marathon six-hour encounter -- the longest grand slam final in history. It was similar fare at Flushing Meadows in September, where Murray turned the tables for his first triumph in the tennis majors, but having to go the full distance after Djokovic battled back from two sets down in the longest final in the tournament's history. And there was yet more to come at the Shanghai Masters, where the pair contested another final where the standard of tennis was of the very highest order. Djokovic survived five match points to conjure up another remarkable win, but for Becker it was the signal of a possible changing of the guard. ""It was an absolute classic,"" the German legend said. ""It used to be Federer versus Nadal, now it's Murray versus Djokovic and they are both only 25 years of age."" Murray told CNN that the reason for such close matches is their familiarity with each other's game. ""We can anticipate what each other is going to do,"" he said at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi in late December. The pair have been friends and arch-rivals since entering the junior circuits of the world at 11 years of age and Murray has seen his rival develop to become the best in the world. ""He has very few weaknesses, great ground strokes, serves well, his returns perhaps the best in the world, moves so well and he now has a lot of belief in himself,"" Murray said. Even though it was at his expense, Djokovic was pleased for Murray when he finally snapped his grand slam duck at the U.S. Open because ""many people had questioned his qualities."" ""It was great to see that and hopefully our rivalry can develop over the next year,"" two-time Mubadala champion Djokovic said of Murray, who shares the same birth month -- May. But others believe it would be dangerous to write off Federer and Nadal just yet. Neil Harman, the tennis correspondent of The Times of London, said he was looking forward to normal service being resumed in 2013. ""It should never be underestimated what Federer has done for the game, and he shows no sign of going away,"" Harman told CNN. ""And I'm looking forward to Nadal returning at his best ."" The rivalry of the big four and their near total dominance of the slams has helped fuel the incredible global interest in tennis despite the economic downturn, with increased prize money, commercial revenues and crowds. Despite Nadal's absence, record attendances are predicted at the Melbourne Tennis Center over the next fortnight as Djokovic and Murray bid to live up to Becker's prediction and Federer does his level best to prove him wrong.","Novak Djokovic looking to defend his Australian Open title later this month .

"Diyarbakir, Turkey (CNN) -- Thousands took to the streets Thursday in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, Turkey, to mourn three political activists killed last week in execution-style shootings in France. The women were saluted as the ""three flowers of Kurdistan"" by a mourner using a sound system atop a bus, while some carried portraits of the victims or signs reading ""Sakine Cansiz is immortal.""

In what appeared to be a sign of good will, Turkish authorities allowed the bodies of the three women, all Turkish citizens, to be repatriated from France. Brigades of Turkish riot police armed with machine guns and gas masks fanned out across the grounds Thursday where mourners were gathered, even as Kurdish politicians denounced Turkey's prime minister and some carried portraits of Ocalan. Kurdish leaders said they, too, were working to reduce tensions in the wake of the killings. ""Here the people of of Kurdistan, by claiming ownership of these three revolutionary women, are showing that they will not fall prey to provocation,"" said Sebahat Tuncel, a member of Turkey's parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party. ""We showed our attitude beyond any doubt, that we are for peace, for freedom, and for a democratic and peaceful resolution of the Kurdish issue."" In recent days, the Turkish military bombed suspected PKK camps in the Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq. On Wednesday, a Turkish police officer was killed in ""an armed attack on a police car,"" according to the office of the governor of the southeastern province of Mardin. ""They say peace on the one hand, but then they bomb Qandil. In short, we have no trust left in the prime minister,"" said a middle-aged Kurdish man attending Thursday's funeral demonstration. The man asked not to be identified for security reasons. ""The peace process has already been stalled. It didn't even begin."" The atmosphere in Diyarbakir was subdued Thursday, with nearly every shop shuttered, in a citywide shutdown coinciding with the funeral demonstration. Kurdish politicians from the BDP told CNN they would accompany the bodies of the three murdered women to their hometowns of Maras, Tunceli, and Adana for burial later this week.","Three Kurdish political activists were killed execution-style in France, authorities say .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As Bangladesh mourns the death of more than 100 workers killed in a factory fire over the weekend, attention is turning to the labels found among the charred debris and what role they could have played in preventing the worst industrial disaster in the country's history. The factory, owned by Tazreen Fashions, produced clothing for U.S. supermarket giant Wal-Mart, European clothing retailer C&A and produced garments for several other companies, including Hong Kong sourcing firm Li & Fung. It is just one of about 4,500 apparel factories in Bangladesh that employ an estimated 3.4 million workers, usually young women who work long hours dyeing, cutting and stitching for a minimum wage of approximately $43 a month. Campaigners say that workers' safety is being put at risk by the complex and fragmented nature of global supply chains used by many of the world's top clothing brands, which largely rely on cheap labor to turn a profit. In some cases, companies are unsure which factories are producing the clothing that ends up in their stores, making it impossible for a brand to know whether safety standards are being met. And workers' rights groups say factory bosses in places like Bangladesh often have little incentive to improve working conditions when contracts are short and orders not always renewed. ""You have this dilemma where the factory doesn't have the funds to improve the factory or there is no faithful relationship (with the supplier),"" Judy Gearhart, executive director of the International Rights Labor Forum told CNN. ""They don't know if they are going to have the order from Wal-Mart three years down the road. They don't know if they are going to be able to make the investment. ""It's really the whole problem we have with global supply chains. The global brands have taken a distance from the responsibility of the workers that actually make the product."" Wal-Mart said in a statement to CNN that a supplier had subcontracted work to Tazreen ""without authorization and in direct violation of our policies."" It added that it had ended its relationship with that supplier and would ""continue to work across the apparel industry to improve safety education and training in Bangladesh."" C&A said it had placed an order for 220,000 sweaters, its first commission with Tazreen, and has sent a representative to Bangladesh to see how the company can help the victims. Li & Fung, which used the factory to make clothes for other brands, has offered $1,200 in compensation to each family of every victim. But fires like the one at Tazreen are all too commonplace, campaign groups say. According to Sanjiv Pandita, executive director at the Asia Monitor Resource Centre, more than 500 garment workers have died due to factory fires since 2006. Emergency exits are few in number and those often blocked by work in progress and poorly signposted. The Bangladeshi government has ordered the police, fire service and civil defense authorities to begin investigations into the cause of the fire and the deaths. In the meantime, Minister for Labor and Employment Rajiuddin Ahmed Raju said that his ministry had ordered the closure of clothing factories which do not have more than one emergency exit. ""I'll sit with the senior officials of the ministry tomorrow (Wednesday) and form a committee to identify the factories which do not have an adequate number of emergency exits,"" he told CNN. ""We've seen many factories have storage of fabrics or other things blocking the emergency exits. We've asked the factory authorities to remove all those (items) immediately,"" Raju said. It's a problem that goes beyond Bangladesh. Despite decades of campaigning by labor groups and tighter legislation, factories across Asia have proved to be deathtraps for their workers. A fire at a garment factory in Karachi in October killed almost 300 workers, making it the worst factory disaster in Asia since a Thai blaze killed 188 toy factory hands in 1993. Pandita says the efforts by brands to improve working conditions are largely ""cosmetic"" and says the root of the problem lies in weak enforcement of health and safety legislation in places like Bangladesh. ""The government doesn't have the capacity right now. The number of factory inspectors who need to visit the factories is far too low."" Bangladeshi minister Raju admitted that the shortage of inspectors was a challenge. ""Certainly, I'll try to increase the manpower, but at the same time I can say that this problem can't be resolved overnight,"" he said. In this vacuum, Pandita says, a patchy system of voluntary self-regulation has emerged where image-conscious brands insist on safety audits conducted by private companies. However, he says that in some cases factories obtain certification that leads to little concrete change on the factory floor. For example, Ali Enterprises, the owner of a Karachi factory that caught ablaze in October, had passed an inspection by an Italian company in August. ""Instead of strengthening core institutions, people think we can do it through a self-regulatory mechanism,"" he said. ""We can see it hasn't worked."" The fires in Bangladesh and Pakistan have come as many garment makers move their production away from China, where wages are rising, says Maurizio Bussi, director of the International Labor Organization's Decent Work Team in south-east Asia. Unlike other industries like car manufacturing, the garment trade is highly mobile with low start-up costs, so companies move from country to country in search of the cheapest pool of labor, he said. As such, it's often the first rung on the industrial ladder for many poor countries like Bangladesh that have a large but low-skilled workforce. ""This is part of the natural business dynamics of a very price sensitive sector such as the garment industry,"" he said. ""Is this exposing workers to additional risk? In a sense yes -- because the systems that protect workers in these countries are not as well developed and will require further engagement and commitment from governments, local employers and foreign investors.""

"(CNN) -- Penguins didn't always come in black and white, paleontologists said Thursday, citing the discovery of a 36-million-year-old fossil of a bird that, in its day, waddled nearly 5 feet tall. A specimen found in Peru showed that at least some of the giant penguin's feathers were reddish brown and gray, said a University of Texas at Austin paleontologist who was the lead author of a paper appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science. The new species, ""Inkayacu paracasensis,"" or ""Water King,"" was bigger than the Emperor penguin, the largest living penguin now. ""Before this fossil, we had no evidence about the feathers, colors and flipper shapes of ancient penguins. We had questions and this was our first chance to start answering them,"" paleontologist Julia Clarke said in a statement. The color pattern of living penguins is a more recent innovation, said scientists. The fossil shows the flipper and feather shapes that evolved early to make them such powerful swimmers. The fossil also has preserved evidence of scales and feathers. Bird feathers get some of their colors from the size, shape and arrangement of nanoscale structures called melanosomes, the report said. Modern penguins and the fossil differed in the formation of melanosomes. Inkayacu paracasensis was discovered in 2007 by Peruvian student Ali Altamirano in Paracas National Reserve, researchers said. The National Geographic Society, which along with the National Science Foundation, provided funding for the research, said it's not exactly clear why modern penguins come in black and white. Perhaps it was a response to the rise of new penguin predators, such as seals, said Clarke, according to National Geographic. In a phenomenon called countershading, modern penguins' white bellies camouflage the birds against the sky, at least from the vantage point of a swimming predator looking up. To a predator looking down, a penguin's black back vaguely matches the dark depths below.","Fossil of giant penguin found in Peru .

"(CNN) -- Chris Pirillo is many things: a self-proclaimed geek, a blogger, an entrepreneur -- and according to him, an average gamer. The 38-year-old founder of blogging network Lockergnome loves the casual game. The pick-it-up, put-it-down, stress-free app. Pirillo has played his share of games like ""Cube Runner"" and ""A Monster Ate My Homework."" He even jumped on the ""Words with Friends"" bandwagon, but found the Scrabble-like game to be a little too much work. ""The problem with games is they're usually so overly complex. If I can't figure it out within a minute, I move on,"" said the Seattle resident, who is an occasional CNN.com contributor. ""And you know, there are lot more people like me than people who would take a lot of time to get into a game."" Then came ""Draw Something."" Pirillo came across the game -- a digital variation on Pictionary, with a dash of Hangman -- recently while browsing the latest apps on his iPad. He downloaded it, connected to Facebook and started playing. He was instantly hooked. Now Pirillo easily blows through a couple of hours a night playing the game. ""What draws people is the drawing,"" Pirillo said with a laugh. ""Everyone likes to doodle. Who doesn't like to doodle? It's fun, it's easy, it doesn't take any thinking. Not any, but just a little."" The app, created and released by gaming developer OMGPop, has enjoyed unbelievable success in its short life. It has attracted more than 35 million users in the two months since its release -- a remarkable amount for a game that has no clear-cut winners, losers or ""Angry Birds""-like levels of achievement. ""Draw Something"" spent weeks as the No. 1 free app on the iPad and iPhone, and OMGPop was snapped up last month by Zynga, the king of the social-gaming industry, for about $200 million. How it works . Playing the game is simple once you scan your social-network contacts for someone to play with. The app gives you three choices of things to draw; you pick a word and then draw it with your finger on the touchscreen, using the basic colors provided in the app. Your friend hopefully deciphers your picture and guesses it correctly, then draws a picture for you in return. The back and forth continues in an addictive cycle. There's no winner; instead, players work together to build streaks of correctly guessed drawings. Dan Porter, former CEO of OMGPop turned a vice president of Zynga, said they were inspired to create something that was close to a party game -- targeted at everyone and not too competitive. ""We wanted to be that game that was on the phone of the people who had no other games on their phone,"" Porter said. ""We thought it would do well. But we were shocked that it did this well."" The point system complements the easygoing nature of the game. Players have the ability to pick from a list of three words, which range in difficulty. Harder words are worth more virtual coins, which can be cashed in for features or hints within the game. What's interesting is how these points work. The person drawing gets coins if the other player guesses it correctly. The person guessing is given the same number of coins for guessing it. Pirillo thinks this system is very intelligent. ""It's not a competition, it's about collaboration,"" he said. ""You owe it to the other person as a player to get what's in your head."" This may be a factor of why the game is thriving in more than 80 countries, in the hands of people of all ages. Porter thinks Zynga's support and infrastructure will enable them to make significant improvements to the game -- such as incorporating a chat feature or letting players save their drawings within the app. Currently, players must use the screen-grab function on their phone or tablet to save images of their drawings. A game of leisure . Varsha Swamy, a 50-year-old mother of two and the manager of Studio One Eighty Nine in Mumbai, India, was invited to play the game on her iPad by her daughters in the United States. She says the main appeal of ""Draw Something"" is that it's a game of leisure, as opposed to a game like ""Scramble with Friends"" where you are working against the clock. ""You're relaxed, you're playing it at your own time and pace, you erase it, then you draw it again,"" she said with a laugh. Players say being able to draw a word at their own pace, in whatever style they choose, opens new windows of creativity and self-expression. To Swamy, it's also a window into your partner's mind. ""When you're drawing, you're illustrating what you're thinking,"" she explained. This thought process is visible in full when playing the game, which shows your drawing being created, line by line, as your partner tries to guess what it is. Once a line is off your fingertip and onto the digital canvas, there is no retracting it -- you can erase and start over, although the entire process, including all your mistakes, will be recreated for your partner as well. This is unnerving to a number of people, especially if they feel their artistic skills are not up to par. Swamy admits that she didn't like the game at first because she doesn't consider herself to be a great artist. ""I think what inhibits people from maybe playing a lot of this game is their drawing skills,"" she said. But that didn't stop her from trying. ""Once I got used to it and figured out all the colors and the thickness of the pen and stuff, I realized I could do a lot of things."" Users agree that, like Pictionary, success at ""Draw Something"" is not about artistic talent but about providing the right clues for the other person. ""I think anybody who can draw a face -- not a proper face, but two dots and a nose and a smile, can play,"" said Swamy, who has hit a streak of 80 correctly guessed drawings in one of her games. Lost in translation? Words and celebrities from present-day popular culture -- say, Twitter, or Rihanna -- make the game refreshing for some players. For others, they're more of a hurdle. Even Pirillo, some years younger than Swamy, said he has trouble guessing words like ""Lil' Wayne,"" the rapper. He also wouldn't play the word ""Android"" for his mother. ""I don't know if she would have the same cultural language everyone else has,"" Pirillo said. The game's American-centric cultural references also throw some international players off. To Swamy, ""football"" does not mean the same thing in Europe or India as it does in America, and the word ""Tebowing"" results in a mental blank. Twenty-one-year-old Rodrigo Llorente of Madrid faces similar cultural and lingual battles daily on ""Draw Something."" ""Some of [the words] are weird,"" the Icade University student said. ""But you can check them in the dictionary."" That doesn't discourage Llorente from playing. In fact, he finds it a great learning experience. ""This is helpful for learning more English, which is very good in my opinion,"" he said. ""Enjoyment plus knowledge is great."" Zynga's Porter addressed some of these issues when speaking with CNN. ""I would love to do more stuff that is relevant for an international audience,"" he said. ""We are about to put a slew of famous footballers in the game for the Euro Cup, for example."" A new way to connect . Meanwhile, ""Draw Something"" players continue to share their scribbled masterpieces, their private doodles and their sometimes embarrassing trains of thought. Players say that while you can play with strangers, the game is a unique and intimate way to communicate with parents, significant others and kids. Swamy loves playing with her daughter, and even her daughter's boyfriend, in the United States. For her, it's a new way of keeping in touch with loved ones who are far away. Pirillo, who has hit round 79 with his wife, sees ""Draw Something"" as a different way of connecting to someone you know so well. ""I am not much of an artist, but I am learning more how to make people laugh in the game,"" Porter said. ""I also like to play with my sons Miles and Joshua, as it gives me a window into how they think."" Porter saves and cherishes many of their drawings.","""Draw Something,"" a hit mobile game, lets players take turns drawing, guessing objects .

"(CNN) -- An international scientific expedition has revealed a South Pacific island roughly the size of Manhattan and clearly marked on online maps and marine charts does not, in fact, exist. The 'undiscovery' of the island -- which until now was midway between Australia and New Caledonia -- highlights how much there still is to learn about the oceans, scientists say. ""We saw this mysterious island on all the scientific maps and weather maps but not on this one navigational chart that was on our ship,"" Ph.D student Sabin Zahirovic, part of the research team on board the RV Southern Surveyor, told CNN. ""So we decided to go see if it was actually there."" The ship didn't find an island . The island, identified as Sandy Island by Google Maps and Sable Island on others, was supposed to be quite large in size -- 156 square kilometers (60 square miles) -- but the ship sailed right through the area where the island was supposed to be. 7 places that inspire gratitude . ""The captain was actually quite nervous because the island was showing up on all the maps,"" Zahirovic said. The undiscovery was made during the ship's voyage this month. Although the team had originally planned to check out the existence of the island during the day, they had arrived at the location of the island at night due to a navigational error. ""We were watching all of our depth-sounding equipment. Luckily for us the sea floor turned out to be very deep there,"" said Zahirovic, who is studying the tectonic evolution of the eastern Coral Sea. The implications are significant . Although the undiscovery of the island was not part of the original research mission of the international team of scientists led by University of Sydney's Dr. Maria Seton, the implications of the wrong maps are significant. ""All the scientific cartography relies on these maps, and numerical simulations of waves and currents depend on size of these land forms,"" said Zahirovic. Eat like a local: Share your picks . ""It just goes to show the oceans are so underexposed. It's actually really shocking that we haven't not found more islands."" When asked about the Google Maps mistake, a Google spokesperson told CNN that keeping on top of changes is a ""never-ending endeavor,"" and that Google will continuously explore ways to integrate new information from users.","The island shows up on the maps between Australia and New Caledonia .

"(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning. Park officials used 10 tracking dogs to hunt for the brazen black bear, which wandered into a heavily-populated campsite overnight. They established a scent trail by late afternoon, said spokesman Randy Hampton of Colorado Parks and Wildlife. At the end of the trail, they discovered a 200-pound  bear that matched the description of the one involved in the early morning attack. It was shot and killed. Officials had said earlier they would have to kill the bear, pointing to the bold and aggressive behavior it exhibited when it wandered into the site with so many campers. The incident occurred in an encampment filled with hundreds of people participating in a bow-hunting event, Hampton said. ""We manage wild bears for a healthy and thriving population,"" said Dan Prenzlow, regional manager for wildlife with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. ""But when an individual bear enters a tent and attacks a sleeping person, we manage that animal to protect the public safety."" The bear entered a tent occupied by a teenage boy and at least one other person early Friday. It bit the boy on the leg, but the teen fought it off.  The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site. Wildlife officials who responded to the scene determined that the black bear had been poking around the campsite before it attacked the teenage boy.  Investigators said they found a ransacked cooler and evidence that food had been eaten before the bear entered the tent. The teenager was taken to a hospital in nearby Leadville, Colorado, Hampton said.  He was treated for deep lacerations on one of his legs and released.  He is expected to recover but will receive followup treatment. The boy, identified as 13-year-old Rick Voss, told CNN affiliate KUSA that the bear stop attacking him and ran after another camper who ran away. ""I got lucky. If he didn't run for help ... luckily the bear chased him. The bear kept getting more and more aggressive and I didn't think I would have lived if he didn't run,"" Voss told the affiliate. Hampton estimated that there are 12,000 black bears on Colorado's 23 million acres of public land.  There are no known brown bears or grizzlies in the state. Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.  But park officials said the man, who was hiking with his wife, surprised the female grizzly while she was with her cubs.  They determined that she was acting defensively and decided not to put the bear down. CNN's Nigel Walwyn contributed to this report.","Black bear enters a tent and bites a teenage boy in the leg .

"Crystal River, Florida (CNN) -- With the utmost care and a healthy dose of respect, Monica Ross brought the pontoon boat to a crawl, shut its engine down, and asked for quiet. She was careful not to disturb the small antenna, which floated on the surface of the Crystal River marking the location of Coral, an 800 pound manatee. ""She is in a nice, quiet cove. Perfect spot to be resting,"" said Ross, a marine biologist with Sea to Shore Alliance. ""Nice and protected ... for now,"" she said. For now. These are uncertain days on the Crystal River, where boat tours take folks out to see the sea creatures, and where people can swim with them. Knowing where these endangered manatees are will help marine biologists, if Deepwater Horizon oil makes its way into these waters where about 1,000 manatees reside. ""We do know that the oil is toxic and depending on how weathered it is, it can have a lot of harmful effects if manatees come in contact with it,"" said Patrick Rose, executive director of Save the Manatee Club. ""Everything from coating their skin to getting in their eyes, to being ingested ... We don't know specifically because it's not been documented ... never happened as far as I know,"" he said. Is there oil near you? Share your story . In winter, the gentle creatures -- sometimes called ""sea cows"" because of their underwater bucolic nature but actually more closely related to elephants -- congregate in the warm waters of the rivers, estuaries and springs along the Florida Gulf Coast. But in summer, manatees frequently leave the close confines of their winter spas and spread out along the Gulf Coast to Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana and around the Florida Keys up the Atlantic coast. With the population more widespread, would-be rescuers face a difficult task. Long the victims of accidental boat strikes and careless boaters, the West Indian manatee population in the Gulf of Mexico stands at about 5,000, experts believe. This past winter's extended cold wiped out almost 10 percent of their number. And while everyone is hoping for the best, federal and state officials as well as environmental groups are planning for the worst. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the lead agency protecting manatees and other wildlife from the oil. ""We don't know how detrimental it will be if they inhale it, if they ingest it, if they're foraging in areas where sea grass has been oiled,"" said Nicole Adimey, the manatee oil spill response coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ""We have no idea how that's going to impact them,"" she said. The Fish and Wildlife Service says that as its staff monitors the flow of the black crude across the Gulf, they will use aerial flights to monitor manatees and other wildlife. They hope to have about 72 hours to respond to save manatees unknowingly swimming in the path of the oil -- including physically moving these mammals, which can reach 10 feet long and weigh 1,200 pounds. Rescue teams are staging gear and will be ready to move in if necessary to try and capture manatees in distress. But rescuing large numbers of manatees has never been done before. Is it realistic to capture large numbers of the sometimes uncooperative mammal? ""I don't know the answer to that question but we're going to move as many as we possibly can,"" said Adimeyr. ""If we had to move dozens, and it was a situation where we needed to move dozens, then I think we've been assured that we can get the resources, the extra hands that we need to do that,"" she said. Adimey said that if manatees come into contact with oil, they will be cleaned with dish soap to break it up and to clean the surface of their bodies. They will be transported to one of two de-oiling stations -- the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Institute for Marine Mammals Studies, in Gulfport, Mississippi. Additional facilities in Florida include the Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park, Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa and the Miami Seaquarium. Once medically cleared, the animal will be transported to a long-term holding facility at Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park just south of the Crystal River Preserve, where many manatees have found a haven. According to the federal plan, no manatees will be released back into the wild until the threat of oil contamination is over. And even then, experts hope the seagrass beds and vegetation that manatees eat aren't destroyed by the oil. Experts say they have a large network of people working together in partnerships, but accounting for every situation, and every scenario is doubtful. ""Capturing, rescuing hundreds of manatees, it's never been done,"" said Patrick Rose of Save the Manatee. ""We would lose manatees, I believe, if those kinds of numbers of manatees are involved.""","Experts estimate manatee population in Gulf at about 5,000 .

"(CNN) -- The man in charge of ensuring the safety of miners at West Virginia's Upper Big Branch coal mine pleaded guilty Thursday to charges that he helped conceal hazardous conditions from federal inspectors. Gary May is the highest-ranking executive of former mine owner Massey Energy charged in connection with an April 2010 explosion that killed 29 miners. He could be sentenced to up to five years in prison and fined $250,000 for conspiring to defraud the federal government, the U.S. attorney's office in Charleston said. As part of his plea agreement, May has agreed to cooperate with the investigation into the worst U.S. mining accident in decades. ""I'm pleased that Mr. May is cooperating with our investigation,"" U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said in a statement on Thursday's plea. ""We hope he can give us a better picture of what was going on at this company."" In court Thursday, May admitted to tipping off mine managers that inspectors from the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration were on their way, allowing them to clean up hazards like poor airflow and piles of loose coal that would have led to citations and fines. He also admitted to falsifying safety records and telling miners to rewire a device that monitored flammable methane gas levels, allowing mine equipment to run illegally, prosecutors said. ""People who run coal mines have a fundamental obligation to be honest with mine regulators,"" Goodwin said. ""When mine operators resort to tricks and deceit to keep government officials in the dark, our mine safety system unravels and miners are put in harm's way. The least we can do for coal miners is protect the integrity of the laws designed to keep them safe."" May faces an August 9 sentencing hearing in Beckley, West Virginia. The Upper Big Branch explosion was the worst U.S. mine disaster since 1972, when 91 men died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. In a December report, MSHA found a methane ignition that set off flammable coal dust was the immediate cause of the 2010 explosion, but it also blamed the ""unlawful policies and practices"" of Massey Energy, which it said ""promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety."" Massey kept two sets of books to mislead federal inspectors and its own workers about hazards in the mine, and had twice as many accidents as it reported to regulators, the report concluded. The company failed to conduct adequate inspections, intimidated workers to prevent them from reporting violations and tipped off crews to surprise inspections, MSHA found. Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey in 2011 and has agreed to a $209 million settlement to avoid prosecution. The deal includes payments of $1.5 million to each family that lost a member in the Upper Big Branch mine. An earlier state investigation found the mine lacked adequate ventilation; water sprays on equipment were not properly maintained and failed to function as they should have; and the mining company didn't meet federal and state safety standards for the application of rock dust, a crucial tool in keeping highly volatile coal dust from exploding. Massey Energy -- whose former CEO, Don Blankenship, was an outspoken critic of federal regulators -- disputed that report, saying the blast probably occurred when natural gas flooded into the mine. MSHA said that investigators considered that explanation but that it didn't fit the facts.","Gary May pleaded guilty to hiding safety violations from inspectors .

"(CNN) -- His glittering cricket career may have ended in an anticlimax on Monday, but Ricky Ponting will be remembered as one of the game's greats, according to one of his first opponents on the international stage. Ponting made just eight runs as Australia suffered a crushing defeat by South Africa in the third and final Test in Perth at the venue where he made his debut in the five-day format 17 years ago. Set an unlikely 632 to win, the home side lost by 309 runs as the tourists retained the world No. 1 ranking and became the first team to win consecutive series in Australia since the West Indies in 1992-93. It is a measure of how far Australia's cricketing fortunes have fallen since Ponting was named cricketer of the decade for 2000-09 by the respected Cricinfo website, having guided his country to a record 48 Test victories before standing down from the captaincy in 2011. He has played in a record 108 Test wins overall from 168 appearances -- equaling Australia's highest number of caps along with Steve Waugh -- and is the second-highest run scorer in both the five-day and limited-overs formats. David Richardson, now the chief executive of the International Cricket Council, played against Ponting when the batsman made his international debut in a one-day match against South Africa in February 1995. ""His contribution to the international game has been immense and quite rightly he will be remembered as one of the true legends of the sport,"" Richardson said of Ponting, who ranks behind only Don Bradman in Australia's list of batting greats and is the only player to have won the ICC's cricketer of the year award twice in a row. ""He was the most successful captain in the history of Test cricket and was the first player to feature in 108 Test match victories. He also steered Australia to two ICC Cricket World Cup triumphs -- as well as playing in a third -- during which time they set a record of 34 consecutive victories: yet another record. ""Ricky was a team man but along the way collected many personal accolades. We wish him well in the next stage of his career and look forward to his ongoing involvement in the game beyond the boundary."" Ponting took over from Waugh as Australia's Test captain in 2004, two years after he claimed the role in the one-day team. However, Australia's dominance gradually waned and the writing was on the wall for Ponting when he lost an Ashes series to old rivals England for the third time in 2010-11 on home soil. He stayed on as captain for the 2011 World Cup but stood down after a quarterfinal exit, vowing to improve his batting form. Ponting scored 13,378 Test runs at an average of 51.85, compiling 41 centuries, but he made just 32 at 6.40 in his final series as he struggled to regain his past heights. ""I have put a lot of pressure on myself to perform, it has always been about big games and big series for me,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""I haven't been able to deal with it as well of late as I would like to. Normally when those big moments come around I have been able to find something, and I haven't been able to do that for a while now."" Ponting was given a standing ovation by the 7,000 crowd at the WACA ground, and the South Africans performed a guard of honor as he went to the crease for his final innings. ""He is the player I respect most,"" said Proteas captain Graeme Smith. ""It was a sign of respect from us for someone who has given the game so much. All of us will miss Ricky as an opponent."" Australia will next start a three-Test series against Sri Lanka in Ponting's home state of Tasmania on December 14 -- five days before his 38th birthday.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting suffers big defeat in his final Test appearance .

"(CNN) -- A federal jury on Monday convicted an Arkansas doctor in a February 2009 car bomb attack on the head of the state's medical board, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Randeep Mann will face up to life in prison when he is sentenced later, said Cherith Beck, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Court records show Mann's trial began July 6. Jurors convicted Mann on seven counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction against a person and property, and using an explosive resulting in personal injury. Dr. Trent Pierce, a family practitioner, suffered serious injuries in the attack and lost an eye, but survived. He was leaving his home in West Memphis, Arkansas, headed to his clinic when a bomb went off as he approached his Lexus hybrid SUV. The blast, heard a mile away, threw Pierce 6 feet into a flower bed. KARK reports on the Arkansas bombing . Mann, whose specialty was internal medicine and pain management, had ""multiple disciplinary matters"" before the state medical board, federal prosecutors said. Early in the investigation, authorities focused on cases before the board, which oversees licensing of those in medical professions and can discipline professionals by suspending or revoking their licenses in some cases. Mann's wife, Sangeeta ""Sue"" Mann, was convicted of conspiring with her husband to conceal evidence and obstruct the investigation, Beck said. She will face up to 20 years in prison when she is sentenced. Authorities said Mann was interviewed by federal agents on the day of the bombing and showed them ""at least one grenade launcher he legally owned.""

"(CNN) -- Word that a teenager climbed aboard a whale for a ride has sent Australian officials to the beach, to warn others not to try such a stunt. ""Adult southern right whales can reach 18 meters (59 feet) in length and weigh up to 80 tons. If you are in the way of a tail slap or when it breaches, you are unlikely to survive,"" said Mike Shephard, a district manager for the Australian Department of Environment and Conservation. A witness said the whale rider boarded a southern right whale on Friday afternoon about 20 meters (66 feet) off Middleton Beach, in the Western Australian city of Albany, the environmental agency said. The witness took a photograph and was to turn it over to authorities. But authorities will not release the image, because it will be part of the investigation, a spokeswoman for the agency said Monday afternoon. No further leads had emerged, she said. ""Southern right whales come close to shore to rest and to allow calves to gain strength in calm waters. Disturbance or physical contact with them, either deliberate or accidental, not only distresses the whales, but also could result in a tragic outcome for a foolhardy person,"" the environmental agency said in a news release. People risk a $10,000 AUD ($9,585 USD) fine if they come closer than 30 meters (98 feet) to the whales, officials said. Southern right whales migrate along southern Australia from June to October. Right whales reportedly came by their name because they're relatively easy for whalers to hunt.

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and three others were injured after a series of powerful tornadoes ripped through dozens of homes in central Arkansas on Wednesday night, officials said Thursday. Ward Baldridge, 79, died when a tornado hit his home in Pearson, according to a CNN producer who is related to the victim. The house was leveled, and Baldridge, his wife and his grandson were blown hundreds of feet away, Alexis Ginsberg said. The victims were sucked out of the house by the winds and landed in a nearby field, she said, citing Baldridge's grandson. The two survivors are in critical condition, she said. The first twister struck in Saline County at 6:28 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. The tornado damaged 22 homes, an Arkansas Emergency Management spokeswoman said. A resident said she could hear the storm roaring as it approached the area. ""It was the awfulest roaring I ever heard in my life,"" she told CNN affiliate KTHV. ""My house felt like it was fixing to crumble over me."" Is severe weather happening where you are? Send videos and photos to iReport. Another tornado struck north of Saline in White County at 8:25 p.m., the weather service said. That storm damaged nine homes and injured one person. The third tornado was the one that killed Baldridge. It struck in nearby Cleburne County at 9:05 p.m., said Renee Preslar, spokeswoman for the Department of Emergency Management. Several homes were damaged or destroyed. Along with tornadoes, central Arkansas was raked by powerful thunderstorms and golf ball-size hail, the National Weather Service said. ""The storm seems to be shifting to the east, so the severe weather should be out of this area by [Thursday],"" said John Lewis, a senior forecaster with an Arkansas office of the National Weather Service. A tornado watch that had been in effect for Arkansas was lifted early Thursday morning. But a tornado watch was issued for most of Mississippi and parts of Tennessee and Kentucky, forecasters said.

"(CNN) -- A suicide bomber walks into a bar. He shouts at the bartender, ""Gimme the money, or I blow this place to bits!"" The worried bartender hands him a wad of cash, and the bomber departs. The next day, the suicide bomber returns to the same bar. He shouts at the bartender, ""Gimme the money, or I blow this place to bits!"" ""Are you nuts?"" answers the bartender. ""If I give you money every day, I'll go out of business. Plus, you're scaring away the customers."" ""I tell you what,"" replies the bomber, ""Gimme the money, and I won't come back until the day after tomorrow."" Welcome to the art of negotiation, Republican style. Since the election of 2010, the United States has narrowly averted three Republican-built suicide bombs: one government shutdown, one debt default and one fiscal cliff. We have two more scheduled for February: across-the-board spending cuts and another debt ceiling expiration. The Republicans' suicide strategy is a relatively new addition to American politics. Newt Gingrich pioneered the first government shutdown in 1995. It was so disastrous that no one tried it again for 16 years. In the meantime, Republicans pursued a more traditional method known as the democratic process. They campaigned for election and took control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. From 2001 to 2006, the dominant Republicans passed plenty of conservative legislation. (They did not, however, reduce spending or balance the budget.) Borger: Fiscal cliff was bound to collapse . When their golden era came to an end, many Republicans refused to accept that the popular will had turned against them and resorted to obstructionist tactics. In the Senate, they have filibustered 391 Democratic bills in the past six years, culminating last month in Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's historic filibuster of his own bill. The Democrats are no strangers to the filibuster, of course, but they managed only 201 in their six years of minority status. Yet the Senate is a model of effective government compared with the House, now the only Republican-dominated branch of the federal government. Frustrated by their inability to get conservative legislation past the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House, congressional Republicans have revived the ""suicide bomb."" The key to the suicide bomb strategy is to convince people that members of the conservative wing of the Republican Party are crazy enough to wreck the economy if they don't get their way. Democratic leaders seem to believe them. Like the hapless bartender, they keep tossing the Republicans wads of cash -- spending cuts and tax breaks -- in order to spare the country from a debt default, shutdown or recession. Opinion: GOP civil war over Sandy disaster relief . But this bomber will not be satisfied by a few payoffs. The Republicans continue to use every opportunity to extract concessions by threatening to wreck the economy ... again. When Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner proposed a permanent debt ceiling extension during the last round of negotiations, McConnell reportedly laughed in his face. The suicide bomb has become the Republicans' most effective weapon. Why would they give that up? President Obama was slow to see the pattern, but after three nail-biting suicide negotiations in two years, he seems to have finally realized that he cannot continue to encourage the bomb threats with concessions. As attention turned to the next debt ceiling battle, he declared, ""While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed."" Hopefully, he will maintain this resolve. The endless threats not only enable Republicans to subvert the democratic process, they hurt the country. Even if the Republicans never actually fulfill their ultimatums, the anxiety provoked by such threats damages the economy by creating uncertain business conditions. To extend the metaphor: The suicide bomber is scaring away the customers. So what will happen when Obama finally says enough is enough? Is the country destined to go BOOM? Avlon: Chris Christie drops bomb on GOP leaders . Fortunately not. The joke has a hidden punchline. It turns out that the suicide bomber is a part-owner of the bar. The folks who will lose the most if the bomb goes off are the investors, bankers and businesspeople who still retain large stakes in the Republican Party. When the Republicans threatened to let the government default in 2011, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other industry advocates objected with growing concern. If the Democrats refuse to negotiate this time around, industry advocates will not sit idly while the party they finance deliberately ruins their businesses. But what if the conservative Republicans are really that crazy? What if they are so committed to their agenda and dismissive of their constituents that they will allow unemployment to rise, interest rates to skyrocket, government services to disappear, seniors to lose their Social Security checks and other catastrophic consequences of debt defaults and government shutdowns? If that is the case, however unlikely, than we will only have to survive until the next election, at which point the Republicans will discover that suicide bombings produce only one guaranteed casualty: the bomber himself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolraich.","Michael Wolraich: GOP ""negotiations"" on cliff, debt are like a suicide bomber's .
He says threat to shut down government, hurt economy pioneered by Gingrich .
He says strategy back again; Democrats cave in the face of it. Obama may be wising up .

"(CNN) -- A 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Arkansas just after 11 p.m. Sunday, the United States Geological Survey said. The quake, the latest in a swarm of nearly 800 since September, is the strongest since a 5.0 event recorded in 1976, according to Scott Ausbrooks of the Arkansas Geological Survey. Almost all of Arkansas could feel the quake, as could residents in parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Oklahoma, Ausbrooks said. The quake caused minor damage across a wide area of Arkansas. Most of the damage was from broken dishes, cracked drywall and, in one case, a broken window. No injuries were reported. The quake's epicenter was 37 miles from Little Rock, the USGS said. The area lies atop several geologic faults, but none is associated with the New Madrid fault, which shook the region in 1811 -- destroying its namesake town in Missouri, bringing down buildings as far away as St. Louis and shaking the ground even in New York. The area around Guy was the site of another historic flurry of earthquakes in 1982. Geologists know it as the Enola Swarm, responsible for 15,000 quakes within a year's time, followed by more shaking in 2001. Ausbrooks has said the state Geological Survey was trying to determine whether the current swarm is natural or due to some man-made cause. CNN's Jeremy Ryan and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Sunday's quake is the strongest since 1976, the state geological society says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- No group has stepped forward so far to claim responsibility for a massive car bombing in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi that killed at least 45 people over the weekend in what appeared to be the latest attack on the Shiite minority in the country. The blast Sunday tore into nearby buildings, wounding about 150 people, and authorities warned that the death toll could rise as rescue workers continued to search for bodies amid the rubble. Caused by a vehicle loaded with about 150 kilograms (330 lbs) of explosives set to a timer, the explosion took place in Abbas Town, an area of Karachi where many Shiite Muslims live, police said. In recent months, a number of large-scale bomb attacks have targeted Shiites, who are overwhelmingly outnumbered by Sunni Muslims in Pakistan. A huge bombing last month in a Shiite neighborhood in the city of Quetta killed about 90 people and fueled outrage about authorities' failure to stem the attacks, many of which were claimed by the Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Pakistani security forces responded by carrying out raids in the area in which four militants were killed and others arrested. But Sunday's attack in Karachi suggested they hadn't done enough to dissuade further attacks. Amnesty International says it has documented 92 separate attacks on Shiites across Pakistan since January 2012 that have resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people. It has criticized what it says is the lack of prosecutions of those responsible for the violence. Pakistan's Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and President Asif Ali Zardari both condemned the bombing Sunday. Although many of the recent attacks against Shiites in Pakistan have focused on the Hazara ethnic group in Quetta, sectarian violence has struck Karachi previously. In February 2010, for instance, at least 18 people died in blasts that took place near a bus full of Shiite religious observers and in front of a hospital in the city. And in late 2009, a suicide bomb attack on a Shiite procession moving through Karachi killed at least 40 people. CNN's Nasir Habib reported from Islamabad and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong .","The blast apparently targeted Shiites in Karachi, police say .
Authorities say the toll could rise as rescue workers search the rubble .

"London (CNN) -- The Duchess of Cambridge attended her first public engagement since her pregnancy was announced this month, presenting prizes at a sports awards show Sunday evening in London. Catherine appeared on stage at London's ExCel center to rousing applause, to present the awards at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year show. She wore a striking, floor-length green dress that showed off her slim figure and featured a daring slit. She handed over trophies for the night's two biggest awards: Sports Personality of the Year, which went to 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins; and the Lifetime Achievement honor, which went to Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympics organizing committee. The duchess was last seen December 6 alongside her husband, Prince William, leaving the hospital where she had undergone several days of treatment for acute morning sickness. Her stay at the King Edward VII Hospital was overshadowed by the apparent suicide of Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse who took a prank phone call from Australian DJs. The pair made the hoax call to the hospital, pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles in an effort to find out details of Catherine's condition. Catherine's illness had led the couple to announce her pregnancy earlier than the usual 12-week mark; the royal couple have not announced when their baby is due. Health concerns have forced Catherine to pull out of several events in recent weeks, including the UK premiere of ""The Hobbit"" in London this week; Prince William attended the event alone.

"(CNN) -- Swiss chocolate maker Lindt is expanding into the U.S., China and Russia as it seeks to combat the impact of the country's strong franc and the eurozone crisis. The franc, seen as a safe haven currency, has been appreciating as the almost-three year old financial crisis continues to weigh on countries using the euro. The strong currency eats into the company's bottom line, leaving Lindt -- which turned an operating profit of $52 million this year -- struggling to maintain financial momentum. According to Lindt chief executive Ernst Tanner, sales growth is falling short of targets and some of the company's markets are now in decline. Appreciation of the Swiss franc cost Lindt an estimated 9.5% of profits in 2011. ""We have grown from approximately $800 million twenty years ago to $2.5 billion [in sales] last year. But those $2.5 billion would be more than $4 billion at exchange rates that we had 20 years ago,"" Tanner said. Lindt still makes all its chocolate in Zurich, but its expansion plans now include opening boutiques and coffee shops to promote its brand. But the company, famous for its Lindor balls, continues to face challenges in emerging markets. ""The chocolate consumption is relatively low and the Lindt brand is unknown [in emerging markets],"" Tanner said. ""With a boutique we can best demonstrate our values, our quality, our breadth of products. This is a vehicle with which we have really established our brand.""

"Entebbe, Uganda -- A Ugandan court has sent a Muslim couple to jail on charges of insulting the Christian religion by allegedly having sex in a church in Entebbe. The prosecution alleges that Abbasi Kigongo and Aisha Namazzi were found having sex near the altar of Kigungu Miracle Centre Church in Uganda's capital on May 14. The charge sheet says that ""the duo willfully decided to have sex in the church with intentions of insulting a religion. That is unlawful."" The charge sheet was obtained from the Entebbe magistrate's office Tuesday. The pair is scheduled to reappear in court June 22. The prosecution alleges that a churchgoer near the scene heard strange loud noises in the church, investigated the situation, and  found the couple having sex.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- An anonymous client wants to buy the Kim Kardashian sex tape from the porn company that owns it so it can be taken off the websites where people now pay to view it, according to a lawyer. The porn video, made with R&B singer Ray J, brought Kardashian celebrity and launched her reality show career, but she entered a new phase of her life with her marriage this month to NBA player Kris Humphries. Nashville attorney Adam Dread confirmed to CNN he sent a letter to Vivid Entertainment on Monday asking to start negotiations for the sex tape's sale. ""Recently, I was approached by a private party who asked us to look into the possibility of acquiring all rights (and copies) of the Vivid 'Kim Kardashian Sex Tape,'"" Dread wrote in the letter obtained by CNN. Dread would not disclose the name of his client to CNN, saying ""Unless I'm told otherwise, this is all confidential."" Kardashian and her representative did not respond to CNN's call for comment. A representative for Ray J also did not comment when contacted. The video, which is viewable online for a fee, drew dramatically increased traffic during the weekend of Kardashian's much-publicized wedding to Humphries, Vivid chief Steven Hirsch said. Hirsch has not yet responded to Dread's offer, the lawyer said. ""I was surprised to receive the attorney's letter offering to buy kimksuperstar.com,"" Hirsch told CNN Tuesday. ""Initially, I thought the offer wasn't real, but after reading it through a second time, I am definitely intrigued."" ""I'm happy to talk numbers anytime,"" Dread said when CNN read him Hirsch's response. Kardashian sued Vivid four years ago when Vivid first made the sex tape public. The legal battle ended with a monetary settlement in which Kardashian would share in the profits, Hirsch said. Dread's letter to Vivid said his client ""does not intend to distribute or broadcast the 'tape,' but hopes to completely remove it from the market."" He also offered to ""purchase any other footage you may have control of that involves Ms. Kardashian.""

"(CNN) -- TV commentator and Tea Party favorite Christine O'Donnell defeated U.S. Rep. Mike Castle in Delaware's Republican U.S. Senate primary Tuesday. O'Donnell won more than 53 percent of the vote in the bitter campaign that displayed internal Republican warfare. O'Donnell on Tuesday night thanked her supporters, including Tea Party groups, saying they ""rallied everyday Americans outside of the political establishment, [got] them involved and created a grassroots network that made all of this possible."" ""Don't ever underestimate the power of we, the people,"" O'Donnell said to raucous cheers from her supporters. ""We, the people, will have our voice heard in Washington, D.C., once again."" Castle, a former Delaware governor who has served nine terms in the House, thanked supporters in a concession speech Tuesday night. ""The last several weeks have been spirited, shall we say, and the voters of the Republican primary have spoken, and I respect that decision,"" Castle said. In the closing days of the primary campaign, O'Donnell got a boost with an endorsement by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and more than $150,000 in late contributions from the Tea Party Express. The GOP establishment is concerned O'Donnell has no chance of winning the seat -- once held by Joe Biden for 26 years before he became vice president -- in November. A top Republican official warned Tuesday night that national Republicans will be slow to rally around O'Donnell. ""Until she demonstrates some viability in the polls, we are not going to have any money for her,"" the official told CNN. ""It is now incumbent on Sarah Palin, [U.S. Sen.] Jim DeMint [of South Carolina] and the Tea Party Express to help support her. They got her here. Now make it happen."" O'Donnell told CNN's Jessica Yellin on Tuesday night that she'd ""love [establishment Republicans'] support, but they're the same so-called experts who said I couldn't win the primary."" ""If we just had that throw-in-the towel mentality every time there was a fight that needed to be fought, our country wouldn't be what it is,"" O'Donnell said. ""There's a lot of visionaries and leaders ... in this room who believe we can win, and if [establishment Republicans are] too lazy to put in the effort that we need to win, then so be it. We're going to win without them. I'd love their support, but we're going to win without them."" O'Donnell positioned herself as a conservative gate-crasher. ""We're breaking up the backroom deals,"" she told CNN before Tuesday's primary. ""We're restoring the political process back to the hands of the people."" She refers to Castle as the ""anointed one."" In an interview before the primary, O'Donnell told CNN: . -- The Republican Party is behind ""false accusations and attack ads"" against her and accused party operatives of ""fighting for not only my opponent's political career but their own political career."" --  She believes it's ""a shame"" that FreedomWorks, the Dick Armey group that backs Tea Party candidates, declined to endorse her but disagrees with the organization's view that she can't win the general election, saying, ""No one even thought we could get this far."" -- Palin's endorsement ""is helping a lot"" because ""it gave my supporters an extra boost of encouragement."" And it helped her, too: ""Gov. Palin can relate to the politics of personal destruction, and she's survived them and they didn't get her down."" -- And she says she'd love support from one well-known Democrat: ""I would love Hillary Clinton's endorsement. When I saw her presidential ads, I said, 'You go, girl!' I'm a Republican, so I probably won't vote for her, but I do admire her."" Democrats were positively gleeful at the prospect of an O'Donnell victory on Tuesday. Many had written off Vice President Joe Biden's old Senate seat as a loss. But with O'Donnell the projected winner, Democrats  believe they can hold the seat in November, which could save their majority in the Senate. The big unknown heading into Tuesday was voter turnout. There are fewer than 183,000 registered Republicans in the state. It's a closed primary -- meaning neither Democrats (about 293,000 registered voters) nor independents (146,000 registered as ""other"") can vote. And in an off-year primary, few voters tend to turn out. So this race -- and perhaps the balance of power in the Senate -- was decided by fewer people than usually turn out for a Palin rally.

"Misrata, Libya (CNN) -- The French government is in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition, a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said late Thursday. The French government has not confirmed the claim, which follows an acknowledgement earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere. Ibrahim Baitalmal, the spokesman for Misrata's Military Council, said that if the French agreed to help in Misrata, anti-Gadhafi forces there would receive much needed supplies to fight against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces. Misrata is surrounded on three sides by Gadhafi's forces, which are much better armed. The city's only outlet is by sea. Gadhafi has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months-long uprising by rebels, emboldened by popular movements across the Middle East, trying to bring an end to his 42-year rule. The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary, with the exception of a ground invasion, to protect civilians. NATO began bombing military targets a short time later. Libyan state TV reported Friday that NATO had attacked targets in the city of Gharyan, south of the capital, Tripoli. It also reported that pro-Gadhafi forces had bombed an opposition building in Tobruk, in the far east of the country. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an explanation from Paris Thursday over its parachuting-in of arms to Libyan rebels -- which was first revealed in a French media report Wednesday -- Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported. Lavrov said that if confirmed, France's action was in violation of the U.N.resolution. But speaking in Moscow Friday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his country's NATO partners and the U.N. Security Council had been told about France's decision to drop weapons for the Libyan opposition. ""We are exactly within the framework of resolutions 1970 and 1973... all means can be used to help civilian populations to protect themselves,"" he said. ""It's within that framework that we reacted. We informed our NATO partners and the Security Council."" French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard confirmed Wednesday that its military had dropped food, medical products and light weaponry by parachute to Libyans in Djebel Nefoussa. ""It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi's forces,"" he said. ""The weapons were given for self defense because of the security situation."" Speaking at a news conference Thursday, Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use. He said it was reckless of France to take such action, saying it went ""against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO's intervention in Libya."" CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: Libyan state TV reports strikes by NATO forces in Gharyan, south of Tripoli .

"(CNN) -- Republican presidential contender Michele Bachmann defended her position on gay rights, the HPV vaccine and the debt ceiling as she made her debut on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."" Bachmann has more usually been the butt of Leno's jokes -- a point he made as he thanked her for being a good sport. ""We've done a million jokes. Hopefully, you haven't been ... watching any of them,"" he said, as she joined him on set. But Leno largely skipped the jokes Friday as he quizzed the Minnesota congresswoman on her political positions. First up was the issue of the HPV vaccine, a subject on which Bachmann hit fellow Republican contender and Texas Gov. Rick Perry hard in this week's CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate. Perry signed an executive order in 2007 that required Texas schoolgirls to receive vaccinations against the sexually transmitted HPV, although it wasn't implemented. Bachmann told Leno that Perry's action had been ""an abuse of executive power"" and had sparked concern over ""crony capitalism,"" an apparent reference to the fact that a former Perry aide was a top lobbyist for Merck, the manufacturer for the HPV vaccine. Merck donated to Perry's campaign fund. She added: ""The concern is that there's, you know, potentially side effects that can come with something like that. But it gives a false sense of assurance to a young woman when she has that that if she's sexually active that she doesn't have to worry about sexually transmitted diseases."" Leno responded: ""Well, I don't know if it gives assurance. It can prevent cervical cancer; correct?"" He then pressed Bachmann over comments she made earlier this week in which she said a woman had approached the congresswoman to say her daughter had suffered ""mental retardation"" as a result of receiving the vaccination. There had been no recorded cases of such side effects despite 30 million people receiving the jab, Leno pointed out. ""I wasn't speaking as a doctor. I wasn't speaking as a scientist. I was just relating what this woman said,"" Bachmann replied. The former tax attorney and mother of five, who won the Iowa straw poll last month but has seen her poll ratings slide since Perry entered the race, also defended two clinics she runs with her husband, offering what she said was a Christian counseling service. The clinics have come under fire over claims they use a controversial therapy that encourages gay and lesbian patients to change their sexual orientation. Asking Bachmann why gay people shouldn't have the right to be happily married, Leno said: ""That whole 'pray the gay away' thing, What? I don't get that."" Bachmann said the clinics did not discriminate, but repeated her position that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Quizzed on her opposition to raising the debt ceiling, Bachmann said she would have taken the same position whether it had been President Barack Obama or George W. Bush in power. On Afghanistan, Bachmann failed to answer whether she thought American forces should withdraw, but paid tribute to the ""unbelievable job"" done by U.S. service men and women there. Leno's final question was whom Bachmann would pick as a running mate if she wins the Republican nomination, suggesting she might want someone more moderate to balance her views. She joked: ""Well, you're taken. You don't want a cut in pay, so what can I say?"" Leno replied: ""Well, we'd probably have an argument over that gay thing.""","Bachmann continues her criticism of Rick Perry over the HPV vaccine .

"London (CNN) -- The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attract crowds of cameramen and hoards of press photographers everywhere they go -- even when they aren't really there. Wax models of William and Kate went on display at Madame Tussauds in London Wednesday, and were immediately swamped by onlookers keen to get close to the ""royal couple."" The figures, which cost more than $230,000 each to make, are shown in copies of the outfits they wore when they announced their engagement in November 2010, complete with a replica of the ring once worn by William's mother Diana, Princess of Wales. ""Since the royal wedding, guests from all around the world have been asking where is Catherine? We want to come and have our photo taken with her,"" said Madame Tussauds spokeswoman Liz Edwards. ""So we've recreated the iconic moment where they announced to the world that they are in love with each other."" A team of artists and model makers spent four months working on the couple. Kate's hair alone took six weeks, each individual strand of real, ethically-sourced human hair inserted by hand. ""It's really important for us that when people come and stand next to them, that they are seeing a piece of that real person,"" said Edwards. Unlike the subjects of most other Madame Tussauds waxworks, the company said William and Kate did not ""sit"" for their figures, but St James's Palace provided all the key measurements, and the finished pieces have been given the royal seal of approval. Other versions of the models will go on display at Madame Tussauds' attractions in Amsterdam and New York, and in Blackpool, in northern England. In each city, ""Kate"" will be shown in a different outfit: A lilac Alexander McQueen gown worn on the couple's U.S. tour in New York, a black lace Temperley London dress worn to a film premiere in Amsterdam, and a Jenny Packham gown worn at a charity dinner in Blackpool. Early reactions to the new figures suggest they are set to prove almost as popular as the real thing. ""Unfortunately I don't think we'll ever get to meet the real ones,"" one visitor told CNN. ""This is definitely a good substitute."" ""It's great,"" said another. ""I can't see the difference between them and the real people."" Madame Tussaud was born Marie Grosholtz in France in 1761, and learned to sculpt wax as a teenager -- her early subjects included Voltaire and Benjamin Franklin -- and went on to become a favorite of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. During the French Revolution, she was imprisoned, and later commissioned to create death masks of many of those put to death on the guillotine. In 1802, she brought her waxworks to Britain and toured the country before settling in London, where she lived until her death in 1850.","Wax figures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge unveiled at Madame Tussauds in London .

"(CNN) -- Japan's new prime minister on Friday offered the world a vision of his country as a reinvigorated Asian power, pledging to restore its influence in a region where it is increasingly eclipsed by China. ""Japan is not, and will never be, a tier-two country,"" Shinzo Abe said in a speech to members of the US foreign policy establishment, following his first meeting with President Barack Obama. ""It is high time, in this age of Asian resurgence, for Japan to bear even more responsibility to promote our shared rules and values."" Mr Abe's declaration that ""Japan is back"" could raise hackles in China, where a new leadership is keen to establish that country as a more dominant political force, befitting its position as Asia's largest economy. Mr Abe, a conservative nationalist, referred to a rare increase in Japan's military spending and made a forceful reassertion of Tokyo's claim to the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership has been contested by Beijing, saying Japan ""simply cannot tolerate any challenge now, or in the future"". But he also tried to assure US leaders that he was working to avoid escalating a dispute which Washington has made clear it does not want to be drawn into, suggesting he might be open to meeting Chinese leaders to try to ease tensions over the islands. ""The doors are always open on my side for the Chinese leaders,"" Mr Abe said. China on Friday criticised Mr Abe after the Washington Post published an interview quoting him as saying Beijing had a ""deeply ingrained"" need to challenge its neighbours over territory. Japanese officials said the quote was ""misleading"" and Mr Abe had not said China sought conflicts with other countries. Mr Abe came to Washington seeking to erase a perceived ambivalence about Japan's relations with the US that was created by the previous centre-left government, which Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic party defeated in national elections in December. Japan has swapped prime ministers six times since Mr Abe first held the office in a short and scandal-marred tenure from 2006 to 2007. One of his biggest challenges is to convince the Obama administration that his second stint will last long enough for him to follow through on his promises. Mr Abe has made a robust start, launching an economic stimulus programme of increased government spending and looser monetary policy that has lifted the Japanese stock market and pushed his poll ratings to around 70 per cent. Washington has been broadly supportive of the effort, even though it has led to a sharp fall in the yen that has alarmed some of Japan's trade partners and prompted concerns about a potential ""currency war"" of competitive devaluations. Mr Abe pressed his government's case that a healthier Japanese economy would be good for the rest of the world. ""Soon, Japan will export more, but it will import more as well. The US will be the first to benefit, followed by China, India, Indonesia and so on,"" he said. He also moved Japan a step closer to joining an effort to create a trans-Pacific free-trade zone. In a joint statement, Mr Abe and Mr Obama said ""all goods would be subject to negotiation"" should Japan join the US and a group of mostly Asian countries in talks over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but that ""it is not required to make a prior commitment to unilaterally eliminate all tariffs"". That wording appeared to be broad enough to allow Mr Abe to claim that joining negotiations would not break an election promise to protect Japanese farmers. ""It is my understanding that giving up all 'sacred areas' is not pre-condition,"" he said.","Japan's new prime minister offered a vision of his country as a reinvigorated Asian power .

"Zawiya, Libya (CNN) -- Rebel fighters in Libya, trying to take over a key western city, faced stiff resistance from Moammar Gadhafi's forces on Wednesday, a rebel commander said. The fighters hope to seize Zawiya, about 30 miles west of the capital, in an effort to advance on the capital of Tripoli in their fight to topple the Gadhafi regime that has controlled the North African country for decades. ""Most of Zawiya is now in rebel hands, but there are snipers and shelling coming from the east of the city,"" rebel commander Col. Radwan Fheid said. ""The snipers are near Zawiya hospital. People are leaving. They can't stay because of the shelling. These are the last days, God willing."" Rebels are setting up checkpoints and field hospitals to treat the wounded, many of whom have been shot or struck by shrapnel. At a hospital in nearby Yefren, doctors said they had treated more than 200 patients over the past four days -- some of them rebel soldiers from any of several front lines, some of them civilians. Among the latter was a 9-year-old girl who was in her house when it was hit by a missile, sending shrapnel into her, a doctor said. ""Unfortunately, there is more than 90% chance that she may lose her right arm here,"" he said. Medical staff said they were donating their own blood to keep their patients alive. One man, both legs wrapped in bandages, cried out in pain. Doctors said there were not enough staff members to properly take care of the patient load. Zawiya is west of Tripoli on a strategic supply route. Rebel control of Zawiya would represent a major advance toward putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi-controlled seat of power. Col. Ahmed Banni, military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council, said Tuesday that rebels hope to enter the capital by the end of the month. The Obama administration has agreed to a NATO request for two additional Predator drones to conduct operations over Libya, a U.S. defense official said Wednesday, a day after the drones began flying. The United States has earmarked up to six drones for the Libya operation in recent months, although until generally only two drones have flown at any one time; some have been armed with missiles. In Washington, the Libyan Embassy was officially re-opened Wednesday by its ambassador amid a crowd of proud Libyan Americans waving flags and singing Libyan songs. ""This embassy will serve as a symbol of the new Libya here in the U.S.,"" Ambassador Ali Aujali said outside the Watergate building in Washington where the embassy is located. ""We will work tirelessly not only to serve the needs of the Libyans studying, living and traveling in this country, but also to thank the United States government on behalf of the Libyan people everywhere for its continuing support for transition to a free and democratic nation."" The mission now represents the Transitional National Council (TNC), the rebel movement based in Benghazi, that the United States recognized as the rightful government of Libya on July 15. The embassy was closed in March after the State Department expelled all diplomats loyal to Gadhafi. Aujali, who previously represented the Gadhafi regime in Washington, resigned his post in February, and has since represented the TNC in Washington. He was formally accredited as head of the Libyan mission last week. On Tuesday, Col. Roland Lavoie, a spokesman for NATO's military operation, said that ""anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli."" He described the advances as ""the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months."" Since the end of July, as the threat from pro-Gadhafi forces has diminished, thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains, he said. Since Friday, the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro-Gadhafi forces, he said. And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro-Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west, he added. Lavoie said rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli but added that the regions were ""still contested."" However, Libyan state television reported that pro-Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were ""cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors"" and had secured the coastal road, a key supply pipeline into Tripoli. Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control, ""there's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs,"" Lavoie said. A spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view on Tuesday. ""We are doing very well,"" Ibrahim Musa said. ""It's true that it's a bit slow; people are still saying that we're not acting immediately and that we're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs. That's true, but, God willing, we are able to lead this battle successfully. We will achieve peace and victory."" He added, ""We are fighting NATO, not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members. Our war is with the crusaders."" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this story.","In hospital in Yefren, a 9-year-old girl may lose her arm .

"London, England (CNN) -- A superboat custom built for the most recent James Bond blockbuster was the star act at the Scotland Boat Show, a three-day show at the weekend. The ""Quantum of Solace,"" a 43-foot Sunseeker Superhawk, is one of three used during the chase sequence in the 2008 film of the same name. And its owner, Robin Porter, had his own action adventure while test-driving the boat off the coast of Marmaris in Turkey. Porter, who bought the vessel in late January but did not realize its celebrity origins at the time, says he found himself in a James Bond-like scenario, when he unwittingly traveled into dangerous waters. He says, ""It was a beautiful, nice day and we took the boat for a run. Out of the harbor and into the bay, from out of nowhere really, there was a boat with men wearing balaclavas covering their faces and AK-47s. ""We were in restricted waters and the little hamlet bay nearby was actually part of naval waters,"" he continued. ""We were taken to be questioned and we didn't have the ship's papers because this was a test drive of the boat so we had to get the coast guard involved. ""Then they asked 'Have you been drinking?' We had to be taken to the hospital for a drugs test. We couldn't even go to the bathroom without a guard outside. We got interrogated about why we were in Turkey and we wanted to buy this boat, "" he added. The fastest things on water . Eventually their eight-hour detention came to an end as authorities involved realized it was a simple case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Despite this slight hiccup, Porter says things have been smooth sailing since his return to the UK and is delighted the boat was part of the show. Since he found out about ""Quantum of Solace""'s Hollywood provenance, he has decked out the boat with custom James Bond accessories. ""Recently we've done up the boat and it has been liveried up with 'Quantum of Solace' along the side, monograms, James Bond things,"" he says. Porter declined to tell CNN how much he paid for the boat. Other Sunseeker Superhawks are currently on sale for between Â£250,000-Â£300,000 ($400,000-$475,000). ""If some people get some sort of enjoyment out of seeing or use out of it, then we are happy ... It's as fast as it looks and extremely comfortable,"" he said. ""Quantum of Solace"" was on display for the public to visit during the show at at Kip Marina, Inverkip, west Scotland. Around 7,000 visitors visited the show, organizers said. Ten marine movies for a sail-in cinema . The 43-foot Sunseeker was part of a larger Bond theme at the show: More James Bond icons lined the shore including a collection of five Aston Martins and the full range of all five Rolls Royce vehicles usually reserved for villains of the blockbusters.","'Quantum of Solace', a 43-foot Sunseeker, was on display during Scotland Boat Show .

"(CNN) -- Iberia ground and cabin crews Monday began what they said was the biggest strike in the airline's history, but the company countered that it had already re-assigned most passengers to other flights to reduce airport chaos. Five people were arrested during the strike for going beyond a police line at Madrid's Barajas airport, a government spokesman told CNN. Earlier, Iberia said in a statement that it had found other flights for 60,000 clients and will give ticket refunds to another 10,000. But Iberia canceled 415 flights this week, about 40% of its total, and three smaller airlines for which Iberia provides ground services canceled an additional 800 flights. Most routes -- within Spain, or to nearby destinations in Europe or much longer distances -- were operating, but in many cases with fewer than the normal daily number of flights. The unions are protesting layoffs, salary cuts for many of the remaining staff and company downsizing that has already seen elimination of flights from Madrid to Athens, El Cairo and Istanbul. In April, Iberia will also stop flying from Madrid to Havana, Santo Domingo, Montevideo and San Juan de Puerto Rico. Iberia has announced 3,800 layoffs, about 19% of the staff, part of an effort to reduce losses, which were more about $350 million last year. Ground crews and in-flight attendants announced 15 days of strikes, during three weeks Monday to Friday, starting Monday. Pilots are not on strike this week but are due to join in for next strikes, for the weeks of March 4 and March 18. Union leaders call it the biggest strike in Iberia's history because it's the first time that all three units -- pilots, cabin crews and ground personnel -- have joined forces to strike and it's the first time so many days of strikes have been announced at one time. Iberia called the situation ""totally normal"" on Monday, given the strike. But Manuel Atienza, of the General Workers Union (UGT) said the strike will have more impact as it continues, because overloaded ground crews, even while complying with legally-mandated minimum services, will fall farther behind on tasks like baggage handling. Unions say that Iberia, which merged with British Airways in 2011, has been suffering ever since as the junior partner, while the majority shareholder British has expanded. Iberia pilots last year went on strike when Iberia created a low-cost carrier called Iberia Express. It and two other airlines that get ground services from Iberia - Air Nostrum and Vueling - also canceled fights this week.","Iberia said it had found other flights for 60,000 clients and will give ticket refunds to another 10,000 .

"San Bernardino, California (CNN) -- A deadly tour bus crash in the Southern California mountains left at least eight people dead and dozens injured Sunday, officials said. The difficult terrain hampered rescue efforts in San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles, as authorities tried to extricate some of the victims. Though the early death toll stood at eight, that number is expected to rise, California Highway Patrol Officer Mario Lopez said. Authorities believe the bus rear-ended a sedan, crashed with a pickup truck pulling a trailer and rolled over about 6:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET). The incident took place in a mountainous area of State Route 38, between Mentone and Forest Falls, San Bernardino Fire Department spokesman Eric Sherwin said. At least 42 people suffered injuries ranging from minor to severe, he said. A parade of ambulances snaked down a narrow, sloping highway Sunday night, waiting to transport the dozens injured. The highway was reduced to one lane for both inbound and outbound ambulances, which had to contend with a downhill grade and winding roads. By late Sunday night, all passengers had been removed from the bus, Sherwin said. The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Lopez identified the bus company as Scapadas Magicas of National City, California. The company did not immediately return a request for comment early Monday. Federal safety records indicate Scapadas Magicas had no reported crashes in the two-year reporting period leading up to Sunday. The company received a ""satisfactory"" rating in a safety review last month. Investigators pored over the debris with flashlights overnight and Monday morning, searching for clues. But evidence of a rollover seemed abundantly clear: The top of the bus over the driver's seat was caved in, and part of the roof was ripped open. CNN's Holly Yan and Emily Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities identify the bus company; safety records indicate it's ""satisfactory""

"(CNN) -- Salman Ahmad is a devout Pakistani Muslim on jihad -- but his holy war is a rock 'n' roll battle against intolerance, he says. He's the frontman of the band Junoon. He's sold 30 million albums. And he says music is a powerful weapon against extremism. ""My own personal narrative tells me that arts and culture is mightier than the sword,"" he told CNN during a tour of the United Kingdom Thursday. Ahmad, who was born in Pakistan and grew up in New York, has set himself an ambitious goal -- not only fighting Muslims' own misconceptions about their religion, but reclaiming the very word ""jihad"" from extremists. It's come to mean violent holy war of the kind waged by al Qaeda and the Taliban. But Ahmad says that's not its true meaning. ""There has been a sinister case of identity theft where the extremists have hijacked not only language but culture,"" he said. ""Jihad means to strive, to overcome your ego, to work for social justice and peace."" That may be why his new book and album are called ""Rock & Roll Jihad."" He insists his long-haired, guitar-driven rock music is entirely compatible with Islam. ""Anybody who says that music is un-Islamic is a poser,"" he said. ""Muslims have expressed their faith, their lives, their hopes, through music, through poetry, for 1,400 years."" His own music is a fusion of the wildly disparate influences he grew up with, he said. ""I was a 13-year-old from Pakistan (when I) arrived in a suburban cocoon like New York,"" he recalled. ""My exposure to rock-and-roll was watching Led Zeppelin in Madison Square Garden."" Frontman Jimmy Page ""had a two-headed guitar and dragons painted on his pants, and I said: 'That's what I want to do with the rest of my life.'"" ""My music takes equal inspiration from classic rock like Led Zeppelin and the Beatles and also Sufi poetry,"" he said, citing a mystical Muslim tradition. ""We are in the same tradition of musicians who are sending out a message of love, a message of joy."" And while he may seem like a trailblazer -- and be one -- he said he is not alone. South Indian Muslim composer A.R. Rahman won an Academy Award for best song for ""Slumdog Millionaire's"" anthemic ""Jai Ho,"" Ahmad observed. And Ahmad's mentor, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, performed with Peter Gabriel and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. ""He said to me, ""The Quran promotes cultural diversity, so why not play with rockers?'"" Ahmad's done some high-profile collaborations of his own, including recording a song with American rocker Melissa Etheridge. ""I saw him perform at the concert and was amazed by his vocal and guitar abilities. Here was this traditional Eastern sound that was rocking hard at the same time,"" Etheridge writes in the introduction to Ahmad's new book. They traded ideas, resulting in the song ""Ring The Bells."" She remembers listening to some tunes he recorded to kick off their collaboration: ""I found in one track a haunting guitar part that I kept playing over and over until finally the words started to come. 'Whose God is God? Whose light is light? Whose law is wrong? Whose might is right?'"" The message is resonating, Ahmad said. He has played rock concerts in the disputed territory of Kashmir, with ""thousands of kids braving death threats going to hear concerts,"" he said. ""It's a way for people to vent their emotions. Junoon's sold over 30 million albums,"" he said. ""That music wasn't bought by a fringe. That's a mainstream majority.""","Muslim rocker Salman Ahmad says music can fight intolerance .

"London (CNN) -- In 2011 the Italian movie Habemus Papam depicted a pope struggling with his own conscience, who takes the outrageous decision of stepping down. The fact that this event took place Monday in Rome went probably well beyond everyone's imagination. Pope Benedict's resignation was unexpected and it struck Italy like a bolt out of the blue. The influence of what happens in the Holy See on Italy is much stronger than on any other country in the world and it is due to both historical and geographic reasons. Read more: Pope Benedict XVI's resignation explained . Nevertheless, whether and how the vacuum of power provoked by Joseph Ratzinger's announcement will affect Italy's economic situation is difficult to see at the moment. On Monday, Italy's 10-year government bond yields reached a new peak. Can the Pope's resignation be considered responsible for that? The answer seems to be negative, since an increasing trend, which has more to do with the uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming parliamentary elections, had been already observed during the past two weeks. Read more: Too tired to go on, Pope Benedict resigns . It is undoubtedly true that Benedict XVI's stepping down surprised Italian politicians. Votes from Catholic believers seem to be distributed over the three main competitors (Bersani's Democratic Party, Berlusconi's People of Freedom and Monti's coalition) and uncertainty over their reactions might exacerbate the tones of the campaign, now in its two last weeks, since the three parties might be willing to appease as many Catholics as possible. Watch more: The Pope's German roots . Nevertheless, the Pope's resignation does not seem likely to bring about major consequences over the financial and economic situation of the country. In the short run, the forthcoming elections of the new successor of St Peter will attract a huge number of pilgrims from all over the world. The tourism industry, one of the most important assets for the Italian economy, is not immune from the crisis and data recently released by the National Observatory on Tourism show that the number of foreign visitors to Italy decreased, in the period January to October 2012, by 6.2% over the same period in 2011. Rome will soon get the unusual status of ""city of the two popes"" (since Joseph Ratzinger will still be living in the Vatican, after a period in the detached Castel Gandolfo's residence) and that might look appealing to foreign tourists. However religious tourism is generally characterized by big numbers but low expenditures: Therefore, a revived wave of pilgrimages to Rome might not be enough to boost Italian tourism. Whether the smoke coming out from St Peter's chimney will be ""white"" or ""black"" for the Italian economic recovery is not immediately clear. This ""inter-regnum"" period will definitely increase uncertainty in the political competition, but not enough to again raise fear in global financial markets towards Italy.

"London (CNN) -- All Airbus A380 airplanes must be checked for cracks in the wings, the European Aviation Safety Agency ordered Wednesday. The order covering all A380s does not mean the planes must be grounded, said Dominique Fouda, a spokesman for the aviation agency. ""They can fly, they just have to be checked within the time frame,"" he said. It expands an existing order that the 20 oldest A380s be checked for cracks, Fouda said, adding, ""Now, with the second directive, we are including the whole fleet."" Planes that have completed more than 1,384 takeoffs and landings must be inspected within three weeks of February 13, the agency said. Those that have completed 1,216 to 1,383 flight cycles have six weeks, and planes that have performed fewer than 1,216 cycles must be examined before they reach 1,300 cycles. If cracks are found, the airline must contact Airbus for instructions, the agency said. The 68 A380 planes in operation are being flown by Air France, China Southern, Emirates, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qantas and Singapore Airlines, according to the company website. Another 185 planes have been ordered, Airbus says. South Korea's Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs said that it will issue an order to Korean Air on Thursday to conduct a safety check on its five A380 aircraft. There are no immediate safety issues, the ministry said. None of the aircraft will need to be inspected before next spring. Any inspection carried out beforehand would not be beneficial in terms of determining safety of the aircraft, the ministry said. Wednesday's order was not prompted by any new cracks, but is a normal follow-up to the original directive, which was issued three weeks ago, Fouda said. He called the directives an interim measure, saying a long-term fix is ""now being worked on with Airbus."" That, he said, should be in place by the summer. CNN's Ayesha Durgahee and Ric Ward contributed to this report .","The European air safety agency orders all A380s checked for cracks in the wings .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal's eight-year trophy drought looks set to continue as Arsene Wenger's men crashed out of the English FA Cup on Saturday losing 1-0 to Championship side Blackburn Rovers at the Emirates. The Gunners, whose last silverware came in the same competition in 2005, were undone by a Colin Kazim-Richards' goal in the 72nd minute to send the former Premier League side into the quarterfinal draw. It is the second time this season that Arsenal have been knocked out of a domestic cup competition by opposition from a lower league -- fourth-tier Bradford City beat them on penalties in the League Cup in December. U.S. soccer star 'comes out' as gay . With their league title chances also dead in the water, Arsenal only remaining chance of glory this term is in the Champions League. But they will need to pick themselves up smartly with Bayern Munich arriving at the Emirates on Tuesday for the first leg of their last-16. ""We don't need to think too much about the eight season (trophy drought),"" Wenger said after the match. ""The players who played today didn't play eight seasons ago and we must focus on the next game."" Fellow Premier League team Everton also ran into trouble against lower division opposition in their FA Cup tie. David Moyes' side looked to have succeeded where their Merseyside rivals Liverpool had failed in the previous round, as they led 2-1 into injury time against Oldham Athletic. But a late Matt Smith's header earned the League One side a replay. On Sunday, Chelsea will look to overcome Brentford in their fourth-round reply while Manchester City and Wigan face Leeds United and Huddersfield respectively in the fifth round.

Second-place Borussia Dortmund kept up their faint hopes of retaining their title with a 3-0 win at home to fourth-place Frankfurt. Third-place Bayer Leverkusen also won on Saturday, beating second-from-bottom Augsburg 2-1 to remain one point behind Dortmund and open up a four-point gap on Frankfurt.

"(CNN) -- On behalf of all those Latino voters who have figured out that the Obama administration is the most hostile to Latino immigrants of any administration in the last half century and who are looking for an alternative, let me say this to the Republican presidential candidates: ""Bienvenidos to Florida! Now, behave yourselves."" Like the saying goes, for everything there is a season. And as far as the Republican hopefuls are concerned, for every primary state, there is a makeover. After campaigning in three states with infinitesimally small Latino populations -- the last of which, South Carolina, had red meat on the menu since it recently passed a tough anti-illegal immigration law -- the next state in the queue is Florida, where voters go to the polls on January 31 and where the Hispanic population is substantial. According to the Census Bureau, the Hispanic population in Florida grew by an astonishing 57% in the last 10 years. Hispanics now account for 22.5% of Floridians, compared with 16.3% of the entire U.S. population. But that's only half the story. Florida's Latino population was once made up almost entirely of conservative Cuban-Americans in South Florida, around Miami, who almost always vote Republican. But in a dramatic change, it now also contains a large number of liberal Puerto Ricans in central Florida, around Orlando, who are more likely to vote Democratic. Mix in large numbers of Nicaraguans, Mexicans and Brazilians and you have a spicy Latin stew that won't be easy to pander to with one message. Or one issue. The estimated 10 million Latinos who are expected to cast ballots in November care about the same issues as other voters: jobs, the economy, health care, education. But with one major difference: Immigration tends to float to the top of the list when tensions flare, as they did last year when Arizona started a trend with a tough immigration law that all but requires the ethnic and racial profiling of Latinos. In addition, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Mexican-Americans all come to the immigration issue in different ways, and some are more fired up than others over the tendency of all politicians to exploit the issue for their benefit at the expense of Latino immigrants. For Republicans, the good news is that President Obama has given them an opening. Not only did Obama break his 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority in his first term, he also broke the record for deportations. His administration roped local police into the enforcement of immigration law through the Secure Communities program, which requires police and sheriff departments to submit fingerprints to federal officials of anyone they arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant -- read Latino. Through this, the administration expelled more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants -- most of them Latino -- and, in the process, divided hundreds of thousands of families. But the bad news is that Republicans -- in trying to pander to what their base wants, or rather what they think their base wants -- have made a mess of immigration to the point where many Latinos tell me they would rather vote for Obama and ""Stick with the devil we know."" Generally speaking, when asked about immigration, Republicans come across as mean-spirited, ill-informed and narrow-minded. The presidential hopefuls have fallen into that trap. Consider their dismal performance in Monday's debate in Tampa Bay, Florida, and how they addressed the question of what they would do about the Dream Act, a bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for students who go to college or join the military. According to polls, the legislation enjoys the support of more than three-fourths of Latinos. Even so, both Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney have said they would veto the bill because they, wrongly, consider it a form of ""amnesty."" That would be something for nothing. The Dream Act offers something for something. But, at the debate, perhaps in an attempt to curry favor with Latinos in Florida, Romney -- true to his reputation for flip-flopping -- tried to walk back from that declaration by saying he would sign a version of the Dream Act if it were only ""focused on military service."" Newt Gingrich said essentially the same thing, insisting that he, too, backed the military component of the legislation, but opposed the part that ""simply says everybody who goes to college is automatically waived for having broken the law."" The only thing that is ""simple"" is Gingrich's understanding of what it means to break the law. When a parent brings his child into the country illegally, the parent breaks the law. But the child doesn't. From that point forward, the child might be without legal status in the United States, but that is not the same as someone making a conscious decision to violate a statute and open himself up to the consequences. When it comes to immigration, Republicans offer little more than silliness, sound bites and simple solutions. Do they really think that will help them with Latinos in Florida, let alone help whichever of them emerges a victor appeal to voters in the general election?

"(CNN) -- It was a much-hyped meeting between two of golf's biggest names -- and the chaotically enthusiastic crowd in China were not let down by Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods in a surreal showdown worth a reported $2 million. Billed as the ""Duel at Jinsha Lake,"" Monday's clash coincided with the launch of a multi-million-dollar housing project which is being built around the course in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province. Fans turned out in their thousands to witness the world's top two golfers -- one of them, Woods, the man largely responsible for the game's increased worldwide popularity, and the other, the 23-year-old McIlroy, its big hope for the future. After banging a ceremonial Chinese gong and immortalizing their hand prints in clay, Woods and McIlroy took to a golf course where models dressed in evening wear inhabited the tees, a luxury yacht sailed across a lake and helicopters parked next to putting greens. ""Had a great time with @TigerWoods at Jinsha Lake in China today!"" tweeted McIlroy, who carded a five under par 67, one fewer than his rival, to claim bragging rights. ""We both played well and hopefully the fans enjoyed it too!"" The pair used all their experience to play some impressive golf, despite the fact that many tee shots were accompanied by the endless clicking of dozens of cameras while security men struggled to hold back the fans on the fairways. ""This is certainly not like most Mondays,"" said Woods afterwards, smiling. ""It's been a different one, hasn't it?"" ""I wouldn't say it was crazy out there. The word I would use is 'enthusiastic',"" said McIlroy. ""It's good to see so many people out there. So many people that follow golf and want to watch us play. I hope that continues."" Many observers see China as the next market for golf to conquer, with an expanding, aspirational middle class taking up the game in significant numbers. McIlroy came to Zhengzhou, a city of 10 million people, straight after finishing second at the European Tour's $7 million BMW Masters in Shanghai, a tournament he won last year. Woods, who has won 14 major titles to his rival's two, traveled to China after finishing tied for fourth at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia on Sunday.","World No. 1 Rory McIlroy beats Tiger Woods in exhibition match in China .

"(CNN) -- The controversial method of putting whereby the club is ""anchored"" to a player's belly or another part of the body is to be banned from 2016, golf's law makers announced Wednesday. The move follows victories for Keegan Bradley in last year's U.S.PGA Championship, his fellow American Webb Simpson at this year's U.S. Open and the triumph by South African veteran Ernie Els at the 2012 British Open. All three players were using ""belly"" or ""long-handled"" putters with the club fixed on their midriff while putting out on the greens and it has been argued that they gained an unfair advantage using this approach. The decision has been supported by 14-time major winner Tiger Woods. ""I believe that the art of putting is swinging the club and controlling nerves,"" he told his official website. ""Having it as a fixed point is something that's not in the traditions of the game. ""We swing all the other 13 clubs. I think the putter should be the same,"" added the former World No.1. Claude Harmon, swing coach to Els, questioned why the decision had been made now despite belly putters being around for many years. ""I don't think it is the miracle cure that those in the media are making out,"" he told CNN. ""Remember, the No.1 player in the world (Rory McIlroy) does not use a long putter, or the majority of those in the top ten,"" he added. McIlroy, who won this year's U.S.PGA title and was top money winner on both the European and PGA Tours, later tweeted his approval of the decision. ""Fully agree with the anchoring ban,"" he said. ""Better image for the game of golf, skill and nerves are all part of the game. Level playing field in '16"" the Northern Irishman added. In unveiling their proposed changes, The Royal & Ancient (R&A) and the United States Golf Association (USGA) said they would ""consider any further comments and suggestions from throughout the golf community."" There have been reports that leading players and club manufacturers could take legal action against the rule changes. ""Throughout the 600-year history of golf, the essence of playing the game has been to grip the club with the hands and swing it freely at the ball,"" USGA executive director Mike Davis said in the joint statement issued with the R&A. ""Our conclusion is that the Rules of Golf should be amended to preserve the traditional character of the golf swing by eliminating the growing practice of anchoring the club."" The amendments, which would come into force on January 1, 2016, do not mean belly or long-handled putters are banned, but it would be hard to see a use for them without the ""anchoring"" method. ""We believe we have considered this issue from every angle but given the wide ranging interest in this subject we would like to give stakeholders in the game the opportunity to put forward any new matters for consideration,"" added R&A chief executive Peter Dawson.","""Anchored"" putting method to be banned by golf's rule makers .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona stand-in coach Jordi Roura suffered another agonizing display on his competitive return to the stadium that effectively ended his playing career. Twenty-four years on from suffering a cruciate ligament injury while playing for Barcelona in the San Siro, that same old sinking feeling returned for a man holding the reins as regular coach Tito Vilanova undergoes medical treatment for a tumor in New York. Fielding a strong side against a Milan team that failed to beat the Spaniards in last season's four European Champions League meetings, Barcelona lost the first leg of the last 16 clash 2-0. After a tight first half, Kevin-Prince Boateng broke the deadlock after 56 minutes when drilling home from the edge of the box after a Riccardo Montolivo drive was deflected into his path. Nine minutes from time, fellow Ghanaian Sulley Muntari sealed Milan's first Champions League win over Barca in 13 years after he stylishly finished off a sweeping move involving Stephan El Shaarawy and new signing M'Baye Niang. The victory was especially satisfying for the Milan hierarchy and club president Silvio Berlusconi, who may hope the unexpected win represents a good omen as the 76-year-old tries to return to office in this weekend's Italian elections. Following last year's comprehensive 3-1 aggregate defeat against Lionel Messi and colleagues in the Champions League quarterfinals, Milan overhauled their squad -- with Gennaro Gattuso, Clarence Seedorf, Alessandro Nesta and Zlatan Ibrahimovic among those moved on. A total of eleven players who took part in the 2012 clashes were sold, reducing the average age of the squad from 30 to 27, and the team has slowly overcome a difficult bedding-in period to rise up to fourth in Serie A. Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri had spoken of the need before the game to find a way of blunting Barcelona's attacking threat and his plan worked to perfection thanks to the on-field discipline of his players. ""We played as a team and we listened to our coach,"" said Muntari, whose goal was his first ever in the Champions League. ""He did a fantastic job by setting us up us very well on the pitch -- and we were very disciplined and managed to close every angle."" CNN Football Club: Send in your questions for Ian Wright . Even though Milan are seven-time European champions, their tally second only to the nine of Barcelona's great rivals Real Madrid, exuberant celebrations spread out across the stadium as the four-time winners fell without scoring an away goal. Roura has never made any claims to wanting to be a permanent coach and he suffered in Milan where the home side's impressive defensive discipline smothered the usual attacking prowess of a side standing 12 points clear in the Spanish league. His side were unable to formulate an alternative to their usual fluent style until the stand-in coach chose to use defender Gerard Pique in a makeshift attacking role for the final minutes. Mustering barely a shot on target worthy of the name, Barcelona's limp display -- with Lionel Messi's impact wholly minimized by some efficient defending -- must have made Roura, 45, wish he could never return to the San Siro in a competitive capacity again. In 1989, he was an aspiring Barca midfielder when the then 22-year-old suffered a serious knee against Milan in the European Super Cup - an injury that would bring his career to a premature end four years later. His side are now in danger of failing to reach the Champions League semifinals for the first time in six years and Vilanova may discover that his team is out of the competition when he returns to the fray in late March. Elsewhere, Galatasaray fielded both major January signings -- Wesley Sneijder and Didier Drogba -- in their home clash with Germans Schalke but were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw. The hosts appeared to have made the perfect start when Burak Yilmaz slammed home a fine individual goal after 12 minutes, with the striker now having scored seven of Galatasaray's 8 Champions League goals this term. That was as good as it got for the home side, with Jermaine Jones leveling the scores shortly before halftime as the visitors finished the game the stronger.","Milan win 2-0 in first leg of Last 16 tie to stun tournament favorites .

"(CNN) -- Mali's footballers brought some welcome relief to their compatriots when drawing 1-1 with the Democratic Republic of Congo to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinals. The point in Durban enabled the West Africans to go through in second place, behind Group B winners Ghana who outclassed Niger 3-0 in Port Elizabeth. On a day when French-led troops took hold of the historic city of Timbuktu as Mali authorities continue their battle to loosen Islamist militants' grip on the country's north, the team nicknamed the Eagles booked their place in the last eight. Perhaps fittingly, the football success was also engineered with the help of a Frenchman as Patrice Carteron ensured his side progressed to a knockout clash against hosts South Africa. Mali, who finished third at last year's Nations Cup, recovered from going a goal behind to Dieumerci Mbokani's third-minute penalty to draw level 11 minutes later through Mahamadou Samassa. The Eagles could have taken the lead late on when substitute Cheick Tidiane Diabate hit the post before midfielder Seydou Keita was denied by Congolese goalkeeper Robert Kidiaba, 37, in stoppage time. After Mali opened their Group B campaign with a 1-0 over group outsiders Niger, former Barcelona star Keita wore a T-shirt with the words ""Peace for Mali"" as he gathered his man of the match award. At the 2012 finals, Mali's most decorated footballer -- who boasts three Spanish La Liga titles and two European Champions League medals among other trophies -- had broken down in tears as Islamists took control of the north of his country amidst fierce fighting. During a news conference in South Africa earlier this month, the Eagles captain announced his desire for one of Mali's allies --- ""be it France or our neighbors"" -- to return order to the north of the country as quickly as possible. He had also mentioned that the Islamist militants' ban on watching sports on television, among other measures such as outlawing music and smoking, meant that some people in the north would have been unable to gain relief from the conflict by following the Eagles in South Africa. ""Our country is in one of the most difficult moments of its history,"" he said after Monday's draw with the Congolese. ""Malians are regaining control of the north and our qualification will bring joy to the people. I am very proud."" While Mali will seek to reach the semifinals for the second tournament in a row against Bafana Bafana in Durban, Ghana will face high fliers Cape Verde in Saturday's first quarterfinal. The Black Stars, who are the second favorites to win the competition behind Didier Drogba's Ivory Coast side, beat Niger with goals from Asamoah Gyan, Christian Atsu and John Boye. ""We stepped up our game and won against a good Niger team,"" said Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah, a squad member when the Black Stars last won the Cup of Nations 31 years ago in Libya. ""We hope to do better as we progress in this competition."" Ghana were beaten in the semifinals last year by Zambia, who will look to book their berth in the last eight when taking on Group C leaders Burkina Faso on Tuesday. In the day's other game, Nigeria's Super Eagles need a win against Ethiopia to be sure of avoiding early elimination from the finals.","Mali draw 1-1 with Democratic Republic of Congo to qualify for last eight of Nations Cup .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The running battle between Egyptian police and protesters outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo continued for a fourth straight day Friday, leading to scores more arrests and at least one death, according to state authorities. A demonstration in Tahrir Square -- which in early 2011 was the hub of activity in the revolution that led to the ouster of longtime President Hosni Muhbarak -- was peaceful. But as it has since Tuesday, unrest continued outside the American embassy as riot police clashed sporadically with protesters. One hundred forty-five protesters were arrested Friday and 53 policemen were injured, seven by bird shot, said Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud. The Interior Ministry later issued a statement stating that one protester -- who was described as an ex-convict with an extensive criminal record -- was killed by birdshot. At least 15 protesters were injured Friday from tear gas inhalation and eye irritation, said Health Ministry spokesman Mohamed Sultan. Eleven protesters have been hospitalized in the past couple of days, he said. The tensions in Cairo flared amid widespread rage over an anti-Islam film made in the United States and posted online. Shortly after dawn on Friday, officers carrying shields and batons and backed by an armored personnel carrier rushed a group of several hundred protesters to quell a violent demonstration that had raged through the night. After the rush, a smaller number of demonstrators regrouped near the U.S. Embassy across from police lines, and stones and tear-gas canisters once again crossed in the air. Police fired rubber bullets at protesters. The army began constructing a wall of concrete blocks about 10 feet (3 meters) high across the road leading to the embassy, located about 25 meters (roughly 25 yards) away. By Friday afternoon, youths climbed the newly built wall and threw rocks at police, witnesses said. Security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons to hold off the rioters. But 100 to 200 meters away, in Tahrir Square, a few thousand protesters congregated peacefully. More than 250 people have been injured and 40 arrested this week as riot police faced off against protesters, state media said. Nearly three dozen of those hurt were members of the nation's security forces, state media said. Those arrested faced charges that included thuggery, assaulting police officers and vandalism near the embassy. Both the police clampdown and the cancellation of nationwide protests come during a delicate period across the restive Middle East. In recent days, residents across the region and North Africa have taken to the streets to protest the film. The region is on edge after the killings of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other American officials at the U.S. Consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi. Ties between the United States and Egypt have cooled since the overthrow last year of Mubarak and the election of President Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected leader. Before he became president, he was a leader in the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, the popular Islamist movement. U.S. President Barack Obama said that relations with Egypt will be shaped by how the country responds to the violence. ""I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy,"" Obama told Telemundo in an interview that aired Thursday. If Egypt takes actions that ""indicate they're not taking responsibilities, as all other countries do where we have embassies, I think that's going to be a real big problem,"" Obama said. Obama's comments were widely seen as a warning to Egypt, which was considered a staunch U.S. ally under Mubarak and remains a major recipient of American foreign aid. It is the most populous and one of the most influential nations in the Arab world. When the protests began Tuesday, police and Egyptian troops formed defensive lines around the embassy to prevent demonstrators who had also gathered there from advancing, but not before the protesters had scaled the embassy fence and placed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound. Police arrested a handful of protesters at the time, but the failure of Egyptian authorities to take action sooner has been widely questioned, as has Morsy's delayed condemnation of the attacks on American diplomatic missions. Morsy initially focused his criticism on the anti-Muslim film as an unacceptable slap at Islam. But after speaking with Obama, Morsy on Thursday directly criticized the violence. ""Those who are attacking the embassies do not represent any of us,"" he said from Brussels, Belgium, where he was visiting the headquarters of the European Union. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Ian Lee in Cairo, and Caroline Faraj, Brian Walker, Elise Labott, Paul Cruickshank and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report.","NEW: An Interior Ministry spokesman reports 145 arrests and 53 policemen injured .

The Russian was troubled by a series of injuries (left hip and right shoulder) in 2012 which saw her compete at just 10 events. Her last appearance in a grand slam was at Wimbledon in June, where she reached the third round before retiring with an upper respiratory illness. Her absence from all tournaments since the London Olympics has seen her slip down the WTA rankings to No.96.

"(CNN) -- As a 14-year-old Madison Keys announced her potential by defeating tennis' leading lady Serena Williams in a professional team competition. Next January, as Williams bids for a third consecutive grand slam triumph, Keys will be hoping to make an impact at just her third major tournament after qualifying for the Australian Open. The American, now 17, earned a wildcard for 2013's first grand slam by beating compatriot Mallory Burdette in the final of a qualification event in Atlanta, Georgia. ""It'd be great to go to Australia and not get killed in the first round this year,"" Keys, ranked 137 in the world, told the WTA Tour's official website. ""I'm pretty happy with how I've been playing. I'm just excited to go down to start playing some tournaments again."" Keys' triumph over Williams, the 15-time grand slam winner who also clinched double Olympic gold at London 2012, came in the World TeamTennis competition. The team competition pits squads representing different U.S. cities against each other and uses a slightly altered scoring method. Keys, who became the youngest player in the competition's history, beat Williams while playing for the Philadelphia Freedoms against the Washington Kastles. The Boca Raton native has won just one match at her two previous grand slams, beating Jill Craybas in the first round of the 2011 U.S. Open. Rhyne Williams won the men's competition to book his place at the Australian Open, which begins on January 14. Williams recorded a 7-6(7-4) 5-7 6-3 6-3 win over Tim Smyczek to reach his second grand slam. The 21-year-old's only other grand slam appearance came at the 2012 U.S. Open.

"(CNN) -- After a decade at the helm of one of the world's biggest football clubs David Gill will step down as Manchester United chief executive officer in June. Gill, who will be succeeded by current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward, was involved in the controversial takeover of the 19-time English champions by the American Glazer family. Macolm Glazer, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL franchise, acquired a controlling stake in United in 2005, a takeover that sparked fan protests. ""It has been the greatest privilege to serve Manchester United for 16 wonderful years -- the last 10 of which as its chief executive,"" said Gill, who joined United as finance director in 1997. ""However, I have always been conscious of the fact that, as a member of staff, I was always just a temporary custodian of this marvelous institution,"" added Gill, who will remain a director at the club. ""I am also of the view that all businesses need to refresh themselves with new management and ideas and after 10 years in charge I believe it is appropriate for someone new to pick up the baton."" United co-chairman Joel Glazer said: ""David has played a significant role in the success of Manchester United in his 10 years as chief executive and he can take great satisfaction in all that has been achieved on his watch, both on and off the field."" Since Gill became CEO in 2003, United have won four English Premier League titles, the 2004 FA Cup and the European Champions League in 2008. All of those titles have been won under the club's iconic manager Alex Ferguson, who has been in charge at Old Trafford since 1986. ""I have been at United for over 26 years and for 23 of those years my boss has been one of only two men: Martin Edwards, who brought me to the club, and David Gill. I have enjoyed working with both,"" said Ferguson. ""David has been a magnificent chief executive. Of course, we have had a million arguments, but I have always enjoyed them because I know that David has two great qualities: he is straight and he always puts Manchester United first. ""He has been, and will continue to be, a fantastic success for Manchester United. He has all the qualities of successful people engrained in him: energy, honesty, integrity, personality and decision-making ability."" The Deloitte Sports Business Group recently estimated United's revenue to be $502.4 million, a figure bettered only by Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona. The list compiled by Deloitte does not consider debt, and it was debt which caused many fans to rail against the Glazer's takeover of United. A group of fans formed a breakaway team called FC United of Manchester, which now plays in the seventh tier of English football. By way of protest, a number of fans began wearing green and yellow scarves to the team's home games, the colors of the Newton Heath club from which Manchester United was formed. United currently lead the Premier League table by 12 points from cross-city neighbors Manchester City with just 12 matches of the season remaining. Ferguson's team are also still in the Champions League and are level at 1-1 with Real Madrid ahead of the second leg of their second-round tie on March 5. After reaching the quarterfinals of the FA Cup with victory over Reading on Monday, United's current squad could emulate the team of 1999 which won an unprecedented Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble.","David Gill to step down as Manchester United CEO in June .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic escaped serious injury when a crowd barrier collapsed on him after his singles win at the Hopman Cup in Perth Monday. The World No.1 had just beaten Italy's Andreas Seppi in straight sets and was signing autographs for young fans at the side of the court. But as they pushed forward, the barrier gave way and fell onto the Serbian star's legs. Clearly shaken, Djokovic went down onto his haunches with his hands on his knees before walking gingerly off court. He canceled his post-match press conference while he received treatment, but did return later to play in the mixed doubles with Serbian teammate Ana Ivanovic. A jet lagged Djokovic, who had only arrived in the western Australian city on Sunday evening after winning an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, later played down the incident. ""I am good,"" he told gathered reporters. ""It was a bit of a shock and I am glad that the children involved are okay. I am fine."" Djokovic is using the mixed team event as preparation for his bid for a third straight Australian Open title next month. After his 6-3 6-4 win over Seppi, Ivanovic polished off Francesca Schiavone 6-0 6-4 to make sure Serbia made a winning start to their campaign with an unassailable 2-0 lead. The 25-year-old Djokovic showed no ill effects of his injury scare during the dead mixed doubles rubber, but he and Ivanovic were beaten 7-6 6-4 by Seppi and Schiavone. Hosts Australia are next up for the Serbians Wednesday as Djokovic tunes up for this defense of the opening grand slam of the season. The action gets underway in Melbourne on January 14, but Rafael Nadal, beaten by Djokovic in an epic final in 2012, has already withdrawn after being hit by a stomach virus as he recovered from a long term injury.","Novak Djokovic beats Andrea Seppi in his opening match at Hopman Cup .

The Dane finished her 2012 campaign in fine fettle with an 18-3 record after the U.S. Open, but Pervak showed her promise with a 2-6 6-3 7-6 win in two hours 48 minutes. Wozniacki, watched by her boyfriend, golf's World No.1 Rory McIlroy, powered through the opening set in just 29 minutes, but Pervak hit back to level. The pair had gone to three sets in their previous two meetings, both won by Wozniacki, but this time the tables were turned. The eighth seed led 2-0 and 30-0 but Pervak broke back and was dominant in the tiebreak, winning it 7-1 for her first victory over a top ten player. ""It's tough to lose 7-6 in the third -- it could have gone either way, but it didn't go my way today,"" Wozniacki told the official WTA website. ""I had a good off-season. I've been working very hard. It's just always tough to play your first match of the season,"" she added. Wozniacki will now head to Sydney to get in some match practice ahead of the Australian Open, while Russian-born Pervak goes into the second round at Brisbane for the first time in four attempts.

"(CNN) -- Warm waters off Peru are to blame in the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds on the coast, government authorities say. The Peruvian National Center for the Study of El Nino reported earlier this week that since February the Peruvian coast has had an abundance of warm water as a result of marine currents throughout the world's oceans. The warm water has altered the marine ecosystem, it said. The warm water has led fish such as anchovy and other species that live in surface waters to migrate to deeper water toward the south. As a result, pelicans and other birds that feed from the surface of the water died of starvation. ""If these oceanographic conditions persist, it is likely that its impact will spread to other areas of the (Peruvian) coast even during the fall, which could make the numbers increase and affect other marine species"" said the report. The ministry of environment said seafood is still safe to eat, and encouraged everyone to continue to support local fishermen, according to state-run Andina news agency. ""Marine resources are fully guaranteed, so we promote consumption and discard the speculation that some people or institutions disseminated irresponsibly,"" said the deputy minister for strategic development of natural resources, Gabriel Quijandria. Andina reported that Quijandria also clarified the beach warning that had been issued by authorities last week. ""The health alert does not prohibit admission to the beaches, but people are advised to avoid contact with the remains of pelicans, dolphins and other animals that are stranded,"" he said. Officials in Peru continue to search for the culprit in the death of almost 900 dolphins since the beginning of the year. The health ministry is awaiting final results from molecular analysis looking for the morbillivirus, which previously has been linked to dolphin deaths.","Warm waters off Peru have chased away fish, a national center studying El Nino says .

"(CNN)  -- Venezuela will give a 300-acre island in the Delaware River to the state of New Jersey, the governor's office announced. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez used the Earth Day celebration to announce the transfer of Petty's Island. The Venezuelan-owned Citgo Petroleum Corp. had bought Petty's Island -- between Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- to use as a fuel storage facility. The island is home to a pair of American bald eagles as well as several great blue herons and state-endangered black-crowned night herons, New Jersey Gov. Jon S. Corzine said in a news release Wednesday. Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez announced the island's transfer as part of Wednesday's Earth Day celebrations. Plans are being finalized for the transition, which will not occur before 2020, Corzine's office said.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso has urged Ferrari to improve ahead of the 2013 Formula One season, labeling the Italian team's performance in last year's championship unbefitting of the sport's most successful constructor. Last season two-time world champion Alonso finished just three points behind eventual title winner Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull, but the Spaniard insists Ferrari must do more if the team is to challenge for the drivers' title. ""At the end of the year we were quite far from Red Bull and McLaren,"" the 31-year-old Spaniard told Formula One's official website after his first run out in the team's new F138 car at a preseason testing event in Barcelona. ""We've been in a group with Force India, behind Lotus and Sauber. We cannot belong to this group -- we know that. We need to be in the group of the leaders and for this we need to do a good job this winter."" Last season Alonso earned many plaudits for taking a Ferrari car -- widely considered to be uncompetitive -- to the brink of a first drivers' title for the team since Kimi Raikkonen's in 2007. Red Bull dominance . The Spanish driver draws encouragement from last year's exploits and he is confident of once again rivaling triple world champion Vettel -- if Ferrari can improve on their slow start to 2012. ""At the first four races we had finishes of ninth in China and seventh in Bahrain, so even with all those problems with the car we were fighting for the world championship,"" continued Alonso. ""If we overcome our bad start of 2012 -- and think positive -- there is no reason for us not to fight for the championship again this year if we only improve the car a bit."" The 2013 season gets underway with the Australian Grand Prix on March 17 and Alonso has urged Ferrari to arrive at the Melbourne race ready to challenge the dominance of Red Bull, who have now won the drivers' and constructors' titles for three consecutive years. ""We need to improve from where we were last year because obviously it was not enough -- we finished second and we want to finish first,"" added the former McLaren driver. ""So our immediate goal to improve in the first half of the year shouldn't be that difficult. We are relatively confident.""","Fernando Alonso says Ferrari must do better in 2013 Formula One season .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Roger Federer began his bid for a record sixth U.S. Open title with a straight-sets victory over American Donald Young on Monday, joining Olympic champion Andy Murray in round two. The Wimbledon champion, seeking to overtake Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors as the grand slam's most successful male player of the post-1967 Open era, won 6-3 6-2 6-4 against a player who reached the fourth round last year. Young, ranked 81st, had no answer to Federer's delivery as the 31-year-old won all 18 of his first-serve points in the third set. Federer, who next plays Germany's Bjorn Phau, won the tournament five years in a row from 2004. However, he lost in the 2009 final and the semis the following two years as Juan Martin del Potro, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic took the titles. ""Novak to me goes in as the favorite here still at the Open just because he's defending champion, he probably won the most titles on hard courts in the last couple of years, it's where he feels most comfortable,"" Federer said of the Serbian, who was to start his campaign on Tuesday. ""He's beaten me the last couple years as well, so it's strange for me to be the favorite after just beating him a couple times. Then again, I've had a great summer and so has Murray, and Rafa won the French -- it's a pity he can't be here."" U.S. Open: Get the latest scores and match statistics . World No. 4 Murray booked his place into the next round with a 6-2 6-4 6-1 victory over Alex Bogomolov Jr following a two-hour rain delay. Murray, seeded third in the absence of the injured Nadal, lost his opening game and trailed 3-1 in the second set but had few problems against the Russian. ""Only lost seven games in three sets, so I must have done something well today,"" said the Scot, who next faces Croatia's Ivan Dodig as he continues his bid for a first grand slam title, having lost the 2008 final to Federer. ""I played fairly well from the back of the court. I just would have liked to have served a bit better because I wasn't getting many free points on my serve."" The only seeded player to exit on Monday was Germany's No. 22 Florian Mayer, who retired hurt while trailing 6-3 6-2 3-2 to 243rd-ranked American Jack Sock. Sock, who turns 20 next month, will next play Italy's Flavio Cipolla as he seeks to improve on last year's second-round exit.

"(CNN) -- Entrepreneur Tony Fernandes is taking a back seat at the Formula One team he founded in order to help take it to a new level on the track. The Malaysian businessman has been replaced as team principal at Caterham F1 by its new French chief executive Cyril Abiteboul, who has been charged with moving the UK-based marque from the lower regions of the championship standings. AirAsia owner Fernandes, who led the team into F1 in 2010 under the Lotus name, will now concentrate on producing Caterham sports cars in collaboration with Renault. The 35-year-old Abiteboul, who joined from Renault in September, will combine his new role with his duties as CEO, working with the Caterham group's overall chief Riad Asmat. ""The strategy for the establishment and growth of Caterham Group has now reached the stage where we can step back from the day-to-day running of the F1 team in favor of Cyril,"" Fernandes, who also owns English Premier League football team Queens Park Rangers, said in a statement. ""He will be able to dedicate himself full time to the role and work closely with Riad to help take our automotive interests into the next stage of their growth. ""Cyril is going to be an excellent team principal. He has extensive experience in F1, he is extremely well respected and he shares our vision for what we want our team to achieve. ""He takes over during a season when we have not yet fulfilled our potential, but at a time when we have everything in place to help us do so.

Caterham sit 11th in the 12-team constructors' standings with two races to go, having finished 10th in 2010 and 2011.

"(CNN) -- Even after all these years, Roger Federer is still thrilled by the chase. The 31-year-old cannot regain his No. 1 ranking this year, but he can add yet more accolades to his glittering resume if he beats Novak Djokovic in Monday's climax of the ATP World Tour Finals in London. The 17-time grand slam champion blew away Andy Murray in Sunday's second semifinal, earning some measure of revenge for his defeat in August's Olympic gold medal match and denying the Scot another long-awaited milestone. Murray became the first British male to win a grand slam since 1936 when he lifted the U.S. Open in September, but the UK will have to wait for its first finalist in the season-ending showpiece. ""It was a special match. It was the third time in London this year for the two of us and the crowd was electric,"" said two-time defending champion Federer, who beat Murray in July's Wimbledon final to match Pete Sampras' record of seven titles on the hallowed grass courts. ""I have been around the block a few times and that was something. You can't tire of nights like this. ""That is why I keep practising in front of no people, it inspires you to keep working hard."" At first it had seemed that Federer might have been feeling the effects of Saturday's three-set defeat by Juan Martin del Potro, as Murray -- who had an extra day off -- took an early 3-1 lead. But the Swiss worked his way back into the match in front of a pro-Federer crowd, and raced away to win 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 in one hour and 33 minutes. ""Almost all the times when you play Roger anywhere in the world he gets great support everywhere. He deserves that because of everything that he's achieved,"" said Murray. It was his third semifinal defeat in the elite eight-man event, while last year he pulled out with injury during the round-robin stage. ""It's been the best year of my career by a mile ... I've achieved things I've never achieved before,"" the 25-year-old said. Federer will seek a record-extending seventh title, and bid to match the last man to have won it three years in a row -- Murray's coach Ivan Lendl. He will face a formidable foe in Djokovic, who was guaranteed the year-end No. 1 spot when Federer decided not to defend his Paris Masters title last week. The Serbian lost his opening match in the French capital soon after his father was taken to hospital with a serious respiratory problem, but better news from home has helped him win all four matches so far this week. Djokovic was tested by Del Potro in Saturday's opening semifinal, but showed the fighting abilities he needed in earlier group-stage wins against Murray and Tomas Berdych as he prevailed 4-6 6-3 6-2. The giant Argentine, runner-up in 2009, looked poised to reach the final for the second time as he went a break ahead in the second set but Djokovic turned it around. He won the 2008 final when the tournament had its final staging in Shanghai, but has never got this far in London. ""Knowing it's the last match of the season, I'm really going to try to give my best physically and mentally tomorrow,"" said Djokovic, who equaled David Ferrer's leading 74 match victories this year. Del Potro has won a career-high 65 matches in 2012, battling back into the top 10 after a long recovery from serious wrist problems. ""He deserved to win today. If you don't play for the whole match at your best level, it's really difficult to beat him,"" Del Potro said. ""I had the chance to win today when I was a break up in the second, but I didn't serve like yesterday and I didn't serve like my first set today. Nole was returning really well.""","Roger Federer will play world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in final of season-ending tournament .

"Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. Paul Begala says Kirsten Gillibrand is a skillful politician and part of a new generation of rising women leaders. (CNN) -- The big news in New York politics is not that Caroline Kennedy, a deeply private person, preferred to be in private life. Rather, the big news -- and for Democrats, the good news -- is that Gov. David Paterson has put another crack in the glass ceiling by appointing Kirsten Gillibrand to the Senate. Gillibrand has it all. She moves with equal ease among Manhattan high-rollers and Delaware County dairymen. She knocked off an entrenched Republican congressman in a conservative district. When she began, no one but she and then-Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Rahm Emanuel thought she could win. When he was recruiting her for the congressional race, Emanuel told me Gillibrand was someone special. I paid attention because I recalled the time, a decade or so ago, when Emanuel told me a skinny state senator named Barack Obama was the future of the Democratic Party. Since then I've seen Gillibrand in action. My father has a small farm in her district, near the village of Andes, New York. Every summer I bring my boys to Andes to fish in a pristine mountain trout pond, and at night we feast on fresh-caught fish with my dad's neighbors. Those farmers and schoolteachers see Gillibrand as one of their own; someone who shares their values, who respects and protects the rugged beauty of their mountains even as she fights to bring jobs to the region. In short, Gillibrand is the kind of Democrat who can win in blood-red upstate New York. Her membership on both the Agriculture Committee and the Armed Services Committee has allowed her to become an expert in policy areas some Democrats shy away from. I've also seen Gillibrand in the big city. Gov. David Paterson spoke at a Gillibrand fundraiser I attended in a posh penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park. Gillibrand had given birth to her son Henry a few weeks before. Where she got the energy and the enthusiasm I'll never know. Even veteran Manhattanites came away impressed. Listening to Gillibrand speak of how Hillary Clinton inspired her, I couldn't help but see parallels to Barack Obama. Our new president has described himself as part of the Joshua Generation -- the African American leaders who have come after pioneers like John Lewis, Rev. Jesse Jackson and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Perhaps Kirsten Gillibrand is part of the Joshua Generation of women leaders, inspired by Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and so many others who blazed the trail Gillibrand is now following. Watching the jubilation of the Obama inauguration, some feminist friends worried aloud when a woman might break through the way President Obama has. ""I'm still not able to tell my daughter that she can be president,"" one friend said. My own strong belief is we will see a woman president sooner than most suspect. And perhaps she will come from the ranks of the female Joshua Generation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala: Kirsten Gillibrand is a Democratic star in Republican upstate area .

"(CNN) -- Nico Hulkenberg will drive for Sauber next season as a replacement for the departing Sergio Perez, the Formula One team announced Wednesday. Mexico's Perez has already signed a deal with McLaren following 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton's decision to join Mercedes. The recruitment of Hulkenberg from Force India marks the first significant piece of business done by the Swiss marque since Monisha Kaltenborn was appointed as F1's first female team principal earlier this month. Hulkenberg is 12th in this season's drivers' standings with 49 points from 17 races ahead of this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Vettel rejects Ferrari speculation . ""I'm really looking forward to working with the Sauber F1 Team,"" said the 25-year-old, who made his debut on the grid with Williams in 2010. ""It's a well-placed team and very competitive. Plus it's a team in which young drivers have repeatedly delivered exceptional performances. I would like to take up that baton."" Despite his promising rookie season, which was capped by a surprise pole position at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Hulkenberg lost his seat at Williams and spent 2011 as a test driver with Force India. Kaltenborn admitted his performance at Interlagos had been a factor in signing the German, who had interested the team for a number of years. Dominant Vettel secures fourth straight victory . ""We've been observing Nico for some time now and his performances have been very persuasive,"" she said. ""That was the case in GP2 and has continued into Formula One. ""An obvious highlight was how he scored pole at Interlagos in 2010 despite the most challenging external conditions. He clearly showed that he can seize the chance if it arises. ""But high spots like that are one thing; systematic teamwork is another -- and on that score I have confidence in Nico too. I'm sure he will fit in very well with the Sauber F1 Team. We look forward to working together with him."" Sauber has enjoyed a solid 2012 campaign, sitting sixth in the constructors' standings one place above Force India with three races to go. Hulkenberg's teammate next year has yet to be decided, with Sauber expected to release Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi, while Force India have yet to announce who will line up alongside Paul di Resta. Force India team principal Vijay Mallya expressed his gratitude for the work Hulkenberg has done at the UK-based marque. ""It has been a pleasure to have Nico with us for the last couple of years,"" he said. ""At the end of 2010 we identified him as a star of the future and it has been rewarding to watch him develop his racing skills.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer has vowed to bounce back from his second successive defeat against a man who has gained a recent edge over the 17-time grand slam champion. Juan Martin del Potro made his name by beating Federer in the 2009 U.S. Open final, and won again at that year's ATP World Tour Finals, but lost seven in a row before toppling the then world No. 1 in the final of his home event in Basel last month. The Argentine, who towers over most opponents at six foot six inches tall, followed that up on Saturday with a 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-3 victory to qualify for the semifinals of the season-ending showpiece in London. ""It's disappointing,"" said defending champion Federer, who was already assured of a place in Sunday's semifinals after beating David Ferrer on Thursday. ""I had a good feeling going into the match, definitely the right game plan. It's indoor tennis, he has a big serve and all those things. But still I expect myself to get more returns into play. ""But it's important to move on right now. Mentally, it's important to look ahead and rest because it's a quick turnaround. ""I tried everything I could and was a bit frustrated at times, but it shouldn't affect me tomorrow."" Dad's recovery gives Djokovic focus . By losing the first set, Federer ended the hopes of 2007 runner-up Ferrer -- who beat Janko Tipsarevic 4-6 6-3 6-1in the final match of the round-robin stage on Saturday. Ferrer's victory means that Federer faces world No. 3 Andy Murray on Sunday in a rematch of the Wimbledon and Olympic finals, while Del Potro plays No. 1 Djokovic -- who won all three of his Group A games. World No. 5 Ferrer is one of the ATP Tour's in-form players this season, with a leading seven titles -- including his last two outings in Valencia and Paris, where Federer relinquished his title and the No. 1 ranking when he decided to skip the season's final Masters event. The Spaniard now has a tour-leading 74 match wins this year, one more than Djokovic. ""I really wanted to give him a chance and give myself the best possible preparation for the semis. I really hoped I could win,"" said Federer, who is seeking a record-extending seventh title at the elite eight-man event. ""It's not that I prefer David over Juan Martin -- not at all -- but I think he's had a stellar season. ""It was a given I was going to give my very best. But I'm more disappointed for him than I am about losing today."" Djokovic edges Murray at ATP finals . Del Potro is appearing at the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time since 2009, when he lost in the final in the tournament's debut year in the UK capital. ""Beating Federer is not easy for sure. But I didn't think about trying to qualify for the next round,"" said the 24-year-old, who has battled his way back into the top-10 after long-term wrist problems. ""I was just thinking about my match and doing the same things like Basel. At the end I was thinking maybe it could be my last service game of the year. ""So I put all my concentration into serving and that helped me to make fantastic first serves and many aces. But he's still the favorite to win the tournament, with Murray and Djokovic. ""Now you have three big names in the semifinals and one big guy. I'm the number four for sure. But everything can happen. I beat Federer, Novak and Andy a long time ago, so maybe if I am lucky I can repeat that here.""","Juan Martin del Potro beats Roger Federer to claim semifinal place in ATP World Tour Finals .

"(CNN) -- Alain Prost has revealed that he hopes to resurrect the French Grand Prix, a race he won six times during his illustrious Formula One career. The four-time world champion driver is meeting with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone about reinstating the event, which was last held in 2008, at Circuit Paul Ricard near Marseille. ""We were very close to organizing a French Grand Prix in Paris a few years ago and now I've been asked to advise and see if everything is correct,"" the former McLaren driver told CNN ahead of this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. ""I have the opportunity to meet Bernie and we'll see what happens. It might be the right timing, that's all I can say. But in the end it is always a question of money."" The Frenchman picked up the first of his 51 grand prix wins at his home race in 1981. That year it was held in Dijon, which was rotated as a venue with Paul Ricard from the early 1970s until Magny Cours took over in 1991. ""We could have organized a race in Paris a few years ago which was really the best project,"" explained Prost, who also raced for Renault, Ferrari and Williams during a 13-year spell behind the wheel. ""If we cannot do that, I think the Circuit Paul Ricard is really the best place ... in Europe, we are in a way missing Formula One. We still have some races but we miss the historical races. ""We still have Monza, we still have Silverstone, but we see that it is not that easy to organize. We have been everywhere in the world for the benefit of Formula One but at the end of the day, the culture, the tradition of Formula One and motor racing is really in Europe."" Prost has special attachment to the track in Le Castellet, where he took some of his first steps on the road to F1. ""I feel a little bit nostalgic,"" he said. ""In my heart I would be very pleased -- it became a fantastic track, a fantastic place and it would be a shame not to use it. ""I have a lot of memories. It's like Silverstone in England. If you stop racing you lose almost all of the history from the country and that is not good."" After this weekend's Abu Dhabi race, teams will stay at the Yas Marina circuit to take part in the annual young driver test event -- where a Prost will take to an F1 track for the first time since the 1993 Australian Grand Prix. Prost's oldest son Nicolas is a development driver for the Lotus team, formerly known as Renault. The 31-year-old is a latecomer to motorsport, instead deciding to attend university in the U.S. where he was a keen golfer. ""I feel proud about what he's doing today,"" said Prost. ""He's going to follow what the team want him to do, I know they are testing a few things for next year. It's exactly what he wants to do."" Prost is unsure whether his son will follow him onto the grid, saying: ""We'll wait and see. He's very realistic, that is his quality. So he's not going to be disappointed."" Meanwhile, reports have suggested F1 teams face increased entry fees next season as the sport looks to increase revenue. Motorsport's world governing body, the FIA, will charge every entrant $500,000 plus further expenses for each championship point won this season. The constructors' champions -- likely to be Red Bull -- will have to pay $6,000 per point, compared to $5,000 for the rest of the teams, according to the Autosport website. If these financial rules had been in place at the start of the 2012 season, Red Bull would have had to part with $4.4 million to enter the championship after picking up 650 points in 2011. Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel's late-season charge towards a historic third successive drivers' title gathered pace as the Red Bull driver set the fastest time in practice ahead of Sunday's grand prix. The German, who holds a 13-point lead over Ferrari's Fernando Alonso with just three races to go, pipped McLaren's Mercedes-bound Lewis Hamilton by 0.168 seconds on Friday. Vettel, the youngest double world champion in F1 history, has won the last four grands prix to derail Alonso's bid to win Ferrari's first world championship since 2007 and his third overall. The Spaniard struggled to match the frontrunners, finishing the final session seventh fastest.","Alain Prost reveals talks being held over reinstating the French Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel closed on his third straight F1 world title with a dominant drive to win the Indian Grand Prix for Red Bull Sunday. The 25-year-old German was claiming his fourth consecutive victory in this year's championship and the 26th of his career. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso showed his famed fighting qualities to take second place, limiting his losses in the title race, but he still trails Vettel by 13 points with three races to go. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber held off a fast finishing Lewis Hamilton in the McLaren for third place. But all the focus was on the leading pair and Vettel is fully aware that his main rival will still be a factor in the concluding races. ""Yes, maybe I have one hand on the trophy, if you say so, but on the other side, I think Fernando has one hand on it too!"" he told the official post-race media conference. ""It is not easy to fight Red Bull but we will never give up,"" said Spain's Alonso. ""We lost points, but this is what we expected this weekend as we are not fast enough, but we lost minimum points and there will be better races to come,"" he added. Vettel took control of the race from pole at the Buddh International Circuit, while Alonso worked his way from fifth on the grid to third in the early stages as he moved past the McLaren pair of Hamilton and Jenson Button. Alonso was able to take advantage of late technical problems for Webber to overtake the Australian for second place, but was still nearly 10 seconds adrift of Vettel by the finish. Button drove a solid race for fifth, with Felipe Massa in sixth in the second Ferrari ahead of Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus. Nico Hulkenberg of Force India, Romain Grosjean in the second Lotus and Bruno Senna for Williams rounded out the points scoring. Vettel has 240 points with Alonso on 227 with Raikkonen a distant third on 173.

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Mark Whitlock's church practices what he calls the 11th commandment: ""Thou shalt not be boring."" Christ Our Redeemer African Methodist Episcopal Church in Orange County, California, also practices something many other black churches don't: integration. ""We're fully integrated in the workplace, schools, public restaurants everywhere, except the church,"" Whitlock told CNN. ""It's still the most segregated place on Sunday in the United States. Our goal is to do what heaven has already done. Heaven is fully integrated."" But most churches aren't. Nine of 10 churches are segregated, according to an analysis by Christopher P. Scheitle and Kevin D. Dougherty published in the August addition of the journal Socialogical Inquiry. For the purposes of the paper, ""segregated"" meant 80 percent of a church's members were of one race. ""People choose churches where they feel comfortable. Maybe they get challenges there, but they're going for the comfort,"" says Dougherty, a sociology professor at Baylor University in Texas. Titled ""Race, Diversity, and Membership Duration in Religious Congregations,"" the analysis concluded that even when people join a church as minority members, they are less likely to stay as long as the majority. This, the paper's abstract says, ""can create a constant pull toward homogeneity despite congregational efforts to diversify."" Some argue that diversification is in the best interest of Christ Our Redeemer because African-Americans make just 2 percent of the 3.2 million people in Orange County, while more than 78 percent of the people in the county are white. Whitlock argues integration should be happening at every church, because he says most of the issues that blacks, whites and everyone else struggle with are the same. ""We have problems with our kids. We have problems with bills. We have problems on the job."" But some African-American commentators disagree. ""The black church is our best institution,"" says Michael Reel, co-editor for reelurbannews.com and former managing editor of the Baptist Voice. ""It's ours -- it's the one last place in the world that we can call our own."" On his website, Reel says many African-Americans are changing from historically black churches to religious houses that are predominantly white. But Pastor Bobby T. Newman of Citizens of Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Compton, California, says black churches can't afford to lose members to other churches. Newman said it creates a great burden on the church financially and leaves a void for younger African-Americans culturally. He thinks the church needs to adapt to make more people more comfortable attending black churches. Interracial churches can be the scene of internal battles, as CNN has reported previously. Some of those tug-of-wars can be over preaching styles or music. Differing views on interracial dating and the appropriate racial mix of church leaders can also cause tension. Dougherty and co-author Christopher P. Scheitle, a senior research assistant at Penn State University discovered that many church minority members feel they have no say in church affairs, though this starts to change when a minority reaches 40 percent of the church population. More than 3,000 people attend Christ Our Redeemer. Ron Guyer has been attending for 10 years, said he's never felt uncomfortable there. Other churches could learn a lesson from his worship community, he says. ""I think as other black churches are beginning to see what's happening and just the burgeoning growth of Christ Our Redeemer, I think they may take a different look at their agenda and say maybe we should kind of open up our churches.""

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa kept his MotoGP title hopes alive by outpacing championship leader Jorge Lorenzo to win the Japanese round at Motegi Sunday. Pedrosa has closed to within 28 points with three rounds remaining after claiming four of the last five races. Honda's Pedrosa went past his Yamaha rival just past the halfway mark of the 24-lap race to win by over four seconds. Alvaro Bautista completed a Spanish sweep of the podium in third place. Pedrosa's only regret is that Lorenzo has managed to limit the impact of his recent dominant run. ""We did what we needed to do and it's just a pity that there is no one else who can stay with us because every race I win, he's been second,"" he told the official MotoGP website. Italy's Andrea Dovizioso finished fourth with reigning world champion Casey Stoner of Australia in fifth on his return to the circuit after an ankle injury which has sidelined him in the last three races. Honda's Stoner, who will retire at the end of the season, was left frustrated by his effort. ""I'm a little disappointed to be honest. At the start of the race I felt had the pace to stay with Dani and Jorge and the bike was feeling pretty good. Then as the race progressed my body started to suffer and ache in ways I didn't expect,"" he said. Stoner cannot retain his title and is third in the standings but can be a factor to help his teammate in the concluding rounds. Valentino Rossi, who will rejoin Yamaha next season, finished seventh on his Ducati.","Dani Pedrosa wins Japanese MotoGP at Motegi .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel usurped Fernando Alonso as Formula One's youngest double world champion, and all the signs are now pointing to the prospect of the German beating his Spanish rival to a coveted third title. The Ferrari driver led by 44 points with nine races to go, but Vettel now holds a six-point advantage going into Sunday's Indian Grand Prix -- where the Red Bull driver will start in pole position as he seeks to repeat last year's victory at the Buddh International Circuit. The 25-year-old, who has won the last three races, topped Saturday's qualifying session ahead of teammate Mark Webber and will have the McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button creating a buffer against Alonso, who was fifth fastest. ""We got a very good result and now we look forward to the race,"" said Vettel, who like Webber admitted to making mistakes in Q3. ""The races these days, a lot of things can happen so I don't think that means a lot. Obviously I'm very happy to be on pole, it's the best possible position to start, so yeah, I'm very happy with that but there's a hard race coming up."" Latest F1 standings . Webber is fifth overall, 63 points behind Vettel, and has helped Red Bull march towards a third successive manufacturers' title. The duo have now been on the front row for three successive races, and last time out in Korea Webber earned his first podium since winning at Silverstone in July. ""I think the way the factory has helped us this weekend has been incredible,"" the Australian said. ""Milton Keynes has really been pushing hard -- even though they're not here they are with us in terms of work ethic and also for the team and the guys on the floor here. ""Obviously it's not the easiest environment to work in, not in terms of temperature but in terms of other challenges and everyone's getting through that pretty well."" Ferrari coy in flag controversy . Alonso, whose teammate Felipe Massa qualified sixth, acknowledged that Ferrari had been left behind by Red Bull's recent technical improvements. ""When we had a similar car, it was possible to fight with Vettel and we have even been ahead of them, but now we are fighting against (designer) Adrian Newey and, at the moment, we cannot match him,"" the 31-year-old said. ""We brought some updates here which have worked as we expected, but the others have also improved over these past two weeks: it's down to us to bring something more significant for the final three races."" While Hamilton and Button are effectively out of the title race, third-placed Kimi Raikkonen still has slim hopes of adding to his 2007 crown -- though his chances of success on Sunday were hit when he qualified seventh as the leading Lotus. ""Unfortunately, we didn't seem to have any grip this afternoon so it was much more difficult than we thought,"" the Finn said. ""I'm quite disappointed as I thought we had a much better car than that."" Sauber's Sergio Perez, who will replace Hamilton at McLaren next season, was eighth fastest ahead of Williams' Pastor Maldonado. Nico Rosberg rounded out the top 10, while his Mercedes teammate Michael Schumacher will start in 14th place. ""We had a tough qualifying session today and I cannot yet really explain why, particularly when I compare the times to what I did this morning,"" said the seven-time world champion. ""In practice, we were able to run similar lap times with much more fuel in the car but, for whatever reason, we were unable to get the tires into the right working window and generate enough grip this afternoon."" Meanwhile, MotoGP world champion Casey Stoner will start in pole position for his farewell race at his home circuit in Australia on Sunday. The Honda rider, who will retire from motorcycling at the end of this season, headed off Yamaha's series leader Jorge Lorenzo and second-placed Dani Pedrosa in Saturday's qualifying. Stoner, who has had a corner at the Phillip Island circuit named after him, is third in the standings but his chances of a second world title were ended earlier this season by injuries.","F1 championship leader Sebastian Vettel on pole for Sunday's Indian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Spain's Dani Pedrosa kept up the pressure on championship leader Jorge Lorenzo with victory in a rain-hit Malaysian MotoGP Sunday. Pedrosa passed pole sitter Lorenzo midway through the 20-lap race at Sepang which had to be shortened to 13 laps because of the appalling conditions. It was the third straight success for Honda's Pedrosa, but each time Yamaha's Lorenzo has occupied second place to limit the damage. He leads by 23 points overall with two rounds remaining in Australia and Valencia. Pedrosa crossed the line nearly four seconds ahead of Lorenzo as officials displayed the red flag to bring it to a premature halt. Several riders had already come unstuck in the heavy rain.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday he's not sure a potential government shutdown at the end of the month can be avoided because of a stand-off between the House and Senate over how much to spend on disaster relief. ""I heard reports that Sen. (Senate Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell said there will be no shutdown,"" Reid told reporters in the Capitol. ""I'm not that sure. I'm not that sure because the Tea Party-driven House of Representatives has been so unreasonable in the past. I don't know why they should suddenly be reasonable."" At issue is a short-term bill to fund government agencies through November 18 that the GOP-controlled House will vote on Wednesday. It allocates fewer resources to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers for disaster response than the Democratic-led Senate approved last week. Additional funds are needed because recent major floods from Hurricane Irene along the East Coast and wildfires in Texas exceeded the amount these agencies have left in their coffers to support recovery and rebuilding efforts. Both the House and Senate are scheduled to take a weeklong recess next week and the current government funding expires September 30. The GOP measure includes a total of $3.6 billion -- $1 billion in emergency funds available when the bill is enacted and another $2.6 billion to be budgeted for those federal response agencies for the 2012 fiscal year. The Senate bill that passed with bipartisan support last week includes $6.9 billion for FEMA and other federal agencies for immediate disaster relief and for relief in 2012. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama asked Congress for a total of $5.1 billion in additional disaster aid â€” $500 million of which was for immediate relief. In addition to the disagreement over how much money these agencies should get, House Republican leaders are insisting that the $1 billion in their bill that those agencies would get right away to cover recovery costs be offset with $1.5 billion in cuts to a loan program that helps automakers retool their operations to make more fuel-efficient cars. Earlier Tuesday, Reid announced that if the House passes its stopgap-spending bill, the Senate will add the higher amount -- $6.9 billion-- it passed for disaster relief to that bill and send it back to the House, in an attempt to force the House GOP to accept the higher level. Reid's tough stand comes partly because he feels emboldened after 10 Senate Republicans, mostly from disaster-hit states, voted with the Democrats last week to approve that aid. However, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor made it clear the GOP won't budge, and accused the Democrats of using the issue for political gain. ""It'll be on Leader Reid's shoulders because he's the one playing politics with it. No one wants to stand in the way of disaster relief money that is needed. There is nothing else but politics going on with that move, if that's what happens,"" Cantor told reporters Tuesday. Reid accused House Republicans of ""pettiness"" in their allocation of disaster relief and said it would be ""illogical"" to expect the Senate to go along with it or to accept the blame if the government shuts down. Despite the sound and fury between Reid and Cantor, McConnell expressed some optimism that a deal will be struck. ""There won't be a government shutdown,"" he said. ""The Congress always responds appropriately to disasters. We're having a discussion about the appropriate way to do that and I'm confident it will be resolved."" The House GOP spending bill keeps federal agencies funded at the rate set in the debt deal enacted last month. Earlier this year Congress averted a government shutdown at the 11th hour when House Speaker John Boehner and Reid negotiated a compromise on overall spending levels. Many on Capitol Hill believed a similar showdown would be avoided this fall because the debt deal already established how much would be cut. But this battle over disaster aid revives the possibility of a shutdown. A group of close to 70 House Democrats sent a letter to House Republican leaders urging them to bring up the Senate measure without any spending offsets for the FEMA money in it. ""The families that remain without homes in shelters are not interested in seeing more gridlock in Washington. The farmers who lost their crops and livestock do not care about debates over deficits and offsets. The entrepreneurs who lost their small businesses cannot afford to see us play politics,"" the letter states. But House GOP Whip Rep Kevin McCarthy, R-California, predicted Tuesday the Senate bill wouldn't pass in the House. ""If Reid does what he does, I don't see the votes on the floor."" The top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep Norm Dicks, D-Washington, said last week he objects to the practice of offsetting emergency money for natural disaster, but said he would support the bill because he wants to avoid a potential shutdown. But the Democrats' vote-counter in the House, Rep Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, predicted the Republican plan to offset additional disaster aid won't get much Democratic support, ""I think Democrats will be loath to support that effort, because we think it's counterproductive."" Hoyer maintained that cutting the loan program run by the Department of Energy by $1.5 billion ""puts at risk some 30,000 to 50,000 jobs that would be created we believe by that investment."" In addition to the fight over the disaster money, House Republican leaders are also dealing with a rebellion from a group of about 50 House conservatives who oppose the spending measure because the overall funding level is $24 billion above the level House Republicans included in the 2012 budget they passed earlier this year. Despite the blowback on both sides of the aisle, Cantor predicted the House would pass the spending bill when it comes up for a vote on Wednesday. Boehner declined to answer a question Tuesday about whether he was worried about Congress heading for a shutdown. But his spokesman Kevin Smith continued to press for the Senate to accept the House bill, saying, ""We believe the best approach is for the Senate to pass the House (measure) to ensure we get disaster relief to those affected communities as quickly as possible.""","FEMA, Army Corps of Engineers would get more money from Senate .

I have set my sights high and am committed to taking the team forward as Peter Sauber would want and leading it on to success."" Sauber expressed his confidence in Kaltenborn's ability to lead the team, explaining the time had arrived for him to step aside. ""We decided a long time ago that Monisha would take over from me but we left the timing open,"" he said. ""Now is a good time for both of us, so this is the right moment to pass on the baton.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Italian prosecutors' decision to seize Vatican Bank funds as part of an investigation into possible money-laundering was correct, an Italian court ruled Wednesday. The Vatican expressed ""surprise"" that its appeal had been rejected and stood by its position that the investigation was the result of a misunderstanding. Italian prosecutors last month froze Vatican Bank transactions for the first time ever, after the bank failed to provide all the information required by anti-money laundering rules. Prosecutors seized 23 million euros (about $30 million) in Vatican Bank transactions ""as a cautionary measure,"" prosecutor Nello Rossi told CNN in September. Pope Benedict XVI personally told the director of the Vatican Bank that he trusted him and appreciates the work he is doing, the Vatican said the day after they met on September 26. Ettore Tedeschi, the bank head, was among the faithful meeting Benedict that day after the pope's weekly Angelus address. Tedeschi kissed the pope's hand and gave him a copy of his book ""Money and Paradise,"" and they exchanged a few words, the Vatican said. Tedeschi told CNN before the meeting with the pope that he was incredulous and ""humiliated"" when he learned Italian investigators were looking into money-laundering allegations against the bank. He said the probe was the result of a ""misunderstanding."" ""My first reaction was of incredulity and afterwards, that of feeling humiliated in the intense work that, along with [bank] Director-General [Paolo] Cipriani and all of the institute's managers, I've been carrying out,"" Tedeschi told CNN by e-mail September 24. ""After discussing with Dr. Cipriani the actions that spurred the inquiry, I was relieved, and I've realized that we had to immediately take action in explaining the facts to various levels and places,"" he said. Tedeschi said he also realized the need to speed up the process of getting the Vatican Bank on the ""white list"" of banks that comply with internationally agreed standards, ""to prevent other misunderstanding events like the one that just happened."" This is not the first time Italian prosecutors have investigated the bank, but probes are extremely rare, Rossi said. The probe began after another Italian bank informed Bank of Italy investigators of two Vatican Bank transactions that did not appear to comply with anti-money-laundering requirements, the Bank of Italy said. When Bank of Italy investigators told legal authorities about the transactions, they were told that judicial authorities were already investigating the Vatican Bank, a source close to the investigation said. The Vatican Bank is ""the most secret bank in the world,"" author Jeffrey Robinson said after the funds were seized, and he said there is no way to find out how much money it controls. The Vatican's sources of income include its vast real estate holdings, explained Robinson, who wrote ""The Laundrymen,"" which looks at money laundering worldwide. The Bank of Italy investigation was prompted by two wire transfers that the Vatican Bank asked Credito Artigiano to carry out, the Bank of Italy said. The Vatican Bank did not provide enough information about the transfers -- one for 20 million euros (about $26 million) and one for 3 million euros (about $4 million) -- to comply with the law, prompting the Bank of Italy to suspend them automatically, it said. It is not entirely clear how much legal authority Italian officials have over the Vatican Bank, since the Vatican is a sovereign state. They had the power to seize the money and stop the transactions because they took place on Italian soil, said Rossi, the prosecutor. An effort by Holocaust survivors to sue the Vatican Bank in the United States failed in 2009 when a U.S. court ruled that the Vatican Bank had ""sovereign immunity"" and was not subject to lawsuits filed in the United States. A lawsuit against related entities is still in court. The Vatican Bank was created by an order of the pope ""to carry on activities that are for pious causes,"" according to expert testimony related to the Holocaust suit. It accepts deposits only from top Catholic Church officials and entities, Settimio Caridi testified in U.S. District Court in 2006. It uses its funds ""for designated pious purposes"" and is ""an autonomous pious foundation,"" he said. Caridi, a top Italian legal scholar who was called to testify by Vatican lawyers, said the bank is an integral part of the Vatican, a ""central entity under the oversight of the Holy See."" It is ultimately overseen by a commission of five cardinals -- the top position in the Vatican hierarchy below the pope -- which is headed by the Vatican secretary of state. The Vatican Bank is subject to particularly stringent anti-money-laundering regulations because Italian law does not consider it to be operating within the European Union. It must supply more detailed information about transactions than European Union banks have to give. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome and Richard Allen Greene in London, England, contributed to this report.","Prosecutors seized about $30 million in transactions last month over money-laundering fears .

"(CNN) -- Italy pushed back Wednesday against a European court ruling that crucifixes in classrooms violate students' right to freedom of religion and education. The European Court of Human Rights found unanimously in November that the display of a particular religious symbol -- such as the Christian cross -- in a classroom ""restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions, and the right of children to believe or not to believe."" But the court agreed in January to hear Italy's appeal. Ten other European governments, dozens of European lawmakers and half a dozen nongovernmental organizations have also gotten involved in the appeal. The original case was brought by an Italian woman, Soile Lautsi, who objected to the crucifixes on the walls in her two sons' classrooms. She fought her way through the Italian legal system starting in 2001, arguing that she wanted to raise her children as secular, according to court documents. Italian courts ruled earlier that the cross was a symbol of Italy's history and culture, prompting Lautsi to take her case to the European court in Strasbourg, France. It awarded her 5,000 euros ($7,400) in damages in November. The court does not have the power to force Italy to take down the representations of Jesus on the cross, but if its ruling stands and Italy does not comply, the door would be open for others to sue on the same grounds, said court spokesman Stefano Piedimonte. Only Italy would be directly affected by the ruling if it loses the case, but all 47 countries that belong to the Council of Europe ""might draw consequences from such a judgment,"" court spokesman Frederic Dolt added. It could take the court six months to a year to rule, he said. Leading Catholic figures expressed astonishment and anger at the ruling last year. The Italian Conference of Bishops called it ""cause for bitterness and many perplexities."" ""It does not take into account the fact that in Italy the display of the crucifix in public places is in line with the recognition of the principles of Catholicism as 'part of the historical patrimony of the Italian people,' as stated in the Vatican/Italy agreement of 1984,"" the bishops said in a written statement. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re told the leading Italian daily La Repubblica he could not understand it, and that no one with common sense could have expected it. ""When I think that we are talking about a symbol, the crucifix, an image that cannot but be the emblem of a universally shared humanity, I not only feel disappointed but also sadness and grief,"" he said. ""The crucifix is the sign of a God that loves man to the point of giving up his life for him. It is a God that teaches us to learn to love, to pay attention to each man ... and to respect the others, even those who belong to a different culture or religion. How could someone not share such a symbol?"" Seventeen judges heard the appeal Wednesday. The governments of Russia, Greece, Armenia, Romania, Lithuania, Malta, San Marino, Bulgaria, Monaco and Cyprus are also involved in the appeal, the court said. The European Court of Human Rights was set up in Strasbourg by the Council of Europe Member States in 1959 to deal with alleged violations of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights.
