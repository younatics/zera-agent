"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Christopher Davies, 40, told police he was a drug dealer after he was arrested for dealing heroin . A criminal caught supplying heroin in a city centre told police he was a drug dealer as they arrested him, a court heard. Christopher Davies, 40, was caught selling the drug on the streets of Tredworth, Gloucester, on November 27th last year. He was taken to Gloucester police station - where he candidly told officers he was a drug dealer. Davies admitted possessing heroin with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and nine months at Gloucester crown court today. Jailing Davies, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said that Davies’ comment about being a drug dealer would usually . entitle him to maximum credit for an early guilty plea. But the judge said he interpreted the words as a joke by Davies - rather than an early show of remorse. Tabor told him: 'Heroin is a very dangerous drug as you know from your own addiction.' In court today, prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said three police officers on patrol in High Street, Tredworth, Gloucester, saw two men and a woman on the streets at about 2.20pm that day. The officers saw what looked like a drug deal taking place - Davies handed something to one of the others. As Davies did so he looked up, saw the officers, and made off. However, Pc Richard Handley pursued and caught him. He placed him under arrest but Davies began to struggle and was taken to the ground. He was seen to throw something into the road and two clingfilm wraps of heroin were found. In his left trouser pocket were another 8 wraps of clingfilm containing the drug and £140 in cash. His car was searched and a further wrap of the drug was found. In total he had 45.8grams of heroin with a street value of £2,290, said Mrs Hennessy. Having been caught red handed, Davies was taken to Gloucester police station, pictured. There he told officers who asked him his employment status he was a drug dealer . 'When asked his employment status he said he was a drug dealer,' she said . 'He went on to say he was a heavy drug user himself and supplied to be able to pay for that. 'He also said ""You would have to be off your bloody face to walk down the road with all that sh*t.""' Joe Maloney, defending, said there was a ‘very positive’ pre-sentence report from the probation service on Davies. 'Last year he became dependent on drugs for a while but this arrest was a turning point and he has addressed the issues that led to him committing these offences,' he said. Davies admitted possessing heroin with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and nine months at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) today . After being told he was going to prison Davies pleaded for a change of heart, saying he had a young family who would suffer. 'I am truly sorry for what I have done,' he said. 'I have got a family and I am not what you think I am.' He said that a prison term for him would be far more damaging than for many. 'I will not ever be in this court again,' he said. But the judge told him the sentence was not just to punish him but also to deter other dealers in hard drugs.","Christopher Davies, 40, caught dealing heroin by officers in Gloucester .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two men convicted of plotting to murder and rob singer Joss Stone appealed their sentences at London's Court of Appeal today . Two men convicted of plotting to rob and kill international pop star Joss Stone appealed against their sentences today. Three judges at the Court of Appeal in London heard challenges by Kevin Liverpool and Junior Bradshaw, who were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to rob following a three-week trial at Exeter Crown Court last year. Liverpool was given a life sentence, with a minimum term of 10 years and eight months - the least he must serve before becoming eligible to apply for parole - while Bradshaw was jailed for 18 years. Judge Francis Gilbert, the Recorder of Exeter, branded Liverpool a danger to the public and said he targeted Miss Stone to get more than £1 million from her. He told him: 'You intended to rob her and kill her and dump her body in the river, according to your words, and then leave the country with your accomplice Junior Bradshaw. 'You had no reason to target her except that she was a wealthy young woman as she was a successful singer.' Liverpool, 36, and Bradshaw, 33, drove from Manchester to Miss Stone's home in mid-Devon with an arsenal of weapons to rob and kill her. The flatmates, of St Stephen's Close, Longsight, Manchester, had scouted Miss Stone's home and were on their way to attack her armed with a sword, three knives, two hammers, masks, gloves and a hosepipe when they were arrested in Cullompton in June 2011. Suspicious residents had called the police, having spotted Liverpool and Bradshaw's badly-damaged Fiat Punto in the area. The pair told police they were lost . and were trying to get to Bristol but officers became wary and quickly . discovered the cache in the boot. Both men were present in the dock of the court for the proceedings today. After . hearing submissions from QCs on their behalf, Lady Justice Macur . announced that the court would give its decision on the appeals next . Tuesday.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . British prisoners of war who died in German camps in the First World War have finally been honoured with proper war graves. Thirty-nine servicemen who were held in the Heilsberg prisoner camp were commemorated in a ceremony today at the site, which is in modern-day Poland. The men, some of them just teenagers, were buried in a common grave after they died from disease and mistreatment while incarcerated. Ceremony: The dead were memorialised by a gun salute from Polish soldiers . Long process: The men died during the First World War, but have only just received full headstones . Remembrance: Tourists visiting Heilsberg prisoner camp paid their respects . Political unrest in the region, which . was behind the Communist Iron Curtain for decades, meant that families . of the men struggled to have their graves properly recognised. Instead, their names were put on a memorial plaque in Malbork, about 75 miles away. But now the Commonwealth War . Graves Commission arranged for today's ceremony at Lidzbark cemetery, where 39 . white headstones were dedicated to the servicemen buried there. British Ambassador Robin Barnett and local governor Artur Jankowski led the ceremony, and 39 schoolchildren held grave lanterns lit by candles at each of the headstones. Information about the dead was collected . by the Western Front Association, a British non-governmental . organization that preserves the memory of World War I soldiers, and by . Pauline Page-Jones, an amateur historian from Llanfyllin, Wales, where . one of the prisoners was from.

"By . Mia De Graaf . A one-legged man in China has become a local celebrity after building a career as a painter and decorator despite his disability. Li Shuang, who lost two thirds of his left leg to a cancerous tumour in 2005, now employs a number of disabled people struggling to find work - and plans to expand. Known to the people of Changchun, north east China, as 'Hoppy', he made a name for himself by offering to work for free. Celebrity: Li Shuang earned a name for himself in Changchun, north east China, after offering to work for free . When they saw that he was as good as able-bodied competitors, the work flowed in. Li, 39, thought that he would be an unemployable cripple for life, unable to work and a burden on his family, when he was forced to amputate his leg. 'But sitting around moping and feeling sorry for myself is really not my style,' he declares. He lost his left leg to a cancerous tumour almost a decade ago and feared he would never work again . Once he started working, employers realised he was as capable as his able-bodied competitors . 'So I decided that one legged, or no legged, I was going to persevere and make something of my life. And that is what I did.' Now, with a 40-strong team of employees, he is happier than ever - and he doesn't mind his nickname a bit. His dream, he says, is to change society's view of disabled people. He now employs a team of 40 people, including some disabled workers, which he hopes to expand . Li says his dream is to help offer the same opportunities he found to other people with disabilities . 'They deserve the kind of chance that I found for myself,' said Li. 'My dream is to keep on expanding the business and keep on employing people who have disabilities who can't work anywhere else.

"By . Phil Casey . European Tour chief executive George O’Grady has apologised for the 'hurt and upset' caused by the decision to finish the Madeira Islands Open following the death of caddie Iain McGregor. Zimbabwean McGregor suffered a fatal heart attack on the ninth hole at Santo da Serra and although an indefinite suspension of play was initially announced, the decision was later taken to resume the event, which had already been reduced to 36 holes due to bad weather. Many players and caddies criticised that decision and O’Grady held an 'emotional' meeting with the European Tour Caddies Association during the Spanish Open this week, a meeting also attended by players’ tournament committee chairman Thomas Bjorn. Apology: George O'Grady acknowledged the 'hurt and upset' caused by actions at the Madeira Islands Open . In a statement on the European Tour website, O’Grady said: 'We had a full and frank meeting with chairman Gerry Byrne and his committee, a meeting which was understandably emotional at times and one during which I apologised to them for the hurt and upset caused by events in Madeira. 'I completely understand the views of people who say that we should not have carried on, but it was a terrible situation for anyone to be in and the decision to finish the tournament was not taken lightly, either by myself or by the tournament officials on the ground in Madeira. 'However, that decision is in the past and the important thing now is that we continue to work with Mac’s family and friends - as we have done from last Sunday - to assist with arrangements surrounding the funeral, which will take place in Madeira next Thursday, the same day as we wear ""Black for Mac"" at Wentworth (during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship). 'I have also personally instructed a review of how we deal, operationally, at tournaments with situations such as this so that we can ensure the lessons of Madeira are learned.' O’Grady also paid tribute to Alastair Forsyth, whose bag McGregor was carrying at the time. 'Throughout this whole process Alastair has behaved like a true gentleman in incredibly challenging circumstances,' O’Grady added. 'He accepted our decision to play on in Madeira with grace and dignity and he should command enormous respect for the way he has conducted himself throughout this difficult week.' Upset: Caddie Iain McGregor suffered a heart attack and died but the tournament continued regardless . Gerry Byrne, chairman of the European Tour Caddies Association, said: 'We as a committee have faced an extremely tough week. Dealing with the passing of our colleague and friend during a tournament is particularly upsetting. 'While we understand that decisions have to be made at very short notice, it will come as no surprise to anyone that all European Tour caddies felt the wrong one was made in Madeira. 'We went into the meeting unhappy and it was emotional at times, but George’s humility and honesty in dealing with tough questions was greatly appreciated and it reassured us of the caddies’ important position within the Tour. 'We can now look forward to celebrating Iain’s life next Thursday and strengthening our links with the European Tour moving forwards.'","McGgregor suffered a heart attack on the ninth hole and died .

"By . Dan Bloom . It may not be a full-on invasion of killer sea monsters, but it's a start. A rambler stood and watched as this dustbin-lid-shaped, 4ft long barrel jellyfish swam half a mile up a river estuary. It is the latest sighting on the south coast of the huge but harmless creatures, which are usually found further out to sea and rarely come close to the shore. Swimming upstream: This barrel jellyfish was spotted swimming up the Helford river estuary in Cornwall . Stuff of nightmares? Thankfully the creature doesn't rank with Jaws as the tide would have washed it back out . And the coming summer weather means there could be many more on the way, according to experts. Measuring 4ft from head to tentacle tip, the harmless jellyfish are often spotted away from the southern and western shores of the British Isles. Wildlife cruise operators have already reported hundreds of the creatures off the coasts of Devon, Dorset and Cornwall. But rambler David Smith, 45, photographed this jellyfish in a rare inland sighting as he visited Porth Sawsen beach near Falmouth. He said: 'It looked at first like a giant blancmange sitting on the water. I took a closer look and realised it was one of those rare jellyfishes that are making the news. Tranquil: The area of the Helford river estuary in Cornwall where the jellyfish was seen . 'Invasion': A string of barrel jellyfish sightings has been reported on a beach in Portland, Dorset. Above, wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella poses with the enormous creature, measuring 3ft in diameter . They look like something from a horror film, but barrel jellyfish are the 'basking shark' of their species - enormous but harmless, feeding only on miniscule prey. Often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the English Channel, the Irish Sea and off the Outer Hebrides. But it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland, which is why recent sightings have made headlines. And when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate, creating huge swarms. Beneath the dustbin lid-shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ('pores'), each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton. The stings, however, are not strong enough to harm humans. Source: Marine Conservation Society . 'I followed it about half a mile up the river before it eventually disappeared beneath the water. The thing moved at a snail’s pace so I was able to get a few photos before it vanished.' Richard Harrington of the Marine Conservation Society said: 'Half a mile up an estuary is not too far as they are relatively strong swimmers, but it was more likely carried in then out again by the tide. 'This type of jellyfish is a regular visitor to the UK, although we’ve had reports of some very big ones this year. 'This is the only species of jellyfish that can live for more than one season, so these larger jellyfish are probably adults who have survived through the mild winter.' The sighting comes days after several of the jellyfish washed up on beaches near Portland, Dorset. Wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella, who picked up one of the animals, said: 'I think we will see more strandings because of the on-shore winds and the tides, but people should be careful not to touch them.' The barrel jellyfish, Latin name rhizostoma pulmo, is not thought to be dangerous to humans. Even so, beachgoers are advised not to touch any jellyfish in case they chance upon a species with a powerful sting. Red Cross guidance says sting victims should not use urine to relieve the pain of a sting - because vinegar is far more effective. Large: The sighting came days after this barrel jellyfish washed up on a beach in Portland, Dorset . Working out where jellyfish will swarm is a tricky business, but tourists will soon have a helping hand - from the Force, no less. Marine biologists have launched a website called JeDI (Jellyfish Data Initiative) which maps swarms of the creatures and allows tourists to check their location. In future, it could have a weather forecast-like feature to help people avoid getting stung. The site draws on almost half a million sets of data on how many jellyfish there are in the uppermost 200 metres of the world’s seas. It was created amid warnings that large numbers of the creatures can cause fish stocks to plummet. The scientists found the greatest concentrations of jellyfish were in the mid latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, partly due to high levels of oxygen in the North Atlantic. Dr Cathy Lucas, a marine biologist from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, said: 'People will be able to contribute their own data... It will be like a jellyfish version of Google Maps. 'We haven’t got a weather forecast feature yet as it’s just raw data but in the future we’re hoping to have something to help members of the public use the database.'","Creature spotted swimming half a mile up Helford river estuary in Cornwall .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured arriving at the BBC, said he was confident his plan to renegotiate Britain's EU membership would be successful . David Cameron today signalled he would call for Britain to leave the European Union if Brussels refuses his demands for change. The Prime Minister said he would not 'sit on the fence' in the in-out referendum he has vowed to hold by the end of 2017, after trying to renegotiate the UK's membership. But he repeatedly insisted he remains confident his plan to overhaul the EU's powers will be successful. The PM wants to make it harder for migrants to claim the dole, stop child benefit being sent to families living across the EU, a guarantee that Britain will never be forced to join the Euro and an exemption from the aim of 'ever closer union'. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch PM Mark Rutte has suggested they are willing to act on benefits and red-tape. Mr Cameron said he was increasingly confident that a deal could be reached. The renegotiation is expected to start soon after the general election in 2015, before a promised in-out referendum before the end of 2017. But Mr Cameron faced repeated questions about whether he whether he would back leaving the EU if his renegotiation failed. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if he would give a clear recommendation to the British people to vote yes or no in the referendum, Mr Cameron replied: 'Of course, I am not going to sit on the fence.' He added: 'We have the referendum whether or not I have successfully negotiated. I think the negotiation will be successful.' He insisted that he is confident of reaching agreement across to EU for changes which means he could recommend staying in. 'I am tremendously upbeat, bullish and optimistic about what Britain can achieve in terms of our our economy but also our place in Europe.' Mr Cameron reiterated his pledge that he will not become Prime Minister if he cannot deliver an in-out referendum. It means that such a vote will be a deal breaker for any future coalition with the Lib Dems. It also suggests Mr Cameron would quit as Tory leader, rather than lead a minority Conservative government. With less than two weeks to go until the European elections, Mr Cameron set out more of the changes he wants to see in Britain's relationship with Brussels. He said: 'We are very clear about what we want to achieve. Let's end benefit tourism, let's make sure the single market is properly safeguarded. 'Let's make sure that Parliaments can get together and block unwelcome proposals from the European Commission. 'Let's make a series of changes to make Europe more flexible, more competitive. Those are the sorts of things I want to see.' The Prime Minister was repeatedly challenged by the BBC's Andrew Mar about what he would say at the referendum if his renegotiation fails, something he is confident will not happen . The government has already increased to the three months the time migrants must wait before they can claim benefits after they arrive in the UK. Mr Cameron said he wanted the limit to be much longer, adding: 'We need to make sure that the freedom to move to work is about just that. It's to go and get a job, it's not to claim.' He also wants to stop millions of pounds being sent abroad each year in child benefit for children who live elsewhere in the EU. There are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland. Mr Cameron . said he had not made 'anybody who thinks that is sensible' but admitted . that under existing EU rules 'it seems impossible to change that'. The . Prime Minister said he could 'absolutely' give a cast-iron guarantee . that the vote would go ahead in 2017 if he is returned to No 10. Before going head-to-head with the BBC's Andrew Marr, the Prime Minister popped into a nearby Starbucks . But the comment will draw unhelpful comparisons with his last 'cast-iron' promise - to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty - which never happened because the treaty was passed by the EU before Mr Cameron came to power. Earlier Mr Cameron told sceptics that he 'gets it' after previous plans to offer them a referendum on British membership of the European Union did not materialise. But the Conservative leader insisted that his party is the only 'credible' option. The Tories face an electoral drubbing on May 22, possibly even pushed into third behind Ukip and Labour. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has boasted that he will trigger a 'political earthquake' by topping the polls. Earlier Mr Cameron issued a direct plea to undecided voters to back his plans for Europe in this month's elections - but admits that he understands their doubts over his ability to deliver. 'Pessimist': Mr Cameron seemed to attack politicians like Nigel Farage for being overly negative . Mr Cameron launched attacks on Labour - who are not offering voters a choice on Europe - and said that they are 'flailing around' on the economy.He also hit out at Ukip, characterising them as 'doom-mongers' who are convinced Britain's best days are over. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said that 'there is only one party with a credible plan in Europe', before reiterating his aim of securing concessions from the EU on immigration, trade, justice and ending the commitment to 'ever closer union'. Pre-empting doubts over whether he will follow through on his promises, he said: 'If you’re reading this thinking “I’ve heard all this before” – I get it. 'I was watching, too, when Labour made Britain the doormat of Europe and signed British taxpayers up to eurozone bail-out funds. So I understand the scepticism.' He then boasted of ways the Government had saved taxpayers from paying for bail-outs and a higher EU budget, before repeating his recent promise to resign if the referendum doesn't happen.The . Prime Minister also took an apparent swipe at Mr Farage, mocking his pessimism, although he does not directly name him, with a reference to Dad's Army character Private Frazer. He . said: 'There are politicians who refuse to be upbeat about Britain. To . them, pessimism equals patriotism. They insist that our best days are . behind us and that everything is bound to get worse. 'Like Private Frazer politicians they're perennially crying out that 'we're all doomed'.' By contrast, Mr Cameron said that he and his party are 'optimistic' about the future of Britain. Polling . has indicated Nigel Farage's party will come first in the UK's European . Parliament results, with the Conservatives pushed into a humiliating . third place.","Prime Minister insists he is confident he can negotiate a new deal for Britain .

It will forever be known as the Great Escape in Kingston-upon-Hull but its architect Warren Joyce always thinks of another classic war film, when he recalls the unlikely tale. 'We were going to a game and the lads were watching the Dirty Dozen when it dawned on me,' said Joyce. 'I was on the bus in charge of this motley crew of players, cast-offs. No-one else wanted them. We couldn’t get anyone else. 'We were bottom of the Football League and I just went for hardest characters I could find. All those I’d hated playing against, those I knew were tough but had reputations for being hard to handle. I thought in a dog-fight, you need personality.' The Dirty Dozen: Warren Joyce helped Hull avoid relegation from the Football League in 1999 . Come along way: Hull take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday evening . It was 1998. A few months earlier, Arsenal had completed the Double, winning the FA Cup at Wembley at the end of Arsene Wenger’s first full season in England. Hull City had ended the same campaign 90 rungs down the ladder, the third worst team in Football League, the new following season, things got worse. They were nine points adrift at the bottom of League Two in November when Joyce, the club captain was asked to take over as player-caretaker-manager. It would get worse before it got better. Crisis does not begin to explain the pit of trouble: plunging towards extinction, begging favours for training facilities and transport, with supporters in revolt and yet another bitter ownership struggle unfolding. Somehow, this bunch of renegades stayed up. 'The football was very, very basic,' said Joyce. 'We had to simplify the game-plan. It was built on running power, fitness and a few counter-attacks but we had spirit. Differing fortunes: Arsenal won the double just a few months before Hull were rooted to the bottom . 'I remember standing in the tunnel and I’d see people wilt when they lined up against us. It was so loud and my lot would be staring them down. I could tell when they didn’t fancy it. They were a scary bunch but their discipline and self-control was good. 'They knew this was their chance. Most had been dumped by clubs a lot smaller than Hull City. And the common bond was no-one wanted to go out of the Football League. We won a game at Southend and we weren’t officially safe but we knew we were staying up. That trip back was unbelievable.' Joyce was appointed permanent player-manager and within a year of the escape act had been sacked. That’s gratitude football-style. He had kept Hull in the Football League. He stopped the rot and like the Tigers has not looked back, forging a reputation as a successful development coach, first at Leeds and then Manchester United, where he is reserve team coach. There was a two-year spell in charge of Royal Antwerp, in Belgium, but he has otherwise resisted offers to return to management. He was linked with a return to Hull when Nigel Pearson left in 2011. Present day: Joyce has forged a reputation as a successful development coach and is working at Man United . Joyce coached at United’s Academy when he was still playing, having acquired his coaching qualifications in his mid-twenties. It was in his blood. His father Walter also devoted his life to football as a player and coach. James Milner, Aaron Lennon and Scott Carson were all nurtured by Joyce in his role as youth team manager at Leeds and many more at Old Trafford, including James Wilson, who scored twice on his United debut against Hull. No-one in the East Yorkshire city will hold it against him. His hero status is assured as the man who inspired Hull City’s revival from rock bottom of the Football League to the first FA Cup final in the club’s 110-year history.","Warren Joyce rescued Hull City from oblivion during his stint as the Tigers' player-manager back in 1999 .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . After 38 games of a long, hard season, the best side always wins the title and Manchester City thoroughly deserve their success. Manuel Pellegrini has done a fantastic job in his first season in English football and he and City should be congratulated. After the match I was talking to Graeme Souness and we agreed that if we were to have our careers again in the present day then we, and any current young player, would want to join City. That is the club where you want to be. Man United have dominated English football for so long and though City might not have the history, they have the future. The champions: Vincent Kompany holds up the trophy as Manchester City win the Premier League . They have spent big money but they are building now with a manager who has the respect and gratitude of his players and are always looking forward. With Patrick Vieira working with the youth sides, too, they are clearly trying to copy the Spanish model of having an entire club following one football philosophy. It has served them well this season, but they will want to make a much better defence of their title than they did after winning it 2011-12. That will not be easy. Make no mistake, the big clubs are coming for City. United will not want a repeat of this season, Jose Mourinho will be desperate to get Chelsea winning trophies, Arsenal will challenge again and if Liverpool can keep Luis Suarez they will be right up there. If those five are fighting it out at the top, we could be in for another special season. Happy man: Manuel Pellegrini has done a fantastic job in his first season in charge at Manchester City . Reliable Ramsey . The number of times the lead at the top of the Premier League has changed  hands this season. Aaron Ramsey gave Arsenal a reminder of what they have been missing with his goal at Norwich on Sunday. He has taken his game to the next level and I almost picked him in my team of the year. Ramsey was the best player in the league until his injury and that was a real blow for Arsenal because he is a complete midfielder — he can tackle, pass, assist and score. And, as the stats below show, Arsenal were much better off when their Welsh wizard was on the pitch this season. Who's the man? Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey celebrates after scoring against Norwich on Sunday . We could be saying farewell to some good managers this summer but clubs should be careful what they wish for. West Ham need to be a Premier League club when they move into the Olympic Stadium and though the football wasn’t pretty, Sam Allardyce has done well to keep them up. At Tottenham, I’m not sure what the future holds for Tim Sherwood but he has done a good job in difficult circumstances. He knows he still has a lot to learn but he has done more than enough to get another good job. More to come: Tottenham Hotspur interim manager Tim Sherwood acknowledges the supporters . Was this the best season ever? In terms of the excitement, the goals, the twists and the turns, I don’t think I have seen a better Premier League season. It may not have the same passing or technical quality as the Spanish league, but from top to bottom, nothing beats the pure, raw excitement of the Premier League. Where else would you find a game and an atmosphere like there was at Selhurst Park on Monday night, or at Anfield when Liverpool beat City? Those two games more than any other this season epitomised everything we love about our league — goals, passion and great drama. Drama: Luis Suarez was left gutted after Crystal Palace fought back for a 3-3 draw with Liverpool last Monday . That game at Anfield was a personal favourite and was one of the undoubted higlights of the season.Yaya Toure and Luis Suarez had their own personal battle to win goal of the season, but I think Suarez’s flick up and volley against Norwich was the best individual goal while Jack Wilshere’s, also against Norwich, was the best team effort. It has been magnificent viewing, so let’s hope for more of the same after a great World Cup. Happier times: Suarez's flick up and volley against Norwich was the best individual goal of the season . Brilliant Barkley . He didn’t quite make it into my team of the season, but there is no doubt about my young player of the year. Ross Barkley has been superb and I have loved watching him tear through midfields up and down the country. Talent: Everton's 20-year-old Ross Barkley has been superb throughout the season . He is unique in the English game because we don’t have another young player who can carry the ball so far and at such speed and still look comfortable with both feet.

"By . Sam Webb . Hundreds of patients queued for more than four hours to say goodbye to a cherished GP when he retired from practice after 32 years. Described affectionately as a 'good old fashioned' doctor, Dr Richard Hughes was adored for the way he took time to get to know people and talk through their issues - rather than to simply treat patients as 'a number'. His decision to retire from Hanway Medical Practice in Portsmouth, Hampshire, was met with dismay and receptionists were deluged with requests for appointments with the 60-year-old medic just so people could wish him farewell. But staff were unable to fit them all in, so decided to open specially for two hours on a Saturday afternoon to accommodate their requests. Thanks, and goodbye: Patients queue down the street to bid a fond farewell to beloved doctor Richard Hughes, who is retiring after 32 years. He was well-liked for his efforts to get to know those he cared for . In the end, they were forced to remain open for over four hours after hundreds of people formed a queue around the block. They arrived with cards and gifts - including food hampers - and joined him for a chat, tea, coffee, and cake. Dr Hughes qualified as a doctor in London in 1977 before settling in Portsmouth in 1980. He worked at the city’s St Mary’s Hospital before completing his GP training at the Hanway Medical Practice, where he worked until he retired. Practice manager Denise Fenton, 57, said: 'Richard was completely humbled by the turnout but it came as no surprise to the other staff. The practice manager said: 'Richard was like your old-fashioned doctor, who went out of his way to do home visits and to get to know everybody personally.' Pictured (left to right) Patient Atik Miah, Dr Richard Hughes and patient Sue Louth . 'We were bombarded with requests for appointments with him since he announced his retirement, and we couldn’t fit everybody in. 'We told patients we would open for a couple of hours one weekend so we could leave the week day appointments for medical matters. 'But even that wasn’t enough. Hundreds of people queued around the block, so we were forced to extend the drop-in session.' She added: 'Richard was like your old-fashioned doctor, who went out of his way to do home visits and to get to know everybody personally. 'He would be the first person in in the morning and the last to leave at night - sometimes as late as 11pm. 'He was always over-running because he spent so much time talking to patients. However, nobody seemed to mind waiting for him to catch up, as long as they could get to see him. 'His departure is a huge loss to the surgery, but we wish him well.' Dr Hughes said: 'As soon as I qualified in 1982, I knew it was the place I wanted to be. I have always liked knowing people and finding out about their families, so it was a perfect job for me. 'I have never disliked anyone I met and have enjoyed working as a GP. All my patients have been so unique. 'There are thousands of stories that I will take with me, and all of them so individual. I will miss all the staff there, they have always been so superb and one of the reasons why I’ve enjoyed working there so much. 'I was very touched to see how many people came to say goodbye to me. I’m lucky to have had such a great career.' During his time, Dr Hughes took a special interest in diabetes care, and also started training junior doctors. Patient Sue Louth, 62, who visited the surgery to wish him good luck, said: 'He had been my GP for more than 30 years and was the best. 'He always had time for you, would listen to your problems and ask after your whole family. He took care of you and treated you as an individual - he always went that extra mile.' Dr Hughes will use his retirement to spend more time with his wife Theresa, and his three children. He would also like to enjoy conservation and wildlife hobbies. Ed Miliband's promise to guarantee patients a GP appointment within 48 hours could cost £3billion, doctors warned today. Labour . has set aside just £100million to pay for the policy, launched last . night to bolster support as polls put the Tories ahead for the first . time in two years. Today . the Royal College of GPs said the £3billion would need to be found from . elsewhere in the NHS to reverse the 'erosion' of funding to local . surgeries over recent years. Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans to guarantee patients can get an appointment with their GP within 48 hours . In . a speech last night Mr Miliband said it was a ‘scandal’ that many . patients have to wait days to be seen by a GP, and said his party would . plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times. He . claimed the £100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times . would be found by cutting back on NHS red tape and highly-paid . consultants. But Maureen Baker, chairman of the RCGP, said the money was not enough to fulfil the pledge. She . told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The £100 million is a start and . it’s a welcome start. It’s not actually anywhere near enough to give any . sort of guarantee. 'When . you look at it, it’s around about £10,000 per practice. It certainly . won’t go anywhere near employing at practice level more nurses, more . GPs. 'At . the moment the share of NHS funding that goes to general practice is . just over 8 per cent. We see about 90 per cent of all NHS consultations. We believe that our share should be around about 11 per cent.' She . said this was the equivalent of 'a rebalancing of  £3billion because . that is the share of the NHS budget that historically came to general . practice that let us provide the service that patients value and want'. Dr . Baker added: 'That funding has been eroded over the years and we need . to be able to balance NHS funding to deliver a proper general practice . service.' Labour . claimed that the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours . has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, with . one in four people have to wait a week to be seen. Mr Miliband visited Leighton Hospital in Crewe ahead of his policy launch, which has since been criticised for a lack of funding . Mr . Miliband said his ‘guarantee’ would prevent patients who cannot get an . appointment with their GP flooding A&E departments and would save . the NHS more than £300million. ‘This . will be better for patients, because they have better access to their . GP surgery; better for the NHS, because it will save money currently . spent in A&E; and better for Britain, because it is the kind of . health service we need’, he said. The . Conservatives called it an ‘unfunded pie in the sky policy’ and said . they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it . counter-productive to patient care. Mr . Miliband told an audience in Manchester that Labour would allow . patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse, rather than a . receptionist on the phone straightaway. If their condition is judged to . need immediate attention they can see a GP the same day. All . patients would have the right to see a GP at their own practice within . 48 hours if they want to, although not necessarily the GP of their . choice. The . number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 . per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, Mr Miliband . Chaand . Nagpaul at the British Medical Association said last year when this . policy was suggested that ‘arbitrary targets, even for limited periods, . are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the NHS and could make the . situation worse. He . added: ‘It is likely to result in a rush for appointments when . practices open which could overwhelm GP services and restrict the . freedom of GPs to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients . with long-term conditions.’ Labour . sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the . previous target, as patients who want to wait more than two days to see . their own GP will still be able to. GPs can spend the extra funding as they see fit, by hiring more staff or asking GPs to work longer hours. The . cost would be funded by cutting £78million of administration and legal . fees associated with EU competition law, and reining in the £3million a . month spending on consultants by three health quangos – Monitor, the . Trust Development Authority and Commissioning Support Units. Mr . Miliband also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal . the Health and Social Care Act– the law putting GPs back in charge of . health budgets. A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'Once . again Labour's sums simply don't add up. Ed Miliband promised 'iron . discipline' on spending, but he's too weak to stick to it. He's got no . economic plan to secure Britain's future. 'All . he does offer are more of the same old failed Labour policies from the . past - more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.'","Dr Richard Hughes, 60, was admired by his patients at Portsmouth practice .

"By . Emma Innes . A man organised his wedding in less than 24 hours so he could marry his terminally ill fiancée before it was too late. Paul Wheatley had been with his partner, Donna, for 12 years when she was admitted to hospital with kidney and heart problems. On April 17, 2013, the couple from Leeds were given the devastating news that the 36-year-old had just weeks, if not days, to live. Paul Wheatley, 40, planned his wedding in just 24 hours after his partner, Donna, 36, was given just days to live. The couple are pictured with their son, Kian, nine, during the wedding which took place in hospital . Mrs Wheatley was rushed to hospital with severe vomiting on Christmas Day and tests revealed she was suffering from terminal heart and kidney failure . Mr Wheatley, along with friends, family and hospital staff, rallied round to organise the couple’s wedding in just 24 hours. They tied the knot at Leeds General Infirmary, but tragically, Mrs Wheatley lost her fight with kidney and heart failure just six days later. Mr Wheatley, 40, said: ‘We had been engaged for nine years and wanted to get married abroad, but we just never got round to it. ‘As soon as the doctors told us that Donna didn’t have long left, I went immediately down to the registry office to collect the paperwork and start organising. ‘Everyone was incredible - we got flowers, a buffet, a dress, suits and rings all sorted in just a day. ‘It meant such a lot to Donna that I went to all the effort to make sure she had the special day we’d talked about. Mrs Wheatley (right before her illness with her best friend, Jane) was diabetic and her health had been deteriorating gradually for years . ‘It doesn’t seem fair that I only got to call her my wife for six days, but I know I made those last days special.’ Mrs Wheatley suffered from diabetes and her health first started to deteriorate three years ago. She had four operations on her eyes and it was thought she had turned a corner. But at Christmas last year she suffered severe vomiting and Mr Wheatley was forced to take her to hospital on Christmas Day. He said: ‘There had been a stomach bug going round, so we just thought she had that. ‘After a few days I was really worried about her, but she refused to go to hospital. Mr Wheatley says he always expected his partner to get better. But when he was told she was dying, he immediately set about planning their wedding . Mrs Wheatley (pictured with her son, Kian) died just six days after the wedding . ‘On Christmas Day I had to put my foot down, she was terrible. ‘At Scarborough Hospital we were told she had heart and kidney problems and Donna was transferred to St James University Hospital, Leeds. ‘It was a very worrying time, but we always thought she would get better. ‘Even months later when they told us it was terminal Donna refused to give up hope.’ Mrs Wheatley was briefly released from hospital in March before returning to hospital and being transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where they were told the devastating news that she would not be leaving the hospital. Mr Wheatley called in favours from friends, family and local business to organise their big day. Mr Wheatley said: 'It doesn't seem fair that I only got to call her my wife for six days, but I know I made those last days special' The couple’s son, Kian, nine, was best man for the wedding, and Donna’s step-sister, Laura Adams, sang John Legend’s All Of Me. Mr Wheatley said: ‘It was an incredibly moving day - everyone was in tears. ‘I helped Kian with his speech and we tried to make it light-hearted to give the wedding a bit of everything. ‘Donna picked up for the day and we had photos done in the rose garden on the roof, before she became too tried at about half four. ‘In the days that followed I did everything I could to keep her spirits up. ‘She’d had a falling out with some old friends over 10 years ago and I arranged for them to come and see her in hospital. ‘She also had a phone call with Danny McNamara, the lead singer of Embrace, and he was planning on coming to visit her over the weekend.’ Mrs Wheatley was transferred from Leeds General Infirmary to St James’s University Hospital where she passed away surrounded by friends and family on April 24.","Donna Wheatley was diabetic and her health was deteriorating gradually .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Experts have confirmed Sydney's northern beaches and north shore are the perfect breading grounds for deadly funnel web spiders. But brave residents who capture the animals can play an important part in developing crucial anti-venom necessary for treating life-threatening bites. The confirmation of Sydney's northen suburbs being ideal funnel web territory follows a traumatic ordeal experienced by a northern beaches family, when a six-year-old girl was bitten on the finger by a male species of the spider. Scroll down for video . Don't get too close: Experts have confirmed Sydney's northern suburbs provide the preferred habitat for the deadly funnel web spider . Following the girl's bite, there have been reports from other residents in the area who have spotted the dangerous arthropods near their homes, The Daily Telegraph reported. Australian Museum retired spider specialist Mike Gray said the region in Sydney's north was a hotspot for the infamous funnel web arachnid, because of the combination of bush, sloping ground and rocky terrain. 'They like to make burrows under rocks, rotting logs and in tree roots, where the ground tends to stay moist,' he said. Mr Gray said male funnel webs often wander into homes during summer and autumn. Life-saving: There have been 13 recorded deaths from funnel web bites in NSW but none since the anti-venom was developed in 1981 . On Wednesday, the six-year-old girl was rushed to a Sydney hospital after mistaking a funnel web for a toy and being bitten. As the spider's venom started to take effect, the young girl began vomiting, shaking uncontrollably and sweating and suffered cloudy vision. The girl's father, who does not want his family identified, said his daughter has since been recovering at home and after being released from hospital on Thursday afternoon and was fine, although a little weak. Doctors gave the young girl three vials of the anti-venom to treat the poison and told the girl's family to monitor her for signs of relapsing over the next four weeks. Sydney's north shore is a hotspot for funnel web spiders because of its bush, sloping ground and rocky terrain . It was thought she may have been bitten by a rare sub-species of the spider for the northern beaches area and there are ongoing test to confirm this. The Australian Reptile Park curator Liz Gabriel previoulsy said despite peak season being from November to April, funnel webs can still be out and particularly this year due to the mild weather. The reptile park, located on the Central Coast north of Sydney, collects funnel web spiders to create anti-venom. To create the anti-venom, trained staff at the park carefully milk up to 500 male spiders, caught within 150km of Sydney. The northern beaches area is also a funnel web hotspot and a young girl was bitten in the area on Wednesday . The venom is then sent to laboratory where anti-venom is developed. Residents who safely catch the animals can take them to drop off points in Brookvale, Mona Vale and Hornsby. The father of the young girl who was bitten said he encouraged others to support the reptile park's work, as his daughter was living proof anti-venom saves lives. 'We will be forever grateful,' he said. There have been 13 recorded deaths from funnel web bites in NSW but none since the anti-venom was developed in 1981. Greencross Vets vet director Dr Adam Stenberg recently had four funnel web spiders waiting to be collected by the reptile park and said despite only offering the service for the last six weeks, about 12 spiders had been dropped off, with four this week. 'The only way the anti-venom can be created is by extracting venom from live funnel webs and so every donation we get helps to save lives,' he said. For those game enough to try capturing a funnel web spider, Dr Stenberg said recommended using long tweezers, a stick or even chopsticks to direct the animal into a deep container. While the spiders will not be capable of climbing out, he said a lid is needed. The Australian Bites and Stings: First Aid Guide to Australian Venomous Creatures app provides advice on poisonous spiders and other animals including snakes.","Experts warn suburbs in Sydney's north are perfect funnel web habitat .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother-of-two has a terrifying condition which causes her body to swell up so dramatically she looks like she has been punched, . Izzy Richards, 32, has an extremely rare and potentially fatal genetic condition called hereditary angioedema. This causes her hands, legs, face, stomach and back swell regularly and, worryingly, her tongue and throat can also swell up, meaning she struggles to breathe because her airways are constricted. Scroll down for video . Izzy Richards, 32, has a rare condition which causes different parts of her body to swell up dramatically . The condition can affect Ms Richards' legs, hands, face, stomach and back. She said:' People think my partner Chris (right) has hit me - it's so humiliating for both of us' She told MailOnline: ‘It is terrifying when my tongue and throat swell up. ‘Once my tongue did it and doctors thought I was a goner – I couldn’t breathe and I thought I was going to die. 'And when my face swells up it's really humiliating - people stare at me and assume my partner Chris has hit me. 'I get very defensive and I don't like going out when it's swollen.' Ms Richards, from Nottingham, started to experience symptoms when she was just four. She suffered a bout of German measles and her knees swelled up for a few days. The condition can also cause Ms Richards' tongue and throat to swell up making it hard for her to breathe . However, at the time, her symptoms were dismissed as an allergic reaction to the medication she was given for the illness. She then experienced no more symptoms until she was seven. At this point, her hands swelled up temporarily but again her symptoms were dismissed – this time as a reaction to a cold she was suffering from. When she was 14 or 15 her condition became much more severe. She started to suffer crippling stomach cramps and vomiting for about three weeks in every four. The condition is a rare inherited disease that causes swelling in various body tissues. Some people have many attacks each month, while others will go months or years without a swelling attack. The swelling is caused by the poor functioning, or lack of, a protein in the immune system. If a person does not have enough of it, blood vessels can become leaky, allowing fluid to build up in the tissues. This can cause swelling anywhere in the body but is most common in the limbs, intestines, face and voice box. The . swelling in the intestines often causes severe stomach cramps and . swelling in the voice box can be life-threatening if it causes the . airway to be blocked. The illness is inherited and a person can develop it if just one parent is a carrier. In this situation, the child will have a 50 per cent chance of developing it. There is no cure but it can often be managed by avoiding triggers and taking medication. Triggers can include stress and some medications. Source: All About HAE . During this time she also occasionally noticed that her legs would swell up. As a result of her illness, she was barely able to attend school and left with very few qualifications. She says that despite the severity of her symptoms, doctors never really investigated her illness thoroughly. Over the years, she was given various diagnoses including a virus and iirritable bowel syndrome. Ms Richards’ mother experienced similar symptoms so believed she and her daughter must have a genetic condition which caused them to be allergic to their own hormones. When Ms Richards, a customer services executive, was 16 her face swelled up for the first time and the swelling spread to her throat. She said: ‘I was choking on what I was saying – I couldn’t get any words out. It was terrifying. ‘I felt like I had something caught in my windpipe.’ Finally, when Ms Richards was 21, she saw a locum GP who noticed her hands were swollen. He asked her about the swelling and she explained the symptoms she'd been suffering from for so many years. Amazingly, this doctor believed he knew of a very rare condition she could be suffering from. He took some blood tests and a couple of weeks later, she was diagnosed with hereditary angioedema (HAE). The condition is a rare inherited disease that causes swelling in various body tissues. In Ms Richards’ case, the swelling tends to be triggered by stress. Some people have many attacks each month, while others will go months or years without a swelling attack. Ms Richards says the swelling on her face is sometimes so bad that people think she has been punched . The swelling is caused by the poor functioning, or lack of, a protein in the immune system. If a person does not have enough of it, blood vessels can become leaky, allowing fluid to build up in the tissues. This can cause swelling anywhere in the body but is most common in the limbs, intestines, face and voice box. The swelling in the intestines often causes severe stomach cramps and swelling in the voice box can be life-threatening if it causes the airway to be blocked. She said: ‘It was a bit surreal to be diagnosed after all those years but it was a relief to know what it was. ‘It was also scary because I then knew the full extent of my illness. Ms Richards first experienced symptoms when she was four but she wasn't diagnosed until she was 21 . ‘I was also a bit annoyed that I had been misdiagnosed so many times.’ As the condition is genetic, Ms Richards’ mother was also tested for it and the results confirmed her symptoms were also caused by hereditary angioedema. By this time, Ms Richards had two daughters – who are now 14 and 11 – and devastatingly, they were both diagnosed with the condition as well. Ms Richards said: ‘It was guilt beyond belief when they were diagnosed – I couldn’t believe I'd cursed them for life.’ Today Ms Richards, who lives with her partner Chris, still experiences swelling every couple of weeks and each time it happens it lasts for a few days. Ms Richards has to use walking sticks to help her get around when her legs have swollen up . 'Sometimes the stomach cramps are so painful I can't walk, and need crutches when my legs swell.' However, . things have improved slightly for Ms Richards as, since her diagnosis, . she has been taught how to give herself an injection when she starts to . swell up. These injections prevent the swelling worsening after it has started, but they do not stop it altogether. When Ms Richards' hands swell she loses her dexterity, and when her feet swell she struggles to get shoes on . She said: ‘My medication has never failed me yet but I am terrified that one day it could – if I left it too long when my tongue was swelling it could one day not work. ‘My partner gets really very worried – he is very attentive and will do everything he can to help me but I would like to think that maybe one day they could cure it. ‘I don’t think anyone should have to suffer with it.’ She added: ‘I want to raise awareness so everyone who has it gets diagnosed and gets the treatment they need.’ For more information about HAE, visit www.allabouthae.co.uk .","Izzy Richards has hereditary angioedema which causes her body to swell .

"By . Darren Boyle . A 25 year-old-woman offered $100,000 life insurance to a mentally ill man to murder her husband, a court has heard. Heather Leann Horst is accused of offering the sum to Aaron William Allen to murder her husband Brandon James Horst as he lay sleeping in bed in St Paul, Minnesota. Prosecutors claim that Mrs Horst invented tales of domestic abuse as well as the offer of a large cash sum to convince Allen to pull the trigger. Write caption here . Assistant Ramsay County Attorney Jada Lewis told the court that Mrs Horst told Allen 'I want him dead', describing the murder as a 'coldly calculated execution'. In her opening statement to the jury, Ms Lewis said Mrs Horst stands accused of aiding and abetting first and second degree murder and conspiracy to commit first and second degree murder as a result of the killing last August. Allen has already admitted shooting Mr Horst telling prosecutors he had been promised a $100,000 share from her husband's two life insurance policies worth $480,000. Ms Lewis described Mrs Horst as a 'kind of black widow' for the manner in which she had arranged her husband's murder. Brandon Horst was shot once in the head at his home in St Paul's Minnesota on August 5, 2013 . Allen said Mrs Horst had told him that she had suffered a miscarriage as a result of domestic abuse and did not want a divorce as she would lose her home, car and dogs. Ms Lewis told the jury: 'His life was cut short by his wife's greed and selfishness.' However, Mrs Horst's defence suggested that Allen was acting alone and was fulfilling a long term fantasy to kill someone. Deborah Ellis, defending also questioned Allen's reliability as a witness. 'He is clever. He has manipulated people, made false claims. He alone committed the murder. He is a cold-blooded murderer.' The Pioneer Press reports that Allen, who claims to have five separate personalities, was engaged to Mr Horst's step sister. The jury heard that the original plan was for a group of men to slit Mr Horst's throat during a staged robbery. Allen told the jury: 'She asked me to kill him. Directly flat out just like that. She was very persistent on me being the one to slit Brandon's throat.' 12.06 am: Allen to Horst: 'You gitta hurry' 12.08am: Horst to Allen: 'On my way' 12.10am: Allen to Horst: 'Ivthink I just heard talking' 12.15am: Allen to Horst: 'He is stillvawake' 12.17am: Allen to Horst: 'And tyler* won't shut up there is a tv on upstairs' *Tyler is one of Mrs Horst's dogs . Later Allen claims that Mrs Horst gave him a gun and told him to hide. He said she had told him to fire several times although he admitted pulling the trigger just once. He has already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is facing 40 years in prison. According to court documents, on August 5, 2013 at 1.11am Mrs Horst rang 911 and said her husband was in bed 'with lots of blood coming from his head'. She said she had no idea what happened to him. A post mortem performed by Dr Michael McGee determined that Mr Horst was a victim of 'homicide' and suffered 'a cerebral laceration and destruction die to a gunshot wound to the head'. According to court documents, following the murder, Mrs Horst removed the SIM card from her phone and broke it into little pieces 'so the police couldn't recover texts from it'. According to court documents: 'Heather Horst denied being present when her husband was murdered. She denied shooting him or having someone else shoot her husband.' Although, police were able to recover five texts from Mrs Horst's phone three days after the murder. Mrs Horst denies all the charges. The trial continues.

The 37-year-old's heart stopped beating for 30 seconds, leaving her medically dead before doctors revived her. The pilates instructor, who is from Oklahoma in Texas but was studying in London at the time, has had to relearn how to walk, talk and write. Pilates instructor Hailey Terrell suffered eight strokes and a cardiac arrest when she suffered a near-fatal reaction to a filler injection to banish a wrinkle on her chin . The 37-year-old from Oklahoma in Texas, was living in London in May 2012, when she found a deal for a dermal filler injection online. She has since recovered from her ordeal after relearning how to walk, talk and write . But after five weeks in hospital and an intensive rehabilitation programme, Ms Terrell has made a full recovery. She said: 'I had no idea a filler injection could kill me. 'When I went to have an injection there was a leaflet with all the side effects listed. 'But it was just like the paper in a paracetamol box - I never thought it would actually happen to me.' After a total of eight strokes - one . of the rare but possible side effects of filler injections - Hailey . suffered a cardiac arrest and was put in a medically induced coma. Her . life was on the line as she fought against the potentially fatal . reaction and doctors feared she may never breathe on her own again. Ms Terrell was studying for a Masters in Real Estate at Cass Business School in London in May 2012 when she discovered a deal online for a dermal filler. After thoroughly researching the practice, she set a date for her chin injection. She said: 'I’d had injections before with no issues and nothing about this practitioner seemed out of the ordinary. 'She was qualified and a registered nurse so I thought that aspect was all I had to worry about.' A day after her injection, Miss Terrell started to suffer symptoms. Struggling to swallow her food she went to hospital and was given medication for a food allergy. The next day she was back at A&E . Ms Terrell was admitted to hospital where she suffered a cardiac arrest and several strokes. Her heart stopped beating for 30 seconds and after reviving her, doctors placed her into a medically induced coma . Two years on and the pilates instructor is almost fully recovered, she has relearned how to walk and talk and has moved back to live in the U.S. But the day after the procedure, Ms Terrell's first symptoms appeared. She said: 'I took a bite of pitta and struggled to swallow it. 'I tried to tell my friend I couldn’t swallow my food properly but the words weren’t coming out. 'Suddenly I had an awful lisp and it was still there the next day. 'A friend told me I might have had a stroke. 'I thought only old people or overweight people had strokes but I agreed I should get checked out.' The yoga instructor visited hospital but was sent home two days later with a prescription to treat a food allergy. She said: 'The next day I knew I couldn’t eat but I made myself a really good dish anyway. 'On my first bite I just kept chewing and chewing and it got stuck. I started choking and thought I was going to die. 'I made myself sick before going straight back to A&E, but again no-one realised I was having a stroke. 'By this point I couldn’t even swallow my own spit and I was drooling profusely. They gave me a wand to stick in my mouth which sucked out all the saliva. Ms Terrell said: ''I had no idea a filler injection could kill me. When I went to have an injection there is a leaflet with all the side effects listed. But I never thought it would actually happen to me' The pilates instructor is now using her experience to urge others to think twice about having cosmetic injections . 'I had to type messages into my phone to ‘speak’ to the doctors. I had been back in hospital for three days and I was really scared. 'I pleaded for a nurse to stay and hold my hand through the night because I didn’t want to die behind the curtain. 'That is the last thing I can remember.' The next day - one week after her first hospital admission - Ms Terrell went into cardiac arrest and suffered a final round of strokes. Her heart stopped beating for 30 seconds before doctors resuscitated her. She was placed in a medically induced coma unable to breathe on her own and transferred to the intensive care unit at the National Hospital for Neurology, where she fought for her life. Ms Terrell's parents flew straight over from America to be by her bedside. Seven days later, she pulled through to start her long road to recovery. She added: 'When I woke up the left side of my body didn’t work at all. 'It took me a while to learn to walk again and I had to relearn to write too because I am left-handed. 'For months I would be out eating and my fork would just drop out my hand.' But the 37-year-old has gone from strength to strength and completed her master’s degree despite an acquired learning disability. Ms Terrell added: 'You would never know just by looking at me what happened. I have a small scar on my neck and have problems focusing but I am now in the best place I have been' Exactly two years on, she is now living in Colorado, and has mostly recovered. Ms Terrell said: 'You would never know just by looking at me what happened. 'I have a small scar on my neck and have problems focusing but I am now in the best place I have been.' The yoga instructor is now using her experience to urge others to think twice about having cosmetic injections. She said: 'I give people Face Lift Massage as an alternative to injections and you can really see the difference. 'I am developing a business to teach people self massage techniques for one’s face, among other natural remedies, such as nutrition, meditation and face yoga. 'Having a stroke and nearly dying for beauty is something I’m not willing to ever risk again.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . In case you missed this among the millions of words recently devoted to a certain deceased Brazilian, we ought to point out the full range of his all-encompassing brilliance. As well as his driving prowess, Ayrton Senna designed the Sistine Chapel, ran up Everest in his bare feet, cured cancer, split the atom and wrote Shakespeare off the page. Excuse the sarcasm, but there has been a danger that hyperbole – admittedly among some fabulous and balanced reminiscences – has attended the 20th anniversary of the great racer’s death. Hyperbole: While tragic, Ayrton's Senna's death was not necessarily the darkest day in F1 . Paying respect: Fans from around the world visit Senna's grave in Brazil on May 1 . Never forget: 16 people were killed when Wolfgang von Trip's Ferrari careered off the track at Monza, 1961 . One story I read described Senna’s fatal accident at Imola as Formula One’s darkest day. Are we really sure about that? We should remember the hot afternoon of September 10, 1961, when 16 people died at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Jim Clark was trying to re-pass the Ferrari of Wolfgang von Trips on the second lap. ‘My front wheels were almost level with his back wheels as he started to brake,’ Clark recalled. ‘Suddenly he began to pull over towards me and he ran right into the side of me. ‘I honestly don’t think Taffy realised I was there. I am sure that when he passed me earlier, he had decided his was the faster car and I would be left behind.’ The collision catapulted the Ferrari into the crowd. Von Trips was slung out of the cockpit. He and 11 spectators died at the scene and four others perished later from the injuries they suffered. In all, 49 drivers have died in a Formula One car, often at the rate of more than one a month during the Fifties and Sixties. The fact the scale of commemoration for one man, the dazzling Senna, eclipses all the rest tells us something about a natural human inclination to fete icons, especially those who died young. It is, for example, easier to say he was mystical when he was cut off in his prime. It also underlines the power of live TV to accentuate an event’s importance and amplify the memory. It may also reflect a modern tendency to involve ourselves publicly in emotional outpourings. Emerson Fittipaldi, the 1972 and 1974 world champion, raises an interesting point. ‘It is my opinion that, had Ayrton walked uninjured from his Imola 1994 accident, he would have won the world championship for Williams in all three of those years – 1994, 1995 and 1996 – which would have given him a career total of six world championships to Michael’s five. Blond ambition: Would Senna have won the 1997 World Championship instead of Jacques Villeneuve? ‘Indeed, he may even also have won the world championship for Williams in 1997, at 37, instead of Jacques Villeneuve, raising his world championship tally to seven.’ Senna’s last team principal, Frank (now Sir Frank) Williams, told a Brazilian newspaper this week that his driver would have gone on to rule his homeland. ‘I believe that he had politics among his plans and, if he had followed that path, he would have been on his way to becoming President of Brazil,’ he said. Politics position: Sir Frank Williams believed the Brazilian had the power to become President of Brazil . Perhaps, but Senna’s manager Julian Jakobi told me that he though this highly unlikely. ‘Ayrton thought he could do far more to help Brazil from outside politics,’ he said. A coda to this week’s pictures showing players at Corinthians, the football club Senna supported, wearing replica yellow, green and black helmets in his honour. The debt owed to Senna by Brazil’s football fans is greater than many know. For in the early spring of the year he died, Senna acted as peacemaker between the nation’s two star strikers, Bebeto and Romario. A head for the occasion: Corinthians players donned yellow helmets in respect for their fallen hero . At the prompting of Leonardo, Senna spoke to Bebeto and Romario and banged their heads together. From barely being able to bear the sight of each other, let alone, pass to one another, they formed a deadly strike partnership that won Brazil the 1994 World Cup. News from Bahrain. Five people were sentenced this week to five years in jail for plotting to detonate a bomb during the 2013 grand prix. I record this as a supporter of the moderate element among the ruling elite and one who is, therefore, unable to view all the anti-government protestors as freedom-fighters. Having a blast: Five people were sentenced for plotting to explode a device at the Bahrain Grand Prix . Will this attempt to blow up innocent people from around the world – an enterprise which laughably included a woman using a pillow to pretend she was pregnant – lead the protestors’ apologists in the western media to admit there are terrorists among the anti-government faction? The smaller teams – Marussia, Catherham, Force India and Sauber – want to ‘level the playing field’. They believe this can be achieved by receiving more money from the sport’s pot and a universal cap on spending. I have sympathy with them up to a point. Lost cause: Bernie Ecclestone has questioned the wisdom in trying to help F1's smaller teams . But here is Ecclestone’s view, as quoted in Tom Bower’s biography No Angel. ‘I have tried to help struggling teams over the years,’ he says. ‘But it’s like somebody drowning. You throw them a lifebelt, then when they get to the shore, they say, “You idiot, you hit me on the head with the lifebelt.”’ Good luck with your ongoing discussions, boys.","Anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death has overshadowed other F1 tragedies .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The fractured relationship between FA chairman Greg Dyke and the Premier League over the England commission will not be improved at the summer meeting of top-flight clubs. Dyke would normally be expected to attend at least some of the Premier League summit on June 5 and 6 at Rudding Park Hotel in Harrogate in his official capacity. But instead he is flying to the Football League equivalent on the Algarve, where he will discuss his plans for a fifth tier in a special session with representatives from the 72 clubs meeting in Vilamoura. In demand: FA chairman Greg Dyke will not be attending a Premier League summit in the summer, choosing instead to speak to Football League clubs about his plans for a fifth tier . Dyke’s failure to consult the Premier League about his proposals en masse at one of their summits — he prefers to talk to top-flight teams individually — has upset the League’s top brass even though they chose not to have a representative on the FA panel, having withdrawn their chairman Anthony Fry, his first choice. Dyke named Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Stoke and Tottenham as clubs who fully support his controversial B team proposals. Chelsea, who have more than enough players out on loan to field C and D teams as well, are another club in favour. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who faces a revolt over participation if the FA have their way on B teams, has another big issue to confront. A number of teams in the top fight, who  comfortably sell out every home game, want the League to allow their many other fans to watch the Saturday 3pm kick-offs live on club outlets. But Scudamore is said to be against live coverage in that time slot so as not to dilute TV rights holders’ contracts...................................................................... It will interest everyone searching for sports sponsorship that Facebook have indicated they want to break into the sports market. And certainly the FA Cup in association with Facebook has a ring about it, especially with the extra interaction it would bring to the competition...................................................................... Greg Dyke’s commission presentation received a damning reception from a sceptical media at Wembley. But at the same time England manager Roy Hodgson’s World Cup backroom support team were enjoying a far more successful bonding session at St George’s Park. Inspiring: Sports psychologist Steve Peters, who has worked with Team GB and Liverpool, spoke to Roy Hodgson and the England backroom support team . Particularly inspiring was said to be the speech given by sports psychologist Steve Peters. Liverpool players demoralised by giving up a three-goal lead — and probably their title hopes — at Crystal Palace last Monday could have been excused for wanting to do anything but turn up for a club awards dinner the following night. But every member of the squad attended the function, demonstrating a resilient team spirit under Brendan Rodgers. Resilience: Luis Suarez was left crying on the pitch after the Crystal Palace draw but 24 hours later he picked up an award at the club's players' awards dinner . The Sport Industry Awards hit a new low by allowing rabid self-publicist bookmakers Paddy Power to run a market on brand of the year when the legion of judges had chosen Wimbledon tennis as the winner months ago. But it has to be said that the stunning sports review of the year video produced with Evoke Films — a rebranded commercial film arm of IMG — took such productions to a new level, with relevant Twitter comments made at the time cleverly linked to the action. The 25th anniversary fund-raising dinner of the anti-racism organisation Kick It Out at Wembley on May 20 has been very poorly supported not only by clubs, with only 12 buying tables, but also by the game’s sponsors, hardly any of whom are going to be there despite almost the full complement having been asked by the organisers. The turbulence at Leeds now includes a trio of popular club ambassadors — Peter Lorimer, Eddie Gray and Dominic Matteo — all in danger of losing their positions in new owner Massimo Cellino’s major cost-cutting operation.

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . If Barcelona win the league on Saturday there will be no open top bus ride through the city the following day to celebrate. Such has been the fatalistic sense of failure that has clouded the second half of the season the absence of a proper celebration seems fitting. The players, manager, directors and supporters gave up on the league long ago. If they win it this weekend it will be by default and after receiving the trophy in the stadium immediately after the match many will leave the city the following day to head to World Cup training camp destinations. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Diego Costa get ready for title showdown . Head-to-head: Barca and Atletico Madrid will face off for the title when they meet at the Nou Camp on Saturday . Leaving: Carles Puyol held a farewell press conference on Thursday prior to his Barcelona departure . The final day will see two teams battle it out for only the third time in history. Barcelona will win the title through a better head-to-head record if they beat Atletico Madrid. A draw would be good enough for Atletico to win their first title in 18 years. HEAD-TO-HEAD . 21 August: Atletico 1-1 Barcelona(Spanish Super Cup) 28 August: Barcelona 0-0 Atletico(Spanish Super Cup) 11 January: Atletico 0-0 Barcelona(La Liga) 1 April: Barcelona 1-1 Atletico(Champions League) 9 April: Atletico 1-0 Barcelona(Champions League) If Atletico Madrid win it, no-one will get any sleep in the Spanish capital for the following 48 hours. Atletico's ticket allocation for the game is only 447 but they will more than make up for it once back home in the early hours of Sunday morning. The very different celebration plans reflect the way the same title means very different things to these two teams. The Catalans will fire their coach Tata Martino whatever happens on Saturday. Goalkeeper Victor Valdes will join Monaco regardless. Dani Alves will follow him to France signing for PSG. Defender Carles Puyol will join incoming new manager Luis Enrique's coaching staff and the club will look to fund a big summer of transfers with the sale of at least two more top players. Alex Song, Javier Mascherano, Pedro and Alexis Sanchez are all available at the right price and while it's unlikely all four will leave, at least two must go to fund offers for a list of new signings headed by Chelsea's David Luiz. They may even try to persuade to take Song and Alexis in exchange for Luiz. Support: Atletico Madrid fans will celebrate for 48 hours should they win their first La Liga title in 18 years . The events of Saturday will change none of these plans. Atletico Madrid in contrast may have a very different summer depending on how their next two matches go. Winning the league and Champions League double could double their resolve to keep key players and increase the desire of those players to stay. There will be offers in the summer for Koke, Mario Suarez, Filipe Luis and Saul Niguez - currently on loan at Rayo Vallecano but very highly rated – but coach Diego Simeone will demand that all stay and if he wins both La Liga and the Champions League his hand will be stronger. Battle: Lionel Messi vies for the ball with Filipe Luis in their Champions League clash last month . Stripes: Diego Costa, who is poised to join Chelsea, takes on Barcelona's Gerard Pique earlier this season . Trophies will also help Atletico attract a better class of replacement for Diego Costa, who looks Chelsea bound. They could even make the headstrong striker dig in his heels and demand to stay in Spain. Costa has scored against every club in La Liga this season apart from Barcelona. On Saturday he will have former Barcelona favourite David Villa alongside him – now public enemy No 1 after his wild celebrations in the Super Cup at the start of the season.  How those two fare against a Barcelona defence that is likely to welcome back Gerard Pique after his cracked pelvis may well be the key to the game. If Atletico get themselves in front few can see Martino's side scoring twice against them to win the game and the league. La Liga has been decided on the last day before – most recently in 2010 when Pep Guardiola's Barcelona pipped Manuel Pellegrini's Real Madrid.","Barcelona will win the title if they beat Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp .

Therese Kerr took to her Instagram account on Friday night to thank her fans for their 'well-wishes' following her visit to the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney. The 48-year-old had been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat and said she was admitted for routine tests 'after a couple of recent incidences'. Scroll down for video . Outpatient: Miranda Kerr's mother Therese has revealed her hospital stay was down to heart problems . Get well soon! Therese took to her Instagram to thanks her 12,200 followers for their 'well-wishes' alongside a picture of a beautiful bunch of pink flowers . 'Hey gorgeous people, thank you everyone for your well wishes during my recent stay in hospital,' she wrote to her 12,200 followers alongside a picture of a beautiful bunch of pink blooms. 'I have a genetic heart arrhythmia, which I have had to have routine tests for after a couple of recent incidences, but all is great now as I am home with my beautiful family.' The mother-of-two is sure to be glad to be able to spend some time with Miranda and her adorable three-year-old son Flynn before they jet back to New York.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Walters' longtime friend Michael Douglas were the two first guests on the show this morning but it was Winfrey who gave the broadcasting legend the biggest surprise. Walters final show was taped on Thursday but aired on Friday and the only time that the famously steadfast journalist seemed close to tears came when Winfrey began singing her praises. Scroll down for video . Oprah moment: Barbara Walters looked genuinely surprised when Winfrey was announced as one of the guests on her final episode .

Important: Oprah Winfrey, right, embracing Barbara Walters during the taping of Walters' final co-host appearance . Emotional moment: The closest Walters ever came to crying during the special was when Winfrey sang her praises and said that she was an inspiration . 'Like everyone else, I want to thank you for being a pioneer and everything that that word means,' Winfrey said, gripping Walters' hand across co-host Sherri Shepherd. Winfrey went on to talk about how Walters had the 'courage' to become the first female co-anchor in spite of widespread criticism and the fact that her co-host openly disliked the fact that he had to share the stage with a woman. 'You're the reason why I wanted to be in television,' she said. The biggest tribute followed from there, as Winfrey introduced dozens of female broadcast journalists- from Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric to Maria Shriver and Deborah Norville- who came on The View stage as a visual reminder of how Walters led the way for so many women to follow. 'I looked in her eyes that was a real surprise,' Winfrey said of the display after the show wrapped. The show, which aired this morning, marked the end to Walters' broadcasting career which has spanned more than five decades. Those who followed: Winfrey took a roll call of the dozens of female broadcasters who came after Barbara was the first woman to have a co-anchor position on television news . Familiar faces: Katie Couric, Savannah Guthrie, Natalie Morales, Tamron Hall, Maria Shriver and Cynthia McFadden were among the women who went to The View set to thank Walters for her inspiration .

Big impact: All of the female broadcasters gave Walters a hug when they reached her, including Today Show hosts Hoda Kotb (left) and Kathie Lee Gifford (center) as well as Fox News host Gretchen Carlson (right) What a legacy: Barbara Walters, front right, was joined on stage by a throng of women she paved the way for in media, including from left, Whoopi Goldberg, Jenny McCarthy, Oprah Winfrey, Sherri Shepherd and Diane Sawyer . She said that she will remain an executive producer of The View, the morning talk show she created nearly 18 years ago, but has no specific plans for what she will do now. During the first segment of this morning's farewell, she turned to Clinton for tips on what to do when taking time off- saying that the 84-year-old reporter should take a real vacation that lasts 'at least a week'. 'You're in no position to tell me to take time off!' Walters joked. 'You . have a wealth of friends who adore you spend time with them,' the . former Secretary of State and likely Democratic presidential nominee . told Walters. 'I can't . believe this day has come, and I can't believe it's for real,' Clinton . told Walters, who began her career on NBC's 'Today' in 1962, then came . to ABC in 1976, where her many duties ranged from co-anchoring '20/20' to hosting scores of specials as well as 'The View.' Typically, . Walters couldn't let Clinton get away without fielding the question on . so many minds: Is she running for president in 2016? 'I am running,' smiled Clinton. 'Around the park.'

Heartfelt: Walters, pictured, brought the hour to a close with a heartfelt statement looking back with amazement on her career, then signing off with a pledge to 'take a deep breath and enjoy my 'View' A bit later, Douglas brought the subject of the 2016 presidential race up again with Walters. 'If Hillary runs,' he said, 'I bet you'd be a great vice president.' Some of the best moments happened during commercial breaks, never to be seen by viewers. Then audience members could snap photos and interact with Walters and her co-panelists (Whoopi Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy). At one point Walters, spying the New York Knicks' J.R. Smith in the stands, broke up the room by telling him that, now, with retirement, 'I just want you to know I'm buying the Clippers.' The audience erupted at the sight of Winfrey, who told Walters, 'You're the reason I wanted to be in television.' 'You shattered the glass ceiling for so many women,' said Winfrey, who then brought on a startling parade of them, some two dozen prominent on-air women including Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Robin Roberts, Gayle King, Connie Chung and Joan Lunden. 'You are my legacy,' Walters, visibly moved, said to them as they crowded around her onstage. The hour had its comic twist: In a pre-taped segment, Walters (who, after all, has interviewed everybody else) lobbed some questions at herself, in the person of former 'Saturday Night Live' player Cheri Oteri doing a spot-on Walters imitation. Barbara asked faux-Barbara what she plans to do in retirement, drawing the response that she means to do some things she never had time for in the past. For example: 'I'd like to get a Costco card.' Walters brought the hour to a close with a heartfelt statement looking back with amazement on her career, then signing off with a pledge to 'take a deep breath and enjoy my 'View.' But a more telling moment took place during a break, as the throng of women she had paved the way for posed with her for a group portrait. It was a remarkable tableau. 'I have to remember this on the bad days,' Walters said quietly, 'because this is the best.'","Winfrey and Clinton surprised Walters on her farewell show that was taped on Thursday and aired this morning .

"By . Associated Press . A Texas man was indicted Thursday for capital murder in a childhood attack on a boy who died nearly 13 years later from skin cancer blamed on the horrific burns he suffered in the assault. Authorities allege that at age 13, Don Willburn Collins attacked Robert Middleton on his eighth birthday in 1998 near the younger boy's home in Splendora, about 35 miles northeast of Houston. Middleton was burned across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011. The grand jury's indictment Thursday came after a judge ruled in March that Collins' case could be transferred from juvenile to adult court. Scroll down for video . Charged: Don Willburn Collins was indicted Thursday for capital murder in a childhood attack on a boy who died nearly 13 years later from skin cancer blamed on the horrific burns he suffered in the assault . Maimed: Middleton was burned on his eighth birthday, and shortly before his death gave a videotaped deposition accusing Collins of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack . Middleton had initially named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998. Collins . spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after . prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to pursue the case. Shortly . before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he . accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks . before the attack. Held: Middleton had initially named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998 . The . sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case, and . prosecutors charged the now 28-year-old Collins with murder last year — . but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take . him to trial. Colleen Middleton, Robert's mother, said she was relieved the case would go to trial. 'When . Robert died we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen, maybe . someone is just going to get away with what they did to him,' she said. 'It's been a long road.' Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said he hopes the case can be tried by the end of the year. Horror injuries: Attacked on his eight birthday, Robert Middleton was burned across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 . Several witnesses testified during that Collins had confessed to them or others that he . had been responsible for the attack on Middleton. But . E. Tay Bond, an attorney for Collins, now 29, said there is no credible . evidence in the case that would result in a conviction. 'I . think the indictment for capital murder is a direct reflection of the . desire that this community has to hold someone accountable for the . tragedy that was bestowed upon Mr. Middleton,' Bond said. Collins, who is being held on $1 million bond, is set to be arraigned on June 19. Bond said he plans to ask for a change of venue and will present evidence at trial of Collins' history of mental disability. One point of contention is the maximum prison sentence Collins could face if convicted.

"By . Graham Smith . A blonde girl identical to Madeleine McCann was seen at a campsite in Spain just three days after the British toddler went missing five years ago, it has emerged. The groggy-looking child appeared alienated from the German family she was staying with at the resort on the Costa del Sol, according to a witness. The potential sighting came three days after Madeleine was abducted from Praia da Luz in Portugal, a few hours drive away. Sighting: A blonde girl identical to Madeleine McCann was seen with a German family at the Cabopino campsite on Spain's Costa del Sol (pictured) just three days after the British toddler went missing five years ago . Missing: Madeleine was abducted from Praia da Luz in Portugal, a few hours drive away from the Spanish campsite, in May 2007 . British detectives investigating her disappearance have been told the German family paid extra after arriving at the campsite with one more child than expected on May 6, 2007, reports The Sun. It is also believed that their vehicle had fake number plates to avoid detection. The alarm was raised by holidaymaker Karen Sisson, 49, who was staying at the Cabopino campsite near Fuengirola. Ms Sisson, from Gibraltar, told police at the time that the girl was wearing a pink T-shirt, shorts and a beige hat and seemed 'out of it'. She said that the girl seemed out of place with the German couple and their two curly-haired children. The mother-of-two's suspicions were further raised when she saw the girl wearing the same outfit the following day. Ms Sisson left the next day but records show the German family stayed at the campsite for two weeks. They checked in under the name Karsten Mayer, who gave 1970 as his year of birth. Their car had a 'BE' German number . plate, which went out of official use 38 years ago - but the vehicle was . a Mercedes Vito people carrier that was first manufactured in 1996. The blonde girl was with a German family driving a Mercedes Vito people carrier (pictured) that was first manufactured in 1996 . Parents: Kate and Gerry McCann pose with an artist's impression of how their daughter might look now at the age of nine . A spokesman for the McCanns said yesterday: 'This lady has done the right thing in reporting what she saw to the police.' The development comes as Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry on Sunday declared they will never give up their . search for their missing daughter as they took part in a ten-kilometre charity run. Just three days after the fifth anniversary of Maddie's abduction, the couple took part at the busy Liverpool event for the first time. Mrs McCann, 44, wore a white vest with a picture of Madeleine on the front and the words 'Never give up' on the back. It was the first year they felt able to take part in the event.","'Groggy' girl seemed alienated from German family she was with at Cabopino campsite near Fuengirola .

'There’s only a 1 in 10,000 chance that a woman will become pregnant with monoamniotic twins,' the hospital said in a press release, which described having both pregnancies at Akron General Medical Center 'almost a statistical impossibility.' 'Mono mono' twins share placenta and an amniotic sac and are considered risky to carry because they can be killed by umbilical cords, the hospital said.

Parents: Mother Amanda Arnold and her boyfriend James McCail welcomed mono mono twin girls on Thursday . Arnold was placed on a month-long bed rest and the twins were delivered on May 15 to honor the anniversary of grandmother Valerie McCail's death, the release said. Father James McCail expressed his joy with NewsNet5, who filmed inside the delivery room. 'It feels great,' he told the station. 'I'm so happy right now.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Every one of the former co-hosts came back to The View this morning as part of the official send off for Barbara Walters. The all-female cast was reunited in a way they'd never been before with every co-host from the show's 17 seasons joined together at an extra large table. Walters and current hosts Jenny McCarthy, Whoopi Golberg and Sherri Shepherd were joined by former hosts Joy Behar, Lisa Ling, Meredith Vieira, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Debbie Matenopoulos, Star Jones and Rosie O'Donnell. Scroll down for video . Reunion shot: All 11 co-hosts of The View were on hand for Barbara Walter's penultimate episode on Thursday . Long time coming: Barbara Walters announced last year that she would be retiring from broadcasting this spring, and tomorrow will be her final day on the program that she created 17 years ago . 'This is like the Last Supper with Barbara as Jesus,' O'Donnell joked. The reunion, dubbed 'DejaView', comes on Walter's penultimute show with her final send off scheduled for tomorrow. In true View fashion, each of the women took turns going through their favorite memory of working with Barbara. Clips of Walters dressed as Marilyn Monroe for a Halloween episode and the Emmy Award-winning journalist struggling to drive a golf cart punctuated the show with some of the lighter moments. Familiar faces: An extra large table was brought in to accommodate the 11 co-hosts . Some hosts, however, couldn't help but get overcome by the emotion of the moment. Debbie Matenopoulos, who was one of the original cast members and started on the show when she was just 22-years-old in 1997, got choked up while talking about how Walters made her feel confident during the casting call where she was the TV neophyte in a room full of famous women who were auditioning. Matenopoulos was on the show for two years before leaving. She now is married to her second husband and is pregnant, with a due date later this year. Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who was the most recent co-host to leave the show after being offered a spot as a co-anchor on Fox and Friends, praised Walters for helping to teach her the ropes of morning television. Going for it: Meredith Vieira greeted her longtime colleague with a big kiss on the lips, playing off a joke from her time on the air when she pulled the same move . Leading ladies: Walters was a Today Show host years before launching The View and Vieira later left The View to take on The Today Show role . Backstage: The co-hosts were sharing pictures over their Twitter feeds throughout the program . Back in the habit: Star Jones, who was on the show for more than eight years, shared impromptu photos with her former co-hosts Debbie Matenopoulos (left), Rosie O'Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck (right) Old clips of Hasselbeck announcing her pregnancies and introducing her children to the world while working on the show for nearly ten years were played back on Thursday. Of the seven cohosts who returned for the special, Hasselbeck is the only one currently working in front of the camera on a daily basis. Lisa Ling also hosts a documentary series on Oprah Winfrey's network, but Meredith Vieira is due to make a return to television as well. Vieira left The View after nine years and went on to co-anchor The Today Show following Katie Couric's departure in 2006. She later retired from morning broadcasting to spend more time with her family and her husband Richard, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, but is due to launch her own afternoon talk show this fall. 'I think the best thing about The View is that the public got to see the other side of Barbara because everyone knows her as the journalist but you got see how she's so funny and full of spunk,' Vieira said of Walters on Thursday. Through the years: The View was launched in 1997 by Barbara Walters and her co-producer with original hosts (left to right) Star Jones, Joy Behar, Meredith Vieira and Debbie Matenopoulos . Personal lives: Elisabeth Hasselbeck (center) said that her favorite moment on the show was when Walters helped her announce her first pregnancy in 2004 . Hot topics: Political discussions often turned controversial, especially when famously liberal Rosie O'Donnell (left) and Hasselbeck (right), a conservative, were on the show at the same time (pictured n 2006) Much of the talk show, which was launched by Walters in 1997 as a way for women of different generations and viewpoints to connect, was based on the personalities and lives of the hosts themselves, so the reunion special served as a type of update on the co-hosts past. Joy Behar shared a picture of her 3-year-old grandson and Lisa Ling, who left the show in 2003, talked about her newborn daughter. Ling said the best advice she ever received from the pioneering female journalist was to not forget about her personal life, and, like a concerned grandmother, Walters jumped right in by saying: 'I thought you'd never get married!' Taking turns: Hasselbeck and O'Donnell got in an infamous on-air fight in 2007 but have clearly move past it as O'Donnell joked that the thing she missed most about the show was 'fighting with this skinny one' Thankful: Walters, seen reaching over Lisa Ling to hold Hasselbeck's hand, said that she stays in touch with the Fox and Friends co-anchor with regular emails . Original cast: Vieira, Star Jones (center), Debbie Matenopoulous (speaking) and Joy Behar (right) were four of the original five cast members . 'Your best advice that you ever gave me was ""don't neglect your personal life,""' Ling said. This was not Rosie O'Donnell's only recent visit to the show, as she came and spoke about her recent heart attack in February to raise awareness for the importance of heart health. During today's visit, the comedian was seated next to Hasselbeck who was her political sparring partner while they were on the show at the same time. Though some of their arguments got infamously heated, they've apparently moved into to stage where they are able to laugh about it all, because When O'Donnell was asked what she missed most about the program, she said: 'Fighting with this skinny one right here!' Friday's show was teased as a 'historic event' and a full line up of surprises is scheduled for Walters' final send off. Twitter postings from other female journalists, including The Today Show's Hoda Kotb, show that a collection of women from across network lines went to The View set on Thursday afternoon for a special segment of the show that will be aired on Friday. The Twitter pictures show journalists past and present, but other reports announced that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is also expected to be a guest on Walters' final show. Preview of things to come: Walters' final episode was taped on Thursday afternoon but will air on Friday, and The Today Show's Hoda Kotb showed a sneak peak of the surprise guests . Not so surprise guests: Female news anchors and talk show hosts came our in droves to honor Walters .","All eleven women who have ever hosted on The View came back to celebrate Barbara Walter's penultimate episode .

"By . Jonathan Block . A teacher at a prestigious Catholic High School just north of San Francisco is suing the school, claiming that the school failed to protect her against sexual harassment, including having male students compete to take up-skirt videos of her and other teachers. In a lawsuit filed Thursday against the all-boys Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, Kimberly Bohnert claims that administrators failed to protect her against a 'boys will be boys' environment where she was subjected to sexually explicit images and tweets regarding her. 'It's a very athletic school and sometimes sports are put forward more than moral development,' Bohnert, 38, told the Contra Costa Times. She also suing the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco, which oversees the school. Scroll down for video . Kimberly Bohnert, 38, a teacher at Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, is suing the school as she claims administrators did nothing to stop sexual harassment from students at the all-male school that include taking up-skirt photos and writing sexually explicit graffiti in the bathroom . Bohnert, who is suing the school, as well as the Archdiocese of San Francisco, which operates it, shows off a printout of some of the sexually explicit Twitter comments student at Serra High School posted online . The suit also seeks back pay and punitive damages. Serra is considered a prestigious Catholic school. It counts a number of famous athletes among its graduates, including baseball player Barry Bonds and football players Tom Brady and Lynn Swann. In response to the allegations, the school, with 840 students and 64 teachers -- 21 of which are women -- released a statement. 'Last year's incident was tragic, and the . disrespect shown by certain former students did not reflect what we . teach and model here at Serra High School,' school President Lars Lund . wrote. 'We felt a deep level of compassion for the teacher. We . immediately contacted the San Mateo Police Department and fully . cooperated with them during our mutual investigations.' He added an assembly for students . was held describing the legal ramifications of inappropriate texting and . Internet activities. Ultimately action was taken: Six students, all minors, were expelled and six were suspended. And San Mateo police referred the six juveniles 'most culpable for producing and distributing the images' to the San Mateo County Juvenile Probation Department, police Sergeant David Norton said. Serra High School is considered an elite Catholic school. It has a number of famous athletes among its graduates, including baseball player Barry Bonds and football players Tom Brady and Lynn Swann . Bohnert, however, said the actions taken by the school were not enough and harassment from male students gave her no choice but to go on leave due to concerns for her safety. 'I'm hoping for the administration to recognize the seriousness of the issue and I'm hoping the school makes some real change to make Serra a better place and to allow these boys to be in a culture that respects one another,' she said. Her lawsuit also seeks back pay and unspecified general and punitive damages. Bohnert started teaching at Serra during the 2006-07 school year. In her second year, a female English teacher had her buttocks photographed and shared by students, she said said. During her third year, a student was caught in the act of taking an up-skirt photo of another teacher. 'It was very hush-hush,' Bohnert said. 'I was really shocked. I guess I could say I was naive on some level. I trusted the kids.' School staff found sexually explicit graffiti in a bathroom wall about Bohnert in February 2012, according to her suit. She claims administrators said they would investigate, but she never heard anything back from them. 'I was hoping the students would be held accountable,' Bohnert said. 'To not get any resolution spoke volumes about how the kids could get away with anything.' In November of the same year, sexually explicit tweets targeting Bohnert were discovered. But administrators again did nothing, Bohnert claims.","Kimberly Bohnert, a teacher at the all-boys Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, says the administration twice said it would investigate  and take action, but never did .

"'Bad,' 'terrifying,' 'horrific,' 'evil.' Each of those adjectives is on a list of banned words at General Motors - one of the odder twists in the company's ongoing recall of 2.6 million small cars for defective ignition switches. The U.S. government slapped GM with a $35 million fine Friday for failing to report the deadly defect sooner. The government also released a 2008 GM training document that warns employees to not use language that could hurt the company. Unflattering terms like 'deathtrap' and 'Hindenburg' also made the list.

The government says that the materials were part of a larger problem at GM, where engineers were reluctant to use words like 'defect.' But safety advocates say it's common for automakers to avoid words that might legally trigger a recall. The fine leveled on the automaker is the maximum allowed by law. But it's only a fraction of the $3.8 billion GM made last year. The . National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating . GM's delayed recall of older small cars with defective ignition . switches. GM has acknowledged knowing about the problem for at least a decade, but it didn't recall the cars until this year. The company says at least 13 people have died in crashes linked to the problem. The Justice Department also is investigating. Automakers are required to report safety defects within five days of discovering them. General Motors recalled an additional 2.7 million vehicles on Thursday as a deep dive into safety issues at the nation's biggest automaker turned up more problems with some of the cars it built over the past decade. The latest recalls bring GM's total for the year in the U.S. to more than 11 million cars and trucks, close to its annual recall record of 11.8 million vehicles, set in 2004.

Toyota, Ford, and Chrysler also have announced sizeable recalls this year. Several factors are behind the industry's recall binge. GM is reviewing all of its vehicles for safety issues following the recall earlier this year of 2.6 million older small cars with a defective ignition switch.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Exactly one year to the day since the Rob Ford crack scandal broke, reports out of Canada suggest the embattled Toronto mayor is at an Ontario rehab clinic. Ford was spotted out and about in Bracebridge, close to both his family's cottage and an addiction rehabilitation center called GreenStone. Ford's lawyer confirmed Friday that he is still undergoing treatment for his addiction problems, though he would not confirm where Ford is being treated. Man of the people: Mayor Rob Ford poses for a snap with a couple of construction workers in Bracebridge on Friday . According to the Bracebridge Examiner, Ford was seen outside a branch of the Bank of Montreal, 'chatting with passersby and telling people that rehab is going well.' Numerous photographs posted to Twitter show the mayor posing amiably with local residents. A woman who works at a local store told the National Post that the mayor's presence caused a lot of excitement, with about 20 people gathered to shake his hand and pose for photographs with him. New friends: Ford with staff from Fabricare Cleaning Services where he picked up a suit . Photo op: Rob Ford with Bracebridge resident Brody Lisle . 'He seemed really calm. He was willing to shake everyone’s hands. He seemed like a really nice guy,' she said. Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said his client hasn't completed his rehab treatment, 'not by a long shot.' He's is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking, but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' he told the National Post. Rest and relaxation: Rooms at GreenStone have fireplaces, Jacuzzi tubs, balconies, patios and views of either woodlands or the Sunset Bay on Lake Muskoka .

"By . Associated Press . In the wake of a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma last month, a Utah lawmaker says he believes a firing squad is a more humane form of execution. And he plans to bring back that option for criminals sentenced to death in his state. Rep. Paul Ray, a Republican from the northern Utah city of Clearfield, plans to introduce his proposal during Utah's next legislative session in January. Lawmakers in Wyoming and Missouri floated similar ideas this year, but both efforts stalled. Ray, however, may succeed. Fired: The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah, is shown. In the wake of a bungled execution in Oklahoma last month, a Utah lawmaker wants to resurrect firing squads as a method of execution in his state . What a choice! Following last month's botched execution in Oklahoma, a Utah lawmaker is proposing a 'humane' policy throwback: Give death row inmates the option of being executed by firing squad . Utah already has a tradition of execution by firing squad, with five police officers using .30-caliber Winchester rifles to execute Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010, the last execution by rifle to be held in the state. Ray argues the controversial method may seem more palatable now, especially as states struggle to maneuver lawsuits and drug shortages that have complicated lethal injections. 'It sounds like the Wild West, but it's probably the most humane way to kill somebody,' Ray said. Utah eliminated execution by firing squad in 2004, citing the excessive media attention it gave inmates. Opinionated: Rep. Paul Ray, a Republican from Clearfield, says firing squads would be a quick and humane way to put someone to death as lawsuits and drug shortages have hampered lethal injections in recent years. Ray plans to introduce his proposal during Utahís next legislative session in January . No change: The botched execution of Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett hasn't dampened public enthusiasm for execution . But those sentenced to death before that date still had the option of choosing it, which is how Gardner ended up standing in front of five armed Utah police officers. Gardner was sentenced to death for fatally shooting a Salt Lake City attorney in 1985 while trying to escape from a courthouse. He was third person to die by firing squad after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. A couple other death row inmates have opted to die by gunfire instead of lethal injection in Utah, but they are all several years away from exhausting the appeals of their death sentences, Assistant Utah Attorney General Thomas Brunker said. Ray's proposal would give all inmates the option. Lethal injection, the default method of execution in the U.S., has received heightened scrutiny after secrecy and drug shortages in recent years and the April incident in Oklahoma, when inmate Clayton Lockett's vein collapsed and he died of a heart attack more than 40 minutes later. Ray and lawmakers in other states have suggested firing squads might be the cheapest and most humane method. 'The prisoner dies instantly,' Ray said. 'It sounds draconian. It sounds really bad, but the minute the bullet hits your heart, you're dead. There's no suffering.' Execution chamber: Utah stopped allowing death-row inmates to choose execution by firing squad after 2004. Utah last used the method in 2010, when a firing squad of five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles executed Ronnie Lee Gardner . The results of NBC's poll of 800 Americans reveals: . Opponents of the proposal say firing squads are not necessarily a fool-proof answer. It's possible an inmate could move or shooters could miss, causing the inmate a slow and painful death, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington, D.C.,-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment. 'The idea is that it would be very quick and accurate but just a little movement by the person could change that,' he said. 'Things can go wrong with any method of execution.' He cited a case from Utah's territorial days in 1897, when a firing squad missed Wallace Wilkerson's heart and it took him 27 minutes to die, according to newspaper accounts of the execution. Dieter said that if Utah brought back firing squads as a default option rather than leaving it up to inmates to choose, as was the practice before 2004, it could be challenged in court. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the use of the firing squad in 1879, but as tastes have changed in the country since then, Dieter said it's possible a modern court could rule the practice violates an inmate's protection from cruel and unusual punishment. Beyond the legal challenges, Dieter said it will probably bring back the kind of 'voyeuristic attention' the state wanted to avoid. For Ray, the option makes sense to avoid a situation like Oklahoma or legal fights over the blend of drugs used in lethal injections. 'There's no easy way to put somebody to death, but you need to be efficient and effective about it,' Ray said. 'This is certainly one way to do that.'","Topic has gained resurgence after Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett took more than half an hour to die of a heart attack after his execution failed .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The family of a . Hofstra University student shot dead by a police officer while she was . being held hostage last year has filed a wrongful death suit. Newsday reports the family of Hofstra junior Andrea Rebello contends the . officer ""recklessly and unnecessarily endangered"" her life while she was . being held by an armed man inside her off-campus house. The . newspaper reported Friday the Tarrytown family is seeing unspecified . damages from Nassau County and the Nassau County Police Department. Andrea Rebello, left, was killed . in May by a police officer who fired eight times at Dalton Smith, right, . who had Rebello in a headlock. Seven bullets hit Smith and one hit . Rebello, killing both . The family of Andrea Rebello, pictured here, left, next to twin sister Jessica, has filed a wrongful death suit contending the officer 'recklessly and unnecessarily endangered' her life while she was being held by an armed man inside her off-campus house . Both . declined comment. The county prosecutor ruled . last month that officer Nikolas Budimlic had no option but deadly . force. District Attorney Kathleen Rice concluded the 21-year-old . Rebello's death was caused by a gunman breaking into her Hempstead . residence with a gun, taking several residents hostage and refusing to . surrender to police. Officer Nikolas Budimlic ‘acted . accordingly’ when he opened fire, killing not only the armed suspect but . 21-year-old Andrea Rebello in May 2013, at an off-campus New York . house, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office announced on . Wednesday following an 11-month investigation. Budimlic ‘reasonably perceived threats of deadly force against himself and others and acted accordingly,’ the report states. The Tarrytown family is seeing unspecified damages from Nassau County and the Nassau County Police Department . The suspect, Delton Smith, 30, who . was a wanted felon after breaking parole for an armed robbery, was shot . seven times by the responding officer. ‘Though . the results were unquestionably tragic, criminal charges under these . circumstances would be inappropriate and legally unsustainable,’ Nassau . County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said at the conclusion of a . 28-page report into the May 2013 shooting. Rice's report for the first time . publicly identified the police officer involved in the shooting as . Nikolas Budimlic, an eight-year veteran of the Nassau Police Department . who had previously spent 12 years as a New York City police officer. Budimlic was among the first officers to respond to a report of an early morning robbery at a house near the Hofstra campus. After . entering the house, the officer soon encountered Smith holding Rebello . in a headlock. Smith maneuvered down a flight of stairs and was . attempting to leave with the young woman through a rear door, hollering . expletives at police officers and threatening to shoot the student. ‘Smith . ignored numerous commands to drop his weapon and repeated his threats . to shoot both Andrea Rebello and Officer Budimlic,’ the report states. The county prosecutor ruled last month that officer Nikolas Budimlic had no option but deadly force in response to the home invasion . ‘Officer . Budimlic clearly and reasonably believed that the use of deadly . physical force was necessary to defend himself and Andrea Rebello and, . on this basis, made the decision to discharge his weapon.’ Rice's report noted that Smith, 30, had been on parole for his involvement in an armed robbery. An arrest warrant had been issued for him about three weeks before the fatal shooting occurred. Smith also had prior convictions for attempted robbery and weapons possession. It . was not clear whether the weapon he was carrying the night of the . Hofstra robbery was operable, the report found. Investigators suggested . it may have been damaged after Smith was shot and fell on the weapon. James . Carver, president of the officer's police union, said he was not . surprised by the prosecutor's conclusions.","Andrea Rebello was killed by a single bullet by a police officer who was firing at her capture during May 2013 home invasion .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A family who thought their camera was lost forever when it was dropped in a river were amazed when it resurfaced one year late - with every photo still in tact. Danielle Boylan, 43, thought she had lost a gallery of precious memories when she dropped her mother’s new camera into the River Avon while enjoying a sunny weekend in Stratford, Warwickshire. The camera had slipped from her grasp after she went to grab her three-year-old nephew Sam, who she feared was about to tumble into the water while feeding the ducks. Danielle Boylan, 43, from Stratford, Warwickshrie, was amazed when the camera . she dropped into the River Avon was recovered one year later with all . the photos in tact . After hearing about Mrs Boylan's plight, Angie Deaves and Nigel Maris, scuba divers from the Stratford British Sub Aqua Club, even waded in to help. They dived down into the river to try and retrieve the camera, but did not have any luck. But one year later, contractors were drafted in to dredge the river for the first time in 14 years. Although they were not supposed to be working on that part of the river, the kind-hearted workers agreed to look for the camera. And, amazingly, the camera was found - with every single photo still in tact. Despite being submerged under the water . for one year, the memory card had remained dry.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Married mother of two and fitness blogger Roni Noone was proud of her dramatic weight loss, so she carefully documented her progress in photos - which she now says have been stolen by a diet pill company for a second time. According to Noone, the website Diets Digest lifted some of her before-and-after photos from a friend's Facebook page and has been using them to hawk a diet supplement called Garcinia Cambogia. The 37-year-old mom, who shed 70lbs over the course of a year using the point system, extensively blogged about her journey from size extra-large to medium on the site Roni's Weigh, sharing photos every month and tracking her weight. Scroll down for video . Dramatic change: Roni Noone started out weighing 200lbs and managed to shed 70lbs by eating healthier - but now a diet supplement company is using her likeness and fake quotes to sell pills . Bogus success story: The site Diets Digest created a fake weight loss narrative using Noone's photos showing her progress . Magic pills: The website hawks diet supplements called Garcinia Cambogiamade from a tropical plant . False claims: The website selling plant-based supplements claims that Noone shed nearly 20lbs in a month . Recently, the Baltimore woman stumbled upon the Diets Digest site, only to discover her pictures along with a bogus first-person account of how she lost nearly 20lbs in a month thanks to the Garcinia Cambogia pills. The website used a fake name in the success story featured on the homepage, complete with weight loss graphs and weekly updates, ABC News reported. According to the site, the supplements are derived from a tropical plant native to Indonesia called Garcinia Gummi-Gutta - a fruit the size of a grapefruit with a sour flavor to activate digestion. The site markets two products: a colon cleanser that promises to boost metabolism and energy while blocking fat and suppressing appetite, and Lipo G3 Garcinia - a supplement that is supposed to promote cardiovascular and digestive wellness. Diets Digest quotes Noone as saying that she decided to go on the Garcinia diet after seeing reports about it on CNN and the daytime talk show Dr Oz, and hearing about it from friends on Twitter and Facebook. ‘After the fourth week, my final results are shocking,’ one of the made-up quotes reads. ‘I lost an unbelievable 19 lbs since starting the Lipo G3 Garcinia and Regula RX Cleanse diet!’ Noone, who also runs the sites . RoniNoone.com, a healthy recipes portal GreenLiteBites and a blogging . community called BlogToLose, which has over 5,000 members, says what . upsets her most is not the fact that her pictures were lifted without . her permission, but that the pill company has been using her likeness . the peddle a product that she had never taken. ‘If Garcinia Cambogia is so great then why do [these websites] feel the need to use fake stories and photos to sell the product?’ she wonders. A similar thing happened to Noone last year when another company used the same pictures showing her at 200lbs and 130lbs to promote its supplements. Precedent: Last year, another diet pills company used the same before-and-after photos featuring Noone to sell its products . Long journey: Noone, 37, documented her year-long weight loss on her blog Roni's Weigh . In that case, the 37-year-old blogger was able to contact the site and demand that her photos be removed. According to Noone, the site then replaced her before-and-after snapshots with those of another person, but kept the narrative and the fake quotes unchanged. But Diets Digest has no address or phone number listed. Noone filled out a comments form asking to pull down her photos, and she is still waiting for a response. The fitness blogger has a growing online following, with over 11,000 fans on Twitter and 6,000 friends on Facebook. Noone, who is married and has two kids, says she is upset that her images are being used to peddle pills she had never used . Painnstaking process: Noone, seen left weight 191lbs and right at her goal weight, says she shed her excess pounds by journaling about her food intake and eating healthier as part of the Weight Watchers program . On the site Roni's Weigh, Noone explained that her weight issues started when she was about 12 years old and continued on through high school and college. By the time she entered graduate school, Nooe tipped the scales at 200lbs. She had tried every kind of diet, from fasting to Xenadrine, grapefruit and cabbage regimens, and finally Atkins. While she was pregnant with her first child in 2005, Noone put on 70lbs. Two weeks after delivering her son, Noone walked into Weight Watchers - a program she credits with teaching her how to maintain a healthy weight by eating better and journaling about her food intake. ‘I just don't think it's possible to sell weight loss in a bottle,’ Mrs Noone told ABC last August.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Indianapolis Colts linebacker Robert Mathis has been suspended for four games for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancing drugs. The announcement, made shortly before 5 p.m. Friday, means he will miss the first four games of the football season, The Indy Channel reports. Mathis claims the test results are due to fertility medication he was taking to conceive a baby with his wife, Brandi. Indianapolis Colt Robert Mathis has been suspended for four games as the NFL says he violated the policy against performance enhancing drugs . In a statement addressing the suspension, Mathis said he wanted his fans, 'particularly young people,' to know that he was not using performance enhancing drugs. 'Like many families, my wife and I . faced fertility challenges, and I sought medical assistance. I . specifically asked the doctor if the medication he prescribed for me . would present a problem for NFL drug testing, and unfortunately, he . incorrectly told me that it would not,' he wrote. 'I made the mistake of not calling . the NFL or NFLPA to double check before I took the medication at the . end of last season;' he continued. 'The union has worked very closely with me to present . all of the facts and medical records for consideration of discipline . that does not include a suspension because of the unique facts of my . case, but the Commissioner refused the request. I am deeply saddened . that this situation will prevent me from contributing to my team for . four games, and I regret that I didn't cross check what my doctor told . me before I took the medication. Mathis said he only failed a test because he was taking fertility drugs to help conceive a baby with wife Brandi . 'I hope that my fans will understand the . unique circumstances involved here and continue to know that I am a man . of integrity who would never intentionally circumvent the performance . enhancing substance policy agreed to by the NFL and my union. He concluded: 'The . incredible blessing of this very upsetting situation is that, after I . took the medication very briefly at the end of last season, we learned . that my wife is expecting a baby. We are thrilled that we will be . welcoming a new member in several months, but I apologize to my . teammates, coaches and Colts fans that I will not be able to contribute . to my team for the first four weeks of the 2014 season.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Savaged: Seven-year-old Aaron Kudray shows the injuries to his face and arm after a dog attack that has left him unable to smile . A seven-year-old boy was savaged by a dog in an horrific attack which has left him unable to smile. Aaron Kudray, from Moston, Greater Manchester, was playing in the garden when the boxer-bull mastiff cross mauled his face and arms. The youngster managed to fight the dog off but was left with severe injuries to his face. He has had to undergo plastic surgery so he will be able to smile again when he's fully recovered. But the owner of the dog will not be prosecuted - because the attack happened two days before changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act. The act now says dog owners whose animals attack someone in their own home or on private property can be prosecuted. But the changes in legislation came in on Tuesday - and Aaron was attacked on Sunday. Aaron's mother, Paula, is furious the neighbour who owns the dog will not be prosecuted. The 33-year-old mother-of-four said: 'It's horrific. I am absolutely fuming. 'Aaron . has had to stay at my mum's, he's so shaken and he can't play outside . it's not fair for him sitting at home while all the other children play . out.' The owner of the dog, an 18-month-old boxer-bull mastiff cross, voluntarily destroyed her pet on Monday. She attacked Aaron after one of the children he was playing with let her out of the back yard. Paula said: 'She went straight for Aaron, I think in hindsight because he was holding sweets. 'He . said he was trying to beat her away with his left arm but every time he . got up she pinned him back down. I'll never know how he got away.' Aaron has been left with deep puncture wounds to his left arm and the left side of his face. Mauled: Aaron has had plastic surgery so he will be able to smile again but doctors said that if the wound had been even a millimetre over the tendons he uses to smile would have been severed, possibly permanently . Doctors . told Paula if the wound had been even a millimetre over, either left or . right, the tendons Aaron uses to smile would have been severed, . possibly permanently.

The . changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act, which have been welcomed by Greater .

The city's police department has launched an investigation after the incident at Good Samaritan Hospital. Officers claim that the teenager was part of a violent altercation with at least five security guards earlier this month when they got involved in the struggle. Scroll down for video . The 19-year-old was involved in a altercation with five security guards at Good Samaritan Hospital (pictured) when he was Tasered by Baltimore police . The teenager, whose identity has not . been revealed because he is a ward of state, was given an unknown . amount of medication before officers arrived on the scene, according to reports. Baltimore police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told CBS: 'The person was breathing when the officers left the hospital. 'It was not learned that the individual was in a coma and was possibly brain dead until several days after this incident.' Police would not reveal if the teenager had been Tased more than once or for how long. He was initially brought to the hospital suffering from emotional distress on May 6. He had been taken to the hospital from a home he was staying at. It is unclear whether the boy was at a foster or group home. Officials who spoke to The Baltimore Sun would identify the teenager only as a 'ward of state'. It is unclear why he was a ward of state but in Maryland you can remain in state care until the age of 21. A spokesman for Good Samaritan Hospital refused to comment on the case to MailOnline today because the name of patient could not be provided.

"By . Francesca Chambers . and Associated Press . Segregation by force of law is no longer legally acceptable in America, but de facto segregation still plagues our schools and neighborhoods, First Lady Michelle Obama told a group of graduating students Friday night. The First Lady was expected to use the speech to celebrate diversity in America. Instead, she took racism head on, telling the Topeka, Kansas, seniors, 'by some measures, our schools are as segregated as they were back when Dr. King gave his final speech.' 'And even in schools that seem integrated according to the numbers, when you look a little closer, you see students from different backgrounds sitting at separate lunch tables, or tracked into different classes, or separated into different clubs or activities,' she said. First Lady Michelle Obama's speech marked the 60th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, that outlawed segregation in public schools . Obama told seniors that 'by some measures, our schools are as segregated as they were back when Dr. King gave his final speech' Tonight's speech marked one of the first times Michelle Obama has discussed race publicly since her husband took office. Her events Friday were . scheduled after the initial announcement of her trip last month stirred . criticism in the Kansas capital. She'd initially planned to speak . Saturday during a combined graduation ceremony for five schools, but . some parents and students were worried the arena for the speech wouldn't . be large enough to accommodate all the students' family members. Democratic . President Barack Obama received just 38 percent of the vote in . Republican-leaning Kansas in 2012. GOP Gov. Sam Brownback, a frequent . critic of the administration, was on stage for the speech. Also present . was outgoing U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, . who faced criticism after the flawed launch of the federal online . health insurance marketplace. She's a former two-term Kansas governor. The First Lady's speech marks the 60th anniversary of the landmark . Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, that outlawed segregation in public schools. Tonight's speech marked one of the first times Michell Obama has discussed race publicly since her husband took office . The court decided . unanimously on May 15, 1954 that 'separate educational . facilities are inherently unequal' and were a violation of the 14th . Amendment of the United States Constitution.' Obama called the graduating class of Topeka's high schools the 'living, breathing legacy' of the the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case, which she said wasn't just 'about our history, it’s about our future.' 'Because while that case was handed down 60 years ago, Brown is still being decided every single day – not just in our courts and schools, but in how we live our lives,' she said. 'Graduates, it's up to all of you to lead the way and drag my generation and your grandparents’ generation along with you.' 'Maybe that starts in your own family, when grandpa tells that awkward joke at Thanksgiving or your aunt says something about “those people,” and you politely inform them that they’re talking about your friends,' she said. 'Or maybe it’s when you have kids of your own one day, and you go to your school board meeting and insist on integrating your schools and giving them the resources they need. She noted that her special assistant, . Kristen Jarvis, is the grandniece of Lucinda Todd, a leader with the . National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Topeka in . the 1940s and 1950s, the first parent to sign onto the lawsuit . challenging the city's segregated schools. She said Todd, who died in . 1996, is an example of people who 'choose our better history.' Obama called the graduating class of Topeka's high schools the 'living, breathing legacy' of the the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case . Obama said that in some cases society was going backward and many schools were becoming less and less diverse as white people move from cities to the suburbs, however. 'As a result, many young people in America are going to school largely with kids who look just like them,' she said. ' And too often, those schools aren’t equal, especially ones attended by students of color which too often lag behind, with crumbling classrooms and less experienced teachers.' 'Our laws may no longer separate us based on our skin color, but there’s . nothing in our Constitution that says we have to eat together in the . lunchroom or live together in the same neighborhoods,' Obama told students. The First Lady said blacks weren't just facing racism in schools. 'We know that today in America, too many folks are still stopped on the street because of the color of their skin, or they’re made to feel unwelcome because of where they’re from, or they’re bullied because of who they love.' Obama received her primary education after segregation had been banned in . schools, but was still prevalent in stubborn cities like her hometown . of Chicago, Illinois.It was not until 1975 that the city opened up its . first integrated school despite being legal obligated to treat black and . white students equally under the law. Michelle Obama . turned 16 in 1980, more than 25 years after legally endorsed segregation . in schools ended. The student population at her high school was 96 . percent black, however, because so many white people were leaving the . South Side of Chicago where Michelle and her family lived. 'She saw firsthand the impact of Brown v. Board of . Education in her own life,' senior White House aide Valerie Jarrett told . the New York Times ahead of Obama's speech. 'What she appreciates is . the strength of . diversity, how important it is to be in a community, a classroom, where . you are . hearing from all perspectives.' The First Lady initially planned to speak Saturday during a combined graduation ceremony for five schools, but some parents and students were worried the arena for the speech wouldn't be large enough to accommodate all the students' family members . Her educational experiences as a child evidently shaped her speech to students attending America's first racially integrated schools on Friday. She said when she gets discouraged about race relations in America, she thinks about 'all the progress I’ve seen in my short lifetime.' 'I . think about my mother who, as a little girl, went to segregated schools . in Chicago and felt the sting of discrimination.  I think about my . husband’s grandparents, white folks born and raised right here in Kansas . – products themselves of segregation,' she said. 'And then I . think about how that child grew up to be the President of the United . States, and how today, that little girl from Chicago is helping to raise . her granddaughters in the White House.' Obama encouraged students to push back against racism when they see it in society and to 'never be afraid to talk about these issues, particularly the issue of race.' Because even today, we still struggle to do that,' she said. 'This issue is so sensitive, so complicated, so bound up with a painful history. ' 'Every day, you have that same power to choose our better history – by opening your hearts and minds, by speaking up for what you know is right, by sharing the lessons of Brown v. Board of Education, the lessons you learned right here in Topeka, wherever you go for the rest of your lives. 'I know you all can do it.  I am so proud of all of you, and I cannot wait to see everything you achieve in the years ahead,' she said.","Speech marks the 60th anniversary of the landmark .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An alleged, longtime hitman already serving what essentially is a life sentence in a Louisiana prison now claims that he was the trigger-man in an infamous 1984 murder that was the basis for the 1989 true crime novel Blind Faith - a murder for which he already has been tried and found not guilty. But that's just the tip of the alleged iceberg for 71-year-old Larry Thompson Sr. - he also has been indicted in the 1979 murder of Deanna Montgomery, of Shreveport, and indictments also are expected in the murders of two other people in two other jurisdictions, one also in Louisiana and one in Texas. Montgomery's husband, Jim - a longtime friend of Thompson's - also was indicted this week in the murder of his wife and charged with second-degree murder. Killer: Larry Thompson has admitted to killing Maria Marshall in a murder of which he was found not guilty . Acquitted: Thompson (right) was found not guilty in the murder of Marshall - her husband, Robert (left), was sentenced to death for his wife's death . Best seller: The murder of Maria Marshall was the basis for the 1989 true crime novel Blind Faith . Thompson's current prison sentence is for crimes unrelated to the three murders - and because he already has been found not guilty of murdering New Jersey socialite Maria Marshall, he can't be tried again for her murder. Marshall was found shot to death on the side of the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey on September 7, 1984. Despite being identified during his trial as the trigger man, Thompson was found not guilty of the murder. Marshall's husband, Robert Marshall, however, was found guilty of arranging the murder of his wife and was sentenced to death - although, that sentence was overturned in 2004 and he was re-sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. He remains in a New Jersey prison. Thompson's confession to the murder comes as investigators have started to take a fresh look at a handful of different unsolved homicides in multiple states. The two other unsolved murders in which authorities suspect Thompson are those of Larry Wayne Lester in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, in 1988, and the 1979 murder of Chester Underwood in Harrison County, Texas. Murdered: Maria Marshall (left) was found shot to death on the side of the Garden State Parkway in 1984 . Authorities are being rather tight-lipped about their overlapping investigations, but law enforcement officials think time is beginning to catch up to the confessed killer and he is beginning to come clean about the murders he's long been suspected of committing. 'Larry was a notorious criminal. He was feared. Nobody ever testified . against Larry Thompson,' Robert Davidson, a retired DeSoto Parish . sheriff’s lieutenant who continues to work on area cold cases, tells the Shreveport Times. 'Testifying against Larry Thompson was like testifying against the drug . cartel.' Authorities believe Thompson could be tied to several more murders, and hope that now that he is behind bars, witnesses who may have previously been scared to testify against the longtime criminal might start coming forward. In many of the cold cases, Thompson was initially considered a suspect. But authorities had a hard time getting charges to stick. But many of the detectives who worked the cases three decades ago never forgot about Thompson's alleged victims. For hire: Marshall's husband, Robert, was convicted of hiring people to murder his wife and sentenced to death . 'It just goes to show you, sometimes the family gives up hope. But every . case in time, just like the one here in DeSoto that happened in 1988, . will have leads still out there,' DeSoto Parish Sheriff Rodney Arbuckle told the paper. 'This investigation has . been going on for more than a year and I know sometimes the family . thinks law enforcement has forgotten them but anytime we get a lead we . are going to run with it to see how far it goes.' Thompson currently is serving a 50-plus year sentence for a botched, 2003 armored car robbery. Thompson and five other thieves - including Thompson's son Larry Thompson Jr. - were arrested following a dramatic chase through a neighborhood in Bossier City. The failed robbery and the chase that followed left one Shreveport police officer wounded. Prosecutors recently began interviewing Thompson about some of the murders he's been suspected of committing over the years as he sits in Louisiana's infamous Angola Prison, where he is now in the 12th year of what essentially is a life sentence for the aging thug. Indicted: Thompson has been indicted in the 1979 murder of Deanna Montgomery . During one of these interviews, Thompson admitted to murdering Marshall, and told Caddo Parish Assistant District Attorney J. Ford McWilliams that his son had provided a false alibi for him during his initial trial. 'Not only did he say he was in New Jersey on Sept. 6-8, 1984, he also . stated that it was he who fired the shots that caused Maria Marshall’s . death,' Ocean County prosecutor Joseph Coronato said. However, he will never be charged with her murder. 'Though there are no legal avenues we can pursue at this time because . our laws preclude further prosecution and substantial time has lapsed . since the event occurred, we felt it was important we publicize these . developments so that the family and friends of Maria Marshall could find . some degree of closure to this tragic event,' Coronato said.","Larry Thompson was known in law enforcement circles as a contract killer .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A cold-hearted crook with a lengthy criminal history sunk to an astounding new low earlier this month when, according to authorities, he stole the wallet of a man who thought he was having a heart attack at a bar in Illinois. As if that weren't enough, the man then used the money he allegedly stole from the victim to buy the woman the victim had been talking to a drink. In an alleged crime that a member of the local sheriff's department called one of the 'most pathetic, disheartening things' he's ever seen, when Larry Lotter fell to the ground at the Rock Bottom Bar in Williamson, Illinois, Bryan Kuegler gave the impression that he was trying to help him. Low: Bryan Kuegler - seen here on his knees over victim Larry Lotter - is seen allegedly stuffing Lotter's wallet in his pocket after he fell to the ground with symptoms of a heart attack . Survivor: Lotter survived, and it turned out he didn't have a heart attack - he now suspects Kuegler put something in his drink that made him ill . However, as surveillance footage would later show, Kuegler was really waiting for the right moment to steal Lotter's wallet. Thankfully, Lotter survived the frightening ordeal - and his ailment wasn't a heart attack. 'I felt fine, and then all at once, I took a drink of my beer, and I . felt a real sharp pain, like someone sticking an ice pick in my chest,' Lotter tells KTVI. Lotter then hit the floor, and his friends called 9-1-1. As they were waiting for the ambulance to arrive, Kuegler can be seen on surveillance video leaning over Lotter as others are trying to keep him conscious. History: Kuegler, 32, has a lengthy criminal history for crimes like narcotics possession, theft and domestic violence . 'As the EMT’s were getting ready to come in, is when he reached down and grabbed my wallet and stuck it in his pants,' Lotter told the station. Madison County Sheriff's Department Captain Mike Dixon said Kuegler can then be seen walking off with the wallet. 'Then as the victim left the establishment, [Kuegler] went into the restroom, returned, and threw the victim’s wallet on the floor,' Dixon says. Dixon says Kuegler took two $50 bills out of Lotter's wallet. Pain: Lotter described feeling a sharp pain in his chest before he fell, seen here as friends notice something is wrong . According to Mike Lovsey, the owner of the bar, Kuegler then spent Lotter's money to buy drinks. 'He tried to buy the girl that Larry was with that day a drink with the money he took,' Lovsey says. Because of the surveillance footage, Lotter easily identified Kuegler as the alleged thief. In fact, he had recently put brakes on Kuegler's car about a month ago. 'Real shocked,' Lotter says of learning Kuegler allegedly stole from him. 'The night I went home, I could hardly sleep because it bothered me so bad.' Lovsey was equally stunned. 'He was trying to play Good Samaritan, then turned around and ripped the . guy off at the same time,' he says. 'I was shocked. I couldn’t believe someone . would do something like that.' Hide the evidence: Kuegler is later seen throwing Lotter's wallet on the floor (shown here in front of arrow) after taking $100 . Sleazy: According to the bartender, Kuegler (center) tried to buy a drink for Lotter's date with the money he took from his wallet . According to Lotter, doctors told him a heart attack was not what caused him to collapse at the bar that day, and he suspects Kuegler could have slipped something in his drink to knock him out. 'Rarely have I seen somebody literally steal from what they believe to be a dying man. It’s pretty pathetic,' Dixon says. Kuegler was booked into the Madison County Jail on one count of felony theft from a person. He faces up to five years in prison if he's convicted. Kuegler's previous offenses include theft, domestic battery and narcotics.","Larry Lotter thought he was having a heart attack while drinking at an Illinois bar .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 31-year-old Chicago man has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, allegedly strangling her to death during a late-night fight on Tuesday. Daniel Kralik is being held on a $1 million bond in the relation to the slaying of Victoria McManus, 26, who he had been dating for two years. The couple had been living together for the past two months at her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street, Assistant State’s Attorney Alexandra Molesky told The Chicago Sun-Times. Two weeks ago, the couple got into a fight because McManus, 26, had a relationship with another man, Molesky said. Confessed: Daniel Kralik called 911 and admitted that he had strangled Victoria McManus after an argument at the apartment they shared in Chicago on Tuesday night . Gone too soon: Victoria A. McManus was found dead in her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street in Chicago on Tuesday night . Kralik initially planned to move out and stay with friends, but the couple reconciled and continued living together. On Tuesday, the couple got into another fight at McManus’ apartment, authorities said. McManus left her residence while Kralik went to a friend’s place until he 'cooled off', Molesky said. Instead, Kralik stayed at McManus’ apartment and when she returned home the couple got into another argument in her bedroom, Molesky said. During the argument, Kralik allegedly strangled McManus with his hands. The roommate heard the muffled sounds of an argument and a brief struggle, Molesky said. Kralik called 911 and admitted that he strangled McManus after an argument. Police responded about 12:50 a.m. and arrested Kralik, authorities said. McManus was declared dead at the scene. McManus is believed to have recently started a relationship with another man, infuriating her boyfriend, who has now been charged with her murder .

An autopsy confirmed McManus died of strangulation, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Kralik appeared in court wearing Thursday a white plastic jumpsuit because his clothes were taken as evidence. Judge Adam Bourgeois ordered Kralik held on $1 million bond and issued a next court date of June 4.

"By . Alex Greig . A 10-year-old First Nations girl from Ontario suffering an aggressive form of cancer has stopped her chemotherapy treatment in favor of traditional Aboriginal treatments. Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from the New Credit First Nation reserve, can be seen in a video posted to YouTube explaining her reasons for wanting to quit the treatment. Makayla's . parents, Pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, allowed their daughter to give up . the chemotherapy, a move that . prompted doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital where Makayla was being . treated to alert children's aid authorities. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Visions: Makayla, whose parents are both pastors, said Jesus came to her and told her she was healed . In the video, Makayla says the treatment was . 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her that . she was already healed. Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January and suffered terrible weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat it despite anti-nausea medications. She underwent 11 weeks of the chemo, which sent her cancer into remission. However, according to Two Row Times, a publication aimed at the Indigenous community, doctors say that in order to rid Makayla of the cancer completely, she needs to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival. 'Coming to the last weeks of her treatment alarms started to go off inside of me,' Makayla’s mother, Sonya Sault told Two Row Times. 'It was . that maternal instinct that told me that we’re not doing the right thing . with her... Makayla said to me, ""Do you have the power to get me out of . there? If you have the power to take me out of there I want you to take . me out of there. I’m telling you Mom, it’s not right. The way that we . are going it’s going to kill me.""' The Saults took Makayla home, weakened and with a 10lb weight loss, for two weeks to recover after her first treatment. Family support: Ken and Sonya Sault say the decision to come of chemotherapy was their daughter's and that they believe she will be healed by traditional therapies . 'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore... I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla says in the video. During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she says. 'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she says. Also during that time, Makayla says she had a vision of Jesus, flanked by two angels, who told her she was already healed, and not to be afraid. This last revelation has caused McMaster Children’s Hospital to pursue court action with the governmental Consent and Capacity Board to determine if Makayla and her parents are of sound mind. According to Two Row Times, if Makayla or her parents are found to be not of unsound mind, the Children’s Aid Society will forcibly remove Makayla from the New Credit First Nation reservation and start her back on chemotherapy. The Saults could also lose their other two children. Eloquent: Makayla wrote in a letter she read allowed that she wishes the doctors would listen to her, 'because I live in this body and they don't' 'It’s pure ignorance to think that Western medicine is the only answer,' First Nations healer James Carpenter, who claims to have successfully treated cancer, leukemia and other life-threatening illnesses, told CTV News. 'What medicine people do is they go to the spirit and ask that spirit and find a way within that person to help them,' said Carpenter, who works at the Anishnawbe Health Centre. According to Two Row Times, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination. Makayla's parents say they will defend their daughter's right to pursue traditional medicine. 'If someone does try to take Makayla away we are assured 100 per cent that people will be there to stop apprehension,"" Sonya Sault told CBC. 'People know the consequences and they’re willing to stand in and protect her at all costs.… If that’s what it comes down to, they need to be physical. We’re going to do what it takes to make sure that our daughter is protected.' They won't say exactly what treatments Makayla is undergoing, but they say that they appear to be working. 'I feel awesome. I gained some of my weight back. I’m eating and drinking and I can hold it all down. And I am getting my strength back,' Makayla says in the video.","Makayla Sault, 10, read out a self-penned letter in which she says she has decided not to have chemo .

"By . Dan Bloom . Food giant Heinz has been fined £50,000 after an engineer had his right hand sliced off by a potato peeling machine. Surgeons had to operate eight times on Alec Brackenbury's stump - leaving him unable to drive, work or live normally - after he was maimed during routine maintenance last June. The 49-year-old's accident sparked a major health and safety investigation at Heinz's Westwick plant in Worstead, Norfolk, one of its five British factories, and he is now suing the firm. Maimed: Surgeons had to operate on Alec Brackenbury's stump eight times, leaving him only with a rudimentary mechanical claw. Heinz admitted safety breaches and the engineer is now suing the firm . Known as Alf, Mr Brackenbury was servicing the machine when he climbed down to fetch a bolt which he had dropped through the peeler into its slurry pump. He had switched off the peeler before working, and he thought the pump - which is used to clear away excess peelings - was connected to the same circuit. But it was not, and the pump began running while the engineer's right hand was inside. It sliced off his hand at the wrist and left him in hospital for two weeks. Now he has just a rudimentary mechanical claw. To make matters worse, Mr Brackenbury's caravan on the Norfolk coast was then washed away by storms in December - leaving him homeless. Failings: The accident happened at Heinz's Westwick plant in Worstead, Norfolk, one of its five British factories . An investigation by the Health and . Safety Executive found the pump and the peeler had appeared to be part . of the same system, even though they were not. The HSE also established there was no protective grate to stop the self-employed engineer reaching into the pump. Food giant: Heinz apologised for the incident . Heinz was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to health and safety breaches yesterday at Norwich Magistrates' Court. Mr Brackenbury's solicitor Ian Comer . told MailOnline: 'He's been pursuing a civil claim since the incident . occurred so hopefully we will now be able to conclude that more quickly. 'The impact of losing his dominant hand has been pretty catastrophic. 'He's a mechanical and electrical engineer and also ran a micro brewery as a sideline, but both of those were physical, dextrous work that needed both his hands. 'He's an active, outdoors type man, not an office computer kind of guy. He's already 49 - what kind of work is he going to be able to find?' The ketchup, baked beans and soup giant . was fined £50,000 and ordered to pay . costs of £9,661. The firm - which Mr Comer said had co-operated fully throughout - admitted one count of breaching Regulation 11(1) of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998. After the hearing HSE inspector Tony Brookes said: 'Alf Brackenbury suffered a horrific injury in an incident that was wholly avoidable. 'Mr Brackenbury was put at risk by . Heinz Ltd's inadequate assessment of risks and lack of effective . measures to stop access to dangerous parts of equipment. Doubly unlucky: To make matters even worse, Mr Brackenbury's caravan home was washed away by storms . 'Sadly . in this case Heinz failed to protect Mr Brackenbury while he was . contracted to carry out maintenance work at their Westwick plant and, as . a result, he has suffered a life-changing injury.' A Heinz spokesman said: 'Safety is always our first concern. 'Although . a safe system for maintenance work was in place, further measures have . been adopted to ensure that such a regrettable accident could not happen . again.'","Alec Brackenbury, 49, reached for metal bolt when machine began running .

She said the horse loved their reactions to a slobbery kiss - as people would often giggle or smile after he had done so. So Robin decided to teach Scooby how to kiss on demand and even built him his own kissing booth for charity events. The money raised from the booth goes towards a children's cancer charity called CureSearch. Why hello there! Robin trained Scooby Boo to kiss on demand and built him his own kissing booth for charity events . He's a lover! Robin says one of Scooby Boo's greatest traits is his trust in humans .

"The search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is the most extensive and expensive ever undertaken, but it’s been claimed the plane could have been located if its tracking software had been upgraded - something that costs just £6 ($10) per flight. According to new book Flight MH370: The Mystery, the Boeing 777-200ER had a ‘data package’ that only transmitted the most basic flight information, so authorities weren’t able to get a GPS fix on it. For just six pounds, however, this package could have been improved, the book says, resulting in far more detailed information about the 777's movements being pinged. Flight MH370 has been missing since March 8 - but could have transmitted a GPS fix on its location if its tracking software had received a £6 upgrade, it's been claimed . Huge task: The search for MH370 is the most expensive and extensive ever undertaken . Investigation: The book weighs all the theories about what happened to MH370 . The book, by Nigel Cawthorne, says: ‘Along with several other carriers, Malaysia Airlines had opted for a cheap data package for its aircraft that transmitted only minimal information rather than pay an additional small fee to transmit detailed flight data.’ The new publication, which weighs all the theories about what happened to the flight, highlights a quote regarding the tracking system obtained by the Daily Telegraph. ‘For US$10, you could have told within half an hour’s flying time where the plane would have gone,’ a source told the paper. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, meanwhile, has called for real-time tracking of planes and improvements to their communication systems to prevent a repeat of the 370 tragedy. In an opinion piece published on Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, Najib called for changes that would ‘make it harder for an aircraft to simply disappear, and easier to find any aircraft that did.’ ‘One of the most astonishing things about this tragedy is the revelation that an airliner the size of a Boeing 777 can vanish, almost without a trace. In an age of smartphones and mobile Internet, real-time tracking of commercial airplanes is long overdue,’ he said. The Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 239 people was traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 when it disappeared. The search is focused in the Indian Ocean, west of Perth, Australia, but it has not been found. Inmarsat Plc, a British provider of global mobile satellite communications services, said Monday it will offer free basic tracking services for planes flying over oceans. The service will be available to most of the world's long-haul commercial fleet. The Malaysian plane sent a signal to an Inmarsat satellite, but not location data. Engineers conducted a novel analysis of those signals to determine the plane's flight path, but the effort took time. Australia's Ocean Shield is carrying a robot submarine, the Bluefin 21, to survey the ocean floor for MH370's black box . Najib also urged the aviation industry to consider changing planes' communications systems so that they can't be disabled midair. The government has said someone severed the plane's communication systems with the ground and deliberately diverted Flight 370. He said the capacity of the cockpit data recorder, one of a plane's two black boxes, should be extended from two hours currently to recording the entire flight, while its location beacons should be made to last at least 90 days, instead of 30 days now. ‘The global aviation industry must not only learn the lessons of MH370 but implement them,’ he added. Najib reiterated that Flight 370 was one of world's greatest aviation mysteries. ‘Nobody saw this coming, nobody knows why it happened, and nobody knows precisely where it is,’ he said. He said the government has done its best but admitted there were mistakes in the early days of the crisis, with a disorderly public communication and a slow start to search efforts. He said an independent investigation is ongoing so the government can learn from mistakes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida couple found an unwelcome guest making use of their swimming pool in the early hours of Thursday morning. Sharon Bente was awoken by noises coming from the backyard of the Bradenton home she shares with her husband, John. Upon further investigation, the noise that she had thought was wind blowing patio furniture around was in fact caused by an eight-foot three-inch alligator. Unexpected guest: The Bentes were not prepared for their late-night visitor, an eight-foot three-inch alligator . Shock: Sharon Bente went out to investigate a noise that she thought was caused by the wind, but made her way quickly back inside when she saw something in her pool that isn't usually there . Unwelcome: The Bentes say it's a great story - but they hope they never see another alligator in their pool . 'I saw something that is not usually in the pool along with the little floaty,' she told My Sun Coast. Sharon Bente's first thought when she saw the huge gator was to get inside as quickly as possible. 'Can I get back to the door without it seeing me or realizing I'm bait?' she wondered to herself, she says. She managed to get inside the house unscathed and awoke her husband with the unexpected news. '[She] said, ""We have a gator in our pool,"" to me, and of course I didn’t know what she was talking about,' John Bente told My Sun Coast. 'I was still half sleeping.' Size counts: A typical adult alligator grows to about 13 feet, so the one who broke into the Bentes' pool would have been a juvenile . Apprehended: The gator was eventually caught by a trapper, who took her to an alligator farm . The alligator had ripped through the screen enclosing the pool and patio area and gone for a late-night dip in the pool. 'He was just swimming around in circles,' John Bente says. 'He tried to get up here for awhile, [but] I think he was a little intimidated with everybody watching, too.' The couple called the sheriff's office and a trapper came around to remove the gator, a female. She was taken to an alligator farm in Arcadia. The Bentes are glad there isn't more damage to repair than their ripped screen. 'It is a great story, it is a fun story, and hopefully it just won't happen again!' Sharon Bente told My Sun Coast.","Sharon and John Bente were awoken at 4am Thursday by noises from their backyard .

"It is a mystery almost as great as those that he solves. But it seems the inspiration behind Agatha Christie's Poirot may have been unveiled as a policeman from Belgium. Little-known gendarme Jacques Hamoir is the man who the author turned into her famous detective Hercule Poirot, according to records unveiled by historians. Uncanny: Gendarme Jacques Hamoir, left, who historians believe was the inspiration for Agatha Christie's fictional Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, right . Christie introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and he went on to 'exercise his little grey cells' in 33 novels. Although the author never revealed any particular person as her inspiration, evidence has now been uncovered by both Belgian archivists and the descendant of a wartime fundraiser which shows Hamoir could have been the real-life Poirot. Agatha Christie, pictured, first introduced the detective in her 1920 novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. He went on to appear in 33 novels . New details emerged of a meeting between a young Hamoir and Christie - when she played the piano for him in her home town of Torquay, Devon, aged 24. Hamoir fled his country in the face of advancing German troops in 1914 and made his way to England -  just as the fictional character did. The 57-year-old and his son Lucian, 17, then travelled to Exeter, Devon, to meet a local volunteer called Alice Graham Clapp, who logged their names in her diary. Mrs Clapp, a married mother-of-four, helped around 500 Belgians find places to stay during the Great War and was later honoured by its Government. She was also involved in wartime fundraising events, hosting one at the home of a friend, a Mrs Potts-Chatto, who was putting up Hamoir and his son at her house in Torquay. Newspaper records reveal that locals laid on entertainment on January 6, 1915, with Agatha Christie playing the piano for the Belgian guests. Christie later claimed she 'found' the characters for The Mysterious Affair at Styles while travelling around Torquay. But Alice Clapp’s grandson Michael was . researching his relative’s exploits with the help of the Torquay Museum . when he uncovered a chance meeting between a man called 'Jacques Hornais' and Christie. Mr Clapp, a retired Navy Captain, . said: 'Alice kept a black notebook listing some 500 Belgian refugees of . all classes who passed through Exeter. 'The . first lot included this retired gendarme, Jacques Hornais, and his son. The names of many of the families who received them are recorded.' 'Jacques Hornais' - now revealed as Jacques Hamoir - fled his country in the face of advancing German troops in 1914,  and made his way to England, just as the fictional character did. The 57-year-old and his son Lucian, 17, travelled to Exeter, Devon, to meet local volunteer called Alice Graham Clapp, who logged their names in her diary . After the discovery, Isabelle Leponce, an archivist at the local council in Herstal, Belgium, looked into it further. She . said there was no-one known as 'Hornais' in the archives but she did discover a man by the name of Jacques Hamoir - who she said was likely to be the person in the entry. She said: 'We worked out the street name, rue Large Voie, even though the postcode has long changed. 'Then we found a Jacques Hamoir and his son Lucien. The ages were right. He must almost certainly be the man in the entry.' Mr Clapp said he had done a lot of research into what happened to the man who had met his grandmother. He said: 'He eventually went to stay with a Mrs Potts-Chatto who lived in a house called the Daisons in Torquay. It’s been knocked down now and there’s a housing estate in its place. Christie introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and he went on to 'exercise his little grey cells' in 33 novels . According to her official website, Christie never revealed who inspired the character which in turn became a TV hit - but 'during the First World War there were Belgian refugees in most parts of the English countryside, Torquay being no exception' 'But the Torquay museum has confirmed however that the Potts-Chattos held a meeting in their house to raise money and gather clothing for the refugees. 'A young girl played the piano at the event. This young lady later became the crime writer Agatha Christie - so there is a very strong circumstantial link to Poirot.' Mrs Clapp, who was married to Cecil Robert Mainwaring Clapp, a solicitor and Sheriff of Exeter, died in the 1920s just as Christie’s writing career was taking off. For her services to the refugees Mrs Clapp was awarded a Belgian medal, la Medaille de la Reine Elisabeth, which the family still have. Mrs Clapp, a married mother-of-four, helped around 500 Belgians find places to stay during the Great War and was later honoured by its Government . The youngest of the refugees are said to have nicknamed her Moei, pronounced Moy, which is Flemish for Mother. Mr Clapp said his grandmother had personally gone to the train station to meet all 500, including Hamoir and his son Lucian, in person. Hamoir would have been a similar age to his fictional counterpart, although little else is known about him and there is no mention of whether he had a moustache like Poirot. Mr Clapp said: 'All of us now think of Hercule Poirot as rather a fat chap waddling along with a distinct character but that doesn’t mean to say he was like that in real life. 'All we know about this man is that he was gendarme and he had a son. He was married but he didn’t bring along his wife his wife at the time. 'It’s seems quite plausible that Christie met him at the event and may have been intrigued by his stories. 'We don’t know any of this for sure, but then its seems quite fitting that the real life Poirot should remains as mysterious as the books themselves.' According to her official website, Christie never revealed who inspired the character - but 'during the First World War there were Belgian refugees in most parts of the English countryside, Torquay being no exception'. David Brawn, publisher for the Agatha Christie Estate, said: 'Agatha always claimed she was inspired by the Belgian refugees she met. 'It’s quite plausible that she played the piano for them at a social event as she was quite an accomplished pianist. 'As far as I’m aware she never said that Poirot was based on any one person, he’s very much a composite character. 'So whether this event was one of those occasions when she thought about him, I don’t know - but it certainly makes for a great little story.' Mr Hamoir was born in 1858 but left Belgium as a refugee in 1914 with his . son, who died in Saint Austell aged 18. After the war, Mr Hamoir . returned to his wife and daughter, Yvonne, living in Herstal until he . died aged 86 in 1944. His daughter married but did not stay in Herstal and archivists have yet to establish whether she had children.","It is claimed Jacques Hamoir is man who author turned into famous detective .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A family has been torn apart after a man took his father's ashes from his elderly mother's garden - and is still refusing to reveal their whereabouts. Joseph Pringle, 64, died from heart failure in 1996 and his remains were buried in his wife Ruby's back garden in Spittal in Berwick, Northumberland. They were stored in an urn and hidden under a rose bush, where they remained for 17 years. Plea: The heartbroken relatives of Stephen Pringle, 52, have begged him to reveal the whereabouts of his father's ashes. Above, his sister, Vivien Robson, in her mother's garden, where the ashes used to be buried . Distraught: Joseph Pringle, 64, died from heart failure in 1996 and his remains were buried in his wife Ruby's (picture, right, with Ms Robson) garden in Spittal in Berwick, Northumberland. But in November, they vanished . But in November, Mrs Pringle, now 82, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, went into the garden and discovered the urn had vanished, while the rose bush had been upended. Following a police investigation, her eldest son, Stephen Pringle, was charged with stealing the cremated remains. The 52-year-old appeared before Berwick Magistrates' Court on Monday, where he was found not guilty of committing a criminal offence. Cremated:  The ashes of Joseph Pringle (pictured) had been stored in an urn and hidden under a rose bush for 17 years before they were taken . But despite the outcome, Mr Pringle admits he has taken the ashes - although he is still yet to reveal their exact whereabouts to his family. Yesterday, his mother and siblings Vivien Robson, 58, Ann Chissel, 46, and Gordon Pringle, 48, pleaded with him to disclose the location of his father's remains. 'Just let us know exactly where you have scattered my dad. We could go and put some flowers down,' said Mrs Chissel, also from Berwick. 'At the end of the day, we were all very close to my dad.' Mrs Chissel said her brother had taken the ashes following a family row over . a loan, and had later revealed that he had scattered them somewhere in . Ormiston in East Lothian, Scotland. But . after visiting the village and raking through rubbish bins, the family . have still not managed to recover any trace of the urn. 'It is like my dad has died all over again but now we don't have anything to show for it,' she said. 'When he died we knew where he was and now it is like that closure has been taken away from us. 'This has wrecked the whole family because we were all pretty close. When we found out this had happened, we couldn't believe it and we don't know why it has happened.' She added: 'We believe that Stephen still has the ashes. We don't know why he is doing this to us. We would be happy if he even took us and showed us where he scattered them. All that is left: In November, Mrs Pringle, now 82, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, went into the garden and discovered the urn had vanished, while the rose bush had been upended (pictured) 'We just want to know what has happened. It would help if we just knew.' Mr Pringle's solicitor Ian O'Rourke said yesterday the case was the 'most extraordinary case' he has ever had to deal with, and should never have reached court. 'It was a dreadful and very sad case. This man [Stephen Pringle] did not act dishonestly at all. It has been quite a distressing case to see a family torn apart like this,' he said. Sister: Mr Pringle has admitted taking the ashes - but is yet to reveal their exact whereabouts to his family . Mr O'Rourke said his client had admitted taking the ashes after things came to a head one night when he had taken prescribed tranquillisers. 'Stephen wanted to scatter the ashes where his father was born in Ormiston,' he said. But he added that there is hope for the fractured family as mediation is an option, saying: 'When Stephen was interviewed by police, he was more than willing to engage in mediation.' When approached by reporters, Mr Pringle said he did not wish to comment.","Stephen Pringle, 52, took ashes from his mother's garden last November .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The 54-year-old grandfather who was severely beaten by a Detroit mob when he stopped to help a young boy has finally left hospital six weeks after the attack. A simple message simply stating 'Steve Utash is home' was posted online on Saturday, as his family announced that he had left a rehabilitation center. The 54-year-old had been left with serious head injuries after a gang of men attacked him after he stopped to help a 10-year-old he had accidentally hit with his pick up truck. Back home: Steve Utash, pictured with his daughters in a hospital room, has been released after six weeks of treatment for his injuries . Road to recovery: Steve Utash is back with his family after suffering severe head injuries in an April 2 attack . The tree trimmer had been in hospital . since April 2, and more recently was moved to the DMC Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan. 'He is home and doing very well. It is wonderful to have him back,' Mr Utash’s family told the Detroit Free Press. Mr Utash was punched and kicked by a group of men, and his injuries were so serious that at first doctors had put him in a medically induced coma and told his family he could suffer lasting brain damage. But he is starting to regain his memory and has been making good progress, At the end of last month he had been well enough to be moved to a rehabilitation center. Earlier this week, Mandi Emerick had posted on Facebook that her father was doing much better. 'He doesn’t need a sitter in his room anymore either and he is almost back to his old self. We are overjoyed that he’s OK,' she wrote. Fears: Doctors had to put the 54-year-old in a medically induced coma after he was kicked and punched . Support: Steve Utash's family, including wife, Starr,  have been touched by the generous donations to help pay for his medical bills . Mr Utash was saved from his attackers by Deborah Hughes, a nurse who lives in the neighborhood and who had also rushed out to help the boy who had been knocked down. Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident when Mr Utash hit the young boy, who had run into the road and was later treated for leg injuries. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' a Detroit police spokesman told Mail Online. Four men have been charged with attempted murder; and a 16-year-old boy, who has not been named, was charged with assault and ethnic intimidation. Mr Utash is white and his attackers are African-American. Charges: Wonzey Saffold, left, James Davis, center, Bruce Wimbush Jr, and Latrez Cummings, not pictured are due in court in August .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Ready meals sold by major supermarket chains contain up to ten heaped teaspoons of sugar per portion - more than double the amount found in bar of Dairy Milk chocolate. An investigation by consumer group Which? showed some supermarket convenience meals contained the equivalent of what experts say is the safe amount of sugar to consume per day. According to the Sunday Mirror, the worst offender was the Sainsbury's sweet & sour chicken with rice, which was found to have 50.7g of sugar in one dish - more than a can of Coca Cola and double that of a six-piece Dairy Milk. Some supermarket ready meals contain as much sugar as recommended per day for an adult. The worst offender was Sainsbury's sweet & sour chicken with . rice, which was found to have 50.7g of sugar per portion . Under government guidelines, the recommended daily sugar intake for adults is around ten teaspoons of sugar. But the World Health Organisation recently suggested adults should have no more than five teaspoons - which is around 25g - in 24 hours. Doctors say this rule is key to avoiding obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses because they fear sugar is as dangerous as tobacco. But the consumer group has found that several of the ready meals made by supermarkets serve up more than that in just one portion of their product. The dishes found to contain the most sugar were sweet and sour recipes, including Tesco . Everyday Value sweet & sour chicken with rice which was found to have 48.4g of sugar - just less than ten teaspoons - per serving. Sainsbury's crispy sweet & sour chicken with rice came with 37.3g of sugar, while Waitrose's sweet and sour chicken . with rice had 38.9g. The survey, carried out by consumer group Which?, found the Tesco . Everyday Value sweet & sour chicken with rice contained 48.4g of . sugar. Under government guidelines, the recommended daily allowance is . 50g - around ten teaspoons of sugar . The chicken pad thai from Tesco and the sweet and sour chicken with rice from Waitrose also contained high levels of sugar. The World Health Organisation recently recommended adults reduce their daily intake to five teaspoons of sugar, which is around 25g . The crispy sweet & sour chicken had 37.3g of sugar per pack. Sainsbury's, Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda . were all found to sell ready meals with high sugar content . Meanwhile, the Tesco chicken pad thai rice noodles were found to have 37.8g of sugar per portion. Which? released the results after looking at 17 supermarket ready meals sold by Asda, Marks & Spencer, . Morrisons, Sanisbury's, Tesco and Waitrose. The worst offenders had more sugar than a can of Coca Cola, which contains around nine teaspoons of sugar . Executive director Richard Lloyd told the paper: 'With rising obesity rates, it is shocking to find that ready meals contain more sugar than a chocolate bar. 'We want the government to set clear targets for calories reductions as a priority as part of the responsibility deal.' The debate over the danger of sugar is raging. Adults have been told they should halve their average intake - slashed dramatically amid fears that sugar poses the same threat to health as tobacco. Experts blame it for millions of premature deaths across the world every year. Graham MacGregor, a London cardiologist and health campaigner, said: ‘Added sugar is a completely unnecessary part of our diets, contributing to obesity, type II diabetes and tooth decay. ‘We have known about the health risks of sugar for years and yet nothing substantial has been done. ‘The new recommendations will be a wakeup call to the Department of Health and the Government to take action by forcing the food industry to slowly reduce the huge amount of sugar added across the board.’ Chief medical officer Sally Davies has already said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity. The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year. Some supermarket brands of sauce contain up to 38 per cent more sugar and 52 per cent more salt than advertised on the label, an investigation has found. The Sunday Times found that sauces which are branded as being 'low salt' or 'low sugar' actually had higher salt or sugar levels than declared. The paper commissioned 26 tests on a range of products and found nearly two-thirds fitted that bill. Despite this, all but one of the tests fell within European Commission guidelines that give acceptable margins of error, the paper said. Tesco's reduced sugar and salt ketchup was found to contain 14.8g sugar per 100g, compared with the 10.7g per 100g put on the label. Asda's reduced sugar and salt baked beans contained 23 per cent more sugar while Morrisons' reduced salt and sugar ketchup contained 17 per cent more sugar than stated. Heinz's reduced salt and sugar HP sauce contained 10 per cent more sugar and 7 per cent more salt than advertised. A spokesman for Tesco said it would be carrying out its own checks. Morrisons and Sainsbury's both said they were carrying out work to reduce sugar and salt in products. Heinz said all the nutritional information met official food labelling requirements.","Ready meals sold by supermarkets contain up to ten teaspoons of sugar .

"By . David Kent . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has vowed to stay at the club after seeing his Gunners side end their nine-year wait for silverware by beating Hull City in the FA Cup final . Hull stunned the expectant Gunners supporters, astonishingly taking a two-goal lead within eight minutes, but Wenger's side eventually clicked into gear, with Aaron Ramsey the eventual hero in extra time.

Going nowhere: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed he will be staying on as manager . Shower time: Lukas Podolski of pours beer over Wenger after their FA Cup win . 'I always said my future doesn't depend on this but I always wanted to stay,' Wenger told ITV when asked if he was staying before saying, 'Yes, I will.' He added: 'We wanted to make history tonight and win the game and we did that in both ways - how not to start the Cup final and how to come back,' Wenger said. 'I think it was a turning point in the life span of this team - to know they can win in that way was really important today. 'It would have been terrible [to lose] but we came back. I've praised the spirit of this team and they showed that today. Congratulations to Hull they played fantastically the whole game.'

"Swingers are set to descend on the Brecon Beacons for a cowboy themed sex party, much to the disgust of disgruntled locals. More than 100 have signed up for the two-day event on July 4 and 5 at the secluded four-star Clyngwyn bunkhouse, in the Beacons National Park. The weekend, in the shadow of Ystradfellte waterfalls, is being set up by a couple claiming to be called 'Fire and Ice', also known as Ally and Steve. More than 100 have signed up for the two-day event on July 4 and 5 at the secluded four-star Clyngwyn bunkhouse, in the Beacons National Park . They have been plugging the £20 nights at the secluded hostel on a swingers website. 'We have been on the scene for a while but are by no means hardened swingers,' the couple wrote. 'We enjoy the social side just as much as anything else.' Swingers from all over Wales have been discussing their party outfits on the website fabswingers.com. 'MissMaverick', from Swansea, promised to bring some order to the party by dressing as a Sheriff. 'Sounds like you guys need a sheriff to oversee matters,' she said. 'Luckily for you, I know one.' One woman, who lives nearby, said she was 'disgusted'. 'It is despicable that people should parade their sexual escapades in the open. 'The venue is easily accessible to all kinds of hikers even children, and indeed the venue is used as a hiking hostel for youths on occasion,' she said. The weekend, in the shadow of Ystradfellte waterfalls, is being set up by a couple claiming to be called 'Fire and Ice', also known as Ally and Steve, and advertised on a swingers website . The resident claimed the event was being attended by professionals from schoolteachers to social workers. 'I for one wouldn't appreciate my children or indeed any family member depending on people that saw public sex displays as a hobby,' she said. She claims the group have hired a photographer to record the event. 'He is photographing the naked jelly and custard wrestling and selling the photographs,' she added.

"By . Abul Taher . Decca Aitkenhead, 43, was on holiday with partner Tony Wilkinson and their two sons when the accident happened . A leading writer watched helplessly as her partner drowned trying to rescue their four-year-old son after he was swept out to sea. Decca Aitkenhead, an award- winning journalist and author, was on holiday with Tony Wilkinson and their two young sons when the  accident occurred. The 49-year-old died after becoming caught in a strong current as he tried to help their son Jake, who had been paddling in the sea. Last night, tributes were paid to Mr Wilkinson, an outreach worker with children’s charity Kids  Company. A friend said: ‘He died heroically, as men have done for thousands of years, putting his child’s life before his own – it was the measure of him.’ The family had been staying at Treasure Beach on the south coast of Jamaica, which has six miles of uninterrupted sandy beaches. They had gone for a walk along Calabash Bay when Jake waded  into the water to paddle but was quickly pulled under the water by hidden currents. Mr Wilkinson, who was described as ‘incredibly fit and strong,’ ran after Jake, but was caught in a powerful undertow and swept away. It is understood Miss Aitkenhead, 43, a journalist with the Guardian, also rushed into the water and managed to grab Jake before getting into difficulties. The pair were later rescued by local fishermen. The couple also have a three- year-old son, Joe. Camila Batmanghelidjh, who founded Kids Company, which helps around 36,000 vulnerable children across London and Bristol each year, said: ‘Tony was absolutely brilliant, fearless and brilliant. ‘He was passionate about children’s education and facilitating children who would not otherwise have had a chance because they  come from disadvantaged backgrounds to have a genuine access  to education.’ She said that since joining the charity in 2011, his work had mostly centred around helping teenagers involved in gangs, . ‘I am talking about children who have witnessed shooting and stabbings, and who have had threats made to their lives, and who are even psychiatrically ill. Family staying at Treasure Beach (pictured) on south coast of Jamaica which has six miles of sandy beaches . ‘They are very high-risk, and Tony was working with them. Of course there was risk to his life, but he was devoted to the children. ‘Once there were two kids who were psychiatrically ill and who had to be hospitalised. Tony was crying for them, saying they were being kept in such appalling conditions. This is how he was. ‘My most fond memory of him was his energy. When he was talking to you, it was like keeping up with  a racing car.’ She also revealed she has spoken to Miss Aitkenhead since the accident, which happened at 8.30 am on Thursday. ‘Decca is in deep shock at the moment. That’s as much as I can tell you,’ she added. ‘We are looking at ways to celebrate his life. ‘He was absolutely besotted with his children. He was absolutely devoted to them, that I know.’ Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger paid tribute on Twitter yesterday saying: ‘All thoughts with Decca Aitkenhead after her partner, Tony Wilkinson, drowned on holiday.’ Before his employment at the charity, Mr Wilkinson – who also has a 15-year-old daughter, Hero, from a previous relationship – ran an organic deli in Hackney, East London. Miss Aitkenhead won Interviewer of the Year at the British Press Awards in 2009 and wrote a book about living in a Jamaican fishing village in 2000. Last night, the Foreign Office said it was aware of the incident and  was providing the family with consular assistance.","Decca Aitkenhead was on holiday with partner and their two young children .

Emmerdale star David Easter has been questioned by police over an alleged rape, it has been revealed. The 54-year-old actor, who is the former husband of Loose Women presenter Denise Welch, was accused of carrying out the sex assault 17 years ago by a woman in her 40s. The woman reportedly saw him on the ITV soap last December, before naming him as her alleged attacker.

However, he denies the allegations and has not been arrested, according to The Sun.

She saw him on Emmerdale and decided to make the complaint.' He also stressed that the complaint had nothing to do with the Met Police's Operation Yewtree, which was launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Speaking at his house in West London yesterday, Mr Easter told reporters he had 'no comment to make'. The father of two, who lives with his long-term partner and five-year-old son in Hanwell, West London, appeared as businessman Mr Keane in Emmerdale until last December.

"By . Leon Watson . Anthony Nickerson, 48, pictured arriving at Bradford Crown Court, was jailed for two-and-a-half years for transferring and concealing half of the stolen cash . A newsagent jailed for his part in a £2.3 million fraud delivered papers in a £50,000 Mercedes, it emerged today. Anthony Nickerson and his wife Julie, 55, from Shelf, West Yorkshire, funded years of living the high life by stealing millions from her laundry company employers. The 48-year-old then laundered just under half of the cash by transferring and concealing it through a newsagent business he owned. The pair spent the cash on lavish luxury holidays, a house worth half a million pounds which came complete with five acres of land, a hot spring and swimming pool and a fleet of Mercedes cars. For years locals were left scratching . their heads as to how Mr Nickerson - Britain's most well-heeled paper . 'boy' - could afford a Merc with the registration number 'News'. The couple also splashed £17,000 on film memorabilia from Christie's Auction House in London and spent a further £10,000 on motorsport events at Silverstone. Last month, Mr Nickerson admitted transferring and concealing just under £925,000 between July 2009 and December 2012. In December last year, his wife pleaded guilty to stealing £2.3 million from JLA Ltd between 2005 and December 2012 after she was made redundant. Mrs Nickerson, who worked in the accounts and finance department at the firm in Halifax, West Yorkshire, was jailed at Bradford Crown Court today for five years. Her husband received a two-and-a-half year prison sentence. A customer outside the couple's former shop in Shelf, near Halifax, West Yorkshire, told the Daily Star Sunday: 'It was a standing joke in the village about all the money they had. 'He used to nip about delivering the papers in his fancy Merc with its private reg. That's when he was in the country because he always seemed to be on holiday. 'They had this massive farmhouse and I used to say to the wife they must be making a pretty penny from that shop. Now we know where it all came from - she had her hand in the till at work.' Nickerson, who worked as an employee . at the firm which supplies commercial laundry equipment between 1990 and . 2012, stole the cash over a seven-year period beginning in 2005. She also admitted money laundering and fraud in relation to a false representation made to HM Revenue and Customs. Julie Nickerson, left, was jailed at Bradford . Crown Court for stealing £2.3m from her former employers. Her . husband Anthony, right, was jailed for two-and-a-half years for helping . to launder nearly half of the cash . The pair spent the cash on lavish luxury holidays, a house worth half a million pounds which came complete with five acres of land, a hot spring and swimming pool, pictured, and a fleet of Mercedes cars . The court heard her husband turned a blind eye to his wife's dishonesty, and was told by the judge 'you helped her' with a theft 'in breach of trust'. Recorder Anthony Hawks told Mrs Nickerson, who sobbed as the sentence was read out: 'You have taken in excess of £2m. You and your husband didn't need that money. 'There was no pressing need for the money for an operation or a sick family member. You were comfortably off. 'What you did was to embark on an orgy of greed and self-indulgence which only came to a head when you were made redundant. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle. You took holidays that other people could only dream of. You spent thousands of pounds of sports memorabilia. You bought expensive vehicles. The list goes on. 'The aggravating feature is that you also covered it all up when the Inland Revenue discovered your affairs.'","Locals couldn't believe newsagent could afford car with reg number 'News'

"By . Abul Taher . A judge has slammed a council for removing an elderly woman from her home while the son who cared for her was out. It took the son 19 days to get the council to tell him where they had taken his mother, and only after he resorted to legal threats. District Judge Paul Mort described Milton Keynes Council’s treatment of the 81-year-old woman, a former magistrate with severe dementia, as ‘woefully inadequate’. District Judge Paul Mort described Milton Keynes Council's treatment of the 81-year-old woman, a former magistrate with severe dementia, as 'woefully inadequate' The council’s social services staff removed the woman and put her in a care home as they thought she may have been abused by her son, who lived with her. But their own inquiries and a subsequent police investigation found no evidence. Judge Mort said the manner in which the social services removed the woman without getting the correct court orders violated her human rights, and described it as ‘unlawful detainment’. He also said she now has little prospect of being able to return to her home. The council has since agreed to apologise to the woman and her son for its ‘failings’. The details emerged in a ruling made by the judge at the Court of Protection, which deals with cases involving sick and vulnerable people. He ordered that the woman and  her son could not be identified. The woman, a magistrate for 20 years, was described as ‘very independent’. She went to church every Sunday as well as to Bible classes. The judge said the woman had lived at her house for 32 years and was rooted in her local community. Her son sold his business abroad so he and his partner, along with a care worker he employed, could look after her. The judge said that in September 2012 the manager of a care centre the woman attended had raised concerns about bruises and scratches on her face and legs. A month later, a visiting student social worker saw more injuries and alerted her bosses. The details emerged in a ruling made by the judge at the Court of Protection, based at The Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand, London, which deals with cases involving sick and vulnerable people . The same day, the social worker and a colleague visited again while only the care worker was there and removed the woman. The son found out where his mother was after his solicitor wrote to Milton Keynes Council threatening legal action. The son described to The Mail on Sunday yesterday how he returned home to find his mother gone. He said: ‘The care worker said to me, “The council have taken her to a place of safety.” ‘I thought you need a warrant to enter someone’s house, but they  just came and took her away.’ He said it was possible that because the care worker was foreign, she did not understand the sort of rights Britons might expect. He also said he was eventually given access to his mother at the care home, but under severe restrictions. ‘I was only allowed to visit her in the afternoons, and a staff member sat with us,’ he said. Judge Mort lifted council restrictions that prevented the son from seeing his mother without being monitored by social workers. He can  now see her as many times as he likes and take her out. The ruling also gives the son grounds to make further appeals to bring his mother home. Milton Keynes Council could not be contacted for comment.","Judge slammed Milton Keynes Council's treatment of 81-year-old woman .

"By . Simon Watkins . Warning: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that the UK must build new houses to avoid boom and bust . The Governor of the Bank of England has issued a stark warning that the booming housing market is now the biggest single threat to the economy – and said that the country must build more houses if it wants to avoid further catastrophic boom-and-bust cycles. Mark Carney said not enough homes were being constructed to meet demand, and that there were signs that an increasing number of buyers were beginning to borrow heavily again. His warning comes as house  prices soar in some parts of Britain – although in other areas they remain stagnant. Mr Carney said: ‘The biggest  risk to financial stability, and therefore to the durability of the expansion – those risks centre in the housing market, and that’s why we are focused on that.’ Contrasting Britain with his native Canada, he added: ‘The issues around the housing market in  the UK… [are] that there are not sufficient houses built in the UK. ‘[There are] half as many people in Canada as in the UK, [but] twice as many houses are built in Canada every year than in the UK.’ Official figures show 112,000 homes were constructed in England in the 12 months to March and that the number of new properties being started is rising. But the figure is still far below the 177,000 houses built in 2007. Mr Carney – who issued the warning in an interview with Sky News’s Dermot Murnaghan, to be broadcast today – also revealed there was a risk that home buyers are borrowing heavily once again, with signs that loans of four times a person’s salary or more were starting to increase. ‘We don’t want to build up another big debt overhang that is going to hurt individuals and is very much going to slow the economy in the medium term,’ he said. ‘We would be concerned if there were rapid increases in high  loan-to-value mortgages across the banks... we’ve seen that creeping  up and it’s something that we are watching closely.’ The Bank of England has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent, despite pleas from some economists that action is needed to calm the bubble emerging in some regions. Bubble: Economists have urged the Bank of England to raise interest rates to calm the market . Last week, Mr Carney said the Bank judged the economy was still fragile and indicated rate rises were unlikely in  the near future. When they came they would be ‘limited’: ‘The recovery is neither balanced nor sustainable,’ he said. The Bank is widely expected to use tools other than an interest- rate rise to stem excessive borrowing. Under new powers granted to it as part of an overhaul of financial regulation, it could require banks to set aside more capital reserves against home loans or tighten rules on lending. The Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, which is chaired by the Governor and is in charge of the stability of the financial system, is expected to outline how it might use those powers next month.","Governor Mark Carney said UK must build more homes to meet demand .

"By . Simon Danczuk . There's an old adage that opposition parties don’t win elections, governments lose them. It’s a crutch that’s easy to lean on for those who subscribe to what’s becoming an ever more cautious approach to politics. But parties rarely walk into Downing Street by default. You have to earn your right to govern. You can’t simply freewheel into No 10. You have to break the door down with a battering ram. Recent polls showing a Tory resurgence are a timely reminder that Labour won’t win by fighting defensively and dodging punches. It’s time  we came out swinging. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, right, believes leader Ed Miliband, left, needs to move away from his 'comfort zone' if the party is to win the next general election . For far too long, we’ve relied on the unpopularity and incompetence of this Government rather than focusing on our performance and offering solutions to the nation’s problems. It was foolish to think that could carry on for ever. Sooner or later the Tories were always going to get their act together. Now we need to up our game. The polls show that Labour’s message isn’t hitting home. We’ve become too comfortable with talking to ourselves, with policy announced through  set-piece speeches as though  in a university lecture. Some in the party view politics as an intellectual pursuit; it’s not,  it’s a monumental struggle  to win hearts and minds. At this stage in the electoral cycle there’s no point in just harping on about the Government’s failings and  it’s too late to rely on negative campaigning alone. Mapping out a vision for a better Britain, however, won’t be achieved by just setting off  a few fireworks or coming up with some catchy slogans. It has to be part of a conversation that addresses people’s doubts. And it has to reach out beyond Labour’s core vote. We won’t win a General Election by campaigning excessively on food banks and the bedroom tax. Labour has to offer a route out of poverty and unfulfilled potential. Continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer.  We have to start speaking the language of aspiration. Britain needs a Government with a convincing mandate to introduce the big changes that are required. But Labour can’t achieve that with the core vote and a few disgruntled Liberals. That’s a suicidal strategy. Mr Danczuk said too many people in the Labour Party view the business of politics as 'an intellectual pursuit' rather than a 'monumental struggle' UKIP has proved that there’s a rich seam of despairing voters out there. They’ve been ignored for far too long and Labour has to show it’s willing to listen. It’s daft to characterise UKIP voters as disaffected loons, because many are simply working-class people tired of the three main parties. A lot are Labour people and we need to work hard to get them back. There are still many in the party who think we have a right to govern. Some have mostly known Labour victories, which makes it easy for them to dismiss the 2010 Election as an aberration. New MPs such as myself know all too well there is no easy way back into power. The latest polls are a wake-up call. But we should be under no illusion. Time is running out and if we don’t have a strong showing in the European and local elections this week then things will need to change. Labour doesn’t need to panic – yet. But more of the same won’t cut it. Earning the trust of the public is hard and there are no short cuts. Between now and election day there are many questions the electorate want answering. We can’t leave them unanswered. From now on all signs need to point away from our comfort zone.","Labour needs 'a battering ram' if it wants to win the next General Election .

"Harriet Green . By . Sophie Jane Evans . Businesswoman: New mothers should limit the amount of maternity leave they take, claims Harriet Green, the chief executive of Thomas Cook . New mothers should limit the amount of maternity leave they take - or face losing confidence in the workplace, a top UK businesswoman has claimed. Harriet Green OBE, the chief executive of Thomas Cook, spoke out against a year's maternity leave, which all working mothers are entitled to under government regulations. The 52-year-old claimed mothers who are out of the workplace lose confidence 'very fast' - and also urged women to 'make choices' instead of trying to achieve perfection in all areas of their life. Speaking to The Times, Ms Green said: 'You need to get the balance right, you can take it too far. It may have gone a little too far in terms of some of the pressures. 'For me, a year [of maternity leave] feels a little long. Women out of the workplace lose confidence very fast. 'What I would do if I were prime minister is give a set number of weeks and allow the family to decide, male and female, how they divvy it up.' Ms Green, who is married with stepchildren, but none of her own, was appointed to the travel firm in 2012 and is one of the few women in Britain to lead a FTSE 250 company. She was awarded the job after cold-calling chairman Frank Meysman to tell him she was the right person to lead the recovery of the world’s oldest travel business. Since then, she has taken Thomas Cook from the brink of collapse to a thriving company which is worth £2.5billion - a staggering 1,250 per cent rise in less than two years. Last year, Ms Green, who sits on the prime minister's business advisory group, was paid £2.4million, including a £1.7million bonus. During the interview, the businesswoman . said she believed that women should be more pushy in applying for jobs because 'What's the worst that can . happen?' Criticism: The 52-year-old spoke out against a year's maternity leave, which all working mothers are entitled to under government regulations. She said: 'Women out of the workplace lose confidence very fast' (file photo) But she added that they should not strive to be perfect at work, home and in their social life - and should, instead, try to 'make choices' based on their strengths and desires. She also said that school term dates need to be changed so parents can afford to take . their children on holiday, sexism in the boardroom is yet to be conquered and companies should be as diverse in age, background and education as their customers. Last night, Sharon Hodgson, the shadow . minister for women and equalities, condemned Ms Green's claims . that mothers should restrict their maternity leave. Award-winning: Ms Green, who was awarded the Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year award (left) on Monday, also urged women to 'make choices' instead of trying to achieve perfection in all areas of their life . She deemed the remarks 'unfortunate', particularly considering the businesswoman's success in increasing equality at the top of a big UK firm. It comes just days after Ms Green was awarded the Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year award for her role in Thomas Cook's transformation.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A teenager whose arm was severed below the elbow as he cleaned a restaurant pasta machine has had the limb successfully reattached. Brett Bouchard, 17, is able to move his right arm again less than three weeks after his accident at Violi's Restaurant in Massena, New York, on the Canadian border, where he worked in the kitchen. So far, Bouchard has undergone four surgeries at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Lucky: 17-year-old Brett Bouchard had his arm re-attached after it was severed in a freak, pasta-maker accident . Reattached: This x-ray image of Bouchard's arm shows how doctors reattached the fractured bones . Doctors say his quick decision to apply a tourniquet and recover the lost limb have helped his recovery. 'I’m feeling great,' Bouchard told reporters assembled at his hospital bedside Friday, according to ABC News. 'Every single day, just focused on my recovery and getting better.' Bouchard will need still more surgeries to transfer new muscles to his hand. But he's confident he'll be able to regrow the nerves in his lower arm and regain his sense of touch. 'Horrific' accident: Brett Bouchard's arm was severed when a spaghetti-maker was turned on as he was cleaning it . The incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. on April 27, when Bouchard was cleaning the pasta-maker at Violi's. Bouchard's right arm got caught in the industrial-size machine and was severed at the elbow. Bouchard was rushed to Massena Memorial Hospital before being air-lifted to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, about 350 miles away. According to the Watertown Daily Times, a supervisor at Massena Memorial tried to have Bouchard taken to the Fletcher Allen Health Center in Burlington, Vermont - which is more than 200 miles closer to Massena than Massachusetts General - but the hospital would not accept Bouchard. Bouchard had reportedly worked at Violi's Italian restaurant for a little over a year . 'We’re all still in shock. One of our employees severed his arm last . night,' Ross Violi, who owns the restaurant with his brother Dominic, told the paper. Restaurant employees are still trying to figure out how the machine was turned on while Bouchard was cleaning it. The U.S. Department of Labor currently is investigating the incident, as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is trying to determine whether cleaning the pasta-maker constitutes as 'operating' the machine - in which case, the restaurant might have been in violation of labor codes because Bouchard is 17. Federal labor guidelines state that to operate certain pieces of industrial equipment, the operator needs to be at least 18 years old. It's unclear whether an industrial pasta maker falls under those guidelines. Bouchard says he's just excited for things to start getting back to normal - and to get some feeling back in his hand. 'He’s not going to be a piano player, but he should have some function and feeling and that’s the goal,' his mother said.

"By . Martin Beckford . A taxpayer-funded hotline to help the unemployed get back to work is unstaffed for hours every day – because its own advisers have been made redundant. Bosses at the National Careers Service reduced the hours that remaining staff were available  by more than a quarter after job cuts – but still advertised the helpline as open for longer. Then other staff were told to lie to callers about why they couldn’t get through to an expert – claiming ‘all our advisers are busy’ when in fact there was nobody there. No one's here: The helpline's website claims advisers are on hand to take calls from 8am until 10pm (file picture) The helpline’s website claims advisers are on hand to take calls from 8am until 10pm, seven days a week. But The Mail on Sunday has discovered that staff are there to field queries only from 9am to 8pm on weekdays and 10am to 6pm on weekends – a total of 71 hours a week instead of 98. Last night the company that runs the helpline, Broadcasting Support Services (BSS), which is paid by Government quango the Skills Funding Agency, was facing serious questions following this newspaper’s revelations. BSS could face a financial penalty for breaching its contract over the performance of the service, for which it was paid £8.6 million in public money last year and £10.4 million the year before. A spokesman for Vince Cable’s Department for Business said: ‘We are very concerned about these allegations and have instructed the Skills Funding Agency to urgently investigate. ‘If there is evidence of wrongdoing, swift action will be taken.’ Accusation: A spokesman for Vince Cable's Department for Business expressed concern about the allegations . Staff at BSS feel they are ‘part of a deception’ leaving taxpayers’ money mis-spent. One insider said: . ‘I think the public would be angry and shocked by this. Not only is it a deception, it’s misusing public funds.’ Callers to the free phone line first speak to a ‘frontline adviser’. The call is then transferred to a qualified careers adviser for an in-depth talk. During normal office hours, there could be up to a dozen available. But a year ago, ten of these advisers, who were paid about £28,000 a year, took voluntary redundancy in an apparent money-saving plan. BSS bosses then dramatically reduced the hours that the remaining advisers worked – and insisted that no one let callers or Government officials find out. An internal email from operations co-ordinator Jonathan Morris said: ‘From Monday June 3 [2013] we will be reducing the careers adviser operating hours.’ A separate message from manager Ian Howard explained: ‘This will obviously mean there are occasions when there are no  CAs [careers advisers] available. Can I ask that you please don’t make any changes to what you say to customers. ‘The official line is still, “There are no CAs available at the moment.” Please don’t give out  the new CA opening times.’ The Skills Funding Agency – which can listen in to calls and visit BSS offices – has also been kept in the dark about the cuts. A BSS spokesman said: ‘The senior management team at BSS are conducting a full investigation.’","Taxpayer funded Broadcasting Support Services is paid for by .

"By . Freya Noble . The extreme weather Australia has been facing in recent years could be having a detrimental effect on honey supplies. Due to a combination of bushfires and severe drought the country's bee population is down 30 per cent, forcing honey producers to put exports on hold and leave supermarkets in short supply. Ben McKee, managing director of Capilano Honey, told the Sydney Morning Herald that prices are on the rise due to the shortage but that was not a solution for the dwindling supplies. 'Honey prices have increased but there is no great result...because honey is physically not being produced. It doesn't exist. You can't buy what doesn't exist.' Hone supplies are short due to sharp decreases in the bee population caused by extreme weather . Internationally, Capilano has imported honey from Argentina, Canada, China, and Europe to cover their demand, and downsized their packages back home according to the publication. Beechworth Honey is also reportedly forecasting a significant decline in their figures, pulling their products from shelves in China before Christmas last year. The company's owner and director, Jodie Goldsworthy, told the Herald without bees our food choices would shrink to 'some grains, fish and grapes, that's about it'. The intensity of last summers heatwaves combined with the volume of flower blossoms declining is to be blamed for the shortage. Capilano Honey has put some of it's exports on hold and is being forced to source product internationally . Globally, a similar trend is occurring, though shrinking honey supplies is just the tip of the iceberg. Honeybees are the world's leading and most important pollinators, and are depended upon for at least a third of the world's food supply. Beekeepers in the United States and across Europe have reported similar declines with annual hive losses of around 30 percent or higher over the past decade. The loss of bees around the world is being called the Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder, and in the US the Agriculture Department is funding research on bee disease to try and halt the disappearance and unexplained death of these vital insects. Honeybee populations are declining by around 30 percent worldwide which could have detrimental effects on the world's food supply .","Capilano Honey halting exports and struggling to fill supermarket orders .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . In a knitted tank top, wellies and trilby, the presenter of a gardening show for toddlers might at first glance seem more weed than sex symbol. But Ben Faulks, who appears in a shed full of talking vegetables on the CBeebies channel, has gained an army of admirers among the mothers of his young fans. And when they got a chance to learn more about the actor and his show Mr Bloom’s Nursery, their questions soon became unsuitable for children. Scroll down for video . Mr Bloom's Nursery: Ben Faulks has gained an army of admirers among the mothers of his young fans . As the green-fingered chat started to turn the air blue, with several women using gardening terminology to make lewd suggestions, the BBC had to step in and clean up the online interview. One mum begged Mr Bloom to ‘feel my melons’ to ‘see if they’re firm’. In total, staff had to delete about 20 of the rudest comments from the CBeebies Facebook page in case they were seen by young viewers. A spokesman for CBeebies – the BBC’s channel for under-sixes – told The Mail on Sunday:  ‘A small number of personal or inappropriate comments about one of our CBeebies presenters were removed by moderators.’ Turning the air blue: Several women used gardening terminology to make lewd suggestions . But some comments remain, including requests for Mr Bloom to ‘come round and do my garden’. The adult nature of the questions was remarked upon by other users, including a father who wrote: . ‘I’m awfully glad my kids aren’t old enough to read these posts!’ In each episode Mr Bloom meets a group of youngsters and teaches them about planting seeds, making compost and trying new foods. CBeebies started the chat on Wednesday, posting: ‘What would you most like to ask Ben about life as CBeebies’ best-known gardener?’ Louise Robson wrote: ‘Can’t say anything that I would like to on a children’s site haha xx lush!’, while Kate Ellerby said: ‘I don’t think my questions would be allowed.’ The 35-year-old actor, who is married with three children, also received marriage proposals. Only a few of the 200-plus posts were serious queries about the show. Last night Mr Faulks said he hadn’t seen the lewd remarks and remains bemused by his status as the ‘sex god of CBeebies’, which sees him receiving Valentine cards and knitted vegetables from adoring mums. ‘It’s just really nice that the show is popular,’ he said.","CBeebies presenter Ben Faulks has built up an army of .

"By . Tara Brady . Mrs Williams stepped in front of the car with her lollipop sign to take the impact and tried to push five children out of the way . A lollipop lady who used her body as a human shield to protect children from out of control car has branded the driver's punishment as pathetic after he was fined just £100. Robert Bell, 62, drove at Karin Williams who used her body to save children as the car hurtled towards her. Mrs Williams, 50, stepped in front of the car with her lollipop sign to take the impact and tried to push five children out of the way. Bell, who was driving in a pair of flip flops, blamed a coughing fit for the accident outside the primary school in the village of Rhoose, near Cardiff. But the retired computer consultant was found guilty of driving without due care and attention after a three-day hearing at Cardiff magistrates court. District Judge Bodfan Jenkins told him: 'You were having a coughing fit and you did not deal with it properly as a driver ought to. 'You got your foot not where you intended on the brake but put it on the throttle. 'It was a misjudgement at low speed and a loss of control with horrendous consequences. 'This is a tragic case, more for those injured than yourself. 'The tragedy is something you will have to live with through a momentary lapse of concentration and misjudgement.' But Mrs Williams has branded the punishment 'pathetic'. She told the Daily Mirror: 'I can't believe he has been fined only £100. 'After everything he has put me through and the children through, it is simply pathetic.' Bell, of Fontygarry, Vale of Glamorgan, was fined £100 with a £20 victim surcharge and court costs of £1,130. Karin Williams who used her body as a human shield to protect children from an out of control car . He had four points put on his licence. Bell's fine was based on his pension of £110-a-week. The court heard there are civil proceedings pending over the incident. Bell blamed a coughing fit for the incident outside the primary school in the village of Rhoose, near Cardiff . Bell's black Audi A3 car flipped over on a bollard during the school run one morning last June. Karin . took the full force of the crash and was left with broken legs, elbow, . shoulder and ribs in the crash outside the school gates. Four girls and a boy under the age of ten were also injured along with three adults who were walking them to school. The court heard his car sent young children 'cartwheeling through the air'. Married mother-of-one Karin - a lollipop lady for ten years - told how she heard a 'revving noise' and saw Bell gripping the wheel with his eyes wide open seconds before the crash. She said: 'I was at the crossing when all of a sudden I looked to my left and I saw a dark car coming towards me at speed. 'It was on the wrong side of the road and collided with a bollard. It was very close to me. 'I remember seeing the driver's eyes were wide open and gripping his hands tight on the steering wheel. It was all happening so fast. 'I was shouting something to warn the kids and moved in their direction out of instinct. 'The next thing I remember is being underneath the car and feeling a sharp pain.' Karin spent ten weeks in hospital recovering from her injuries. One . girl aged ten spent three days on a life support machine and has . undergone a series of operations. She still does not have use of her . left arm. Bell's lawyer David James told the court: 'This is something that has weighed heavily on his shoulders since it happened.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . It was a day after his high school graduation in June 1987 when then-budding photographer Michael Galinsky picked up his camera and traveled to downtown Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to photograph a Ku Klux Klan rally. Galinsky, who went on to become a prominent documentarian and photographer, recently stumbled upon a cache of his black-and-white photos showing men and women wearing robes emblazoned with crosses  and KKK insignia, and angry protesters urging them to get out. Galinsky, who runs the Brooklyn-based Rumur multimedia studio, decided to dust off his old prints and release them online on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court decision that put an end to school segregation in the U.S. Long-forgotten march: A day after Michael Galinsky graduate high school in 1987, he went to downtown Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to photograph a KKK parade . Dark knights: some 40 Klensmen in point white hats and robes embalazoned with insignia descended on Chapel Hill June 15, 1987 . Blast from the past: Galinsky, who went on to a successful career as a filmmaker and photographer came up a box of negatives from the 1987 event just days before the 60th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision . Face-off: the sight of men and women dressed in Klan robes and carrying Confederate flags sparked rage in bystanders . In Galinsky's stark photos, . participants of the march are seen walking down the street in Chapel . Hill in cone-shaped hats and waving Confederate flags. In . a blog post on Rumur’s website Friday, Galinsky wrote that he has not . thought of the KKK event for nearly 30 years, but looking at the . negatives served a vivid reminder of that long-forgotten day. The Associated Press reported at the time that the some 40 Klansmen took part in the demonstration held June 15, 1987 in Chapel Hill. Some of the marchers came to the event armed with rifles and knives, landing them in jail on weapons charges. Members . of the notorious white supremacy group were met by about 2,000 . protesters who lined the parade route and heckled them, holding signs . calling the marchers ‘racist pigs’ and telling them to go home. The . son of civil rights activists from the North East, Galinsky wrote that . he was not acutely aware of race or racism growing up in Chapel Hill in . the decades after the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling. Backlash: Some 2,000 residents welcomed members of the KKK with angry signs telling them to get out . Armed and dangerous: Some of the marchers came to the event armed with rifles and knives, landing them in jail on weapons charges . Strong impression: Seeing a noose hanging in a car on the parade route left Galinsky shocked and nervous . Deep-seated bigotry: The rally took place more than 30 years after the 1954 Supreme Court ruling ending segregation in American schools . ‘I wasn’t aware that the Klan even still existed until they decided to . march in Chapel Hill the day after my high school graduation in 1987,’ Galinsky stated in his post. Looking . back on that day, Galinsky recalled that seeing a noose hanging inside a . car served as a reality check for him, leaving the newly minted . high school graduate feeling shocked and nervous for his own safety. The . plan put forward by local religious leaders was for the Klensmen to . march down an empty street because it was believed that actively . protesting the event would give the hate group credence. But hundreds of people came out anyway armed with placards to show their opposition to the KKK's intolerant ideology. Galinsky explained that he was there because it was the first newsworthy event for him to photograph. Failed plan: Local religious leaders encouraged residents to stay away from the march so as not to give the Klensmen any credence, but many people came out to protest against them . Sheltered childhood: Galinsky, the son of civil rights activists, admitted that he was not acutely aware of racism until he entered junior high school . Unpleasant surprise: The filmmaker recently moved back to Chapel Hill and was surprised by how entrenched social segregation remained in the college town . The filmmaker added that having recently moved back to Chapel Hill from Brooklyn, he was taken aback by how entrenched social segregation remained in the college town of 57,000. ‘We can all look back and be proud of what we have achieved in terms of limiting overt discrimination,' he wrote. ‘However, if we look around and see that there is a lot of work to be done to bring true equality and justice to our country…. Let’s let this day be a reminder that we still have a long way to go.‘ .","Filmmaker and photographer Michale Galinsky photographed KKK parade June 15, 1987, a day after his high school graduation .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Walked free: Sardar Khan, 20, befriended his 15-year-old victim during her trips to his sweet store . A sweet shop boss who groped a teenage girl has walked free from court. Sardar Khan, 20, befriended his 15-year-old victim in 2012 during her trips to his store - Khan's Late Shop. The relationship escalated from him . chatting to the girl, who was a customer, to hugging and touching. One day, Khan, who was 18 at the time, led the girl into the back of the shop in Stretford, Greater Manchester, and forcibly groped her. But on Friday he walked free from Minshull Street Crown Court - despite being found guilty of sexual assault. Judge Leslie Hull told him: 'The . impact on your victim has been significant. She now finds it hard to . concentrate on other things in her life. 'But it is apparent you are generally a hard-working and diligent man and I take that into account.' Khan was arrested after the victim told a police officer at school, but he pleaded not guilty to the offence, and three other charges, when it came to court in March this year. He was acquitted of three offences but found guilty of one count of sexual assault after a trial. Sentencing, Judge Hull ordered Khan to complete 120 hours of unpaid work and put him on probation for 12 months. Khan is also banned from working with children for the next 10 years and must sign the sex offender's register for five years. After the case, the father of Khan's victim slammed the sentence - saying he should have been jailed. He . said: 'To see him walk free is upsetting. I think any sexual predator . like that should be locked up. I just want to know why he picked my . daughter and her alone? The judge at Minshull Street Crown Court said Khan's actions significantly affected the victim . 'Before it she was such a happy and friendly girl, she would do anything for anyone. But now she is much more reserved.' Allan Armbrister, defending, said since the offence Khan had settled down with a wife. The girl, now 17 and who cannot be named for legal reasons, is studying at college. She said: 'It was scary at the time because I didn't know what to do or if anyone would believe me. I find it hard to sleep and concentrate as I can't stop thinking about it.'","Sardar Khan, 20, befriended 15-year-old customer in Stretford store .

"By . Nick Craven . Untrue slur: Kenny Marshall is consulting his lawyers about the insult which appeared in email newsletter . With its £4,000 joining fee and strict rules on dress and etiquette, Wimbledon Park Golf Club prides itself on its highly respectable image. So the well-heeled members of the South-West London club were left in shock last week when they received the results of its annual Pro-Am competition, conveniently delivered in an emailed newsletter. The winner for the best performance on the 17th hole – the club’s six-times champion Kenny Marshall – was listed as: ‘Kenny Marshall (CHEATING ****)’. Unsurprisingly, who was responsible for inserting the untrue and offensive accusation is now the talk of the club bar, where members include television stars Ant and Dec, Ainsley Harriott and Ben Shephard. Mr Marshall, 51, part-owner of a multi-million-pound wholesale grocery business, is now consulting his lawyers about the astonishing slur. And an internal investigation has been launched at the club, where the atmosphere is now said to be ‘toxic’. When asked by The Mail on Sunday this week how the newsletter’s results could have been circulated with such an offensive addition, general manager Patrick Shanahan refused to comment. ‘There’s absolutely nothing I can say about this,’ he said, even when asked if the club had apologised to Mr Marshall. It is the second scandal to rock the picturesque golf club in the past 12 months – with both incidents involving Mr Marshall. A bitter row erupted last year when he sued fellow member Jeff Clargo for libel. Mr Clargo, 61, had branded wholesale grocer Mr Marshall an ‘odious and foul-mouthed cheat’ in an email sent to members of the club. Mr Marshall said he had been compared to the ‘despicable and villainous’ Goldfinger, from the 1964 James Bond film in which Goldfinger tries to cheat on the golf course against 007. Mr Clargo, a retired kitchen firm director, was temporarily suspended over the email and the libel action was recently settled out of court. Mr Marshall says he has received a ‘full apology’. Wimbledon Golf Club has television star members including Ant and Dec, Ainsley Harriott and Ben Shephard . Mr Clargo is denying involvement in the new slur against Marshall. ‘This latest incident has nothing to do with me. There is no ongoing dispute,’ he said yesterday. Mr Marshall, who won the section of the Pro-Am by landing his ball closest to the 17th hole with two shots, said he had read the offending newsletter but could not comment further.","Members shocked when results of annual Pro-Am competition were sent .

But now, ex-Corrie actress Julie Goodyear has been involved in an off-screen conflict after a rogue fly-tipper dumped 10,000 tonnes of rubbish on her farm.

"By . Tara Brady . Erin Gray started limping in May 2012 but doctors said it was because she had flat feet . A mother was repeatedly told her six-year-old daughter had 'flat feet' by doctors when in fact she had cancer. Erin Gray started limping in May 2012 but doctors initially told her parents Lorraine, 49, and Richard, 52, it was caused by her flat feet. However, her condition deteriorated and the youngster was left paralysed from the waist down following a dance class in November 2012. After being sent to hospital for blood tests the next day her parents were given the devastating news that she had leukaemia. Mrs Gray, a mother-of-five, said: 'We were absolutely heartbroken. 'It came as a real shock because we'd taken her to the doctors seven times since she started limping and cancer wasn't mentioned. 'At first they thought it was because she is flat footed and then we were told it was in her imagination. 'I wasn't happy with that attitude but I didn't think it would be something as serious as it was. 'Another time we were told it was because she had a scab on her knee where she'd fallen over and she didn't want to bend her leg. 'We thought that maybe it would improve with time so we kept an eye on it for a few months. 'She went on a field trip with the school during the summer and her teacher contacted us and said Erin had really struggled to walk around so we took her back to the doctors.' After being referred to hospital by her GP, on November 7, 2012, Erin was diagnosed with Perthes' Disease, a condition at the top of the thigh bone which causes it to soften and break down. Mrs Gray, who works for the Royal British Legion, said: 'We were quite positive, and we even said it was life changing, but not life threatening. 'The worst case scenario was that she would need a hip replacement when she was 40.' Fighter: Erin Gray was sent to hospital for blood tests but her parents were told she had leukaemia . However, Erin, who is now seven, soon became lethargic and was experiencing terrible night sweats - so doctors diagnosed a virus. Mrs Gray said: 'She was coming home from school and would curl up on the sofa with a blanket.'She didn't want to play either and it was very out of character. 'She seemed to find everything really exhausting and she was so pale. Erin Gray has had chemotherapy every day at home as well as intravenously every four weeks, which leaves her feeling lethargic . 'The doctor told us she probably just had a virus and she'd soon get better.' In December 2012, Erin could barely walk after a dance exam so her parents took her back to her GP. 'She kept asking us to carry her because her legs wouldn't work and she was paralysed from the waist down,' said Mrs Gray. Since her diagnosis, Erin proved herself a fighter and took to the chemotherapy so well she was able to return to school the following March .

'I just burst into tears.' Since her diagnosis, Erin, from Wesham, Lancashire, proved herself a fighter and took to the chemotherapy so well she was able to return to school the following March. She still has to have a full blood transfusion every six weeks, and has chemotherapy every day at home as well as intravenously every four weeks, which leaves her feeling lethargic. She will come off chemotherapy in just over 40 weeks, and will have check ups at Manchester Children's Hospital for the next three years. Mrs Gray added: 'Erin astounds me.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A teenager has died during his gap year trip in Thailand after falling from a train while he tried to have a sneaky cigarette. Matt Lawlor, 19, described by his father as a 'rising star', is thought to have been standing in the area between two carriages when he fell from the moving train. The teenager, from Bengeo, Hertfordshire, was travelling with friends from Bangkok to Koh Phangan but had stepped outside to smoke because it was banned inside the carriage. Matt Lawlor, 19, fell from a train during his gap year trip in Thailand after sneaking out of the carriage to have a cigarette . His body was found lying in bushes next to the tracks, the day after the incident took place, on May 8. Matt - who was due to return home later this month and had been in Thailand for just five days - was a budding film director who was due to start a film studies degree at Brighton University in September. His father Peter, 59, said: 'He was really quirky, really funny and extremely intelligent. He was a rising star.' Matt had started his gap year adventure in January when he flew to Australia with friend Alex Bartels. They . were originally intending to return to England in July, but Matt had . decided to fly home on May 29 because after becoming homesick. His . parents, who have two other children, had planned to meet their son at . Heathrow airport with his favourite homemade chocolate cake.

"By . Chris Pleasance . The 1812 Overture may have its cannons, but there has never been a symphony quite like the one performed in Spain this week where all the 'music' was provided by roaring farm tractors. The resulting cacophony left audience members baffled and a little deaf after watching 12 diesel behemoths whining, groaning and belching out exhaust smoke for nearly half-an-hour. The tractor symphony was performed in the Spanish city of Valencia and opened the country's oldest festival of contemporary music, which has been running since 1978. Scroll down for video . A symphony written using engine noises from 12 diesel tractors opened a music festival in Valencia, Spain . The half-hour 'musical' number was lead by Swedish conductor Sven-Ake Johansson (pictured) Swede Sven-Ake Johansson conducted the farmyard ensemble like he was standing before violinists and cello players. 'Yes, I am the soloist,' said the driver of one old tractor, a farmer named Hector Latorre. 'There are few tractors like this, and the director likes a lot of noise,' he added. Audience member Mampu Perea Badillo said: 'It was a load of old rubbish. It might appeal to anoraks who like to listen to the different strains of engines, and get their jollies sniffing diesel smoke, but anyone who likes music was left baffled. However, audience members were left unimpressed, with one onlooker calling it 'a load of old rubbish' The festival director said he wanted to break the stereotype that all classical music was 'elitist' 'I think they would have been better opening the festival with a load of half-empty water glasses being played. At least they would have made a tune. This lot sounded like a garage workshop on a bad day.' Joan Cervero, director of the music festival, said: 'We wanted to start this festival breaking the stereotype that the contemporary music is elitist.' Elpido Lopez, clarinettist and also the driver of one of the tractor, said: 'It is an adventure, a new experience.' 'It certainly was,' added Miguel Lopez, another audience member. 'And not one I want to repeat.'","Twelve tractors played symphony and conducted by Sven-Ake Johansson .

"By . Fred Redwood . From Ronnie Biggs to Dick Turpin and from the Krays to Bonnie and Clyde, some villains, regardless  of their horrific crimes, become folk heroes in the eyes of the public. Another such folk hero – or heroine – is Lady Katherine Ferrers, whose supposed deeds as a highwaywoman have been fictionalised in two films, both called The Wicked Lady – the 1945 classic with a bosom-heaving Margaret Lockwood, and  a 1983 remake starring Faye Dunaway. Now the house that is said to have been the base from where the Wicked Lady held up coaches – Cell Park, in Markyate, Hertfordshire – has come on to the market. Wicked house: The 11 bedroom 'home' of legendary Lady Katherine Ferrers, Cell Park, in Markyate, Hertfordshire, will be sold at auction in London this month . Fittingly, even its sale is cloaked in intrigue. It was initially priced at £4 million, and agents Strutt & Parker received an offer of £4.25 million. But to ensure it gets the best price, the Grade II listed manor house is now being put up for auction in London at The Cumberland Hotel, only a stone’s-throw from the start of Watling Street, the long, old Roman road upon which the Wicked Lady is said to have committed her crimes. Katherine Ferrers was born in Hertfordshire in 1634, heir to a considerable fortune, but her father died only six years later. Her mother remarried but died herself two years after Katherine’s father. Katherine ended up being cared for by the family of her stepfather and was married off to his nephew, Thomas Fanshawe, when still only 13; he was 16. The story goes that the marriage was a disaster, with Thomas boring Katherine and things supposedly coming to a head at Cell Park one evening when his sister, whom Katherine detested, came to dinner. Notorious: Lady Katherine Ferrers has been chronicled in two  films, both called The Wicked Lady, in 1945 starring Margaret Lockwood, left, and a 1983 remake starring Faye Dunaway, right . Magnificent: The Grade II listed 11 bedroom manor house in Hertfordshire comes with 79 acres of parkland and two cottages - if you've got a spare £4.25million . The meal over, the sister went home and Katherine made as if to go to bed, but instead climbed through a hidden partition to a secret chamber, pulled on buckskin breeches, cloak, mask and a tricorn hat, and jumped on her black horse to set off for Watling Street, where she robbed her sister-in-law of her jewellery. That was just the start of the legend of the Wicked Lady. Flame-haired, with beautiful green eyes, she is said to have hooked up with Ralph Chaplin, a handsome local farmer by day and a highwayman by night, who brought her the excitement her marriage lacked. Sadly for Katherine, Chaplin was soon caught and hanged, and from then on she became increasingly bloodthirsty – burning houses, slaughtering livestock and even killing a constable. Eventually, she, too, was killed. Having been shot on Nomansland Common near Harpenden, she tried to get back to her secret stairway at Cell Park, but was found dead in a pool of blood at the foot of the east wall of the house the next morning. Dating from 1145, the imposing property was initially a priory for Benedictine nuns before being converted into a manor house in 1539. The Ferrers family took it over in 1547 and it was largely rebuilt in 1825. Long history: The impressive property was initially a priory but was turned into a manor house in 1539 . Although records show that Cell Park was definitely owned by Katherine’s family in  her lifetime, local author and historian John Barber points out that there is no concrete evidence that she ever lived there. In fact, when she died, aged 26, she may have been living in London. Mystery surrounds how the Wicked Lady story developed over the centuries but the tale was the subject of a 1944 novel by Magdalen King-Hall – and that story formed the basis of the first Wicked Lady film the following year. What is certain is that the Fanshawes sold off Katherine’s inheritance and land in 1655, giving her ample motive to go in search of booty. And her view of her husband as a despicable skinflint also has substance: Pepys described Thomas as a ‘rascally fellow, without a penny to his name’. Today, if you stand in Cell Park’s long, curving drive overlooking its 79 acres of parkland, it is easy to imagine thundering horses galloping under a full moon. Inside, the reception rooms are laden with period features.  A Jacobean oak staircase leads upstairs to the 11 bedrooms, and one, in the eastern wing, is said to have been Katherine’s. It was here, in the 1800s, that workmen discovered a secret chamber. Sadly it was empty – they found no tricorn hat, mask or breeches. However, it is still possible to make out the false wall abutting the chimney stack which conceals that hidden chamber. The question remains, why was it built? Cell Park, along  with its two cottages  in 79 acres of parkland, is to be auctioned  by Allsop at The Cumberland Hotel, London, on May 29. The reserve price will not exceed £4.25 million.","The life of Lady Katherine Ferrers was turned into The Wicked Lady films .

"By . Will Payne . and Sara Malm . The biological family of a little girl taken from her foster parents and returned to her jailbird father have branded her adoptive mom and dad, ‘selfish’ for fighting to get her back and vowed never to give her up again. Sonya, aged nine, had been in the care of Kim and David Hodgin, from Dickson, Tennessee for more than seven years, but she was recently handed over to ex-con John McCaul in Omaha, Nebraska. The Hodgin family have released a heart-breaking phone conversation, revealing Sonya’s desperate pleas, begging to be reunited with them. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: David and Kim Hodgin had been caring for Sonya, now nine, since before she was two years old, but were forced to see her forcibly returned to her biological father in January . Sonya, pictured with her adoptive father David Hodgin, has been returned to her biological father who served time in prison for transporting arms . Desperate pleas: The Hodgin family has released heartbreaking phone conversations in which Sonya begs to be reunited with them . And they have claimed the school girl, . ""cried her eyes out"", screaming, ""Please don't let them do this, Daddy, . please, Mama, don't let 'em take me,"" when she was forcibly removed . from them. But a female . relative of McCaul – a convicted felon who served time for transporting . firearms – has hit back at the Hodgins, branding them ""selfish"" and . accusing them of not have the little girl’s best interests at heart. Speaking . from Omaha, Nebraska, the woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘This . is not the way to do things. If you don’t get what you want you . shouldn’t behave like they are. ‘They . are spreading all kinds of dirt about John, but they don’t know him. Sonya should never have been with them in the first place. She wasn’t . treated badly. She’s the most important person in John’s life. ‘His . mother, Sonya’s grandmother, never gave up on her and has been fighting . to get her back all this time. Her real family love her. ‘What . is happening now is not in the best interests of the child. They are . foster parents, but they are plastering her picture all over the . internet and selling t-shirts with her face on to pay for lawyers’ fees. I have never seen that kind of behavior. Tragedy: Mrs Hodgin and her husband were just given three hours notice before their adoptive daughter was taken from their home in Dickson County, Tennessee and moved to Omaha, Nebraska . ‘John . has had to take Sonya into hiding because he is being targeted by . people. Some people stole his trash and tried to steal his truck. ‘I . feel sorry for the Hodgin’s because they have a relationship with Sonya . and if it was up to us, they would continue to see her, but they are . making that impossible, because they want to take her back permanently. ‘We . are never going to let that happen. She is family and families don’t . just give up on each other. They have no blood link to her. They have no . right to her and if you ask me, their lawyer needs to tell them to shut . their mouths.’ The . family member also revealed McCaul has been in prison for an armed . robbery as well as transporting a gun across state lines. But she . defended him saying: ‘John got into trouble when he was a kid, I’m not . going to deny that. ‘But the robbery was not his fault. He told some guys how to do a robbery, but he wasn’t with them when they did it. ‘It . was the same with the gun charge. He was running a security firm and he . wasn’t allowed to have a gun. A woman was in his car and she had one, . but it wasn’t in a holster, so as it was in her car, he was charged. ‘But he has served his time and has straightened up. He just wants to start a new life with his daughter.’ McCaul was in court in Tennessee on Friday after the Hodgins petitioned to have her returned to them on Sonya’s best interest. The family adopted her in 2008, but a Tennessee appeals court overturned that after McCaul was released from prison. In . a recording of a phone call made on January 30 this year, a day after . Sonya was moved from Dickson County to Omaha, she can be heard asking . for her adoptive parents to take her back.'What did you say, baby doll?' Mrs Hodgin can be heard asking in a recording of the phone call obtained by CNN. 'I want to you to come and get me', the young girl responds. During . the phone call, the last time the Hodgins spoke to her, Sonya also . describes her biological father's home as 'dirty, with mold and . cigarettes everywhere,' and although the man is 'nice' to her, the home . lacks clean water. Convicted felon: Sonya has no memory of her father Josh McCaul, left, but a court still ruled she should live with him . The Hodgins say they were given just three hours' notice before the young girl was taken from them.'Sonya's . crying her eyes out. Screaming bloody murder, ""Please don't let them do . this, Daddy, please, Mama, don't let 'em take me,"",' Mr Hodgin told . CNN. 'They took her bags, and that's the last that I've seen her,' Mrs Hodgin adds. McCaul had been awarded custody of his infant daughter in 2004 after Sonya's mother gave up her rights. However, . she has been living with the Hodgins since 2006 and they were able to . adopt Sonya after McCaul pleaded guilty to transporting firearms and was . sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. This . automatically terminated his parental rights as Tennessee state law . does not allow anyone incarcerated for more than ten years to have . rights to a child under the age of eight. But . his sentence was shortened to just eight years and he was able to . retain it upon his release from prison after claiming his parental . rights were illegally terminated. In . 2009, McCaul won an appeal claiming he did not voluntarily give up his . rights and the court did not follow due process in the adoption . proceedings. For the next five years, Sonya continued to live with the Hodgins on their Tennessee farm as the two sides fought for custody. In . January this year, a judge ruled that the nine-year-old should return . to her biological father, and a few hours later, she had been taken from . the Hodgins. DCS . spokesman Rob Johnson said earlier this year that while foster parents . often come to love the children in their care, the law is clear, 'Birth . parents have the right to raise their children.'","Sonya McCaul has been 'returned' to an ex-con father she did not know .

"By . Valerie Elliott . Testing: A Harrods customer tests the store's cherries - some of the first to be grown outside this year . Everybody wants a bite of the cherry... but you’ll need deep pockets to do so – as Harrods has opened this year’s season for the fruit by selling them at a juicy £1.65 each. At the upmarket store in Knightsbridge, West London, The Mail on Sunday paid £41.16 for a punnet that weighed 294g (10.5oz) and contained just 25 cherries. At £140 a kilo (or £64/lb), industry sources said this was a ‘record’ price for early-season cherries. The fruit is not available at all until April, when the only supply in the world comes from heated Spanish greenhouses. But the Harrods cherries are among the first of the year to be grown outdoors. Bruce Langlands, the store’s director of foods, said: ‘We sell French Glamour Edoa cherries from a small producer in the Pyrenees with a limited number of trees. 'They grow in the open and are only available for four weeks in the year. Each cherry is hand-picked at optimal ripeness with direct, same-day distribution into Harrods. ‘The producer only supplies Harrods with this variety. As these cherries are very difficult to grow, very few people do. Because they are so rare, they are expensive.’ But even more common varieties of cherry might plunge the average family budget into the red. At Marks & Spencer on Friday, a 200g (7oz) pack of cherries cost £5. With 20 cherries in the pack each cherry worked out at 25p. A Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said: ‘It’s early for the cherry season but demand is outstripping supply and that is why shoppers are having to pay these prices. 'Next week though the season comes into full swing, cherries will be in abundance and prices will come down.’ Morrisons cherries will also be on . promotion from tomorrow, with a 10oz punnet priced £2 – almost 20 times . cheaper than Harrods’ variety.

Federica Richards, 25, a South African living in London, chose Harrods as her favourite and Tesco as least enjoyable. ‘I usually buy my cherries from Sainsbury’s but the Harrods ones are just as good,’ she said, adding she would expect to pay about £6 for a packet. When told how much the luxury store was selling its cherries for, she said: ‘Oh, I’d never pay that, that’s ridiculous.’ Barbara Frantini, 31, originally from Italy but living in the capital, said the ‘sour and tasteless’ Harrods cherries were the worst and Whole Foods ‘the best by far’.","Our reporter paid £41.16 for a punnet of 25 cherries that weighed 294g .

"By . Daniel Martin . Two-thirds of councils are subjecting vulnerable pensioners to the indignity of 15-minute care visits that are too short to meet their needs, an independent report has found. Hundreds of thousands of frail, elderly people are being hit by the growing culture of so-called ‘clock-watch care’, the research revealed. And it exposes how care workers are undertrained, with almost half going into homes with no training in how to look after dementia or stroke patients. Hundreds of thousands of frail and elderly people are being hit by the growing culture of so-called 'clock-watch care', the research revealed (file picture, posed by models) The report comes after charities and trade unions last year demanded an end to clock-watch care, an issue which the Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted through its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. This latest study by Labour peer Baroness Kingsmill was commissioned by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who yesterday pledged to ban care visits lasting just a quarter of an hour if he wins the General Election. Baroness Kingsmill concluded that England faces a ‘crisis’ in the quality of care for older and disabled people who need help preparing meals, bathing and taking medication. ‘People who may be vulnerable are not being treated with the care and attention they deserve,’ she said. ‘Strict restrictions on time mean that people are not being treated with dignity, their needs are being ignored and care workers cannot do a satisfactory job.’ Care agencies are ‘exploiting’ home helps, the report said, with up to 220,000 workers in effect being paid less than the minimum wage because the firms pay them only for the visits and not the amount of time taken to travel between them. The study by Labour peer Baroness Kingsmill was commissioned by Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured, who yesterday pledged to ban care visits lasting 15 minutes if he wins the General Election . And many workers who stayed longer than the 15-minute slots they were allocated – so they could attend to their patient with the dignity they deserve – were not paid any extra. The report said: ‘Care workers are undervalued, underpaid and undertrained … The sector is subject to weak regulation. The working conditions of care workers are among the worst of any in England. Qualifications are patchy. The workforce tends to be older women or migrant workers, who have few other employment options. ‘The low status of care work and poor treatment of workers has led to a vicious downward spiral into one of the most  difficult sectors for workers,  with widespread exploitation.’ Mr Miliband said that, as prime minister, he would work with councils and care agencies to raise standards in the industry, adding: ‘I am determined that a Labour government will call time on clock-watch care.’ The Labour leader commissioned Baroness Kingsmill, a former solicitor, to write a report into the impact of exploitative employment practices on the care of elderly and vulnerable people. It found that between 150,000 and 220,000 of England’s 1.8million care workers were paid less than the minimum wage, often because they are not paid for time spent travelling between visits. And 41 per cent do not receive training to help deal with specific medical needs, such as dementia and stroke, while nearly a third receive no regular training. The report said 15-minute care should end and called for a new Care Charter to be drawn up by regulators. It also said there should be an inspection regime for the commissioning of care.","Two-thirds of councils are giving pensioners care visits lasting 15 minutes .

"By . Wills Robinson . A brother and sister who cheated the taxman out of £350,000 and blew the cash on a luxury Caribbean holiday have each been jailed for 18 months. Matthew, 29, and Rebecca Kania, 31, from Brentwood, Essex, used the money they swindled during the five-year scam on a lavish break in Barbados while wining and dining clients at top restaurants. They were directors of Embassy Scaffolding Services but set up ‘buffer companies’, enabling them to take staff off the payroll and pocket income tax and national insurance contributions. Rebecca Kania, 31, left, and brother Matthew were jailed for 18 months each after cheating the taxman out of £350,000. They splashed out on a lavish holiday to the Caribbean with the money . Between September 2008 and June 2013, the Kania’s stole the huge sum from 25 employees who thought they were paying their taxes to HMRC. The pair set Turbo Labour Services, Foremost Labour Services, Evolution Contract Services or Lost PR, but never filed any tax returns. The Kania siblings became directors of the scaffolding compnay after their father, who previously owned it, was forced into bankruptcy. Judge Nicholas Huskinson, sentencing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, told the pair: ‘There was a private company which was a family company and that company was eventually run by you with you effectively being the two owners of any shares. ‘Rather than the company declaring to HMRC for its full workforce of some thirty people and all its deductions for its employees, it transferred the employees to buffer companies. ‘In other words a company set up for the purpose of this manoeuvre. ‘Although . you were not directors of these companies you did control them and the . idea was that the employees, rather than being employed by Embassy, . instead were employed by the buffer company. ‘They . would issue the payslips and deduct from the employee’s pay-packet the . necessary taxes but rather than account that to HMRC it would be . returned to Embassy. The pair used the money they swindled from 25 employees to wine and dine top clients in Barbados . ‘You carried on the fraud once you became aware of it - it coincided with the recession in the building industry and some separate misfortune of lorries owned by the company being stolen. ‘I have thought very hard about whether this can be suspended but in my judgement this was a serious fraud carried out over a long time and a large amount of money was taken. ...‘I would be failing in my public duty if I did not send you immediately to custody' Judge Nicholas Huskinson, sentencing at Snaresbrook Crown Court . ‘I would be failing in my public duty if I did not send you immediately to custody.’ Relatives of the family were horrified to see the pair, who had been embracing throughout the hearing, be sentenced to prison. Rebecca Kania sobbed as she was led to the cells while her brother said tearfully: ‘I love you mum.’ Christopher Gillespie, defending the Kanias, said: ‘It is accepted that some of the money went on high living but mainly for the benefit of Matthew rather than Rebecca. ‘I would submit their lifestyle was improved rather than lavish. ‘A large sum of money was used to entertain clients to keep business not because of any selfish reason to spend it at expensive places. ‘In fact when their homes were raided the bank statements seized had been annotated by Rebecca so she knew what the money had been spent on.’ The court heard Matthew is blind in one eye and has apparently been diagnosed with adult ADHD. The pair pleaded guilty to cheating public revenue. Judge Nicholas Huskinson, sentencing at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) said he would have 'failed in his public duty' if he had not passed a custodial sentence .","Matthew, 29, and Rebecca Kania, 31, used money to wine and dine clients .

"By . Katy Winter . Whether they happen in a flash, or take a little bit more building up to first kisses are usually a special moment for everyone. But a former army clerk had to wait more than 20 years for her first kiss with her childhood sweetheart after they made a promise to ‘wish upon a star’ the night before she signed up. As teenagers, Marie Kavanagh, 38, and Alex Inwood, 38, chose the planet Venus - the brightest point of light in the night sky - to remind themselves of each other as they went their separate ways after school. Marie and Alex, pictured recently, waited more than 20 years for their first kiss, having been sweethearts at school and separated for years . Miss Kavanagh’s tours of duty would take . her Bosnia, Kosovo and Cyprus and, despite going on to have another . relationship which gave her two children, from time to time she would . look up at the planet and think of her time with Mr Inwood. He stayed behind in the West Midlands and also had two children but finally took the plunge when he reunited with Miss Kavanagh in August . 2013 and the pair are now, finally, a couple. Miss . Kavanagh, of Coventry, said: 'I don’t regret the choices I made. It was . my lifelong dream to join the army and my path led me on to have two . wonderful boys. 'But I’m so happy to be with Alex now. It was fate - we were meant to be together.' Miss . Kavanagh and Mr Inwood first became close in 1992 when they were sat on . the same table during art lessons at Ernestford Grange Community School . in Coventry. Miss . Kavanagh said: 'I thought he was hilarious. He made a paper mache mask . based on the Pinhead character from the Hellraiser films which I thought . was hysterical. We had exactly the same sense of humour. 'He began making excuses to catch up with me in the corridor after class and soon we were hanging out together after school. Marie, pictured at her passing out parade following her army training (L), left Alex, pictured as a teenager (R), to pursue her dream of being in the army, . Alex finally took the plunge when he reunited with Miss Kavanagh in August 2013 and the pair are now, finally, a couple . 'It . was very innocent - we held hands, but we never kissed. I never tried . to kiss him, and if he had tried to kiss me, I would have been oblivious . to it.' Miss . Kavanagh, whose grandfather was among the British prisoners of war . forced to build Burma’s Death Railway and whose father served in . Operation Motorman in Northern Ireland, dreamed of joining the army once she turned 18 in 1994. Mr Inwood . said: 'I knew how important a career in the forces was to Marie and I . wasn’t going to stop her fulfilling her dreams, no matter what I felt . about her. So I made sure the moment we said goodbye was special.' Miss . Kavanagh said: 'Me and Alex were incredibly close by that point. We had . instinctively begun telling each other we loved each other. But I’ve . always been extremely proud of my family’s connection with the armed . forces and I was going to join up no matter what. 'The . night before I left, Alex and I went for a walk. He stood beneath a . lamp-post and shook it until the light went out. We then looked up and . picked out the brightest point in the sky. 'Alex . said that wherever we might be in the world, we could look up, see . Venus, and it would be as if we were together again. It was incredibly . romantic.' Miss . Kavanagh fulfilled her dream by joining the Adjutant General’s Corps . and, despite injuries, served in the army over a period of 12 years, . eventually reaching the rank of Lance Corporal. Marie served in the army over a period of 12 years, eventually reaching the rank of Lance Corporal (R) before leaving the army in 2006 and returning to the UK, settling in Leeds (left, Marie pictured recently) In . 2005 she gave birth to twin boys, Shane and Leon, now 9. She said: 'I . was living my life but from time to time, I would look up at Venus and find myself wondering where Alex was - what he was doing, and who he was with.' Unknown to her, Mr Inwood had found a life in Leamington Spa, and was raising a daughter, Jo, now 12 with his then-partner. Miss Kavanagh eventually left the army in 2006 and returned to the UK, where she settled in Leeds. Two years later, she was glad to recieve a friend request from Mr Inwood on Facebook.She . said: 'I was so happy to hear from him, although we were both in . relationships at the time. We caught up briefly, and promised to stay in . touch with each other.' Miss . Kavanagh’s relationship came to an end in 2010 and she turned her . thoughts to returning to Coventry to be closer to her family. Realising . that Mr Inwood owned a removals business, Miss Kavanagh asked him . whether he would be willing to help her move. The . pair finally reunited in person in August 2013, by which time Mr Inwood . had a son, Mason, now 2, although by then his own relationship had been . over for nearly five months. Marie with her twin sons Shane and Leon, 9 who now all like with Alex in Coventry . Miss Kavanagh, who now works as a primary school classroom assistant, said: 'We met up in the Memorial Park in Coventry and spent the whole day together. It was as if we’d never been apart. The chemistry was exactly the same. 'I didn’t want to leave him. At the end of the night, he leaned over and kissed me. It felt wonderful, after all that time.' Just over a week later, Miss Kavanagh and her sons moved in with Mr Inwood and his children in Leamington Spa. Today, Miss Kavanagh lives in Coventry and spends every day with her former childhood sweetheart. Mr Inwood said: 'The road to us getting together was a long and winding one. Perhaps things could have happened differently. Perhaps I should have given Marie that kiss when we were teenagers. 'But I wouldn’t change anything - I love my kids and I know Marie loves hers too. 'The important thing is we’re back together now.'","Alex and Marie were a couple while at school together .

"By . Stephen Fisher . Labour has been ahead in the opinion polls since 2011. But it has never taken the commanding lead necessary to be sure of winning the next Election. Instead, its lead has been narrowing in recent months, and this week saw the publication of the first polls since 2012 showing a Tory lead. This comes as no great surprise. It is more of a wonder that Labour had the lead in the first place.Voters have consistently thought David Cameron makes a better prime minister than Ed Miliband would do. Labour is still being blamed by the electorate for the 2008 financial crisis, which is why Ed Miliband will never move into Number 10 Downing Street . They blame the Labour Party for the 2008 financial crisis, and now that the economy is recovering people have increasing confidence in Conservative  economic management, which they have nearly always preferred to the alternative offered by the two Eds. The diminishing Labour lead is  also unsurprising, because usually governments rally and oppositions fall back in the final months before  a general election. If past election cycles are a good guide, recent polls suggest the Tories are likely to get the largest share of the vote in 2015, with a two-thirds chance of winning the most seats. While the chances of another hung parliament or a Tory majority are each about 2 in 5, Labour’s chances of a majority are looking increasingly thin at less than 1 in 5. The numer of people intending to vote Labour has fallen dramatically since the beginning of the year . But maybe the past is not such a good guide to the future. This time things might be different. Now that we have the first post-war Coalition government, will both governing parties recover from their mid-term doldrums? While the Liberal Democrats have been flat-lining at about ten per cent, the Tories, as expected, are doing better now than at this time last year. The unprecedented rise of UKIP is also important. For Cameron to recover his mid-term losses he needs to turn around former Tories who have defected to UKIP. Surveys suggest this will be harder in 2015 than it was in 2010. Cameron’s challenge is on the right. Ed Miliband’s is in the centre. Hanging on to the former Lib Dem voters who switched to Labour after the Coalition formed will be particularly hard in the many constituencies where the Lib Dems, not Labour, are the main competitors for the Tories. Ultimately though, Miliband’s biggest challenge is to convince more people they want him to be prime minister. After years of the public consistently preferring Cameron, it will be hard to change their minds now. *Stephen Fisher is a Fellow and Tutor in Politics at Trinity College, Oxford .","Voters believe that David Cameron is a better Prime Minister than Ed Miliband .

"By . Emma Glanfield . One in four office workers keep an eye on their emails as they eat, according to a new study by O2 . Half of office workers now eat lunch at their desks and one in four keep an eye on their emails as they eat, according to a new study. Researchers also found office workers spend an average of just 15 minutes eating their lunch with 15.8million workers failing to take a full lunch hour. The poll, by O2 Priority to launch its £1 Lunch, found the most commonly stated excuse for workers failing to take a proper lunch break was being ‘too busy’ - with one in six people even feeling guilty about leaving their desk. It also found that time pressures are not the only thing stopping people from enjoying a lunch break. More than a third said the cost of food was the biggest factor affecting their decision of what to buy for lunch and more than one in four workers opt to take a packed lunch to work to save cash, according to the research. In what is perhaps a reflection of ever-busier lives, the lunch break is increasingly used as admin time for workers’ personal lives. The most common admin tasks performed by workers during their lunch break are internet banking (40 per cent), personal phone calls (39 per cent), booking appointments (29 per cent), shopping online (28 per cent) and paying bills (21 per cent). Food psychologist Doctor Christy Fergusson said workers who eat at their desks could be in danger of overeating. Food psychologist Doctor Christy Fergusson said workers who eat at their desks could be in danger of not switching off from their work (file picture) She said:  ‘It’s clear that most of us are eating too fast, and all-too-often we’re distracted by other tasks while eating so we don’t take time to notice and appreciate our food. ‘There’s a danger that this could lead to overeating - but it also means that our mind is constantly working so we don’t ever switch off to focus on the food itself. ‘A lunch break is a time to re-fuel, but it should also give us some breathing space from work.’","15.8million workers fail to take full lunch break and most take just 15 minutes .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A huge hedgehog is causing her rescuers a prickly problem - by refusing to leave her favourite food and return to the wild. Edinburgh the hedgehog was put on a strict diet in July last year after tipping the scales at more than 5lbs - more than double the average weight of an fully-grown hedgehog. The rescued hog soon shed half her body weight through the healthkick at her temporary home in Fife. Edinburgh, who was named after the place she was rescued, is almost double the size of an average adult hedgehog - thanks to her diet of mealworms . Edinburgh has refused to return to the wild because she doesn't want to leave the diet of mealworms that she is given at her rescuer's home in Fife . But now Edinburgh has got a little too comfortable with her diet of mealworms - and is refusing to return to the wild. Despite being released in time for spring, the hedgehog has so far stayed put at her charity boss Sandy Boyd’s garden in Wormit, Fife, preferring to stay and snack on mealworms. And now her weight has slowly crept back up to a hefty 3lbs - more than the 2lb average for an adult hog. Edinburgh, named after the place where she was rescued, weighed just 400g - less than 1lb - when she arrived at Wormit Hedgehog Care Centre in the autumn of 2012. But her love of fatty mealworms meant her weight soared until she could not properly roll up to defend herself. With the arrival of spring, and Edinburgh's new svelte figure, Mr Boyd decided the time was right to release Edinburgh, along with four other rescued hedgehogs, back into the wild. The rescued hog was put on a strict diet in July last year after ballooning to more than 5lbs - more than double the average for an adult hedgehog . Edinburgh managed to slim down to around 2lbs, pictured above, but the weight has now crept on since the hedgehog has refused to leave home . Now Edinburgh is refusing to leave charity boss Sandy Boyd's garden in Wormit, Fife, preferring to stay at the home and snack on her favourite food of mealworms . November 2012 -  0.8lbs (415g) June 2013 - 4.8lbs (2182g) July 2013 - 4.5lbs (2079g) October 2013 - 2.8lbs (1296g) February 2014 - 2.4lbs (1127g) March - 2.9lbs (1356g) But while the other four hogs went off to explore when released into the garden, Edinburgh stayed put. He said: 'We released her out in the back garden three weeks ago. 'Edinburgh has decided to stick around though and is staying in one of the special boxes we have for wild hogs in the garden. 'She’s even making herself right at home by taking the straw out the others and moving it to hers. She’s well and truly tucked in.' Mr Boyd said the lure of her favourite snack was one of the reasons Edinburgh stayed around - and is now contributing to her weight gain. He said: 'We do keep little bowls of mealworms under the shed and we’ve watched her going under there for a good feed. 'We will have to watch and restrict the mealworms again. It’s likely she’s going to be sticking around and will probably be back with us next winter for hibernation.'","Edinburgh tipped the scales at 5lbs but lost more than half her bodyweight .

"By . John Drayton . The biggest culture shock to have impressed itself upon Mesut Ozil during his first season in English football has been that no side ever gives up. A £42million signing from Real Madrid in September, the Arsenal playmaker has found life in the Premier League tough going thus far. Ozil is expected to flourish in his second year since the switch. But the German claims he is still getting used to the intensity of competition, which is in stark contrast what that he witnessed in Spain. Shock to the system! Mesut Ozil can't believe how much harder smaller teams fight in England than in Spain . Bit of a struggle: Ozil has found life in the Premier League tough going during his debut season over here . 'We had many matches. The pace was massive. The matches were exhausting. Always forward and backwards,' he said. 'Even against the smaller clubs even if it was 3-0. In Spain, the opponents stopped fighting when it was 2-0.' Arsene Wenger's side go into Saturday's FA Cup final against Hull City as overwhelming favourites, but Ozil's words serve as a warning if they are to end a nine-year trophy drought. The Tigers have been solid since their promotion to the top flight this year and comfortably avoided relegation. And recent memories of the penalty shoot-out semi-final win against Championship outfit Wigan should act as motivation to get the job done quickly. 'It will be a tough game,' Ozil added. 'Hull fight until the end. Nowhere else than in England are there so many teams who never give up.' Touch anxious?

"By . Amanda Williams . Clive Goodman, the former royal editor of The News of the World leaves the Old Bailey after giving evidence . Police did not publicly reveal the extent of hacking at the News of the World out of 'discretion' for victims - including members of the royal family, jurors heard today. Former royal editor for the paper, Clive Goodman, insisted that he had always been 'open and honest' even when confronted with evidence yesterday that he repeatedly hacked Kate Middleton, Prince William and Prince Harry. He claimed that he was simply a 'spear carrier' rather than the 'five act opera' of hacking, if compared to a colleague - who cannot be named. The Old Bailey heard, at the time he was caught, that 'there was not a single significant story broken at the NotW in the last couple of years' that the colleague had not got from tampering with phones. Goodman, 56, of Addlestone, Surrey, was dismissed in 2007 after he pleaded guilty and was jailed for hacking royal aides with private detective Glenn Mulcaire. He gave evidence under renewed questioning by former . NotW editor Andy Coulson’s lawyer. Goodman denied staying quiet about the . extent of his phone hacking when he appealed against his sacking. Timothy Langdale QC said: 'The one thing you were not going to tell them was the extent of your activities.' Goodman replied: 'As I said yesterday I have been completely open and honest about the extent of phone hacking. 'The reason these things did not come into the public domain before was the police and CPS in 2006/07 decided they were not going to publish things to protect the discretion of the victims. 'The only reason they came up now is they were not out there in the public domain at the time.' He went on: 'Whatever I have been accused of I have admitted to and paid an extremely high price for it.' He claimed that when he appealed against his dismissal in 2007 he wanted others at the NotW to 'admit their responsibility'. Goodman is on trial with Coulson for conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office in relation to paying police for information. He insisted that he had always been 'open and honest' even when confronted with evidence yesterday that he repeatedly hacked Kate Middleton, Prince William and Prince Harry . He does not face any further hacking charges. Coulson along with ex NotW editor Rebekah Brooks and former managing editor Stuart Kuttner are accused of conspiring to hack phones. All seven defendants deny the charges against them. Goodman hacked Kate Middleton’s phone and listened to a message from Prince William telling her about being ambushed and shot with blanks on a night exercise at Aldershot, the court heard. Mr Langdale pointed out the voicemail from the prince telling his then girlfriend about the incident in January 2006. The lawyer said: 'Who hacked Kate Middleton’s phone to get that message?' Goodman replied: 'It may have been me, it may have been Glenn Mulcaire. It may have been both.' Goodman hacked Kate Middleton's phone and listened to a message from Prince William telling her about being ambushed and shot with blanks on a night exercise at Aldershot, the court heard . Mr Langdale said Goodman had indicated previously that another message from Prince William to royal aide Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton was the source of the story. He then presented the witness with phone records showing the future Duchess of Cambridge’s voicemails were accessed several times between January 25 and January 27 2006. One hacking at midnight on the 27th lasted seven minutes and 12 seconds. Goodman responded: 'I accept I hacked her phone but I think Mr Mulcaire also hacked her phone. 'It was going on continually throughout. It is quite obvious here. I have never denied it.' Timothy Langdale QC, defending Coulson, accused Goodman of not revealing the full extent of his own hacking while trying to implicate others in the scandal. The court heard yesterday that Goodman had hacked the phones of Prince William and Kate Middleton nearly 200 times in total, and hacked into Prince Harry’s voicemails nine times. Mr Langdale said: ‘The one thing you are not going to do is tell them was the extent of your activities.’ Goodman replied: ‘The extent of my activities - I had been completely open and honest about the extent of phone hacking. ‘The reasons things didn’t come out into the public domain before was because the police and CPS in 2006 and 2007 decided that weren’t going to publicise the cases for reasons of their own - to protect the discretion of the victims. ‘The only reason this came out now is because you have chosen to bring them into the public domain.’ He said he did not outline the full extent of his own hacking ‘because it wasn’t the terms of the appeal’. Goodman added: ‘This was a very hostile confrontation between two senior executives of News International and me on my own. ‘It did get a bit tense.’ Goodman is on trial with Andy Coulson for conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office in relation to paying police for information . Allegations: Kate Middleton and Prince William on the day of their graduation at St Andrew's University in June 2005. The Duchess was said in court to have been first hacked in December that year by Goodman . Mr Langdale challenged him: ‘You . didn’t say a single word to Mr Cloke and Mr Myler about the extent of . your phone hacking activities.’ Goodman . replied: ‘My phone hacking activities were known, I had been charged . with what the police felt was relevant, and I had been convicted. ‘What this was about was getting others in the paper to admit their responsibilities.’ Goodman . denied he had contradicted a draft statement from 2006 that claimed a . colleague knew about the £500-a-week deal with private detective Glenn . Mulcaire to hack Royal aide’s phones. He said in his statement that the colleague had ‘full knowledge and approval’ of the project when it began in October 2005. Mr . Langdale pointed out yesterday Goodman had said the fact he was working . with Mulcaire had been kept from the other journalist for fear of . upsetting him. ‘We would discuss the stories produced often, but it is not the case that we discussed stories from Glenn Mulcaire or (his company) Nine Consultancy.’ Mr Langdale told him: ‘You change your story as and when it suits you.’ Goodman replied: ‘That’s not true, I have had a very straight forward story since day one of this, and a very clear story.’ Goodman returned to the court yesterday for the first time in nine weeks to continue his evidence to the phone hacking trial. He had been diagnosed with a new heart condition and battled a bout of pneumonia before being declared fit to resume his evidence. Trial: Goodman returned to the hacking trial of . former editors Rebekah Brooks (left), Andy Coulson (right) and five . others to finish giving his evidence after he fell ill on March 21. All . seven defendants deny the charges . Mr Justice Saunders told the jury this morning that Goodman is feeling side effects from his treatment, and the court will take regular breaks to help him. ‘In your absence, Mr Goodman told me he is having some difficulties in giving evidence’, he said. ‘As you are aware, the problem he had originally required him to stop giving evidence was a fast rapid heartbeat.’ He said Goodman has been put on drugs to deal with the heart problem, and underwent an angiogram to ensure he was well enough to give evidence. ‘One of the side effects of having the angiogram is yesterday he felt his heart going faster again’, he said. ‘He knows as you and I do we need to get through this but we can’t endanger his life by doing so.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Clive Goodman was dismissed in 2007 after he pleaded guilty and was jailed for hacking .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A World War One soldier's life was saved when prized photographs of his loved ones he kept in a wallet in his breast pocket blocked the path of a piece of shrapnel as it hurtled towards his body. Private William Taylor kept the eight pictures of his family in his pocket during the entire four years of the conflict. And in a remarkable quirk of fate he survived a . battle which left three quarters of his regiment dead or injured thanks . to the stack of photos which took the impact of a shell blast. Life saver: The first seven postcards clearly show the path the shrapnel took as it went through Pte William Taylor's breast pocket and saved his life . Saved: First World War soldier Private William Taylor's saved from shrapnel by a stack of family photographs kept in his breast pocket. Shrapnel tore through every one but stopped at his sister Lilly, right . The projectile pierced the outer layer . of his leather wallet and perforated seven of the eight photos, . stopping as it reached the last picture of his younger sister Lilly. Pte Taylor escaped the near-death experience with just a broken rib. He had spent the entire war on the . frontline and survived the hell of the Somme, Passchendaele and Ypres . before bringing the photographs, now bearing holes from the shrapnel, home with him. The first seven postcards clearly show . the path the shrapnel took as it went through Pte Taylor's breast . pocket, with the size of the hole getting fractionally smaller the . further it travelled. Pte . Taylor twice won the Military Medal for bravery, the first time for . risking his own life by dashing into No Man’s Land to rescue a wounded . comrade stranded in a shell hole. Family man: William Taylor with his grandsons Graham (left) and David in the 1970s . Protection: Photographs of Pte Taylor's sisters Rose Bertha and Lilly (left to right) - the last three in his wallet, two of which were perforated by the shrapnel . Pte . Charles Winch, who came from a neighbouring village to Pte Taylor’s . home in Hertfordshire, was so grateful he sent him a birthday card every . year - thanking the soldier for saving his life on the Somme in 1916. Now, . nearly a century on from the battle, Pte Taylor's own story of survival . and his gallantry has emerged after his grandson dug out the . war-damaged photographs and medals for an exhibition to mark the 100th . anniversary of the start of the First World War. 'Like . many others, my grandfather didn’t say very much about the war but he . did tell us about how these old family photos saved his life,' said grandson Dave Taylor, 55. 'When . he left for France in 1914 he took these pictures with him as . keepsakes. In quiet moments he got them out and looked at them and . remembered his family back at home. 'He tucked them away in his wallet which he always kept in his breast pocket. Luckily that trivial act saved his life. 'There are impact marks about a . centimetre big on every photograph bar one from the shrapnel. The one at . the very end was of my great auntie Lilly, his sister. 'He was incredibly lucky. Pals: Pte Taylor, pictured third from left behind the flag, is pictured with his comrades from the Hertfordshire Regiment at the start of the war . 'My . grandfather was there from the start of the war until the end. How he . and others like him survived is down to little quirks of fate like this . one. It is an amazing story.' Pte Taylor, from Hertford, volunteered for he Hertfordshire Regiment, which was part of the Territorial Army, at the age of 23 and went to France in November 1914. He acted as a stretcher bearer at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, when he saved Pte Winch, who had been badly wounded by a shell blast. Mr Taylor, an accountant, said: 'This poor chap was badly wounded but couldn’t get out without assistance . 'After the war Mr Winch lived in Watton at Stone, a few miles from my grandfather’s home, and ran a sweet shop close by. 'My father remembers seeing him riding his bike and bearing the facial injuries he sustained in the war. 'He remained in contact with my grandfather and we still have a birthday card he sent in 1975 which reads ""Many thanks for helping to save my life on the Somme Nov 13 1916. '“Also I know you did the same for many others"".' In July 1917 during the Third Battle of Ypres, otherwise known as Passchendaele, Pte Taylor had his own brush with death. His battalion was fighting at were at St Julien at Flanders and came under heavy shell and machine gun fire - when Pte Taylor was struck by the shrapnel. Following his recovery from his broken rib he was awarded a Bar to his Military Medal for his overall gallantry and devotion to duty. He was promoted to Lance Corporal and after the war he went to work as a gardener. He married wife Gladys in 1928 but tragically she died two years later as she gave birth to their twin children, William and Lilla, who are now aged 84. Pte Taylor bought up the twins with the help of family members, and married his second wife Joyce in 1943. History: Pte Taylor's grandson dug out the war-damaged photographs and medals for an exhibition to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War . Memento: Pte Taylor's dog tag - which he wore during his four years at war . He served as an air raid warden during the Second World War and died in 1979 aged 88. Dan Hill is leading the Herts at War project which is holding an exhibition of untold First World War stories from August. 'Corporal Taylor’s wartime experiences are a poignant mix of extreme bravery in battle and incredible fortune that saw him saved by the wallet of family photos that he carried,' he said. Grateful: Soldier Charles Winch always sent Pte Taylor a birthday card thanking him for saving his life, and after his death in 1979 sent this letter to wife Joyce .

"By . Mark Duell . Two teenage brothers tried to rob a betting shop to prove themselves to their criminal stepfather, a court was told yesterday. The man had challenged the 16 and 17 year olds to ‘go out and show me you’re a man’ - before they burst into a Ladbrokes in Witham, Essex, and attacked the manager, Colchester Youth Court heard. But the pair - who cannot be named for legal reasons - fled empty-handed after the incident on January 7 this year, and were arrested eight days later after they were filmed on the shop’s CCTV. Caught on CCTV: The stepfather had challenged the 16 and 17 year olds (pictured) to 'prove they were men' They both admitted attempted robbery and were sent to a young offenders’ institution for a year.  The boys had been living in local authority care, one in Tiptree and one in Chelmsford. The court heard that their stepfather, who has various convictions and also cannot be named for legal reasons, told them to ‘prove they were men’. Philippa Beswick, representing the 16-year-old, said: ‘He wanted them to be a little team that goes out to commit robberies to make money for the house. ‘The stepfather drove them and waited around the corner until they had committed the offence. The offence would never have been carried out if it was not for the influence of the stepfather.’ Robbery attempt: The boys burst into a Ladbrokes (pictured) betting shop in Witham, Essex, the court heard . Ms Beswick said her client had received abuse from his mother following the offence and had encouraged him to seek a restraining order. 'He obviously sees himself as a big criminal and wants to have a firm where his sons are out committing crimes too' Stephen Moriaty, defending boy, 17 . Stephen Moriaty, representing the older brother, said: ‘He obviously sees himself as a big criminal and wants to have a firm where his sons are out committing crimes too.’ Victim Linda Beales, who has managed the bookmakers for 21 years, told the court she was still suffering psychological trauma as a result of the incident. She was on her own and closing the store when the teens burst in at about 10pm. The brothers pushed her to the ground and held her there, but eventually ran off down a nearby alleyway. Mrs Beales, who suffered bruising and friction burns, said the incident has damaged her confidence. Hearing: The boys both admitted attempted robbery and were sent to a young offenders' institution for a year at Colchester Youth Court (pictured) in Essex . She said: ‘When the shop door clicks my stomach feels sick. I am no longer confident working alone in the shop, which is a problem as it is a requirement of my job. 'This was an offence where you gained nothing, but put the victim through a tremendous amount of stress' Matthew Batten, chairman of the bench . ‘Recently when I was in a supermarket I screamed when someone ran past me. I have had flashbacks of the incident.’ The pair admitted attempted robbery and were both given 12-month detention orders. Half of the sentence will be served at a young offenders’ institution and the other half under supervision. Matthew Batten, chairman of the bench, told them: ‘This was an offence where you gained nothing, but put the victim through a tremendous amount of stress.’","Stepfather challenged boys, aged 16 and 17, before they burst into shop .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . World number 690 Thomas Pieters will take a two-shot lead into the final round of the Spanish Open after home favourite Miguel Angel Jimenez’s charge faltered on Saturday. Jimenez surged two clear of the field thanks to six birdies in his opening 13 holes at PGA Catalunya, but bogeyed the 15th and 18th to card a third round of 69. That left the 50-year-old, who was fourth in the Masters last month and then won on his Champions Tour debut seven days later, on five-under-par and allowed overnight leader Pieters to reclaim top spot with birdies at the 15th and 16th in a round of 71. In the driving seat: Thomas Pieters has a two-shot lead going into the final round of the Spanish Open . Chance gone? Miguel Angel Jimenez was two clear of the field at one stage during his third round but boegys at the 15th and 18th hole cost him dear . 'I’m a little disappointed with that,' admitted Jimenez, who has no plans to switch to the seniors circuit as he chases a fifth Ryder Cup appearance at Gleneagles in September. 'I didn’t hit it very well the last few holes. 'I played very well the first nine holes and was solid until the 14th but made a bad bogey on the 15th where I three-putted from eight metres and also bogeyed the last.' Jimenez is already the oldest winner in European Tour history, beating his own record by winning the Hong Kong Open for a record fourth time at the age of 49 years and 337 days last December. But despite 20 tournament victories to his credit, the world number 34 has never won his national open and added: 'It would be nice. I’d love to win the Spanish Open of course and we’ll see what happens tomorrow.' Poise: Pieters hits his approach into the fourth hole during the third round of the Spanish Open . Pieters only turned professional in June last year and secured his European Tour card via the qualifying school at PGA Catalunya in November, aided by an opening round of 64. The 22-year-old said: “It was a solid day. I hit solid shots and really played to my strengths. I got two over par early just because my short game wasn’t sharp enough but I took advantage of the par fives again today and the shots dropped in the end. 'I stayed really patient, you need to be on this course and I’m getting better and better at it. You know that it’s going to be a hard day and an even par is a good score. 'I’ve always done well on really tough courses, I like grinding it out, not having to shoot six or seven under. Today I shot one under and I’m in the lead. 'I’m excited for tomorrow. I’ll just go out to play golf, obviously playing for a win too. 'Playing with Jimenez will be fun, I’ll get to learn a lot from him and I’ll just soak it all in. I’ve never played with him or any of the big names. The crowd will also be bigger and all the support will go to him but I just have to play my own game.' In the red: Richie Ramsay is three shots off the lead at the Spanish Open . Scotland’s Richie Ramsay, England’s Chris Wood and Australian left-hander Richard Green are three shots off the lead on four under, Ramsay holing a putt estimated at 100 feet on the eighth for one of his five birdies. England’s Ross Fisher is among a five-strong group on three under, the Tshwane Open winner carding a best-of-the-day 67 which included two eagles. 'I’m very pleased,' Fisher said. 'Starting the day two over par I wanted to get into red figures and I managed to do that. 'I played really well and the difference from yesterday to today was that I had the speed of the greens. Yesterday I really struggled, I felt the greens were a lot slower than they were on Thursday morning so I’m pleased to go out there and play a solid round of golf.'","Thomas Pieters holds a two-shot lead going into Spanish Open final round .

"By . Tim Oglethorpe . Gabriel Byrne can't stand being described as brooding and intense. 'I'm actually quite the opposite,' insists the quietly spoken Irishman, best known for roles in movies The Usual Suspects and Defence Of The Realm. 'Maybe it's because I play those kinds of parts. People are always looking for labels to stick on others, so maybe those descriptions have been extended from the characters I play to me. Whatever the reason, I don't like it. In Ireland, brooding is a term we use for hens. A brooding hen is supposed to lay eggs. Every time somebody says, ""He's dark and brooding"" I think, ""He's about to lay an egg.""' In his latest drama, Gabriel Byrne tackles issues that are very close to home . Gabriel's latest TV character isn't about to lay an egg but he's certainly brooding. Quirke - we never learn his first name - is the main player in BBC1's new three-part crime drama set in 50s Dublin. He's the city's chief pathologist and not only does he spend his professional life examining dead bodies but he usually finds such a tragic story behind their deaths that he feels obliged to investigate further, even if it means suffering acute emotional anxiety in the process. Quirke smokes and drinks too much too. He's mourning a dead wife and he has a closet full of secrets, including an ill-fated affair with his brother's wife Sarah, played by Geraldine Somerville. 'He spends a lot of time in his subterranean office and he's much more at home among the dead than he is among the living,' explains Byrne, who had to smoke packet after packet of menthol cigarettes and drink copious amounts of grape juice - substitutes for the cigarettes and red wine his character gets through - during the five-month shoot in Dublin. 'He has a wounded past, something most people can relate to, and hides his vulnerability beneath an exterior of detachment. But he's determined to find out the truth if he be-lieves there are suspicious circumstances surrounding a death.' Later stories take in the disappearance of a junior doctor with a racy private life, and an apparent but unlikely suicide, but the first concerns a woman called Christine Falls. Quirke - starring Gabriel Byrne and Michael Gambon - starts this month on BBC1 . 'Quirke won't give up on his investigation and it takes him to the very heart of Dublin society and some powerful people within both the medical profession and the Catholic Church,' says Gabriel. 'I think he's to be applauded for trying to lift the lid on clandestine worlds. Openness and accountability are crucial to a healthy society and anything that hinders that has to be questioned.' One suspects it's Quirke's zealous determination to uncover the truth that appealed to Gabriel. This, after all, is a man who went through hell because nobody was prepared to take on the Catholic Church and challenge its absolute power in the 50s Ireland in which he grew up. Gabriel revealed on an Irish TV chatshow in 2010 how, between the ages of eight and 11, he had been sexually abused by Brothers in the Roman Catholic seminary where he was studying to be a priest. He's since described the Church as 'a tyrannical, evil institution: anti-woman, anti-homosexual, anti-love, anti-condom, totally elitist.' He went on to say, 'Because of this culture of secrecy, priests - and nuns - could commit crimes against children and realise they didn't have to pay for it. The Church would never hand them over to the authorities. To take advantage of a child's innocence in that way is a crime against the soul of that child. I'm only thankful that now, all the rocks have been lifted and all the maggots have finally crawled out.' Booker Prize winner John Banville, who wrote the novels on which Quirke is based under the pseudonym Benjamin Black, agrees that the Dublin portrayed on screen is very much of the past. 'Ireland changed in the early 90s when a man called Bishop Casey, who was very popular, was revealed to have had a mistress and a 17-year-old son by her and had 'borrowed' £70,000 of parish funds to pay her off,' he explains. 'When that story came out the floodgates opened and by 2003, when I started to write the books, these bad people had been exposed. But Quirke is set squarely in 1950s Dublin so they were still doing terrible things.' Fortunately, there were lighter moments. Gabriel, who's divorced from US actress Ellen Barkin by whom he has a son Jack, 24, and a daughter Romy, 22, says filming the series became a trip down Memory Lane. 'By absolute coincidence we filmed in the very first flat I ever had, on Pembroke Road in Dublin, and later shot scenes in the theatre where I made my first professional appearance. I hadn't been there since,' he says. 'Déjà vu doesn't begin to describe it.' Quirke starts this month on BBC1.","Gabriel takes on the role of a hard- drinking pathologist in a new drama .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A woman who was snatched as a baby 26 years ago and raised by her kidnapper has revealed that her life is all the better for it. Netty Nance, who was just 19 days old when she was stolen from a Harlem Hospital, was reunited with her real mother in 2011, having managed to solve the case on her own. However, rather than harboring feelings of anger and bitterness about the deception, she says that she wouldn’t change what happened. Together again: Netty, reunited with her real parents in 2011 . Deception: Netty with Ann Pettway, shortly after the abduction . How it was reported: A New York Post story about the kidnapping . Netty told the Daily Mirror: ‘Now I have two moms and two dads and my life is richer now because of that. I feel as though everything happens for a reason. ‘I wouldn’t be me, if it wasn’t for what I’ve been through, and I’m happy. I wouldn’t change what happened to me.’ Netty’s remarkable story begins in 1988 in New York. Her real mom was Joy White, who gave birth to her at 16 and called her Carlina. But after just 19 days Carlina developed a fever so Joy and the father, Carl Tyson, 22, took her to Harlem Hospital. The kidnapper, Ann Pettway, struck when they went home to collect some belongings, Carlina having been left in a cot. Ann, from Connecticut, had been posing as a nurse on the maternity ward for many weeks - and so effectively that many of the nurses there thought she was genuine. She had recently had a miscarriage and she saw Carlina as a chance for happiness. Joy and Carl were horrified when they discovered their baby was missing. A massive police hunt got underway, but despite wanted posters for a woman matching Ann's description, the crime remained unsolved for the next 23 years. Carlina was renamed Nejdra Nance, which became Netty after a move to Atlanta, Georgia. Ann had a son when Netty was 10, called Trevon, and they had a happy family life for many years. Netty recalls learning dance steps with her cousins and lots of family picnics and birthday parties. ‘I have more good memories than bad from that time,’ she said. However, in 2005, her world was sent into a spin. She had a child of her own and had to present her birth certificate to officials to claim prenatal care. But she was told her birth certificate was forged. Police hunt: A wanted poster for Ann Pettway issued shortly after the kidnapping . In a state of shock she confronted Ann, who broke down and confessed that she wasn’t her real mom. It made sense to Netty as she had begun to notice that she didn’t share physical traits with Ann. But Ann lied and told her that she’d been abandoned by a drug addict. Netty moved into her own apartment after she gave birth to a girl, called Samani, and became determined to find out more about her past. Heartbroken: Joy White standing by Carlina's empty crib . Pride and joy: Carlina White pictured before she was abducted . Bond: Joy and Carl at home, as they tried to come to terms with what had happened . Sorrow: Joy White holds a picture of her baby in 1988 as police desperately tried to unravel what had happened . Carlina, now known as Netty, was abducted during a stay at Harlem Hospital, when she was admitted with a fever . After five years of research she discovered her real identity through the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children’s website. She found a picture of herself as a baby that looked just like Samani and the shocking truth of what had happened dawned on her. DNA tests confirmed that Joy and Carl were her real parents and she was joyously reunited with them. Truth revealed: Ann Pettway, pictured in 2010 (left), and Netty (right) photographed shortly after she was reunited with her real parents . She describes her relationship with them as ‘incredibly close’, though it did take a while for her to come to terms with her new life, admitting that she hid away and barely spoke to her friends for over a year after the truth was revealed. Ann handed herself in in 2012 and is two years into a 12-year jail term. Netty added: ‘I’m not mad at Ann any more. I was, but only because she hid something from me for so long. But I can appreciate what she did for me.’","Netty Nance, 26, was snatched when she was a 19-day-old baby .

"By . Tales Azzoni . The roof of the stadium hosting the World Cup opener in a few weeks will not be fully finished in time for the tournament, constructors said on Friday. Construction company Odebrecht confirmed that a part of the roof at the Itaquerao will only be completed after the World Cup. There was not enough time to install the glass covers that were supposed to be added to the sides of the stadium's roofing structure, so Odebrecht and local organisers have decided to postpone the work until after the tournament. Shambles! The Itaquerao in Sao Paulo won't be completed before the World Cup starts (picture taken in March) Odebrecht said the missing covers will not affect fans watching matches in the stadium. The company in charge of 20,000 temporary seats needed for the opener said it has successfully addressed all health and safety issues that had prompted prosecutors to threaten to halt work at the venue. Odebrecht said in an email that the glass covers will only be installed after the World Cup because 'transparency studies' were still being finalised to make sure the covers can allow the passage of the proper amount of light needed to 'preserve the pitch in good conditions'. The company said the roof itself is ready and guaranteed that the covers are not essential, even though they were part of the initial project. Some reports said the glass covers were needed to help protect fans from rain, but Odebrecht denied that their absence would keep fans uncovered. The company had already said that not all fans seated behind the goals will be fully covered from rain during the World Cup. Sure? The construction company said no fans will be left uncovered at the ground (picture taken on May 8) Major blow: The stadium's roof will now only be completed after the World Cup has ended (picture taken May 8) FIFA and the local World Cup organising committee did not respond to requests for comment. The Itaquerao is one of the three stadiums yet to be completed ahead of the World Cup. Late last year, two workers died after a crane collapsed while hoisting a huge roofing structure, causing significant construction delays at the venue that was expected to be ready by the end of last year. In March, another worker died while installing the temporary seats there, prompting labor officials to halt construction and causing another delay. On Thursday, prosecutors said they found health and safety irregularities at the Itaquerao and threatened to stop the installation of the temporary seats that are still missing. The company in charge of the work, Fast Engenharia, said on Friday that it addressed all the problems pointed by prosecutors and dismissed the possibility of another work stoppage. In his latest visit to Brazil last month, FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said there was 'not a minute' to waste if local organisers wanted to make sure the Itaquerao was ready for the opener.","Roof on the Itaquerao won't be finished in time for World Cup opener .

"By . Ben Spencer . Scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain, which could go some way to warding off the disease . A widely-used antidepressant could help slow the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers have found. Scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain, which could go some way to warding off the disease. The U.S. academics admit it is too early to recommend the drug to Alzheimer’s patients, but dementia charities last night welcomed the ‘promising’ findings as providing ‘vital new clues’ about the disease. Plaque deposits are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of Alzheimer’s, so anything that can stop their build-up in the brain is likely to help ward off the condition. The research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, found that a single dose of the antidepressant citalopram lowered production of the plaque protein amyloid beta by 37 per cent. The experiment was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 50, but the scientists, from the universities of Washington and Pennsylvania, hope the findings can be replicated in elderly patients. The drug, marketed in the UK as Cipramil, also had a dramatic effect on elderly mice, halting the growth of existing plaques and reducing the formation of new deposits by 78 per cent. Lead scientist Dr John Cirrito, from Washington University School of Medicine said: ‘Antidepressants appear to be significantly reducing amyloid beta production, and that’s exciting. 'But while antidepressants generally are well tolerated, they have risks and side effects. ‘Until we can more definitively prove that these drugs help slow or stop Alzheimer’s in humans, the risks aren’t worth it. There is still much more work to do.’ The amyloid beta protein is a waste product of normal brain activity. But its levels rise in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, causing it to clump together in plaques. Earlier research by Dr Cirrito’s team showed that serotonin, a brain messenger chemical, reduces amyloid beta production. Serotonin is also linked to mood, and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain . Serotonin is also linked to mood, and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain. The scientists are now investigating how serotonin affects amyloid beta production in mice at the molecular level. Co-author Dr Yvette Sheline, from the University of Pennsylvania, said: ‘We also plan to study older adults who will be treated for two weeks with antidepressants. ‘If we see a drop in levels of amyloid beta in their spinal fluid after two weeks, then we will know that this beneficial reduction in amyloid beta is sustainable.’ Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Amyloid build-up occurs many years before symptoms appear in Alzheimer’s, and understanding how to prevent or delay its accumulation early is a key goal for Alzheimer’s researchers. ‘This study has yielded some interesting findings, and further research to understand the mechanisms responsible for these results could provide vital new clues about the disease and how to fight it. ‘Currently half a million people in the UK are living with Alzheimer’s, the most common cause of dementia, and we urgently need treatments that can stop the disease in its tracks. 'Investment in research is crucial if we are to develop these treatments and provide better outcomes for people with the disease.’ Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, added: ‘The fact that this anti-depressant has the ability to reduce the production of amyloid beta is promising, and it is encouraging to see the effects in mice replicated in people. ‘However, this was a small study in healthy people, so more research is needed to see if the drug could work for people with dementia, or even help prevent the condition developing in the first place.’ Citalopram is one of the most-commonly prescribed antidepressants in England, where 53million prescriptions of all antidepressants are issued a year, double the number prescribed a decade ago. According to recent research, one in three British women and one in 10 men now take antidepressants, and doctors have been warned not to routinely prescribe the drugs. While citalopram is not clinically addictive, some experts fear that people who take it as an antidepressant can become dependent on it.","Scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce plaques in the brain .

"By . Wills Robinson . Amy Black, 40, was suffering from post-natal depression when she killed her baby Zoe . A mother suffering from post-natal depression thought her TV was 'telling her to do things' before she drowned her baby and dumped it in a factory car park, a court has heard. Amy Black, 40, snapped after enduring a sleepless night with seven-month-old daughter Zoe, who had been crying constantly because of a painful case of glue ear. CCTV footage showed Black climbing a makeshift ladder and tipping the child's body over an eight-foot fence into undergrowth that separated her . bungalow in Bestwood, Nottingham, from an industrial unit. She became increasingly paranoid at her home before the horrific incident, and believed her husband was a spy from the UK Government. Black also thought her neighbours were ignoring her because she was American, and had illusions of her television telling her to leave the UK. Several witnesses reported the child's body appeared to be ‘wet’ shortly after she was discovered, with ‘clear liquid’ coming from her mouth. Half-an-hour later she called 999 - but paramedics were unable to revive Zoe. At an earlier hearing Black pleaded guilty to infanticide on the grounds that she ‘caused the death of her child at a time the balance of her mind had not recovered fully from giving birth’. She was sentenced by High Court Judge Mrs Justice Kathryn Thirlwall at the same court today. Detaining her in a secure hospital for an indefinite period, Mrs Justice Thirlwall said: 'You are suffering from a mental illness that makes it necessary that you be detained for treatment.' Black's mother and stepfather attended today's hearing along with her elderly husband, Jack, who the court heard was suffering from a terminal illness. The court heard from three psychiatrists who agreed that Black was continuing to suffer from a mental illness which required further treatment. Isabella Forshall QC, defending Black, said: 'She was seriously ill at the time of the incident and continues to need treatment.' Timothy Spencer QC, prosecuting, had told the court there was evidence to show that in the months leading up to Zoe’s death, Black’s mind was ‘significantly disturbed’. Black became increasingly paranoid at her home in Bestwood, Nottingham, before the horrific incident, and believed her husband was a UK Government agent who had been placed in her home to spy on her . Neighbours left flowers at the scene following the death of seven-month-old baby Zoe Black . The court heard she and her husband, 70-year-old Zen trainer Jack Black, had lived in the UK for 30 months before the tragedy. They met after Black read a book her . future husband had written about Zen spiritualism and left her home in . the US state of Minnesota to travel to India in the hope of finding . ‘spiritual fulfilment, Mr Black, or possibly both’. Mr Black told detectives ‘his wife hid a lot from him, sometimes she didn’t want to share with him what she was feeling’. She also developed a worsening dislike for their bungalow, claiming the television was telling her ‘to do specific things’ such as leave the UK. Mr Spencer said she indicated she was having suicidal thoughts and went on to tell her husband, who suffered from chronic respiratory problems often leaving him confined to a wheelchair, that he was a UK government employee who had been placed in their home ‘to spy on her’. CCTV footage showed Black climbing a makeshift ladder and tipping the child's body over an eight-foot fence into undergrowth, pictured, that separated her bungalow in Bestwood, Nottingham, from an industrial unit . The court heard that neighbours told police that Black appeared ‘overburdened and finding it difficult to cope with a sick husband and newborn baby’. The day before she killed Zoe, Black took a taxi to London with her daughter and booked into a room at a Premier Inn in Ealing. Police were alerted to the fact they were missing by paramedics who had been called to their home by Mr Black. His respiratory condition had worsened when he had awoken to find them gone. Black was eventually returned home by police officers, telling them that, apart from exhaustion, she was ‘fine’ and had simply ‘had words’ with her husband. The hearing was told events surrounding the her death were captured on a CCTV camera at the factory which bordered Black’s home. Mr Spencer said the youngster was . unwell with glue ear, a blockage of the middle ear, which meant that . Black, whose husband was still in hospital, had a ‘disturbed night . indeed with little sleep’. The . court was shown enhanced CCTV footage which showed the house lights on . throughout the early hours, and Black tending to Zoe, who was lying in a . cot near the patio doors. Judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall told Nottingham Crown Court she was satisfied that at the time of Zoe's death she was suffering from a 'severe mental illness' Mr . Spencer added that a neighbour recalled hearing Zoe crying at 7am . before a CCTV recording two hours later showed Zoe cradled in her . mother’s arms. Further . footage taken at 9.39am showed Zoe held under her mother’s right arm, . which, said Mr Spencer, ‘was in a way inconsistent with Zoe being . alive’. At 9.41am, Black was . filmed scaling a makeshift ladder she had constructed from garden . furniture to drop Zoe on the other side of the 8ft high wire mesh . security and into the factory car park. Minutes . later, CCTV showed Black scaling the fence and standing at the point . where she had dropped her child. She took with her a cordless phone and a . knife, which she used to inflict non-serious wounds on her own arms and . neck. Neighbours, paramedics and the police who saw Zoe’s body all said it appeared to be ‘damp’ or ‘wet’. Mr Spencer said the evidence ‘points inescapably that the defendant drowned Zoe’. ... 'You are suffering from a mental illness that makes it necessary that you be detained for treatment.' Mrs Justice Thirlwall . He added that Black told police who accompanied her to hospital: ‘Don’t bring Zoe back. She wanted to die. She’s been unwell because she’s been crying a lot.’ She went on to refuse to comment in police interviews, or tell doctors what had happened to her daughter - but did tell neighbours at the scene: ‘I don’t know what I have done. I am never going to be able to live this down. My head is spinning.’ Psychiatrist Mary di Lustro told the court that she and two fellow experts agreed that Black was suffering from a mental illness and personality disorder and concurred with the prosecution that she should be detained in a medium secure mental health unit under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act. Doctor di Lustro said if Black responded well to drug treatment she could be eligible for conditional discharge within two or three years but Dr Di . Speaking afterwards, Detective Inspector Mat Healey, who led the investigation for Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'This is a tragic case where, I am sure, the outcome offers little relief for those involved. 'I would like to commend those neighbours and friends who discovered Zoe's lifeless body and began, in vain, the distressing task of trying to revive her. 'It too has been a difficult case for officers to investigate and I would like to thank them for their professionalism and sensitivity which has been evident throughout.' Feeling 'low' after having a baby, . also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, . but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and . long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND). It . usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on . gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite . severe. Sufferers . may feel sad or low, unable to cope, and hostile or indifferent to their . husband, partner or baby.  They may have thoughts about death, be . unable to sleep, and feel hopeless about the future. Many . of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say . that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and . to be less severe. Post-natal depression usually develops within six weeks of giving birth. (Posed by model) Treatments for PND include . counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be very . effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered for . short-term use. Some . women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, . and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and . anxiety. Practical . and emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a . great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other . parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and . anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an . antidepressant. Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness . provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering . from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 . Monday-Friday 10am-2pm. Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401.","Amy Black, 40, snapped after a sleepless night with seven-month-old Zoe .

"By . James Rush . An obese boxing fan who lost eight stone on a year-long fitness camp in Thailand was detained by border guards on his way home because they did not believe he was the same person who had entered the country. Ross Connor, 33, slimmed down from 21 stone to 13 stone after he enrolled at a Muay Thai kickboxing gym in Phuket. But he hit problems when he tried to leave the country, with border guards detaining him for questioning, convinced he could not be the same person they photographed on his arrival 12 months earlier. Fighting fit: Ross Connor lost eight stone while on a year long training camp in Thailand . Training regime: Mr Connor paid £6,000 to enrol at the year-long kickboxing camp on the island of Phuket . Mr Connor only managed to negotiate his way on to a flight home after showing photographs on his iPod documenting his dramatic weight loss. Mr Connor, of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said: 'It was a worrying moment. 'I knew I’d lost a lot of weight, but I never expected they wouldn’t let me on the plane. 'But when they showed me the image taken on my arrival, even I had trouble recognising myself. 'After all my hard work, I thought I wasn’t going to get home to show my family the result of my year of training.' Boxing fan Mr Connor decided to take action in March last year after he put on so much weight he was having trouble walking and said he sounded like Darth Vader when he breathed.

Kickboxer: For 12 months Mr Connor worked out four hours a day in the heat and humidity of Phuket . He paid £6,000 to enrol at the year-long kickboxing camp on the island of Phuket. For 12 months Mr Connor worked out four hours a day in the heat and humidity. He said: 'I’d watch my idols boxing, and I thought to myself, if they can lose weight at a boxing camp before a fight - then so can I. 'I’d comfort eaten my way to obesity in such a short time and doctors told me if I carried on I wasn’t going to see 40. 'I thought I was in control, but before I knew it I was 21 stone and eating my way to an early grave. Slimmed down: Mr Connor said he was not strict with his diet during the year-long fitness camp, adding: 'I ate what I wanted - but the training regime was brutal' New look: Mr Connor decided to take action in March last year after he put on so much weight he was having trouble walking and said he sounded like Darth Vader when he breathed . 'I ate takeaways every night and never exercised. I avoided meeting friends, and talking to girls. Getting a date was just unrealistic, so I just stopped caring.' Speaking of his year-long slog, he said: 'I wasn’t strict with my diet - I ate what I wanted - but the training regime was brutal. 'I was ultimately living in a gym and training 24/7. 'It wasn’t a fat camp. People came to get authentic Muay Thai training, so they were quite fit. 'I was the fattest one there, bottom of the class, so I had to work twice as hard to heave my 21 stone around the ring.' Trainer: Mr Connor (pictured with one of his boxing trainers) said he was 'the fattest one there, bottom of the class, so I had to work twice as hard to heave my 21 stone around the ring' Delighted: Mr Connor said he is delighted with his new look and plans to return to the Thai gym in June to put in another six months of training . When Mr Connor entered Thailand his photograph was snapped and border guards also took a biometric image. Guards did not believe he was the same person until he showed them a diary of photographs from his camp. When they realised their mistake, they congratulated him and sent him on his way. Mr Connor said he is delighted with his new look and plans to return to the Thai gym in June to put in another six months of training. He said: 'I couldn’t be happier with the way it all worked out.'","Ross Connor slimmed down from 21 stone to 13 stone during fitness camp .

"By . Paula Kerr . Pam's life changed when she was 12 after moving to New Zealand to be closer to her sister . The day that changed my life prompted a move to New Zealand, where I fell in love with acting. It happened shortly after my 12th birthday. My older sister Barbara had emigrated to New Zealand with her husband and their tiny baby. I remained in Bridgend, Wales, with my parents, where my father worked for the police force. We didn't have a telephone at home, so one afternoon we arranged for her to call us at our local phone box. We all huddled around the receiver. It was a hugely emotional telephone call because in those days she may as well have been in another world. She'd travelled by boat, and letters and rare telephone calls were our only form of communication. It was wonderful to speak to my sister, but that telephone call upset all of us because we missed her so much. Weeks of debate followed until it was decided that we'd move to New Zealand, where my parents could see their grandchild grow up. I'd already had a nomadic childhood, caused by my father Fred's careers as a civil servant and with the police force. I was born in Germany and moved to Wales when I was six. I'd got used to being flexible about setting down roots and making new friends. Then, aged 13, I was transported to New Zealand. It was wonderful to be close to my sister again but there was so much more that I loved about my new surroundings. I remember not needing a winter coat and rarely wearing shoes because you could walk around barefoot. A couple of years later, I also had a lovely boyfriend with a speedboat. Welsh schooling was ahead of New Zealand's, so I was drumming my fingers with boredom in class. I enjoyed drama though, and my teacher encouraged me to join an amateur dramatics group, which I loved. Soon I knew I wanted to be a professional actress. Pam Ferris in one of her earlier acting roles in Connie - 1985 . I went on to train at a theatre company in Auckland and the more experience I gained, the more diverse roles I wanted to play. At 21 I was cast as Britannia, the nude, in the play The Entertainer. New Zealanders were a bit prudish, though, so I wasn't allowed to be starkers. I stood on a plinth, wearing three micro Union Jacks, which I was grateful for. As much as I adored my sister, her family and my parents, by the age of 23 I knew I had to return to London if I was to make a good living as an actress. It was a huge decision and a very painful one for all of us. Luckily the move to London worked out well for me. I got an agent and enough work to afford somewhere to live. Long before series like The Darling Buds Of May and the Matilda and Harry Potter films I was cast in wonderful TV dramas like The Rag Trade. My parents have passed away now but Barbara still lives in New Zealand, and these days we fly to see each other as often as possible. The older we get, the closer we become. And if it hadn't been for her phone call that afternoon, my life could have turned out quite differently. Series 3 of Call The Midwife is out now on DVD.","Pam Ferris' sister moved to New Zealand when she was younger .

"By . Ruth Styles . It's a British summer tradition, famous for its beautiful blooms and the occasional wacky garden design. Now the Chelsea Flower Show, which opens next week, has gone high fashion after Gucci unveiled its whimsical garden inspired by its classic Flora motif. The Gucci Flora Garden is designed by Sarah Eberle and includes many of the varieties immortalised in the print, which made its debut in 1966 on a silk scarf. Glamorous: Gucci's Chelsea Flower Show garden was inspired by its classic Flora print, designed in 1966 . Commissioned by Rodolfo Gucci, one of Gucci founder Guccio Gucci’s four sons, the Flora design has royal, as well as botanical connotations. In need of a suitable gift for Princess Grace of Monaco, Rodolfo commissioned artist Vittorio Accornero to create a floral pattern for an silk scarf, which he then presented to the royal instead of a bouquet. Accornero's design, which was completed in time for a visit to the Gucci boutique in Milan by the Monégasque princess, eventually included a riot of naturalistic flowers, fruit and insects and was dedicated to the four seasons. 'When I first joined Gucci, I immediately asked to see the archive, and it was there that I rediscovered the Flora pattern,' remembers creative director, Frida Giannini. Inspiration: The Flora print was created for Princess Grace of Monaco who visited the brand's Milan boutique . Pretty: The gorgeous Flora print has been revived for a new version of the £1, 480 Lady Lock bag . 'I remember chic women – my mother and grandmother among them – wearing Flora scarves in the 70s, and I’ve always been fascinated by the story behind the design and how it was created for Princess Grace. Although the silk scarves are no longer available, Gucci has launched a new version of its iconic Lady Lock bag featuring the canvas print. First introduced in 1947, the bag, which starts at £1,480, is made from canvas emblazoned with the flora print and includes the trademark bamboo cane handle specially made for the fashion house by artisan craftsmen in Florence. Almost there: The RHS Chelsea Flower Show opens on the 20th May and runs until the 24th . Hotly anticipated: Tickets have sold faster than ever this year, although Alan Titchmarsh won't be there . 'Flora was the very first iconic design motif from Gucci’s past that I decided to revive and reinterpret,' adds Giannini. 'Since then I have used it on bags, dresses, scarves (of course) and as the inspiration for a series of fragrances. 'I am so excited by the prospect of finally seeing Flora as a real garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show; there is something truly magical about this project.'

"By . Tom Latchem . By showing a different side to her character, Samia has even become unpopular with her fans . Fourteen years ago this week, fresh-faced 17-year-old Samia Ghadie made her Coronation Street debut as pretty kennelmaid Maria Sutherland. Since then she's taken centre stage in some of the show's most harrowing storylines: who can forget her heartbreaking stillbirth, or when she was widowed after just eight months of marriage? But for Samia things could have turned out very differently. Years earlier she was turned down for another part - the daughter of Des Barnes's girlfriend - when she was 11. 'Emily Aston, the sister of Sam, who plays Chesney, got it because she had ginger hair,' says Samia, 31. 'I remember crying on the sofa, saying, ""What's wrong with me?"" But now I'm glad I didn't get it because Corrie is huge and it could have been a shock to the system at that age.' Instead, child actor Samia - she started drama classes aged six - won roles in Children's Ward, Heartbeat and Doctors, before heading back to Weatherfield. 'At 17, having done other shows, I felt ready for it,' she says. One of Samia's disappointed rivals for the role was Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh. 'We've laughed about it since,' says Samia. 'And Kimberley's done amazingly with Girls Aloud, so I'm sure she doesn't mind she's not playing Maria. I definitely wouldn't want to swap with her - I love my life. And anyway, I can't sing!' Samia's enjoyed showing a different side to Maria recently - even if it's got her into trouble with fans. This week sees Maria's transformation from goody two-shoes to bad-girl complete as her bid to split up her ex Tyrone and Fiz ends in disaster. 'For once, I don't mind people slagging me off,' she laughs. 'On Twitter they all say how much Maria's annoying them! It's been nice getting a bad reaction. 'It's been challenging though, showing another side to her. After all the years of hurt it has to explode some time. She's been pretty sane, even with her husband Liam being murdered. But her boyfriend Marcus being gay and cheating on her with Todd really drove her over the edge. Thankfully my life's more settled than Maria's.' Samia describes her outfit a her first Bafta's appearance as her most embarrassing moment . Samia lives in Cheshire with hunky French ice skater Sylvain Longchambon, 33 - who she partnered on last year's Dancing On Ice - and her four-year-old daughter Freya by her property developer ex-husband Matthew Smith, who she divorced in 2011. Samia says, 'I have a really good family behind me. Mum's great and picks Freya up from school if needed, and Matthew is just around the corner, so he helps a lot, as does Sylvain.' Samia remains coy about their future plans, and when asked if she fancies getting married again she'll say only, 'I'm really happy as I am now.' Perhaps, given Maria's dreadful record with men, Samia's right to keep things the way they are. Cats or dogs? I love walking my dog, Sonny. He's a Maltese and is becoming a celebrity because I keep getting photographed with him! Holiday- sun or snow? The sun, as we don't get a lot of it in Manchester! Food- Middle Eastern or Asian? Lebanese. I grew up with it because my dad was Lebanese. British or American TV shows? I'm working my way through the box set of US series Californication, starring David Duchovny. It's rude but funny. Grease or Dirty Dancing? Dirty Dancing. Me and Sylvain always do 'the lift' when we've had a few drinks. Pop or rock? Pop. I like all sorts - from enya to Lady Gaga. My current favourite song is Hideaway by Kiesza. It's a great summer tune.","Samia's character Maria goes from goody two shoes to bad girl this week .

"By . Emma Innes . A hospital has become the first in Britain to trial a futuristic way of getting medications to patients quickly. Wexham Park Hospital, in Slough, is using Futurama-style tubes to deliver prescriptions. The series of pneumatic tubes shoot prescription medications to wards and departments all over the hospital. Wexham Park Hospital has become the first in the country to use a series of tubes to transport medications from the pharmacy to the wards. Image shows the shoots in the hospital's pharmacy . Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has also become the first in the country to automate their drug dispensary, by using two robots. The £600,000 automated drug robots, nicknamed Tom and Jerry, work automatically to sort through the mounds of different prescriptions before placing each medication in a tube, to be sent to the doctor in charge. The Dutch-made robots slash the waiting time for patients to receive their drugs by more than half. Chief Pharmacist Dennis Lauder said: 'Our whole ethos in pharmacy is patient safety. 'The number of dispensing errors is low at the Trust and is line with the national average. 'Nevertheless, we consider any error to be serious and the robots will certainly help to eliminate them. The hospital is also using robots to sort through prescriptions and to help distribute drugs (pictured) The hospital says the new system has more than halved the time it takes patients to receive their medication . 'We feel it's important to invest in and continuously improve our efficiency so that we can continue to provide a high quality and safe service.' The robots pick the correct medicines by automatically scanning the barcodes on the packaging, with zero margin for error. A spokesperson for the Trust said: 'It really is like Futurama. 'The robots do the work, sort out the drugs and then they shoot along these tubes to where they need to go. The hospital says the new system will prevent errors being made in the distribution of medicines . 'It is a revolutionary new system and nobody else has them yet. 'We can see it being the future of pharmacology in the NHS, especially for large hospitals like ours.' Within minutes, prescriptions are sorted and either handed out then and there or sent through the more than 200-metres of air tubes to the pharmacy department for staff to distribute. Mr Lauder added the robots can sift through more than 900 items an hour, and will reduce waiting times for medication from two hours to less than one, freeing up pharmacy staff to spend more time with patients on wards.","Wexham Park Hospital says patients now get medicines more quickly .

"By . Wills Robinson . A pensioner died from an allergic reaction to penicillin because part of his medical notes had been covered with a Post-it-note, an inquest has heard. John Dudding, 80, from Plymouth, Devon, was suffering from 'dizziness' and went to hospital so he could get better for his daughter's wedding. But doctors wrongly prescribed him with an antibiotic containing penicillin, because the sticky yellow paper was covering the allergy section of his chart. Tragically, he died three days after taking the drug at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and a week before his daughter, Kim Tremaine, walked down the aisle. Tragedy: John Dudding, 80, pictured on Saunton Sands beach in North Devon with his daughter Kim Tremaine, died after he had an allergic reaction to penicillin. He died a week before she was due to get married . The inquest in Plymouth heard on Tuesday that Dr Nicholas Batten, who prescribed the drug, was not aware at the time that the patient was allergic to penicillin. Mrs Tremaine told the hearing that her father had previously suffered from bowel cancer . and lymphoma, but believed he was getting better. She said: 'I . thought he had improved that much that I was going to leave. ‘Nurse Joseph came and injected into the catheter in his hand. As soon as it was administered she left. ‘Dad started shaking and I had my hand on his heart and chest asking if he was ok.' Ms . Tremaine and her family waited outside while doctors treated her . father, she saw him later and said, ‘His face was really red and swollen . to a point where he didn’t look like my dad at all. Ms . Tremaine thanked the nurse who looked after her father the evening . after the drug was administered, and said: ‘She was out guardian angel . in our darkest time.’ Doctors at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, did not see the allergy information on his medical chart because it was covered by a Post-it note . Dr Batten, who was in the first of . three years of specialist medical training at the time of the incident, . was instructed by Dr Elizabeth Howeson, to prescribe an antibiotic. He said he chose the drug because of protocols concerned with hospital-acquired chest infections and MRSA. ...‘Dad started shaking and I had my hand on his heart and chest asking if he was ok' He told the court: ‘We had been through the notes of his admission and past medical history. ‘In there would have been record of his allergy. That may not have been on my mind, I may have been focusing on the neurological problem. ‘I do recall when I lifted it there was a Post-it note on the drug chart. It almost becomes an automatic reaction to look at the allergy section and sadly on that day I don’t think I looked under the Post-it note.’ Nurse Shirley Joseph, who injected Mr Dudding with the drug, said she checked for allergies but didn’t see the warning because of the note. Both doctors said lessons had been learned from the incident. In an emotional statement, Dr Howeson said: 'It has made me much more careful to double check observation charts and drug charts. Missed: Mr Dudding died three days after taking the drug. An inquest in Plymouth heard how Mr Dudding had gone to hospital so he could be healthy for his daughter's wedding . ‘We rely on the fact our junior . doctors do their job well and there’s no harm having someone else check . and the more people check the less problems will occur.’ Dr . Charles Keene, from Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, performed a . post-mortem examination and said he found a cancerous tumour in Mr . Dudding’s lung, evidence of bronchopneumonia, coronary artery disease . and the spread of cancer to the kidneys. Dr Martin Mansell, who specialises in kidney problems, also gave evidence and said: 'If I was involved in Mr Dudding’s care I would have said that the outlook was hopeless probably on February 19 early on. ‘I would have thought there was something terrible going on in the brain. I would have said it would be a miracle for that patient to survive.' The inquest heard evidence from Mr Dudding’s son, John, and daughter Kimberley Tremaine. The hearing continues.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . and Victoria Woollaston . Meteorologists are predicting that the weather will go wild later this year. The cause is El Niño, a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific, which can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the world. But while scientists are anticipating a stronger-than-usual El Niño, many are warning that the planet is ill prepared to deal with the consequences. A spike in Pacific Ocean sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears this year's El Niño could be one of the strongest yet. El Niño, pictured left, is a warming of sea temperatures that can trigger floods and droughts. La Niña, pictured right, is when sea temperatures drop . El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. The average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C (approximately 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and globally. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. At the opposite end of the scale, La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño. La Niña refers to periods when sea-surface temperatures around the Equator are cooler than normal. This has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere. The more heat in the Pacific, the large the El Niño and right now a ball of warm water is crossing the ocean 490ft (150 metres) below the surface. A majority of weather forecasting models indicate that the phenomenon may develop around the middle of the year, but it was too early to assess its likely strength, the U.N. World Meteorological Organisation said on 15 April. Meteorologists claim the prospect of an El Niño will likely be firmed up 'in the next month or two', although forecasting its strength will be hard to do. The chance of it developing in 2014 exceeded 70 per cent according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. But according to a report in New Scientist, some El Niño researchers say forecasters are being too conservative. ‘One thing I hear over and over again is 'we do not want to create a panic', Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu told the magazine. One reason is that forecasting a big El Niño would increase food prices. ‘But it may be better to have this reaction at an early stage, when farmers can still adapt, rather than later,’ he said. The worst El Niño on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, pictured, that killed over 1,500 people. Australian climate experts claim the recent rises in sea temperature are above those seen in previous El Niño years and suggest this year's events will be 'significant' Researchers claim that California, which faces floods, is well prepared for emergencies. India is thought to have invested in water storage in event of a drought. Scientists' main concern is Central and South America, Asia and Australia. The worst El Niño on record in 1997 and 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, responsible for killing more than 1,500 people. A strong El Niño also increases fears that production of many key agricultural commodities in Asia and Australia will suffer. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. Here, the village of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, is seen flooded in January 2003 as a result of El Niño rains, which drove 16,000 people from their homes . The impact of this year's El Niño events is expected to be felt by every continent. During the 1997 to 1998 events, damages were said to have been in the region of between $35billion to $45billion. Beachfront homes in Malibu, California, pictured, collapsed after two weeks of high surf under El Niño weather conditions . Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Niños, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns. The new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. Extreme El Niño events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years. The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent. In January, a team of international . scientists said extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El . Niños are expected to double over the next century. Climate . scientists warned countries could be struck by devastating droughts, . wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years. The team, made up of experts from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CoECSS), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO, also  spotted a link between global warming and extreme El Niño events. ‘We currently experience an unusually strong El Niño event every 20 years. Our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years,’ said Agus Santoso of CoECSS, who co-authored the study. ‘El Niño events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming,’ he added. Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Niños, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Scientists in Germany recently said they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance. They hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires, pictured in the Philippines. Meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 El Niño will be firmed up 'in the next month or two' This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns, which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. The impacts of extreme El Niño events that extended to every continent across the globe in 1997, for example, killed around 23,000 people. Dr Cai continued: ‘During an extreme El Niño event countries in the western Pacific, such as Australia and Indonesia, experienced devastating droughts and wild fires, while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of Ecuador and northern Peru.’ In Australia, the drought and dry . conditions caused by the 1982 and 1983 extreme El Niño led to the Ash . Wednesday Bushfire in southeast Australia, which resulted in 75 deaths. The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events.

"By . Deni Kirkova . A 17 stone woman who was 'mortified' by her holiday pictures vowed to shed her extra weight and did so in spectacular fashion - dropping seven stone and completing a beach babe transformation. Keri Irvine, 23, from Liverpool went on a trip to Benidorm, Spain, with her friends last year and felt she looked 'slim and nice' - but her photographs told a different story. The former Primark sales assistant tipped the scales at 16 stone 11lbs and seeing how large she had become was a shock. Keri Irvine on a trip to Benidorm with her friends last year (l) and after her transformation in just a year (r) Since Keri began a strict diet programme her weight has plummeted seven stone - and she is turning heads wherever she goes, weighing a svelte 10 stone. Thrilled Keri said: 'I was mortified when I saw the holiday photographs. I honestly didn't realise how big I was until seeing them. 'I'm going to Turkey this year so the bikinis will be coming out and there will be no covering up.'I will be showing of my body now I'm able to fit into smaller clothes. 'I have always been a shy girl but in Benidorm I never wore a bikini because I looked huge. I didn't realise I looked so big, though. 'Going out of a night I never really got attention, I just wore T-shirt and shorts on the beach and in the night long dresses to cover up.' Unhappy Keri would binge eat on junk food like crisps, cakes, fizzy drinks and sweets to make herself feel better. Kari was horrified by her holiday snaps and seeing how big she was was the final straw before she took action . In a typical day, the brunette would tuck into a Kit-Kat or chocolate bar for breakfast, her lunch would be a sandwich, chocolate biscuits with Coca-Cola and tea would be pizza. Confidence boost: Keri says she enjoys the attention her new body shape brings . After every evening meal, which was always something 'quick and easy', like a microwave meal, she would gorge herself on ice cream and puddings. But the 5ft 5in beauty ballooned to an unhealthy weight and fatty foods began to take their toll on Keri's body. Three years ago, she had to have her gall bladder removed because her diet of junk food caused gall stones. After seeing the holiday photos she finally joined slimming plan Herbalifeplan - and is now a brand distributor. Keri said: 'Herbalife have a range of foods, like protein bars, vitamins and formulas for milkshakes to fight the flab. The F1 shakes have all the nutrition your body needs to get you through the day. 'I did the plan because it fits in with my lifestyle if I’m on the go I can just take my shake with me or my healthy snacks. 'I lost the weight because I was depressed and ashamed of how I looked. I hated going into shops and having to buy bigger sizes it was embarrassing. I also knew I needed to lose the weight for my health and after seeing holiday snaps from Benidorm I knew I had to take action in getting into shape.' Morning : A biscuit- something quick . Lunch time: A sandwich and crisps . Dinner time: Microwave meal with a side or pizza and garlic bread . Snacks: Crisps,cakes, biscuit, Coca-Cola . Morning: F1 Herbalife shake and beverage teaMid-morning: Fruit or a protein barAfternoon: Shake with tea againMid-afternoon:  Fruit or a protein bar or a small healthy snack and teaDinner time: Chicken or fish with veg . *Shakes are a large part of the diet until target weight is reached. They are then used to help maintain. She said: 'I was depressed had no social . life because I was too scared of what people would think of me. I never . talked to boys because I thought they would not like me because of my . weight. 'I hated . going out the shop and having to buy size 20 clothing so I would just . binge eat to make the feelings go away - but obviously things got worse, . a lot worse. 'I used to be a size 18 to 20 but now I can just pick up a size 10 without trying it on, I feel like a new woman. 'When I walk down the street or I'm out in town boys I can see boys looking at me, they never used to and it's nice. 'I . don't have a boyfriend yet though but I've got a better chance at a . relationship now I'm not so overweight - so I'm sure it's only a matter . of time.' Keri will stop having Herbalife products every day on her strict diet regime when she reaches her target weight of nine-and-a-half stone. She then plans to continue to eat healthy months - and use the shakes or low fat snacks to help hr maintain her new weight. She was a size 18 to 20 but now can just pick up a size 10 without trying it on .","Keri Irvine, 23, from Liverpool went on a trip to Benidorm last year .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . With luminous colours and alien-like features, these mesmerising mushrooms look like they belong on another planet. But from glow-in-the-dark caps to delicate pastel gills and even slimy stalks, they all grow on Earth in an array of diverse and mysterious forms. Australian photographer Stephen Axford, 62, has spent 12 years snapping the fungi. An eerie sight: With luminous colours and alien-like features, these magical mushrooms look like they belong on another planet. There are thought to be 65 species of luminescent mushrooms such as the Mycena chlorophos pictured - which use a reaction that emits light when water and oxygen are present so they glow 24 hours a day, but are visible at night . ‘This project came together all by itself,’ said the resident of Melbourne, who started photographing mushrooms across Australia in 2002. ‘As I collected more and more photos it became obvious that I should do something with them, as it would be such a pity to just collect them and then let them die with me without any one seeing them. ‘I am very fortunate in that I live in a place that has plenty of fungi, and when I started photographing fungi, I knew nothing about it. Hidden treasure: Australian photographer Stephen Axford, 62, has spent 12 years snapping the fungi, some of which glows in the dark. These specimens appear to be holding silver pearls and looks slightly like an oyster . Deserves a fanfare: This Panus fasciatus is known as the 'hairy trumpet' and looks as it if should be growing on another planet. However the fungus can be found in Australian woods and forests and often grows from rotting logs. These specimens appear to be providng a temporary home for a small stripy insect . ‘Now I am learning not only their names and how they survive, but also a little of how they fit into the world and the importance of the role that they play. ‘Many plants and animals could not survive as they rely on fungi to provide them nutrition’ From monstrous specimens measuring 16 inches (40cm) in height to tiny fungi just one millimetre in size, Mr Axford photographs them all. Lighting up the woods: Bioluminescent mushrooms emit light 24 hours per day but are best observed at night. There are about 85,000 species in the fungi kingdom and around just 65 of them are thought to be luminescent. Here, Mycena chlorophos illuminate pitch-black woodland . Gloriously glossy: From monstrous specimens measuring 40cm in height to tiny fungi just one millimetre in size, Mr Axford photographs them all. This specimen has a large, irregular cap that appears to be glossy . When they are too small to see with the naked eye, he uses a macro lens to reveal the fungi’s beauty. A fungus is any member of a large group of eukaryotic organisms that includes micro-organisms such as yeasts and moulds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. Mr Axford said: ‘I live in an area of New South Wales that used to be an old volcano, so it has rich volcanic soil and lots of rain mainly in the summer. Alien Invasion? When the fungi are too small to see with the naked eye, he uses a macro lens to reveal their beauty. This Mycena Interrupta looks a little like an alien. The species does not glow-in-the-dark but matures to have a brilliant blue cyan cap . Diverse: A fungus is any member of a large group . of eukaryotic organisms that includes micro-organisms such as yeasts and . moulds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. They come in many shapes and sizes. Hygrocybe viscidocruenta is pictured left and Mycena Interrupta right with its pretty cyan caps . Could have starred in Ghostbusters: Hygrocybe graminicolor (pictured) is charmingly known as the 'slimp green waxcap' as its luminous green body is coated in a thick, glutinous substance. It only grows in wet rainforests to the south of Australia . ‘This is perfect for sub-tropical fungi which thrive in summer and so about half of my photos are taken at my home and the rest mostly from close by. ‘My pictures show the beauty in the world, but they also stimulate me to find out more about how the world fits together. Under the sea? This Panus fasciatus looks as if it should live beneath the waves in a tropical reef but it can be found in the forests of Australia. Its delicate gills  curl upwards and the caps have delicate hairy details . Delicate: Mr Axford lives in an area of New South Wales that used to be a volcano, so it has rich volcanic soil and lots of rain in the summer. Such conditions are necessary to support incredible structures such as this mushroom, which has impossibly delicate gills . Like little flowers: Marasmius Haematocephalu look like flowers and play an essentialrole in forest ecosystems by helping to break down the litter layer of the forest floor. They are small and are often overlooked by collectors . ‘I also try to make the colours true - though the lighting will enhance that at times. Most people love my fungi photos which encourages me to keep taking them. ‘I try to get as many people as possible to see them, in the hope that they will stimulate an interest in fungi, and I think this is working.’ It's best side: The photographer waits for the perfect lighting conditions to showcase the fungi in all their glory. Anthracophyllum archeri is pictured, which is also known as the orange fan. Masses of the fungus can cover dead twigs in the forest . It can leave its hat on: Mycena viscidocruenta is also called the ruby bonnet. It has a blood-red cap with a darker red dimple at its centre as well as pink gills and a deep red stem. It is most commonly found in the south east of Australia .","Photographer Stephen Axford from Melbourne, has spent 12 years capturing the mushrooms of New South Wales .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From the building of vast pyramids to religious life and burial practices, life in ancient Egypt was very different to our own. But modern vegetarians may have more in common than they thought with the ancient Egyptians, because it is thought that they also ate a diet composed largely of vegetables, fruit, wheat and barley. Archaeologists have thought for a while that most settled ancient populations survived on a vegetarian diet and now carbon isotope analysis has given experts a better idea than ever before of what the ancient Egyptians ate. A team of researchers studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies that lived in Egypt between 3,500BC and 600AD to discover that they ate a lot of barley and wheat over the long period, suggesting that they adapted to the region incredibly well, as evidenced by farming scenes painted on the walls of tombs (pictured) A team of researchers from the University of Lyon studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies that lived in Egypt between 3,500BC and 600AD. They found that all the mummies ate a lot of barley and wheat, indicating that the Egyptians were skilled farmers. The ancient people ate mostly 'C3' plants such as garlic, aubergines, pears, lentils and wheat, but less than 10 per cent of their diet was made up of C4 seeds such as millet and sorghum. They ate remarkably little fish, according to the study. This has surprised some experts because  archaeological evidence has proved otherwise and there are a lot of paintings in tombs showing people fishing with nets and poles. A team of researchers from the University of Lyon studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies of people that lived in Egypt between 3,500BC and 600AD. They found that they ate a lot of barley and wheat over the long period, suggesting that they adapted to the region incredibly well. The finding also echoes many paintings in Egyptian tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat to make loaves of bread, which are often offered to god of the afterlife, Osiris. Carbon atoms are taken in by plants from carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis and carbon ends up in human bodies by eating the plants or by eating animals that eat the plants, Live Science reported. Scientists can investigate a person’s diet by studying the isotopes carbon-12 and carbon-13, which have slightly different masses. Keen fishermen? Surprisingly the study revealed that the mummies had not eaten much fish in their lifetime. It has previously been assumed that the ancient Egyptians ate fish, which they caught in the Nile, as seen in paintings in tombs. A relief showing net fishing is pictured . Plants are divided into two groups: C3, which includes garlic, aubergines, pears, lentils and wheat and C4, which comprises millet and sorghum, which are seedy grasses. C3 plants take in less carbon-13 than the C4 group so researchers can work out what people ate by measuring the ratio of the two isotopes. If a person ate a lot of C3 plants, the concentration of carbon-13 isotopes in their body will be lower than if they mainly ate foods from the C4 group. Research leader Alexandra Touzeau, of the University of Lyon, explained that they took samples from bones and teeth instead of hair, collagen and proteins like in other studies. ‘We also worked on many different periods, with not many individuals for each period, so we could cover a very long time span,’ she said. The scientists compared the carbon isotope ratios with those measured in pigs, which had been fed on a strict diet of different proportions of C3 and C4 food. The animals have a similar metabolism to humans so the carbon ratios could be compared to the mummies’. Using their loaves: The finding that Egyptians ate a lot of wheat echoes many paintings in Egyptian tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat (pictured is a painting from the Tomb of Menna circa 1,400BC) to make loaves of bread, which are often offered to god of the afterlife, Osiris . When the results were also compared to isotope ratios in the hair of modern European vegetarians, the experts could confirm that the ancient Egyptians were mostly vegetarians, eating a diet based around wheat and barley. They found that C4 seeds made up less than 10 per cent of their diet, but surprisingly that the mummies had not eaten much fish in their lifetime. It has previously been assumed that the ancient Egyptians ate fish which they caught in the Nile, as seen in paintings in tombs. The results of the carbon tests appear to contradict such cultural evidence. Kate Spence, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, said: ‘There is abundant evidence for fishing in Egyptian wall reliefs and models and fish shows up in offering lists.’ ‘All this makes it a bit surprising that the isotopes should suggest that fish was not widely consumed.'","Researchers at the University of Lyon, studied carbon atoms in mummies of people who lived in Egypt between 3,500BC and 600AD .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new oat cereal claims to reduce cholesterol levels as effectively as low doses of statins - but will cost around £1 per bowl. Betavivo has been shown to cut high cholesterol and blood sugar levels in scientific trials. It contains beta-glucan, a soluble fibre derived from oats which is known to positively impact on heart health. The Swedish makers of the cereal claim that one serving a day can cut cholesterol by around 10 per cent and cut the chances of heart disease by 25 per cent. A new oat cereal claims to reduce cholesterol levels as effectively as a low dose of statins . A bowl of Betavivo provides 3g of beta-glucan. Most healthy oat cereals contain around a quarter of this amount and porridge just a third. Trimb Healthcare, which makes Betavivo, claims a daily bowl of the cereal for eight weeks or longer is the same as taking a 20mg dose of statins every day. The new cereal has received approval from the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) and has been welcomed by heart health charity HEART UK. Dr Charlotta Buch, from Trimb Healthcare, said: 'Statins are a powerful drug and are effective at reducing cholesterol but our product does not have the bad side effects. 'The only side effects are positive. 'Typically the cereal can reduce cholesterol by around 10 per cent if eaten every day for more than eight weeks. This is the same as a low dose of statins. 'If you are on a higher dose, you could have the option of reducing your dose of statins and therefore reducing the chance of side effects such as muscle pain.' Up to seven million people in the UK are on statins, costing the NHS around £450million a year. Dr Buch added: 'The compliance rate for statins in the UK is only 50 per cent so we know patients are concerned about the side effects. Betavivo provides 3g of beta-glucan, a soluble fibre derived from oats which is known to positively impact on heart health. Trimb Healthcare who make the cereal claim that one serving a day can cut cholesterol by around 10 per cent and cut the chances of heart disease by 25 per cent . 'Betavivo is scientifically proven to reduce cholesterol which is a major risk factor in heart disease. 'For those who won't take statins because of side effects, it's an all-natural alternative. 'It's also a product that's suitable for diabetics and anyone who wishes to control their blood sugar levels and is therefore at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Beta-glucan works by dissolving in the stomach to form a gel that binds bile acids. As the liver produces new bile acid it 'draws' cholesterol from the blood and carries these out of the body. Beta-glucan also slows down the uptake of sugars so that insulin response is reduced after every meal. This . means people stay fuller for longer and are more likely to stick to a . healthy diet without the need for snacking between meals. Trimb . says it uses only oats which will produce high quality beta-glucan . molecules and then uses a process to increase the concentration of these . in production. Linda Main, dietitian at HEART UK, said: 'Betavivo is a cholesterol lowering product and cholesterol is a prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 'It contains 3g of beta-glucan, which is great. Porridge typically only contains 1g. 'I would say this is for people on statins who want an additional cholesterol lowering effect or for people not on statins who want to lower their cholesterol as a preventative measure. 'Potentially you might be able to lower your dose of statins by eating it and taking positive lifestyle measures. 'As you get older your cholesterol gets higher and if you are eating a product like this you may be able to avoid increasing your statins dose.' Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, today agreed that positive dietary changes could be effective in lowering cholesterol. However she warned against patients abandoning statins without consulting with their GP. She said: 'It is possible for people to lower their cholesterol by changing their diet and being physically active. 'However, statins are prescribed if someone is assessed to be at significant risk of having a heart attack or stroke. 'They have been scientifically proven to reduce this risk and millions of people take them safely. 'If a person wishes to stop taking their statin they are advised to discuss the risks of doing so with their GP.' Betavivo will be available in health . stores and major pharmacists from September. Trimb Healthcare say it . will cost around £1 per daily serving.","Betavivo found to cut cholesterol and  blood sugar levels in scientific trials .

"By . Sophie Borland . Women struggling to conceive have a right to receive treatment, according to NICE guidelines . The health watchdog yesterday told NHS managers to stop refusing women IVF, warning it is having a ‘devastating effect’ on their lives. NICE has been forced to issue new guidance to local trusts over concerns there is a postcode lottery in the availability of treatment to couples struggling to have a baby. Women under 40 unable to conceive naturally are meant to be offered three courses of IVF on the NHS while those aged 40 to 42 should be offered one. But figures show that three-quarters of the 211 GP-led bodies fail to adhere to these rules. This includes six which do not offer any fertility treatment at all. NICE – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – has also told trusts not to refuse women treatment just because their husbands or partners have children from previous relationships. Professor Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive of NICE, said: ‘Infertility is a recognised medical condition that can affect people of any age and has a potentially devastating effect on people’s lives. ‘It can cause significant distress, depression and can possibly lead to the breakdown of relationships. ‘Unfortunately, we know that not all areas are following our guidance. This creates variations in treatment within the NHS, which is disappointing and goes against the fundamental aims of the NHS.’ The latest rules also remind organisations to offer cancer sufferers and other chemotherapy patients the chance to freeze their eggs before as the treatment can leave them infertile. But last month, a 25-year-old artist was refused the £4,000 procedure by her NHS trust in Thanet, Kent, as it disagreed with the policy. Elizabeth Rose suffers from a severe form of Crohn’s disease and is about to undergo a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, which is likely to trigger an early menopause. NICE first issued its guidelines telling NHS trusts to offer at least three cycles of fertility treatment in 2004. But, more than a decade on, most still fail to comply. The watchdog warned the 'postcode lottery' is leaving couples struggling to conceive 'devastated' A survey of the 211 GP-led bodies called Clinical Commissioning Groups earlier this year found that just 24 per cent offered the recommended three rounds of IVF. The guidelines are not enshrined by law so CCGs draw up their own policies depending on their budgets. Typically, IVF costs £3,500 a cycle – or £10,500 for three – and managers are reluctant to fund it. Sarah Norcross, co-chairman of the National Infertility Awareness Campaign, said: ‘It’s high time patients were allowed to access the treatment they are entitled to.’ She added that NICE’s action will make it clear ‘exactly what is needed to bring the unfair postcode lottery approach to an end’. Last week, Commons leader and former health secretary Andrew Lansley said CCGs had ‘responsibility’ to obey NICE’s guidelines even though they were not law. The issue was raised by Tory MP Caroline Dinenage, who told how women in her Hampshire constituency are offered one round of IVF up to 35 and refused thereafter.","Fears rising over 'postcode lottery' failing couples struggling to conceive .

"By . Mark Prigg . It may look like something from the film Alien, with a strange snout and rows of terrifying teeth. However, in fact this is a catfish believed to only exist in a small part of India. The rare creature has baffled scientists, as it appears to be unrelated to every other catfish. Scroll down for video . Alien or fish? Kryptoglanis shajii, a small subterranean catfish sees the light of day and human observers only rarely, when it turns up in springs, wells and flooded rice paddies in the Western Ghats mountain region of Kerala, India . Based on its teeth and subterranean home, Lundberg said that Kryptoglanis most likely eats meat, in the form of small invertebrates and insect larvae – whatever might be found in the groundwater and could be captured by the fish, which at less than ten centimeters is smaller than an adult human’s pinkie finger. The fish can move swiftly in its environment, as evidenced by video footage of collected fish darting through water to grab food. Called Kryptoglanis shajii, the small subterranean catfish has only occasionally been found in springs, wells and flooded rice paddies in the Western Ghats mountain region of Kerala, India. It was first described as a new species in 2011. Soon after that, John Lundberg, PhD, one of the world’s leading authorities on catfishes, started taking a closer look at several specimens. 'The more we looked at the skeleton, the stranger it got,' said Lundberg of Drexel University, who's paper was published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 'The characteristics of this animal are just so different that we have a hard time fitting it into the family tree of catfishes,' said Lundberg. From the outside, Kryptoglanis does not look particularly unusual for a catfish. But when Lundberg and his colleagues looked at its bones using digital radiography and high-definition CAT scans, they found it was missing several bony elements – a characteristic fairly common for subterranean fish. Researchers likened the fish to the monster from the film Alien . But there were also changes in the shapes of certain bones, changes so strange that Lundberg described them as 'completely unique among catfishes and all fishes as far as I know.' Numerous individual bones were modified in the face, giving the fish a compressed front end with a jutting lower jaw – like a bulldog’s snout, if a bulldog also had four rows of conical, sharp-tipped teeth. Multiple changes piled up in one part of the body could mean there is a functional purpose for those changes. 'In dogs that was the result of selective breeding. In Kryptoglanis, we don’t know yet what in their natural evolution would have led to this modified shape,' Lundberg said. The small subterranean catfish sees the light of day and human observers only rarely, when it turns up in springs, wells and flooded rice paddies in the Western Ghats mountain region of Kerala, India. Kryptoglanis most likely eats meat, in the form of small invertebrates and insect larvae ¿ whatever might be found in the groundwater and could be captured by the fish, which at less than ten centimeters is smaller than an adult human¿s pinkie finger.

When Lundberg and his colleagues looked at its bones using digital radiography and high-definition CAT scans, they found it was missing several bony elements ¿ a characteristic fairly common for subterranean fish. But why Kryptoglanis is so different, and what its closest relatives are, remains a mystery. At the same time, a separate team led by Ralf Britz at the Natural History Museum of London independently examined the bone structure of Kryptoglanis using a technique of visualizing the skeleton called clearing and staining – a chemical method in which the fish’s soft tissues are rendered as clear as glass and bones and cartilage are stained in contrasting colors. This team’s description of the structures was published in the March 2014 issue of the journal Ichthyological Exploration of Freshwaters. 'There was an amazing congruence between the results,' Lundberg said. 'Neither of us was way out.' However, Neither could figure out which other catfishes Kryptoglanis was most closely related to, although Britz’s team chose to assign it to its own new taxonomic family within the order of catfishes. 'It continues to be a puzzle,' Lundberg said.","Found in the Western Ghats mountain region of Kerala, India .

"By . Damien Gayle . Edging slowly out of her dry dock at Barrow-in-Furness, this is the third of the Astute class submarines that will take the Royal Navy's fighting capabilities into the 21st Century. The 97m long, 7,400 tonne nuclear-powered attack submarine Artful has cost taxpayers more than £1billion but, along with its sisters, sets a new standard in weapons load and stealth. Armed with both Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, Artful's design marks a shift away from a Cold War focus on anti-submarine warfare to a concept of 'Maritime Contributions to Joint Operations'. Scroll down for video . Artful, the third highly-complex Astute class submarine designed and built by BAE Systems for the Royal Navy, appears outside her construction hall for the first time . Facts and stats: Armed with Spearfish torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, Artful's design marks a shift away from a Cold War anti-submarine warfare . The Tomahawk cruise missiles she will carry are claimed to have an accuracy of just a few metres over a range of within 1,240 miles, giving Artful the ability to support ground forces anywhere in the world. More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask the vessel's sonar signature, meaning she slips through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin. Yet her sonar is said to be so powerful it can detect ships leaving harbour in New York City from a listening point below the waters of the English Channel, 3,000 nautical miles away. Artful got her toes wet for the first time yesterday, more than 24 hours after she first emerged from the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. She was officially named last September by Amanda, Lady Zambellas, wife of the Royal Navy’s First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas. Stealth: More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask Artful's sonar signature, meaning she will slip through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin . Hunter: Yet her sonar is so powerful it can detect ships from 3,000 nautical miles away - equivalent to the distance between the English Channel and New York . Expensive: The 97m long, 7,400 tonne nuclear-powered attack submarine Artful has cost taxpayers more than £1billion . Stuart Godden, Astute Programme Director for BAE Systems, said: 'The launch of Artful is another significant step forward in the Astute programme. 'Building on past experiences we’ve been able to launch her in the most advanced state of construction of any submarine to be built in Barrow.

It’s testament to the experience and careful planning of the team involved that Artful is now ready for the next phase in her programme.

The Ministry of Defence’s Director Submarines, Rear Admiral Mike Wareham, said: 'The Astute programme is making real progress and the sight of the third submarine afloat in the water is a reflection of the hard work of both the MOD and industry. 'The launch of this submarine brings it a step closer to entering into service where it will provide a key capability for the Royal Navy and an essential component of the Submarine Service into the future.' BAE Systems, the prime contractor in the Astute programme, is the UK's only designer and builder of nuclear powered submarines - one of the most complex engineering programmes in the world today. The first two submarines in the Astute class – HMS Astute and HMS Ambush – have now been handed over to the UK Royal Navy, while the remaining five are in various stages of construction.","Artful and her sisters in the Astute class set a new standard in weapons load and stealth .

After being convicted of the double murder of her two teenage children earlier this week, the twisted hand-written journal that allowed a jury to find Julie Schenecker guilty has been released, painting a picture of a bitter and evil mother struggling to deal with her bipolar disorder and abuse of drugs and alcohol. The at-time incoherent notes, which were written in a school book that belonged to her 13-year-old son Beau, were made public as Parker Schenecker spoke out about his former wife's trial and how he can now finally move on. The retired Army Colonel said he agreed with jurors rejecting Schenecker's insanity defense, believing she was acting with a sane mind when shooting dead her son and 16-year-old daughter Calyx in Tampa in January 2011. 'I think there was a resentment from her for a lot of circumstances,' Parker Schenecker told WTSP. 'There were some things that she had done that she was now having to take responsibility for, and I do think she was desperate, angry and upset just as the prosecution laid out to the jury.' Guilty: Julie Schenecker, right, listens to the closing arguments as the trial into the double murder of her children comes to a close on Thursday. The diary she used to document her murderous thoughts have now been released . Sentenced: Schenecker cries and puts her head in her hands as the judge sends her to life in prison . Closure: Parker Schenecker, pictured in court on Thursday, said the verdict won't bring his children back but it will help the family move on . Victims: Calyx, 16, and Beau, 13, were murdered by their mother in Tampa in 2011. She shot them both in the head for being 'mouthy' Haunting: Pages from Julie Schenecker's journal which was used as evidence during her murder trial. In the stomach-churning notebook she detailed her plan to kill her children and then herself, however passed out before she could commit suicide . Parker Schenecker said he has found solace over the years by keeping in touch with the friends of his children. 'You know, I'm still a father,' he said. 'I'm still a dad, whether Beau and Calyx are with me here on Earth or not. And that's what this really boils down to. 'Dads love and honor their kids forever.' Schenecker's murder trial culminated in the blue spiral notebook that was left sitting on her bed, Tampa Bay Online reported. Soaked in blood, it was turned to her last entry on January 27, which read: 'We're going Home today. Take us home Lord.' Following a three-year investigation, jurors turned to its pages during their deliberation, reading aloud how she planned to buy a gun, kill her children and turn it on herself. She had planned to kill herself after murdering her children, the prosecution said, but passed out through a combination of pills and alcohol before she was able to. In her journal, one entry read: 'I offed Beau on the way to practice. I accidentally shot the window then shot him. One in the side of the head and one in his mouth because he became so mouthy just like Calyx.' Another entry, about her daughter, read: '[I] walked up without [Calyx] reacting, and shot her in the right temple. Then shot her in the mouth, her sassy little mouth.' It took the jury just two hours to find the 53-year-old guilty. Taken away: Schenecker looks at her family as she is led out of court. Before she left, she apologized . Chilling: Schenecker writes exactly how she plans to shoot her children, Beau and Calyx, worrying that she will have to reload the gun . Some pages were completely coherent while others contained nonsensical ramblings. Here Schenecker has simply written: 'You're a failure.' The wide-ruled, single-subject notebook - a staple of drugstore school supply aisles - belonged to Schenecker's 13-year-old son, Beau, whose name is written neatly on its cover along with the subject 'Language Arts' Trial: Parker Schenecker examines evidence at the trial of his wife. Prosecutors claimed Juilie Schenecker killed their children in anger at him . Along with warnings of a coming 'massacre' and her promise that 'the evil starts Thursday', Schenecker devoted pages to planning what should be done after she and her children were found dead. 'I have no idea where to do the memorial service,' she wrote, suggesting a few possible locations, including the Tampa Palms Golf & Country Club. She wanted their bodies to be donated to science, but she also asked to be cremated and have her children's ashes mixed with hers. Her clothes should be given away, she wrote, and wanted her family and girlfriends to be informed of her passing. 'Maybe post it on facebook,' she wrote, listing her username and password. 'Everyone I know & love is on facebook.' Schenecker also worried her children would become bipolar like her. 'If you're wondering why I decided to take out the kids it's to protect them from embarrassing them for the rest of their lives,' she wrote. She devoted an entire page to listing the things Calyx had supposedly wronged her. 'Sprayed lysol in my face when I came in from smoking,' she wrote. 'Wants to euthanize one of the cats.' 'said recently ''If I commit suicide it's all your fault!''.' Plea: Schenecker, pictured being led into the courtroom on Thursday, had tried to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, but a jury found she was sane at the time of the killings . Beau had been her 'ally' she wrote, and Calyx had been the 'bully'. At the top of one page she wrote only: 'You're a failure.' In the hours after she killed her children, she returned to the journal. 'I have really lost my mind. . . I'm so sad, my two babies! It was too easy to take them out.' The prosecution said Schenecker's motive was anger and resentment toward her . husband, saying she intended him to come home and find his family dead. Schenecker now faces a life sentence after the possibility of a death penalty . was ruled out. As she was sentenced to life in prison with no parole, Schenecker addressed the court, saying: 'I shot my son and daughter, I don’t know why,' Fox 13 reported. She apologized for the killing and, through tears, said: 'I know my children are I heaven. I want people to try to find comfort and meaning, as I do, that they are in no pain.' 'I'm prepared and accept your sentence. 'I apologize, I apologize to everyone in this courtroom who I have broken, the lives I have destroyed. I hope they can collect themselves as best as possible. All of us. Not just this courtroom - anybody who knew our family, Calyx and Beau, our children's friends, teachers, coaches, our relatives, aunts, cousins, grandparents, uncles, nieces, nephews, everyone has been so deeply affected and I understand that there are people affected by this that maybe just read about in the paper, maybe a child looked at their mommy and said, ""Mommy are you ever going to shoot me?"" I know that this could happen, and I apologize for what happened, what I did. I take responsibility. I was there. 'I know I shot my son and daughter. I don't know why. But I have a period of time to try to understand that. 'Your honor, the judicial system in the U.S. is the best in the world. We don't lash our women 125 times for driving when they're not supposed to drive. I'm proud to stand here in front of you, as I understand you might be prior service as well. And to serve my country, and I proudly said the first code conduct as a soldier, in 83, I said - I said, I'm an American fighting man [sic], serving in the forces which protect our country and our way and our way of life, an I’m prepared to give my life in their defense. I said that proudly, it changed, we’re no longer by men, we’re fighting in the forces which protect our country. 'It’s our trust and I believe in you and what you’ve done. You’ve run a great court. I have no experience, from what I’ve seen, you control the court tremendously well. I thank my attorneys who supported me, and I trusted them and they worked so well. And all those people behind me on my team, put in many, many hours on this case. I will never be able to repay all these people, I have no way to repay, but to say thank you. So thank you to the entire American judicial system. I am not playing you're honor, and that is heartfelt. 'I have one more... I know our children are in Heaven. I want people to try to find comfort and meaning as I do that they are in no pain. And they are alive and enjoying everything and anything Heaven has to offer, Jesus protecting them and keeping them safe until we get there, and their loved ones follow us to join them. That’s all your honor, I appreciate you letting me speak.'","Julie Schenecker found guilty of double murder on Thursday .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Most airlines begin life as major government-owned projects or as the ambitious playthings of billionaires with endless piles of cash to spare. Not as start-ups funded via a whip-round on the internet. But such is the curious situation with a . new high-end carrier which intends to come to life via the decidedly . modern money-raising method of ‘crowd-funding’. Taking off: Odyssey Airlines plans to operate business-class flights from London City airport . A London-based entrepreneur has announced plans for Odyssey Airlines – a business-class only operation which will fly between the British capital and New York from 2016 – assuming that the $8.5million (£5million) needed can be sourced from small investors. ‘Crowd-funding’ has developed as a concept in the last two or three years. Close to the action: Flying from London City will help the airline cater to business class passengers . Usually, it sees funds to support a medium-sized idea – a rock band without a record label trying to record an album; a fledgling film-maker trying to produce a documentary – raised from a large number of small backers rather than a single financial giant. ‘Crowd-funding’ also tends to occur via an internet petition, with social media used to spread the word to possible interested parties. It has not yet been used to help the development of something as sizeable as an airline. But Adam Scott, a former Goldman Sachs banker, and the CEO of Odyssey Airlines, is confident that the money to make his dream reality can be found via this method. ‘By using an online crowd funding platform, we are offering an investment that is accessible to a large and diverse number of potential investors,’ he says. Prior example: Silverjet operated as a business-class-only airline between 2006 and 2008 . Scott is using the crowd-funding website Crowdcube (crowdcube.com) as his chosen portal. The project has already raised funds from other sources, and hopes to be in business within two years, offering a premium transatlantic service. Mooted flight routes include New York and Toronto, with all services taking off from London City airport, close to the Docklands business hub in the east of the capital. Odyssey will reportedly use Bombardier C-series aircraft, with 40 fully-reclining flat-bed seats to cater to passengers travelling for business purposes. However, Odyssey will not be the first airline to aim solely at the suit-and-tie market. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) recently announced business-only flights between Stavanger, on Norway’s west coast, and Houston in Texas – a service designed to appeal to executives needing to zip between these two oil-industry hotspots. And in February, Qatar Airways announced an exclusively business-class service between Doha and London Heathrow. Flights are due to begin on 15 May. Luxury in the skies: Despite catering solely to business-class flyers, Silverjet ceased to trade in 2008 . While investors will hope to see a profit on their money if they assist in the crowd-funding of Odyssey Airlines, they should perhaps also be wary of a recent precedent. Silverjet was a business-class-only airline, which flew out of London Luton, and served New York-Newark and Dubai between 2006 and 2008. Despite a positive start, the airline ran into economic turbulence as the financial crisis of 2008 took hold, and ceased trading after a mooted buy-out failed to come to pass.","Odyssey Airlines hopes to raise £5million via online crowd-funding website .

"By . Rory Dollard . Liam Rosenior has called on his Hull team-mates to treat their FA Cup near miss as the start of a new journey, not the end of their ambitions. The Tigers played their part in a wonderful Wembley final on Saturday - their first ever appearance at such a showpiece - taking a 2-0 lead over firm favourites Arsenal inside just eight minutes. They were hauled back in by the Gunners, who forced extra-time before Aaron Ramsey secured a 3-2 win - and the club's first trophy since 2005 - with a clinical finish. Raise your ambition! Liam Rosenior doesn't want Hull to rest on their laurels of an impressive season . To even reach a cup final far outstripped the ambitions of Hull, who had targeted only Barclays Premier League survival on their first season back in the top flight. Now Europa League football beckons next term and Rosenior expects the squad's expectations to be revised upwards based on recent efforts. 'We want to be successful and we can't rest on our laurels now,' said the full-back. 'We want to grow as a club, we don't just want to stand still. 'The Premier League is the best league in the world and we want to make sure we are stabilised in it for years to come. We also want to come back here and have more days like this one. 'I'm proud to play for this football club because it's a special one and the fans are fantastic. 'Hopefully we've done them proud. When the time comes I'm sure I'll enjoy this too but at the moment it still hurts.' Dream start: James Chester gave Hull the lead in the opening minutes of the FA Cup final at Wembley . Like Rosenior, midfielder Stephen Quinn has spent much of his career outside the Premier League.Both performed impressively on the grand stage and the Republic of Ireland international, who scored in the semi-final, took huge pride in the underdogs' display. 'We're so proud of each other and I'm proud of all the lads in that dressing room,"" said Quinn. 'We were so close but when you have top quality opposition like Arsenal there's no shame in losing. 'The fans were excellent and the last couple of trips to Wembley have been great for them. 'They made a big sound and I'm sure they had a good day. 'They know how hard we've worked and I'm sure they're proud of all the boys. 'Getting safe in the Premier League and reaching the FA Cup final, it's the best season in their history.' Childhood dream: Captain Curtis Davies is consoled by Steve Bruce (R) after losing 3-2 to Arsenal . Captain Curtis Davies, whose close-range finish put the Tigers two ahead following James Chester's opener, was battling mixed emotions after the match. He took defeat harder than most but still acknowledged he has experienced possibly the biggest moment of his career to date. 'I might sit down in a couple of days and realise that I have lived a boyhood dream,' he said. 'I've played in a cup final, I never thought I'd score in a cup final, but for now it's just a feeling of devastation. 'People are saying how we gave them a great game, but we might as well have been beaten 5-0 and never have been in it. 'To be 2-0 up and lose any game is devastating, but when it's a cup final for a trophy and a medal....this is one of the worst feelings I'll ever have.'","Hull City lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley .

Brendan Rodgers will urge Liverpool to shoot their way to the title as he insisted they have the firepower to overturn Manchester City’s goal advantage. Liverpool will reclaim top spot on Monday if they beat Crystal Palace, but while both Liverpool and City can finish the season with 86 points, the latter’s goal difference (+59) is nine superior. Liverpool, like City, have scored 96 times this season and Rodgers has faith his side can secure two huge wins against Palace and Newcastle to edge ahead. He concedes Liverpool are second favourites but he is not convinced City will take maximum points from their last two fixtures. Scroll down for video... Open the floodgates: Brendan Rodgers wants his side to shoot their way to Premier League glory . SOS SAS: Liverpool's Luis Suarez (L) and Daniel Sturridge are the most feared partnership in the league . ‘If there is any team that can score goals and turn it around, it will be us,’ Rodgers said. ‘That will be our aim. We aim to score goals and be defensively strong. I have seen it before. Chelsea beat Wigan 8-0 in the last game of the season (in 2010). ‘I am not paying any disrespect to Newcastle at all — but what we are saying is if there is a team that has shown it can score goals, it is us. ‘We are not a 1-0 team. That is what gives us the chance. It’s the team that scores the goals that will win.’ Playing catch up: Manchester City have a superior goal difference of nine heading into the final games . Sharp shooters: Man City edged past Everton 3-2 on Saturday to take their goal tally for all competitions to 150 . He added: ‘Manchester City need to win all their games — they will have won five games in a row and have only done that once this season, so it will be a wee bit new for them as well. It is not over by a long way.’ Outscoring City is a romantic notion, but the reality is that Liverpool will need to show great mental strength to get a result at Selhurst Park on Monday evening. Losing to Chelsea was a huge blow and they were dealt another when City clung on for three points at Goodison Park. ‘I just believe that if we can win our two games, then it will go a long way to deciding whether we finish at the top,’ said Rodgers. ‘But the first thing is concentrating on our game, which we have done all season, and that is Crystal Palace.’ Where Eagles dare: Liverpool face Crystal Palace's much improved defence under Tony Pulis . Despite Liverpool’s title bid, Palace manager Tony Pulis insists that Rodgers should not be manager of the season — it should be Hull’s Steve Bruce. Pulis himself is a contender for the prestigious accolade after guiding Palace to Barclays Premier League survival when they looked certainties to be relegated before his appointment in November. ‘Taking Hull, an unfashionable club, keeping them up and reaching an FA Cup final is fantastic,’ said Pulis. ‘Sometimes it’s the managers who haven’t got the resources but been successful in their own ways. ‘It’s nice to look further than the top of the tree sometimes.’ Watching Brief: Probable teams for Monday night's game between Crystal Palace and Liverpool .","Liverpool trail Manchester City by a goal difference deficit of nine .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The smells of sun cream, fish and chips, and candyfloss are among the most powerful aromas that can transport us back to holidays of our past, according to a new survey. A study of 2000 people has unearthed the 40 most evocative scents that trigger memories of childhood, school days and family trips to sunny destinations. The fabulous fun of frying: The smell of fish and chips is among the aromas that carry us back to old holidays . A British favourite: The smell of fish and chips is powerfully redolent of seaside holidays . And, in a sign that many of us gaze back fondly to sepia afternoons at fairgrounds in British seaside resorts like Blackpool, Bognor or Skegness, the smell of hot sugar and gaudy colourings that is a stick of candyfloss has emerged as a hugely potent throwback. Other aromas that convey us back to long-ago holidays include the batter and grease of traditional fish and chips (ideally eaten out of old newspaper), sun lotion and bubble gum – the latter being redolent of trips to the sweet shop with pocket money to spend. Sugar and spice and all things nice: Candyfloss is another trigger smell for old memories . The research was commissioned by Disneyland Paris to mark the launch of its new ride Ratatouille – The Adventure, in July. Sensory expert Professor Barry Smith, of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says that smell is the most emotive of the five senses. ‘More than any other sense, smell can evoke powerful, emotional memories,’ he says. ‘Whole scenes of people, places and things can be brought back to life by the mere hint of a long forgotten scent. Drifting back through the years: Smell is the most powerful of the senses for triggering memories of past times . ‘The rooms in a friend’s house, a boat trip, the sound of a voice – all can be conjured up by a smell’s power to reproduce the scenes for us.’ ‘Whether it’s a seaside holiday, a visit to a fairground or a sunny walk through a forest,’ he continues, ‘suddenly smelling a particular scent can take us right back there, re-creating the whole sensory experience.’ Other aromas to carry us back to earlier days include freshly mown grass (indicative of school sports days), bonfires (long winter nights) and popcorn (trips to the cinema). Once upon a time: Sun cream is another potent trigger scent for transporting us back to our childhood breaks . Our receptiveness to smells also varies according to location and gender. The survey shows that people in Northern Ireland are most responsive to aromas that conjure memories of people and places. And women are shown to be 20 per cent more likely than men to recall distant memories from a trigger scent.","Aromas such as fish and chips are powerful triggers of holiday memories .

Saints training ground sources have . told Sportsmail that Osvaldo was already an unpopular member of the . squad following his club record £15million arrival from Roma in the . summer. A large number of players no longer want forward involved in the first-team once his club ban expires. 'He (Dani) is not the most popular of people among the football staff,' said a Saints insider. He has not done much to get along with his team-mates and hasn't made much of an effort to contribute to the team-spirit. 'He comes across as arrogant and that he is too good for the club and that has rubbed players up the wrong way.' Back in 2013, Manchester City’s hugely talented, but often unpredictable striker, Mario Balotelli, came to blows with then-manager Roberto Mancini. The 22-year-old was ordered off the field for a late lunge on teammate Scott Sinclair during training. When he steadfastedly refused to leave, the City boss shoved him towards the touchline and attempted to physically drag him from the field – resulting in a scuffle, which needed the intervention of two coaching staff to bring to an end. Andy Carroll broke fellow Geordie Steven Taylor’s jaw in a fight at the Newcastle training ground, after he found out that his ex-girlfriend had been sending text messages to Taylor. Although Carroll got his comeuppance, as he was out for a spell with a hand injury, Taylor came off worse, missing the rest of the season. Notorious troublemaker Joey Barton attacked teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training session at Manchester City’s Carrington ground. Dabo claimed he was hit several times and was left ‘disfigured’ from the attack, whilst Barton was arrested and later pleaded guilty to a charge of assault. This fight was the final straw for Barton’s City career and he was swiftly sold to Newcastle. Despite this bust-up not happening on the training pitch, it deserves a special mention. Leicester teammates Dennis Wise and Callum Davidson got into an argument over a game of cards at the team hotel during pre-season training in 2002. The war of words escalated into a full on punch-up, which resulted in Wise breaking Davidson’s nose and jaw. Unsurprisingly, Wise later got the sack. A routine training game descended into chaos at West Ham when John Hartson kicked teammate Eyal Berkovic in the face. The dramatic act – caught on camera by a fan - occurred after Berko reacted angrily to the Wales striker’s attempt to simply help the Israel international back to his feet, after he had brought him down in a challenge. Berkovic was hospitalised and unable to eat for two days.","Saints trying to sell record signing Dani Osvaldo after 'brutal' training-ground incident .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Police want to speak to this man after two 22-year-old women were attacked near Sydney Road in Brunswick on Saturday . A third woman has been sexually assaulted in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick, less than a week after two other similar attacks. In the most recent incident, the woman was grabbed from behind by an unknown man on Hope Street at approximately 8pm on Friday before he tried to sexually assault her, according to Victorian Police. A passer-by was said to have disturbed the offender, causing him to run away. No further information has been released to date, but police have mentioned that the latest attack is not suspected to be linked to the earlier assaults. All three attacks occurred as separate incidents near the scene of Jill Meagher’s brutal 2012 abduction. The sex predator who attacked two young women last Saturday, told one of his victims it was the first time he had struck, police said. A 22-year-old woman was dragged into a side street off Sydney Road in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick at 2.20am on Saturday while she was walking home from a hotel. The unknown man grabbed her from behind and indecently assaulted her. She managed to break free and ran back onto Sydney Road where she flagged down a friend who was driving past in a taxi. Police believe the man assaulted a second woman on nearby Charles Street just minutes later on the same night. The woman, also 22, was similarly grabbed from behind and wrestled to the ground. She managed to escape and ran home. Detective Senior Constable Dean Solomon said both women fought back when they were attacked. 'They have defended themselves so fiercely that in the end I think he has just given up,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'While (one woman) was trying to defend herself, he said that he was homeless and this was the first time that he'd done this sort of thing,' Det Snr Const Solomon added. Neither of the two women were physically injured during the attacks. Police have released an image of the man they are looking for. He has been described as around 180cm tall with a thin build and a fair complexion. He was wearing a dark-coloured or blue hoodie, blue jeans and a t-shirt with a white print on it. Saturday's attacks happened in close range to where Jill Meagher was last seen on Sydney Road back in 2012 . Police say the same man might have also approached other women in the area about the same time. Jill Meagher was raped and killed as she walked home along Sydney Road in September 2012. Her attacker, Adrian Bayley,  was on parole at the time of the crime. He was sentenced to life in prison with a 35-year non-parole period in June last year.

"By . Emma Innes . A leading respiratory expert has warned that the UK is sitting on a lung disease ‘time bomb’. Professor Luca Richeldi, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Southampton General Hospital, said idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is responsible for 5,000 deaths annually, is increasing at a rate of 5,000 new cases a year. The condition, one of a group of disorders known collectively as interstitial lung disease, causes inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue. Professor Luca Richeldi says the UK is sitting on a lung disease time bomb (file picture) It leaves sufferers with a life expectancy of three to five years. It is estimated that IPF affects around 15,000 people over 60 in the UK, mainly men and former smokers, but can affect anyone and its cause is unknown. The disease often goes undiagnosed until the onset of symptoms - such as shortness of breath and coughing. As a result, intervention with the only available treatment, the anti-fibrotic drug Esbriet, can only slow down progression of the disease. Professor Richeldi said: ‘Nationally, the number of people suffering from IPF and other interstitial lung diseases is increasing by thousands every year, but the cause is often unknown. ‘As a result, the majority of patients are diagnosed late when their life expectancy has been cut extremely short.’ More than a quarter – 28 per cent - . of patients being treated at Southampton General Hospital's respiratory . centre have some form of interstitial lung disease, with four to six new . cases presenting every week. Professor . Richeldi said the numbers demonstrated there was an ‘urgent need’ to . develop a quick and simple way of diagnosing early IPF. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - the lung condition that Professor Richeldi is concerned about - is most common in men and former smokers but it can affect anyone . As a result, he has relaunched a study he began in Italy to discover if electronic stethoscopes - usually used to listen to the heart - can detect early signs of the disease. He said: ‘In particular at a time when treatments to slow disease progression are becoming available, we urgently need to develop a quick, cheap and simple tool to increase the number of patients treated early in their disease course. ‘We believe using electronic stethoscopes to identify distinctive sounds, which we already know are similar to ripped Velcro, could alert clinicians to people who might be developing the early stages of the disease. ‘They could then be sent for chest high-resolution CT scan to confirm the diagnosis, ideally before they become symptomatic, and give us the opportunity to start an appropriate close monitoring programme and intervene before the condition has taken hold.’","Professor Luca Richeldi says idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is killing 5,000 people a year and that there are currently 5,000 new cases per year .

"By . Eleanor Steafel . A carrier pigeon that delivered the crucial first SOS message which relayed the news that the British forces at the Battle of Arnhem were in trouble is to be honoured at an exhibition next week. Three days into the daring battle which, if it had succeeded, would have brought World War Two to an end by Christmas 1944, the desperate troops sent the carrier pigeon named William of Orange back home as a last-ditch attempt to make contact after their radios failed. An exhibition on January 18-19 in Blackpool will celebrate all 32 carrier pigeons that won the prestigious Dickin Medal - the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. William of Orange brought back the first message from the Allied troops who were under fire at the Battle of Anherm . William of Orange did his duty to the Allied forces efficiently, flying the 260 miles back to its loft in Knutsford, Cheshire in just four hours and 25 minutes. The note attached to William's foot relayed the message to the British authorities that the Paratroopers at Arnhem Bridge were cut off and in desperate need of airborne support if they were to fight the German forces. General manager of the Royal Racing Pigeon Association, Stewart Wardrop, said William's story deserved recognition. William of Orange (left) was awarded the Dickin Medal (right) - the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross . William flew the 260 miles from the Dutch/German border back to Cheshire to deliver the message . He said: 'William of Orange isn’t as well known as other pigeons that won the Dickin Medal but his story is quite remarkable. 'It took William four hours and 25 minutes to fly 260 miles back to Britain which was a record. 'When you consider he would have been cooped up in a cage for days and then released under fire by the Germans and then flew over 135 miles of open water with no navigation points and still returned home, it was quite an achievement. Troops at the Battle of Arnhem, where the Allied forces faced up to the German troops in September 1944 . 'Sadly he did not arrive home in time to save the men who were overcome by the Germans over the next two days.' William nearly didn't get home at all, as at first he proved reluctant to leave the men at the battle. While under fire, two soldiers tried to launch the bird off from one of the bridges on the Dutch/German border, but it refused to budge. The Battle of Arnhem was known at the time as Operation Market Garden. It was one of the boldest plans of World War Two and, if it had succeeded, would have ensured the war ended by Christmas 1944. Allied and German troops clash on the Dutch/German border, September 1944 . 30,000 British and American airborne troops were to be flown behind enemy lines in September 1944 to capture the eight bridges that spanned the Dutch German border. British tanks and infantry were to meet the airborne troops at the bridges and cross them. The plan was conceived after the D-Day landings in June 1944 by General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the British forces in Europe. Over three days, the Allied airborne forces tried to parachute in, while tanks and infantry made their way to the bridges. They were surrounded by German troops and were eventually forced to fight their way out. 1,984 British soldiers were killed and 6,854 captured - a disastrous defeat for the Allied Forces. German artillery controlled the river only 2,500 British soldiers made it out alive. It would be another four months before the Allies crossed the Rhine again in early 1945. The war dragged on for another seven months until September 1945. It was only when one of the soldiers fired his Sten gun into the air the pigeon was spooked and flew off into the night. William had been trained for this mission by the National Pigeon Service and assigned to the Royal Corps of Signals. He was given to the service by his owner Sir William Proctor Smith in 1942. Troops under fire at the Battle of Arnhem on the Dutch/German border in September 1944 . For Operation Market Garden he was selected to accompany Two Para, commanded by Major John Frost, who was played by Anthony Hopkins in the epic 1977 film 'A Bridge Too Far'. William of Orange was awarded the Dickin medal in 1945 - the 21st animal to win it. The award is the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross and was set up in 1943 by Maria Dickin, who was the founder of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. William was eventually brought out of service by his owner for the considerable sum of £135 (now £3,500) and lived for another 10 years.

"By . Alicia Vrajlal . Australian actress Cate Blanchett says women are subjected to unfair judgment when it comes to balancing work and motherhood because of stereotypes that are 'complete rubbish'. The 45-year-old Australian actress and mum-of-three spoke out about the 'raft of judgement' levelled at women who play mothers on screen, while promoting her new film How To Train Your Dragon 2 in Cannes. The award winning beauty criticised how she was always asked about her ability to maintain a balance between working on high profile films and looking after her three sons. 'It's a certainly a question that's never asked of men. The question is only ever directed towards of women,' the actress said according to the Telegraph UK. Scroll down for video . Award winning actress and mother: Cate Blanchett stuns the crowd at the Cannes Festival on Friday and speaks out about the stereotypes imposed on working mothers in the industry . Mother of three: Cate was spotted with her three sons Dashiell, 12, Roman, 10, and Ignatius, six, earlier this year at Disneyland . Cate stars as a mother in her new film who is reunited with her son after abandoning him earlier on and she explained that the scrutiny that she faces off camera transcends to her onscreen performance. 'When anyone plays a mother on film, there is a whole raft of judgment in that a mother is a particular archetype or that every mother is the same,’ the actress said. ‘That's complete rubbish,’ she continued, adding that the film touched on this issue ‘beautifully and deeply’, serving the storyline well. Cate and her husband of 16 years, screenwriter and playwright Andrew Upton, 48, have three sons, Dashiell, 12, Roman, 10, and Ignatius, six. The Blue Jasmine actress also expressed her frustration at how such a focus on women was still existent in 2014. Celebrity couple: Cate who is married to screenwriter Andrew Upton has questioned why men are not asked about how they balance their lives as working fathers . Emphasising the fact that women are still paid less in practically every industry, the blonde beauty said she was appalled that the current situation made her feel like she was back in the Middle Ages. ‘I’m an actress at a film festival. I can cope with the questions, I'm a big girl.  But it does surprise me that we're still asking those questions,’ she said. And it looks like the international star was disgruntled about the attention placed on women beyond their motherly personas. She admitted that she finds it a ‘little bit rude’ when actresses like herself are scrutinised for their red carpet attire. Cate had Hollywood talking during the Screen Actors Guild Awards earlier this year, when she shunned a camera man for scanning the camera lens up and down to capture all angles of her exquisite body. But she said that the Cannes film festival is a bit more of an exception, as grand fashion is in essence a part of the event.","Blanchett annoyed by question of how to balance work life and motherhood .

"By . Joel Christie . Updated: . 23:03 EST, 17 May 2014 . Not many girls from New Jersey can lay claim to shaking hands with a chimp named Ricky at the age of three, or being scooped up by an elephant at seven. But Amelia Forman is no city kid. She's actually more of a jungle girl. Now 15, her mother, award-winning photographer, Robin Schwartz, who’s worked for the likes of National Geographic and has prints in the MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has 12 years worth of photos of her daughter cozying up to exotic creatures. The project officially took flight in 2004, spawned by a sudden family tragedy. Animal nature: Amelia Forman, pictured here at Grandpa's beach in Easthampton last year, has been posing for her photographer mom, Robin Schwartz, for 12 years . Gothic: Now 15, Amelia has started putting her own print on the photos, such as styling the costumes . Instinctual: The teen says she feels more comfortable around animals than she does people . Amelia Forman poses with the family pets . 'My mother and mother-in-law died quite close to each other and it knocked me for six,' said Schwartz. 'After that though, I realised that it was so important to spend time with my daughter. 'So we came to the understanding that if she was to come with me on my photographic work our deal would be that the only times I would take pictures of her would be when she was with animals. 'She loves them, she is so natural with them. 'She is a shy girl, but can have more confidence with a giraffe, or a chimpanzee than a fully grown man or woman could have with another person. The unusual photographs have been compiled into a book called Amelia and the Animals . Amelia has bottle-fed tiger cubs, nuzzled deer in the woods while wearing a black wizard's cloak, and straddled an elephant¿s trunk as if riding a rope swing . As she grows older, Amelia has started taking a keen interest in fashion . 'We spend time most summers attending fairs and meeting contacts in the animal community, where Amelia can come close to elephants like Shiba, who simply picked her up with her trunk. 'That was a magical moment for me and Amelia. It really was like Amelia was talking to Shiba, just like you would with a person. It was beautiful.' While their adventures has already produced one book, Amelia's World, The Aperture Foundation is trying to raise funds on Kickstarter for another that encompasses the whole journey, to be called Amelia and the Animals. 'Since I was only three, it seemed sort of normal just to know monkeys and a lot of different animals,' Amelia says in the Kickstarter video, 'until I got older and I realized that wasn’t something that most kids had the opportunity to do.' Give me a lift: Shibu's trunk lifts Amelia off the ground as she poses for this photograph. She is believed to have been seven-years-old . Go on, gives us a cuddle: Amelia bonds with chimp Ricky during a visit to an animal park . 'I love animals and work with them quite extensively,' said Robin Schwartz, who lives in New Jersey. 'I had produced a series called ""Primate Portraits"" and through that I had built up a network of contacts in the animal community in New York state and subsequently through other parts of America. 'As part of my work with chimpanzees, lemurs, gibbons and smaller monkeys inside a circus family in 2002 my daughter was sometimes there and she was photographed. 'The first time was when she was three years old and she met a young chimp named Ricky. 'Their rapport was instant and they were great together. They just sat there kissing and became firm friends instantly.' In this image taken many years ago, Amelia gently strokes the head of a camel . The youngster takes being with Louie, an emu nearly as tall as her, in her stride . Robin says she is aware of photographing Amelia around wild - albeit highly trained - animals. 'I don't want to put my daughter in harm's way,' said Robin. 'But things can happen any time with anyone. The animals are partly pets, I talk to the owners. 'It is a risk, just like walking to school. 'This is a way for us to spend time together and brings my daughter and me to the animals we both share a deep love for. 'We both feel lucky to get this close.' Cosy chat: Giraffes Geoffrey and Twig move in for a tete-a-tete with Amelia in this picture taken in 2010 . Time for a nap: The youngster has a nap as she gets up close to these kangaroos . 'The one thing that upsets me most is when people ask me if being close to large giraffes, kangaroos, elephants or chimpanzees is scary. 'It isn't at all, I am not scared around them, we respect each other. 'If I don't like the feeling I get off one animal then I will not go near to it. We are cautious .

"By . Kevin Keane . A teenage cycling fanatic has been forced to apologise to the winner of Dublin’s Giro d’Italia stage – after taking a selfie with him on the ground. David McCarthy, 19, became a figure of hate on social media for taking a picture with cyclist Marcel Kittel while the star was sitting on the roadside exhausted and gasping for breath. He was bombarded with abuse on social media after posting the picture on his Instagram account, with the caption: 'Kittel collapsed after the line today so instead of giving him a hand up I took a selfie'. David McCarthy apologised for taking selfie (left) with collapsed . cyclist Marcel Kittel. He received abuse on social media after he was caught . taking the snap by a spectator (right) Moments earlier, Kittel had sprinted to a . stage win in front of 50,000 people on Merrion Square to complete the . Armagh to Dublin leg of the race. The photograph drew a barrage of criticism towards Mr McCarthy, with cycling websites and members of the cycling community condemning his behaviour. The teenager said: ‘Within five minutes people were calling me a w*****, calling me a loser.’ It is believed many of those who saw the picture were under the mistaken impression that Mr McCarthy had posed in front of Kittel following a crash. Mr McCarthy, from Fermoy, County Cork, said he just got swept up in the moment. ‘I didn’t mean it in a bad way,’ he said. ‘I was standing on a post box 100metres behind the line, I hopped off it and there was Kittel beside me. He added: ‘There were a load of photographers around so I thought “he won’t mind one more camera being there” so I just went down and literally I was down there and out in two seconds.’ Within minutes of posting the picture to his Instagram account, Mr McCarthy faced a barrage of criticism. Sprint finish: Marcel Kittel (left) and team Giant Shimano crossing the finish line to win the third stage of the Giro d'Italia from Armagh to Dublin on Sunday . Exhausted: German cyclist Marcel Kittel collapsed after crossing the finish line . ‘Last night I turned off my phone when I went to bed because the amount of abuse I was getting,‘ he said, adding that some of the comments really hurt him. ‘I had put it up on Instagram and was getting awful abuse on it. I was reading through the comments and it was getting worse and worse so I just said, I don’t need this negative energy coming at me”, so I just deleted it. I hope now it will just pass on.’ He has since removed the picture from his social media accounts. Mr McCarthy said that so far as he knew, Kittel wasn’t offended by his behaviour: . ‘One of his teammates messaged me and said that Kittel will see the funny side of it. He didn’t really care and he wasn’t too bothered about it.’ Mr McCarthy issued an apology to Kittel and all the people he offended yesterday in which he said he did not think the photo would cause such hatred towards him. Apology: A message which McCarthy sent to Irish cyclist and pal Nicholas Roche, which was posted on Twitter and retweed by Kittel . ‘I got excited after the finish to see Marcel and wanted a photo and in hindsight looking back I understand the time and place was completely wrong,’ the apology read. The apology was tweeted by Irish cyclist Nicholas Roche to his 70,000 followers and drew a humorous response from Marcel Kittel who tweeted McCarthy, telling him that he had learned his lesson. ‘So did I when my Grandma found me playing with fireworks next to our barn full with dry hay,’ the German sports star wrote. Roche also stood up for the teenager, telling his Twitter followers that ‘Dave is a nice kid’. McCarthy knows Roche through an Irish youth development cycling team that Roche mentors. Mr McCarthy hopes one day to turn professional himself and said since Roche defended him the abuse has lessened. ‘Nico is really nice, he is an idol for me and would be my role model. I was really upset with the whole thing and I just messaged him and I said I was really sorry about it and he gave me advice on what to do. I wrote the message and he tweeted it and once it went out people started changing their tune when people saw that I was sorry.’ Yesterday, Kittel’s Team Giant-Shimano confirmed that the German rider – who also won a stage in the North – will not compete in the rest of the Giro because of a ‘fever.’","David McCarthy, 19, posed for a pic with collapsed cyclist Marcel Kittel .

"By . Ryan Parry In Los Angeles . The wife of severely ill radio legend Casey Kasem is desperate to become a reality TV star, the MailOnline can reveal. Former actress Jean Kasem, 59 – who is currently at the centre of a bitter family feud over the care of her husband – wants to make a return to the lime-light. The statuesque blonde had a small role in the 1984 hit movie Ghostbusters but is best known for playing the ditzy wife of Nick Tortelli on the hit '80s sitcom Cheers. Scroll down for video... Returning tot he limelight: Jean Kasem, 59, had a small role in the 1984 hit movie Ghostbusters . Chtarring role: Jean is best known for playing the ditzy wife of Nick Tortelli on the hit 80s sitcom Cheers . It's war! The simmering battle between Jean Kasem, 59, left, and Kerri Kasem, one of Casey Kasem's three children with Linda Myers (pictured right with Kerri) has spilled out dramatically and publicly this week . Happier times: Court papers reveal how Kasem's three children from his previous marriage, Kerri, Michael and Julie were on good terms with Jean until his health deteriorated. But for seven years they have been fighting over who cares for him with Jean claiming they showed 'disturbing' behavior and want to secure his $80m . She has rarely been seen on television screens since - spending most of her time caring for 82-year-old husband Casey. But a source told MailOnline: ‘Jean hasn’t been on TV for many years, she runs her own business and has invested a lot of time caring for her husband, but she’s keen to get back in the spotlight. ‘She’s spoken to producers about having her own reality show and I know she was desperate to get on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.’ Last year Jean admitted her interest in starring in hit show RHOBH that is currently in its fourth season, and said she was in talks with producers at Bravo. It was rumored she was being lined up to replace departed show stars Adrienne Maloof and Camille Grammar. The move never transpired but sources say she is still keen to sign a deal for her own show. Fame-seeking: MailOnline understands that Jean is desperate to join the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills . New family: Kasem married Jean, a statuesque actress in 1980, a year after his divorce. They went on to have a daughter together, Liberty, pictured with them above. She is now 23 and firmly sides with her mother . 'Wicked': Jean claims in court papers seen by MailOnline that she has unfairly been portrayed publicly as the villain in all their wrangling. She says the children have done nothing but 'disgrace' their father . Jean certainly has enough housewife credentials, she has been married to radio icon Casey since 1980. The couple have a $10million home on the edge of Beverly Hills where she lives with her daughter, aspiring singer Liberty, 23. Liberty is desperate to launch her singing career and would no doubt be keen to star in a reality show alongside her mom. Her official website describes Liberty as a pop singer who performs in and around LA. Her bio states her showbiz parents initially tried to dissuade her from pursuing a career in music but she began writing songs from a young age. It adds: ""Liberty is carrying on a proud tradition for an entirely new generation of radio listeners and fans."" Liberty is extremely close to her mom and just last week she pledged her undying love for Jean on Facebook. In a passionate message posted on Mother's Day, Liberty wrote: 'Mom I love you your my best friend I would die without you! We are one!!!' There’s certainly no doubt that a reality show starring the Kasem clan would be packed with drama. Frail: Kasem (pictured here in 2009) has suffered terrible health problems. At first doctors thought he had Parkinson's and dementia. But now they have diagnosed him with Lewy body dementia that has left him unable to speak and bed-ridden for most of the time . Home help: Jean claims she was an excellent carer for Kasem while they lived at the mansion. While his children used to visit every Sunday, she says in court papers, she put a stop to them because of their behavior . Jean is currently at the center of a row over his husband’s health-care which last week sparked an international man-hunt for her frail husband who was reported missing. Casey has since turned up on ‘vacation’ with his wife in Port Orchard, Washington. But his older children from a previous marriage are furious that Jean took their dad away from the Berkley East Convalescent Hospital in Santa Monica where he was being cared for. Casey was secretly moved without his gurney and all his medical equipment was gone. He suffers from Lewy body dementia, a progressive disease. 'Wildchild': Liberty, who describes herself as a singer/songwriter, has given Jean public support. On Mother's Day, she wrote: 'Together we stand together and we shall not fall!!!' Upset: Jean says in court documents that Kerri, Julie and Michael have . ‘single-handedly and irreparably shattered the lives' of Kasem, Jean and Liberty (above) and have 'vilified their stepmother' Money, money, money: Kerri dismisses Jean's claims that the children are after his money and control of his will. Kerri said: 'She's out of her mind. As I've said all along, we're . not going to contest the will. She can take the house. We just want our dad back' His daughters contacted the authorities and the media and claiming had been 'kidnapped' and was being 'hidden' by Jean. But when police found the star they said he was 'cognizant' and did not appear in distress. The MailOnline has also revealed how Jean and Casey’s children, Kerri, Julie and Mike are embroiled in a bitter seven year legal battle over Casey’s ongoing medical care. Accusations that Casey was abused by his wife Jean have been hurled around. His daughters branded her a ‘wicked’ step-mom, while Jean blames their ‘disturbing’ behavior for splitting the family up. And shocking allegations of harassment and threats as well as lively street protests outside the family home have sparked endless rows. Bad blood: In her submission to the court she makes her feelings known about Kerri's claim on her father's care. She writes harshly that they are the children from a 'prior marriage long ago'. Kasem is pictured here with his first wife Linda Myers and a child, thought to be Kerri .

"By . Sarah Dean . A woman is staging a grass roots protest after the council have ordered her to rip up the $10,000 synthetic lawn she planted on land that belongs to them. Gold Coast City council reportedly claimed the fake grass 'could trap someone wearing stilettos'. But Diane Padbury reckons the man-made lawn she installed at a nature strip 'looks great' and is actually helping the environment by saving water from being used. Turf war: Diane Padbury is proud of the $10,000 synthetic grass that she planted but Gold Coast City Council have ordered her to rip it up . Ms Padbury, who lives in Sovereign Island, a very affluent community within the suburb of Paradise Point on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, has vowed to fight the council's decision to get rid of her quirky creation. She believes homeowners should be given control over neighbouring nature strips and that the council could save water with synthetic grass. 'I never watered the previous grass so it was brown and ugly,' she told the Gold Coast Bulletin. 'Now the area looks great and it doesn’t require me to spend any money on water. I was told the synthetic grass was dangerous and could trap someone wearing stilettos. The whole thing is just crazy.' Proud of her work: Ms Padbury was trying to improve her local area of Sovereign Island, a very affluent community within the suburb of Paradise Point on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia . The enthused resident is engaged in a turf war with the council who say she has 'ripped up council land and started developing without any guidance'. Compliance officers are due to assess the unusual dispute towards the end of the week. A spokesman for the Gold Coast City Council said that it comes down to a matter of 'principle'. 'We cannot create a precedent which encourages people to develop council land without even asking,' he said. Councils across Australia have invested in synthetic grass for sports centres and recreational grounds. By 2020 many of the tennis courts on the Gold Coast will be made from the material. Benefits of the fake lawns include no watering, no fertilising, no mowing and no dangerous pesticides and chemicals.","Diane Padbury planted a fake lawn because she never watered the real one .

"By . Alex Greig . A New York woman is suing a hospital and two doctors, claiming she was forced to undergo a cesarean section against her will. Rinat Dray was a 32-year-old mother of two boys who had been delivered via cesarean section. She decided that with her third pregnancy, she wanted to have a VBAC, or vaginal birth after cesarean. Forced? Rinat Dray, pictured, claims doctors at Staten Island University Hospital forced her to have a C-section . Overruled: Doctors at Staten Island University Hospital performed a C-section on Rinat Dray against her wishes (file photo) However, when she arrived at Staten Island University Hospital in labor, Dr Dr Leonid Gorelik began pressuring her to have another cesarean section, she said this week. Dray's attorney Michael Bast told RH Reality Check that after Dray had been in labor for several hours the attending physician would not examine her unless she agreed to have the surgery. Gorelik told her that she was putting her baby at risk and that her uterus would rupture if she didn't have the surgery, Dray told The New York Times. The doctor also said that not having the surgery was tantamount to child abuse, and that her baby would be taken away from her if she refused, Dray said. Hospital records show that the cesarean section was approved by the hospital's legal department and Dr James J Ducey, the director of maternal and fetal medicine. 'The woman has decisional capacity. I have decided to override her refusal to have a c-section,' he wrote in her case notes. Bast, a specialist in medical malpractice, said that this is the first case in which he has seen a woman's refusal to have a cesarean section overruled. Generally, he said, women who are reluctant to have cesarean sections are eventually talked into have the procedure. According to Dray's complaint, not only did the hospital ignore her express wishes not to have the surgery, but they also failed to consult the bioethics department and didn't engage the hospital's patient advocate, reports RH Reality Check. Dray, having already undergone two C-sections, was reluctant to endure a third, due to the after-effects of the surgery. Force: Dr James J Ducey (left) wrote that he was 'overriding' Dray's refusal to have a C-section, while Dr Leonid Gorelik (right) allegedly pressured Dray about having a C-section as soon as she arrived at the hospital . She did her research and believed she may be a successful VBAC candidate. Dray raised the issue with physicians in the Metropolitan OB-GYN Associates group and they indicated a vaginal birth was a possibility for her. New guidelines set out by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that VBAC is a safe option for most women, including those who have had multiple previous cesareans. ACOG states that respect for the patient's decision-making requires that a cesarean birth cannot be forced nor can care be denied if a woman refuses a cesarean during labor. The guidelines also note that a VBAC means the patient avoids serious abdominal surgery, lowers a woman's risk of hemorrhage and infection and can shorten post-partem recovery time. During the surgery to which Dray never agreed, the doctor perforated her bladder. No comment: The hospital cannot address the legal issue, but a spokesman says it has a good record of both cesareans and VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) Dr Gorelik, in court papers, denied that he had carried out the surgery against Dray's will. He said that her own 'culpable conduct and want of care' were to blame for any injuries she sustained. According to the Centers for Disease COntrol and Prevention, almost 33 per cent of births are by cesarean section, a rate that has been climbing since 1996 for various reasons, including a desire by mothers and doctors to schedule deliveries and fear of malpractice lawsuits should the baby be injured during a normal delivery. The New York Times reports that the hospital has defended its actions, saying that its 22 per cent cesarean section rate is much lower than the state average of 34 per cent, and that as of 2012, its VBAC rate was at 29 per cent compared to a state average of 11 per cent. Court documents state that Dr Ducey claims Dray's baby was 'at risk for serious harm without the C-section.' Dray, now 35, says she begged Gorelik to give her more time to give birth to her child naturally. As she lay on the operating table, he told her, 'Don't speak,' reports The New York Times. Dray is suing the doctors and the hospital for malpractice, alleging they 'improperly substituted their judgement for that of the mother' and 'pressuring and threatening' her during the birth of her youngest son, Yosef, who was born in July 2011.","RInat Dray, 35, says she was forced to have a cesarean against her will .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Disturbing pictures have emerged showing New South Wales firefighters humiliating one of their colleagues who was moving to another station. The images feature a member of staff at NSW Fire and Rescue headquarters in Sydney who was shackled to the back of a firetruck as part of a farewell 'ceremony'. He was then sprayed with a water hose, followed by a fire extinguisher before having highly corrosive oven cleaner applied to his head and neck, it is claimed. 'Farewell ceremony': Disturbing images have emerged this week from a former firefighter, which he claims depict a staff member being humiliated at the NSW Fire and Rescue headquarters on Castlereagh Street in Sydney . The photos were taken by a former firefighter, who did not take part in the ceremony. He told the Daily Telegraph that the victim, who was being re-stationed in regional NSW, soon collapsed on the ground in agonising pain, struggling to breathe. 'The poor guy couldn’t breathe and they threw soda ash all over him to try and stop the oven cleaner burning his skin,' the anonymous photographer said. More... Managers of Soma coal mine 'knew methane levels were too high and are to blame for death of over 300 workers,' claims survivor . An ambulance was called to the HQ in Castlereagh Street and paramedics gave the man oxygen. He refused to go to hospital, instead opting for a shower. It is unclear when the incident took place. However, it is not the first time the station has come under the spotlight. It was revealed last week that another firefighter, Ron Moor, was suing Fire and Rescue NSW for more than $1 million. He alleges that he suffered physical and mental harassment since his own initiation ceremony in the 1980s which led to a breakdown in 2007. The photographer said the man, who did not make an official complaint, was tied between two fire trucks, sprayed with a water hose followed by a fire extinguisher and finally a caustic cleaning agent before collapsing and struggling to breathe . In the wake of Mr Moor's claims, seven more firefighters have contacted his lawyers to complain about their treatment. It also prompted the anonymous photographer who took these images to come forward. The former firefighter claimed he defied the orders of a high-ranking officer to hand over and destroy the photos, purposefully giving him the wrong memory card. 'This wasn’t the only incident. They happened all the time. Sometimes you would be called out to a fire in the early morning and you’d find a naked firefighter chained to the truck. You’d have to cut him free before you could get on the road,' he said. 'The mob mentality in there was just out of control. And the senior offices did nothing about it.' Fire And Rescue NSW have not yet been available for comment. It is not the first time the NSW Fire and Rescue headquarters on Castlereagh Street in Sydney has come into the spotlight, with another firefighter, Ron Moor, alleging he suffered physical and mental harassment while stationed there .","Firefighter was tied to two trucks, sprayed with fire hose, fire extinguisher and highly corrosive oven cleaner .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Michael Seamark . Google has received scores of 'right to be forgotten' requests following a controversial European ruling - including one from an actor who had an affair with a teenager, it emerged today. Another request was made by the child of a celebrity who has asked for articles about their criminal convictions to be taken down, it has been suggested. It is thought a man who tried to kill members of his . family has also asked for a news report about the attack to be taken down. Furthermore, sources say half of the 1,000 requests made so far by people in Europe have come from those with criminal convictions. A celebrity who had an affair with a teenager and the child of someone in the public eye with criminal convictions are just two of the people who have requested for Google to take down articles, sources say . The requests come just days after the . European Court of Justice ruled people had the 'right to be forgotten' - and could therefore . request for articles in Google search results be removed. It also ruled Google searches linked to the individual could also be taken down if they tarnish their reputation. These latest removal requests come a day after a British politician seeking re-election made requests to Google to have results removed from the search engine. The politician has asked for stories linking him to a scandal to be removed from searches related to him, sources confirmed. Earlier this week, MailOnline reported that two other UK requests for search results to be removed include a convicted paedophile and a doctor who had received negative feedback online. The original case regarding the right to be forgotten was brought by a Spanish man who claimed his privacy had been infringed by an auction notice for his repossessed home. Under Article 17 of the European Data Protection Regulation, internet users who are mentioned in data have the right to 'obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data'. Google has declined to comment on the received requests, but expressed its disappointment when the ruling was made on Tuesday. A Google spokesman said: 'The ruling has significant implications for how we handle takedown requests. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice, pictured, earlier this week after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy . 'This is logistically complicated - not least because of the many languages involved and the need for careful review. 'As soon as we have thought through exactly how this will work, which may take several weeks, we will let our users know.' The creator of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee has recently been leading a campaign to establish a bill of rights for web users to ensure they are protected online. While this court ruling appears to support this idea, some industry experts have expressed concern that the ruling amounts to censorship and a violation of free speech. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales called the ruling 'astonishing' when it was first announced and called it 'one of the most wide-sweeping internet censorship rulings that I’ve ever seen'. He later tweeted: 'When will a European Court demand that Wikipedia censor an article with truthful information because an individual doesn’t like it?' Emma Carr, acting director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'It is hardly surprising that people, intent on rewriting their own history, have already requested that Google remove links to articles referring to their past. 'Those arguing that this ruling is a successful move towards ‘the right to be forgotten’ are quite simply wrong, it is going to be of huge detriment to freedom of speech. 'There is little doubt that making intermediaries responsible for the actions of the content of other people will inevitably lead to greater surveillance and a risk of censorship. 'It is important to recognise that search engines do not host information and trying to get them to censor legal and accurate content from their results is totally the wrong approach. 'If an individual takes issue with something that has been published about them, they should tackle that at the source.' But Conservative MP David Davis said: 'There will be a presumption that companies like Google must remove links to such information unless there are particular public interest reasons justifying the public in having access to the information. 'This is a sensible decision but it is only the first step in people having property rights in their own information. 'The presumption by internet companies and others that they can use people’s personal information in any way they see fit is wrong, and can only happen because the legal framework in most states is still in the last century when it comes to property rights in personal information. 'It is long past time that the western democracies grappled with this problem. 'As the next few decades will only see it becoming both ever more important and ever more problematic.'","One request made by an actor who had an affair with a teen, sources say .

"By . Associated Press . Authorities said ailing radio host Casey Kasem was on vacation and not in danger when they found him in Washington state this week. A Los Angeles judge on Monday expressed concerns about his whereabouts and safety amid a dispute between his wife and children from another marriage but the sheriff's office in Kitsap County, west of Seattle, tracked him down the next day. He was at a home where he and his wife, Jean, had been staying with longtime friends, Deputy Scott Wilson said. Scroll down for video . Found: Radio icon Casey Kasem has been found outside of Seattle and is in acceptable health in spite of his children's claims to the contrary (pictured in 2003) On vacation: He was at a home where he and his wife, Jean, had been staying with longtime friends in Kitsup County outside of Seattle . 'We know he has an affliction, but he was alert, upright, dressed, groomed and cognizant of what was going on,' Wilson said. 'We see a lot of at-risk adults and children. This wasn't anywhere close to being suspicious.' Kasem, 82, gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and he was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo.' His children rejoiced after days of uncertainty. 'We are grateful to the local authorities for finding my dad,' Kasem's daughter, Kerri Kasem, wrote in a statement. 'We are one step closer to bringing him home.' Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel S. Murphy on Monday ordered adult protective services and court investigators to try to locate Kasem after an attorney for his wife said he did not know where Kasem was. Worried: Kerri Kasem has been made a temporary caretaker for her father and a judge demanded an investigation into his disappearance . Wife and husband: Casey and his wife Jean, shown in 2004 in Holllywood, California, have been married since 1980 . Apparently unaware that he had already been located, the children filed a missing person's report on Wednesday. Danny Deraney, a spokesman for three of Kasem's children, said Thursday the family still had 'grave concerns' about his health. Kerri Kasem's court filings state her father is suffering from a form of dementia called Lewy Body Disease. Casey Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean, has been in control of his medical care and controlled access to him, blocking three of Kasem's children from seeing him in recent months, according to court filings. The judge appointed an independent attorney and doctor to evaluate the radio host, and he scheduled a hearing for June 20 to receive updates on Kasem's well-being.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Going food shopping with your mother was only ever truly fun if you could ride along in the cart, and the animal kingdom is no different as these anteaters show. The exhausted baby giant anteater ensured it got a much-needed piggyback from its mother as the hunt for food gets all too much. The peculiar little animal slumped onto its mother to hitch a ride as she dug through the earth in search of ants and termites for dinner. Hurry up mum: Tired of hunting for food, the baby anteater has climbed up onto the back of its mother . Can we go home now? The strange-looking animals were photographed  in the Pantanal wetlands in Brazil . Grand moves: The giant anteater is also known as the ant bear due to its large size and can be found across central South America . Young anteaters often travel on their . mothers’ backs, using their large claws to climb up their parents' thick . fur where they are cleverly camouflaged from predators. The one-foot-long baby was dwarfed by its mother, which measured around nine feet from nose to tail. The pair were snapped by Mario Haberfeld in Pantanal, an area of wetlands in the mid-west of Brazil. Mr . Haberfeld, 37, a former racing driver who now runs a jaguar . conservation project, was visiting the region with his son when they . stumbled across the scene. Dinner time: The giant anteater is an insectivore and uses its tongue to eat ants and termites . Are we there yet? A baby anteater normally stays with its mother until it is nine or ten months old, after which they wander off independently . Safe haven: Baby anteaters use their large claws to climb up their parents' thick fur and onto their backs where they are cleverly camouflaged from predators . He said: ‘I was in the Pantanal wetlands in mid-west Brazil working on my jaguar conservation project. ‘One day I was walking with my son Roberto and we came across a giant anteater with its baby on its back. ‘Giant anteaters have terrible eyesight and as long as you stay upwind of them you can get quite close to them. ‘We . slowly walked over to the anteater until we were about six feet from . it. They are very docile creatures and it just kept going about its . business, looking for ants.' Score: The mother dives down, nose first, after finding insects in a small bush on the Pantanal wetlands . Heading back: Having eaten, the mother looks to find a safe place where she in turn can feed her baby . He added: ‘Giant . anteaters have very long nails and the adults have thick fur, so the . baby had just clambered up onto its mum's back for a rest. ‘I . have been going to the region for ten years and sights like this are . not uncommon. It seems that as long as the babies are small enough, the . mums are happy to have them on their backs.’ The giant anteater is also known as the ant bear due to its size and is the largest of the four species of anteaters. They have one of the longest tongues per body size in the animal kingdom, measuring more than two feet long. They are native to Central and South America and live in a range of different environments from grassland to rainforest.","Mother anteater gave its tiny baby a ride on her back .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . A mysterious Middle East virus with an approximately 30 percent death rate appears to have spread from one person to another in the United States, health officials reported Saturday. An Illinois man probably picked up an infection from an Indiana man who earlier this month became the first U.S. case of Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. The two men met twice before the Indiana man fell ill and was hospitalized in Munster, Indiana, shortly after traveling from Saudi Arabia, where he lived and was employed as a health care worker. Health officials say they think the . virus spread during a 40-minute business meeting that involved no more . contact than a handshake. The Illinois man, however, never needed . medical treatment and is reported to be feeling well, officials at the . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Scroll down for video . Is this how it happened? Health officials say they think the MERS virus spread during a 40-minute business meeting that involved no more contact than a handshake . Dangerous: This electron microscope image shows MERS virus particles, colored in yellow . 'We don't think this changes the risk to the general public,' which remains low, said Dr. David Swerdlow of the CDC. The new report also is not considered evidence that the virus is spreading more easily among people than previously thought, he said. The virus is not considered to be highly contagious, and health officials believe it only spreads from person to person with close contact. Many of those who have gotten sick in the Middle East have been family members or health care workers caring for a MERS patient. The CDC said tests completed Friday provided evidence that the Illinois man had an infection at some point. Since the first man's diagnosis, health officials have been monitoring and testing anyone who was in close contact with him, including health care workers and household members, but none of the rest of them has tested positive for the virus. Caution: Airports have posted signs like this one, seen in Denver International Airport, to warn travelers of MERS symptoms . A second U.S. illness was confirmed last week in a 44-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who was visiting Florida. Saudi Arabia has been at the center of an outbreak of MERS that began two years ago. The MERS virus has been found in camels, but officials don't know how it is spreading to humans. Overall, about 600 people have had the respiratory illness, and about 175 people have died. All had ties to the Middle East region or to people who traveled there. There is no vaccine or cure and there's no specific treatment except to relieve symptoms, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Not all those exposed to the virus become ill. The CDC says that travelers do not need to change their plans at this time, and has asked the airline industry to report sick passengers in and around the Arabian Peninsula. MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003.","Virus may have spread from an Indiana man to an Illinois man during a 40-minute business meeting that involved no more .

"By . Freya Noble . and Sarah Dean . and Sarah Michael . John Singleton made a rare on-air appearance on Ray Hadley's show on Saturday in support of the shock jock . 2GB radio host and rugby league commentator Ray Hadley has lashed out at rival media outlets for their coverage of his split from wife of 20 years, Suzanne. On Saturday he again used his own radio show to address the issue, which has played out this week after accusations he tried to have a football coach sacked because of his relationship with Hadley's estranged wife. It comes after NSW State of Origin assistant coach Matt Parish denied having an affair with Suzanne Hadley, who he says he met only after she separated from the broadcaster. 'Now you keep meddling in people's lives, maybe one day I'll start to meddle in your private life,' Hadley said on his show on Saturday in a broadside directed at Sydney media. John Singelton, owner of 2GB, made a rare appearance on air during Hadley's show defending the shock jock and making light of the media coverage. According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, 'Singo' was dishing out some life advice during the slot, and said 'They always say glass half full, glass half empty...call me old-fashioned, but I'd rather see a glass thrown at some bastard's face.' 'Remember Ray, mate, you got a long way to go...you got three [marriages] to go to get me...so get used to it buddy,' he later added. Parish's denial follows accusations from NSW head coach Laurie Daley that Hadley tried to 'exert his power and influence' to have the assistant coach sacked, by making private phone calls to the NSWRL. 'I didn't even know Suzanne before that,' Parish told The Daily Telegraph of his relationship. 'Whatever I am doing, it's my private life. It's being dragged through the mill by him (Hadley),' he added.

Ray Hadley (right) has opened up about his split from his wife Suzanne (left), pictured here at the Australian Commercial Radio Awards in 2006 . On Friday Hadley spoke out about his split from wife Suzanne for the first time, describing it as his 'biggest personal challenge'.

Blues assistant coach denies affair with Ray Hadley's wife after shock jock 'tried to have him sacked from Origin team' Mr Hadley addressed the accusations on his radio show on Friday morning, saying all he was trying to do was 'get some dignity from a very undignified situation'. 'I've never been one to be overwhelmed by things, but this year has provided me with no doubt my biggest personal challenge,' Mr Hadley said. Scroll down for video . 'At times I've felt like staying in bed and not coming here [to work]. 'Listeners have to understand that despite the fact I'm on the wireless I face exactly the same problems off air as you do every day.' Hadley phoned NSWRL CEO David Trodden last week and warned him that Parish should be 'more circumspect in matters relating to my wife', The Daily Telegraph reports. The shock jock, pictured here in 2010, described his marriage breakdown as his 'biggest personal challenge' Daley also claims Hadley is trying to 'derail' the Blues' entire Origin campaign, which has already been beset by the Mitchell Pearce controversy. But Daley and Parish were supported unanimously at an unscheduled board meeting held on Monday following the phone call between Hadley and Trodden, according to the Telegraph. On Friday Hadley said he has had one phone conversation with Daley, after Daley phoned him last Tuesday week. 'He was very supportive and offered his friendship, that’s a friendship that has been in existence for almost 30 years,’ he said. 'From my point of view nothing has changed.' Hadley added: 'I've told my former wife previously and repeat today, I wish her well and hope she can find happiness.' Hadley, who leads rugby league talkback show Continuous Call Team, used his 9am to midday slot on 2GB radio station to discuss the Blues, Daley and Trodden three times this week. 'He is using his personal attacks on me on air as a way of getting to Matt Parish,' Daley said. Hadley last night denied having put any pressure on NSW officials to dump Parish from the Origin staff. He has admitted he spoke to Trodden about Parish and his estranged wife, who have been seen together at NRL events. Laurie Daley, pictured here coaching the Blues in 2013, says Ray Hadley is trying to have assistant coach David Parish sacked and derail NSW's Origin campaign . 'I simply asked Dave Trodden to advise Matt Parish to be more circumspect in matters involving my wife,' he said. 'I deny I asked for him to be sacked.' Hadley has been married to Suzanne since 1994. They are currently separated after she applied for an Apprehended Violence Order against him and his policeman son Daniel on Feb 20 and then withdrew it a few days later. Earlier this week Blues halfback Mitchell Pearce was involved in a nightclub row after a woman claimed he approached her on the dance floor at a popular Sydney drinking spot. The woman has declined to press charges over the incident and Pearce has been disciplined by his NRL club the Sydney Roosters but is still expected to be named in the NSW team for the first Origin match on May 28.

"By . Alex Greig . Karl Rove has reiterated comments about Hillary Clinton's health that drew ire from her husband Bill Clinton last week. The GOP strategist appeared on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace on Sunday speaking about the recent speculation that Hillary Clinton may have suffered a traumatic brain injury after a fall at home in 2012 while she was suffering a stomach virus. He began by giving an oddly forensic and lengthy description of Clinton's movements in 2012 at the time she was ill. Scroll down for video . Unhealthy fixation: Karl Rove has repeatedly questioned whether or not Hillary Clinton suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2012 . 'I’m not questioning her health,' he said, although he appeared to be doing just that. 'What I’m questioning is whether or not it’s a done deal that she’s running, and she would not be human if she did not take this into consideration.' Host Chris Wallace asked Rove flat out - does he, in fact, have doubts about Hillary Clinton's health? 'No, no, no, I don't,' he said, saying that the point of his recent remarks about Clinton's health was to raise questions about whether the former secretary of state is guaranteed to run in 2016. Rove's fixation with Clinton's health was kicked off last week when he said that 'we need to know what's up' with Clinton's health and whether or not she suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2012. Bill Clinton ridiculed Rove's speculation at his wife's fitness to run. '100 per cent': Representatives for the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (seen May 16) say she is in vigorous health . Fit to run: Rove says Clinton's health problems in 2012 may have been more serious than first thought, and that he is not questioning her health, but merely whether or not she'll run in 2016 . 'First, they said she faked her concussion and now they say she is auditioning for her part on The Walking Dead,' Bill Clinton said at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation’s 2014 Fiscal Summit. 'I must be in really tough shape because she is still quicker than I am.' Rove said, 'I love being lectured by Bill Clinton that this is off-limits: ""You can’t talk about her health. You can’t talk about her age."" Let’s remember this is a guy who ran for reelection by savaging Bob Dole. [He] looked like Methuselah in the Clinton TV ads,' indicating that, as host Chris Wallace hypothesized, Rove's speculation is merely a political play. Despite his own stated confidence in Hillary Clinton's health and fitness to run, Rove maintained that the American public needs answers. 'Let’s be clear: She is going to have to cough up these medical records and describe this, if this was that serious,' Rove said. Dick and Lynn Cheney also appeared on the panel and Cheney, who suffered his own health problems while vice president gave his take on the issue. 'I think any presidential candidate or vice presidential candidate is going to have to answer questions about their health,' he said. 'I wouldn’t want to pre-judge Mrs. Clinton’s health. I don’t know about it.' A doctor believes the glasses Hillary Clinton wore last year may have been the type used to treat double vision common to severe head trauma . A prominent New York ophthalmologist said in an interview yesterday that a special pair of glasses worn by Clinton are the type used to treat the double vision sometimes caused by severe head trauma. In an interview with Fox News, Dr. Marc Werner said the glasses had a Fresnel prism. 'In order to see one object, your eyes need to be pointed in the same . direction. If your eyes are misaligned, one way to optically align them . is to put a prism ... on your glasses,' he said. The comments fueled speculation by Rove about her time in the hospital in December 2012. She was reportedly fighting a stomach virus when she fell at home, hit her head, and suffered a concussion. A blood clot was later found behind her right ear. According to Werner, the severe head trauma may have caused double vision. 'Any issue which raises intracranial pressure can damage one of the . nerves which moves the eye around, and if it damages one of the nerves, . your eyes will be misaligned -- maybe temporarily, maybe more . permanently,' he said. Rover has argued that Clinton's health may be an issue if she runs for the presidency in 2016. 'This was a serious deal. She basically was out of action,' the former George W. Bush administration adviser said . Tuesday. 'She spends over a month fighting this. ...And they're not . particularly forthcoming.' Dr. Marc Werner said he knew the glasses corrected double vision because they had a Fresnel prism . Clinton's reps have defended her, saying she's at '100 per cent.' Former president and husband Bill Clinton went so far as to say there was 'nothing' to the health issue. Dr. Werner said if he was given access to her medical records he would want to see imaging studies. 'I would like to know what the results of any imaging studies were . and the cause of why someone needed Fresnel,' he said. 'There are . lots of different causes, anything from Myasthenia to Multiple Sclerosis . to maybe a blood clot, these are all possible causes, but all we know . is that she was using a Fresnel prism and therefore had double vision.'","Karl Rove has again questioned Hillary Clinton's health .
He appeared on Fox News Sunday with Christopher Wallace and denied that he was questioning her health .
'No, no, no, I don't,' he said, in response to whether he had doubts about Clinton's health .
Rove said his recent speculation about Clinton's run of ill-health in 2012 is to determine whether or not she intends to run for president in 2016 .
He said that the American public needs answers, 'Let’s be clear: She is going to have to cough up these medical records and describe this, if this was that serious'

"By . Ian Garland . Paint giant Dulux has been forced to pay out thousands of pounds in compensation to disgruntled DIY-ers who claimed its ‘brilliant white’ paint is neither brilliant nor white - because it fades to yellow. Customers complained the company’s oil-based paint turns a creamy yellow colour over time - often within weeks of application. Dulux has admitted the problem was caused by new EU regulations which forced it to water down solvent levels in the paint. Lisa Winter, 35, with the doors she painted white... but have since turned yellow . But customers left with yellow walls are furious they weren't warned about of the problem before they invested hours painting their homes. Lisa Winter, 35, (pictured) and her husband Martin, 36, have spent hours repainting their home in Yatton, Somerset, after the Dulux paint faded to yellow. The couple painted all the doors and skirting in the hallway, landing, bathrooms and bedrooms in Dulux white satinwood after moving in. Mum-of-two Lisa, a freelance writer, said: 'We recently had the skirting replaced in the hallway and when we put fresh white paint on there it showed up just how yellow the old paint was. 'So we’ve had to repaint everything and it’s going to take ages because there are so many doors to do. Dulux admitted new E.U. regulations have affected the 'white-ness' of its brilliant white paint . 'It’s very annoying because you expect white paint to stay white for longer than a few years. Especially when you pay extra for a leading brand name like Dulux.' Colin Beare, 58, was offered £500 in compensation after 11 doors of his home and the flat he rents went yellow just weeks after he applied the paint. But the general manager at a car salvage yard, from Gillingham, Dorset, is now taking the company to the Small Claims Court - insisting it will cost £2,000 to re-paint. He said: 'I feel like I have been cheated - I was devastated when they told me what was wrong with the paint. 'It is obviously something they must have known about. I first started to notice it was discolouring after a matter of just weeks. 'I eventually came to the realisation that something was not quite right - at first I thought I had done something wrong - it looked horrendous. 'To my surprise Dulux actually put their hand up straight away and said ‘yes we have a problem with this paint - it is a problem that we know about’.It pulls into question why they managed to sell it to me in the first place. They have offered me £500 in compensation but I have estimated it will cost £2,120 to re-paint. The problem emerged in 2010 after the European Union forced all companies to reduce the amount of Volitle Organic Compounds (VOCs) in their oil-based paints. Firms, including Dulux, were forced to reformulate their paints, but that led to its ‘brilliant white’ substance losing its colour. Martin Horler, an expert decoration consultant, explained: 'To get rid of or reduce the amount of VOCs, you had to reduce the solvent. Lisa Winter repaints her faded doors with a fresh coat of white paint . 'If you reduce the solvent you have to increase something else. So what they would have to do to keep it in liquid form would be to increase the drying oil. 'To increase the drying oil unfortunately causes more rapid yellowing of the paint.' Dulux included the VOCs label on its tins - informing customers of the change - but fail to warn customers of the yellowing problem. It even boasted that its paint was ‘long-lasting’. In contrast, rival Crown Paints put on some of its tins: 'Recent changes made to meet the reduced solvent levels...may lead to yellowing over time.' John Chesters, who was given vouchers for new paint and £250 by Dulux after doors and frames in his home turned yellow, added: 'It was if we had chosen a different colour. 'It was a real shock. Also we were worried about having to do the work again. It was just totally unacceptable.' Dulux claims it has now solved the problem that had affected a 'small minority' of customers. Matt Pullen, a UK director of Dulux, speaking on BBC’s Watchdog programme which highlighted the issue, said: 'This is a problem that affected the whole industry. 'We reformulated our products as did everyone else. We started to see a problem in the market in 2010 for a small minority of customers under certain conditions. 'As soon as we saw that we put all our energies into solving the problem, which we did in 2011. 'We focused our efforts on actually solving the problem rather than making a disclaimer against it. 'All the products we have produced since 2011 - and is in the shops on sale today - is as good as it was pre-2010. 'For those individuals who have had a problem and have complained to us - we’ve resolved 95 per cent of all those complaints in a fair and reasonable way. 'People can have confidence in what we are doing.'","Dulux admits it's aware of the fault but blames tough new EU rules .

"By . Associated Press . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called on Sunday for a more aggressive foreign policy that defends American values abroad — even in 'in some very messy, difficult places'. 'The rest of the world watches in desperation and hope that America will realize and act upon once again its indispensable place in the world,' Christie, a prospective Republican presidential contender, said in a keynote address at This World: The Values Network's second annual Champions of Jewish Values International awards gala in New York. 'We must lead.' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called for a more aggressive foreign policy that defends American values abroad on Sunday night at the 2nd Annual Champions of Jewish Values Gala in New York. 'We must lead,' he said . Celebrity Rabbi Shmuley Boteach of New Jersey shakes keynote speaker Chris Christie's hand. Boteach's organization honored Christie on Sunday despite Christie's recent remarks on 'occupied territories' that unsettled some Jewish Americans . He charged that America must represent the strongest military and economic power, but also 'the strongest moral power for what is good and what is right in the world.' The appearance offered Christie a second chance to impress deep-pocketed Jewish donors after stumbling in a recent speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. Sunday's event also featured Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, This World Executive Director and Celebrity Rabbi Shmuley Boteach and major political donor Sheldon Adelson. The gathering comes as donors — none bigger than Adelson — begin to size up the crowded field of potential Republican presidential candidates ahead of the 2016 contest. While billed as a nonpartisan affair, there were political references throughout the evening. Asked if he was running for president, Perry told reporters: 'I'm being governor for the next nine months. To be real honest with you I don't know what I'm gonna do after that.' Christie did not talk about his own presidential prospects in a speech that offered aggressive rhetoric but few specifics. He didn't mention Israel, but insisted that America's leaders must send 'clear and consistent signals' to those nations it supports and those it doesn't while promoting America's values. 'We need to stand once again loudly for these values,' he said. 'And sometimes that's going to mean standing in some very messy, difficult places. Standing long and hard for those things that we believe in.' He added: 'We will either lead or disappoint. Those are the only two choices. Unfortunately, today, in my opinion, America is disappointing. But it's not too late.' Christie was seated at the same table as Adelson, who figures to play a prominent role in the selection of the next Republican presidential nominee. It was their second meeting over the last two months. At a Las Vegas gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition in late March, Adelson met with Christie and several other possible Republican contenders: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. At the time, Christie, a Catholic, said he was overwhelmed by displays of religious tolerance during a recent trip to Jerusalem. 'I took a helicopter ride from occupied territories across ... and just felt, personally, how extraordinary that was to understand the military risk that Israel faces every day,' Christie said. The comment about 'occupied territories' drew sharp criticism from some in the audience. The Israeli government and by extension most of Israel's supporters in the U.S. don't consider the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be occupied territory. After the speech, Christie met privately with Adelson to explain that he misspoke. With a net worth estimated at nearly $40 billion, Adelson may be the Republican Party's most influential donor. He is known for his devotion to Israel, in addition to an aggressive American foreign policy. Adelson donated more than $90 million to Republican candidates and their allies in the 2012 election.

"By . Associated Press . You promise 'in sickness and in health,' but a new poll shows becoming a caregiver to a frail spouse causes more stress than having to care for mom, dad or even the in-laws. Americans 40 and older say they count on their families to care for them as they age, with good reason: Half of them already have been caregivers to relatives or friends, the poll found. But neither the graying population nor the loved ones who expect to help them are doing much planning for long-term care. In fact, people are far more likely to disclose their funeral plans to friends and family than reveal their preferences for assistance with day-to-day living as they get older, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Challenging: In this August 30, 2013 photo, Pauline King cares for her husband Jerry King at their home in Anna, Illinois. Jerry was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1978. A new poll reveals it's more stressful to care for a spouse than a parent . And while 8 in 10 people who've been caregivers called it a positive experience, it's also incredibly difficult. 'Your relationship changes. Life as you know it becomes different,' said Raymond Collins, 62, of Houston, who retired early in part to spend time with his wife, Karen. Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 15 years ago, her mobility has deteriorated enough that she now uses a wheelchair. Collins, a former business manager for an oil company, said he has felt stress, frustration and, at times, anger. 'The traditional vows are through sickness and health, for richer or poorer, for better or worse, etc.,' he said. 'At the age of 25 and 32, you say those things and you're high on love and healthy, and life is all in front of you. The meanings of those words are pretty much lost, even when you concentrate on them.' Still, he said caregiving has strengthened his marriage commitment in ways he couldn't foresee as a newlywed nearly 37 years ago. Caregiving may start with driving a loved one to the doctor or helping with household chores, but progress to hands-on care, such as bathing. Increasingly, family members are handling tasks once left to nurses, such as the care of open wounds or injections of medication. With a rapidly aging population, more families will face those responsibilities: Government figures show nearly 7 in 10 Americans will need long-term care at some point after they reach age 65. Yet just 20 per cent of those surveyed think it is likely they will need such care someday. Almost twice as many, 39 per cent, are deeply concerned about burdening their families. Contrary to popular belief, Medicare doesn't pay for the most common types of long-term care — and last year, a bipartisan commission appointed by Congress couldn't agree on how to finance those services, either. But the AP-NORC Center poll found nearly 6 in 10 Americans 40 and older support some type of government-administered long-term care insurance program, a 7-point increase from last year's AP survey. The poll also found broad support for a range of policy proposals: . —More than three-fourths favor tax breaks to encourage saving for long-term care or for purchasing long-term care insurance. Only a third favor a requirement to purchase such coverage. —Some 8 in 10 want more access to community services that help the elderly live independently. —More than 70 per cent support respite care programs for family caregivers and letting people take time off work or adjust their schedules to accommodate caregiving. —Two-thirds want a caregiver designated on their loved one's medical charts who must be included in all discussions about care. Oklahoma this month became the first state to pass the AARP-pushed Caregiver Advice, Record and Enable (CARE) Act that requires hospitals to notify a family caregiver when a loved one is being discharged and to help prepare that caregiver for nursing the patient at home. Just 30 per cent in this age group who say they'll likely care for a loved one in the next five years feel prepared to do so. Women tend to live longer than men and consequently most family caregivers, 41 per cent, assist a mother. Seventeen per cent have cared for a father, and 14 per cent have cared for a spouse or partner, the poll found. The tug on the sandwich generation — middle-aged people caring for both children and older parents, often while holding down a job — has been well-documented, and the new poll found half of all caregivers report the experience caused stress in the family. But spouses were most likely to report that stress and to say caregiving weakened their relationship with their partner and burdened their finances. Spouses are more likely to handle complex care tasks, on duty 24-7 with less help from family and friends, said Lynn Feinberg, a caregiving specialist at AARP. Physically, that can be harder because spouse caregivers tend to be older: In the AP-NORC poll, the average age of spouse caregivers was 67, compared with 58 for people who've cared for a parent. Virginia Brumley, 79, of Richmond, Indiana, cared for her husband, Jim, for nearly five years while he suffered dementia and Parkinson's syndrome, care that eventually required feeding, dressing and diapering him. 'I think I loved him more after I started caring for him. I saw what a wonderful person he was: his (positive) attitude, his kindness, his acceptance of things,' she said. But he lived his last 11 months in a nursing home because 'I couldn't handle him anymore,' Brumley said. 'He was too big for me. He was as helpless as a baby.' The AP-NORC Center survey was conducted by telephone March 13 to April 23 among a random national sample of 1,419 adults age 40 or older, with funding from the SCAN Foundation. Results for the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.",Seven in 10 Americans will need assisted care after the age of 65 but only 20 per cent surveyed think they will need a caregiver .
"By . Associated Press . AT&T Inc. on Sunday agreed to buy DirecTV for $48.5 billion, or $95 per share, a move that gives telecommunications company a larger base of video subscribers and increases its ability to compete against Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which agreed to a merger in February. AT&T's proposed combination, which is subject to government review, could improve its Internet service by pushing its existing U-verse TV subscribers into video-over-satellite service, and thereby free up bandwidth on its telecommunications network. Scroll down for video . Merger: AT&T has offered to acquire DirecTV for $95 a share - a deal worth $67.1billion, including the company's debt . AT&T currently offers a high-speed Internet plan in a bundle with DirecTV television service. The acquisition would help it further reap the benefits of that alliance. With 5.7 million U-verse TV customers and 20.3 million DirecTV customers in the U.S., the combined entity would serve 26 million. That would make it the second-largest pay TV operator behind a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable, which would serve 30 million. The companies expect the deal to close within 12 months. Under the terms agreed to Sunday, DirecTV shareholders will receive $28.50 per share in cash and $66.50 per share in AT&T stock. The total transaction value is $67.1 billion, including DirecTV's net debt. The deal could face tough scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission and antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice. Unlike Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable - which don't compete in the same territory - AT&T's U-verse, offered in 22 states, does compete directly for TV customers with DirecTV, which is available nationwide. The combination would reduce consumers' options for pay TV providers from four to three for about 25 percent of U.S. households, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne. Fewer competitors could result in higher prices, a situation that usually gives regulators cause for concern. AT&T already has more than 5.7million TV subscribers. They would be moved over to DirecTV satellite dishes . Analysts have also questioned the strategic benefits of a deal that would give AT&T a larger presence in the mature market for pay TV. Last year, pay TV subscribers fell for the first time, dipping 0.1 percent to 94.6 million, according to Leichtman Research Group. While AT&T and DirecTV are doing better than cable companies at attracting TV subscribers, DirecTV's growth in the U.S. has stalled while AT&T is growing the fastest of any TV provider. Long term, the deal may offer little help to AT&T as viewers continue to watch more video online. DirecTV offers neither fixed-line nor mobile Internet service, and its rights to airwave frequencies for satellite TV are not the kind that AT&T can use to improve its mobile phone network. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has spoken exuberantly about how the growth of online video helps boost demand for its Internet and mobile services. Last month, AT&T entered a joint venture with the Chernin Group to invest in online video services. AT&T is based in Dallas. DirecTV would continue to be based in El Segundo, California, following the merger, the companies said.","Total deal would be $67.1billion, including DirecTV's debt .

"By . Associated Press . Clyde Snow, a forensic anthropologist who worked on cases ranging from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to mass graves in Argentina, has died. He was 86. His wife Jerry Snow said her husband died on Friday morning at Norman Regional Hospital in Norman, Oklahoma. Mrs Snow said her husband had been suffering from lung cancer and emphysema. Forensic anthropologist Dr Clyde Snow unites parts of a skull, in El Salvador in 2000.  Dr Snow, who worked on cases ranging from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to mass graves in Argentina, died on Friday in Norman, Oklahoma . Dr Snow examined mass graves in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Croatia. He often helped build criminal cases against government leaders who carried out the killings. He also assisted in identifying victims of the Oklahoma City bombing and the remains of serial killer John Wayne Gacy. 'Bones don't forget,' Dr Snow once told the AP. 'They're there and they have a story to tell.' Snow traveled the world helping to give a voice to the voiceless. 'I find it challenging,' he said. 'It is fascinating work. I feel we are doing a little bit of good. It's not the role of forensic science to put the bad guys in jail, but to evenhandedly collect the evidence.' Born January 7, 1928, in Texas, Snow became interested in the human body through his physician father. After joining the Federal Aviation Administration in Oklahoma City in 1960, Snow helped develop a computer program to investigate plane crashes. Snow investigated the deaths of many historical figures, including soldiers who died at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 and King Tutankhamun. In 1978, his expertise was on display when he spoke before the House Select Committee on Assassinations about various aspects of the death of President Kennedy. Less than a decade later, he was part of an international forensic team that identified the remains of Nazi fugitive Josef Mengele, who conducted horrific experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. In 2006, Snow testified against Saddam Hussein, who was on trial for genocide. Fourteen years earlier, Snow had been part of a team organized by the groups Physicians for Human Rights and Middle East Rights Watch who investigated a mass grave in the northern Iraqi town of Koreme, which was destroyed in 1988. Closer to home, Snow, who was a professor at the University of Oklahoma, assisted in identifying victims of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and worked with the Tulsa Race Riot Commission to create a comprehensive account of the deadly 1921 racial clash that laid ruin to the city's black business district. Jerry Snow said her husband will be remembered most for his great sense of humor and dedication to basic rights. 'That was his driving force in his life - human rights,' she said. Dr Snow testifies about his work exhuming graves in the Kurdish lands of Iraq at the Saddam Hussein  'Anfal' genocide trial in November 28, 2006 in Baghdad .","Clyde Snow, 86, died on Friday morning at Norman Regional Hospital in Oklahoma .

A fiery crash that killed two high school sweethearts in Louisiana last week has taken an even more sinister twist after a witness came forward to say that the young couple were being chased when their truck slammed into a tree and exploded. Blake Fritz, 20, and Megan Rogers, 19, were both home from college when they died May 14 in their hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. Their bodies were so badly burned in the wreck that authorities had trouble identifying who they were. Now, Paul Leslie has stepped forward with some startling revelations. Scroll down for video . Bright futures: Blake Fritz, 20, and Megan Rogers, 19, had been dating since high school. They were both home from college when they died . Horrific: The truck carrying Fritz and Rogers smashed into a tree and burst into flames. Their bodies were charred nearly beyond recognition . Mr Leslie told KSLA-TV that he was awakened by the sound of a revving engine and then the sickening crumple of the truck smashing into a tree. He ran outside to find a fireball crash. But he saw something else - two other pickup trucks that had stopped on the street. The drivers appeared to be talking to each other. Someone got out and took a picture of the fireball wreck. Then, they drove off, Mr Leslie said. 'I think that somebody was chasing this Blake Fritz. And he got really scared enough to take the risk that he took,' he told KSLA. Gone too soon: Fritz was a student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette. Rogers had just finished her freshman year at Louisiana State University . Paul Leslie says he heard the crash and saw the people in two pickup trucks watching the wreckage burn . Police say the truck was traveling at least 50mph when it crashed - twice the posted speed limit for the narrow residential street. Mr Leslie said Fritz's father told him that his son carried spare gas cans in the bed of his pickup truck. He believes that contributed to the fireball. Mr Leslie said he has not spoke to the police about what he saw - but he would be willing to. Fritz was a student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette. Rogers had just finished her freshman year at Louisiana State University. They had been dating since Rogers was a junior in high school. '(Megan) never met a soul she didn’t love.

"By . Associated Press . A conservative Mississippi blogger who is accused of photographing the bedridden 72-year-old wife of Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, 76, without permission has had bail set at $100,000. Clayton Kelly, 28, has a preliminary hearing on Thursday, which was scheduled by a magistrate in Mississippi on Sunday, Assistant Police Chief Robert Sanders said. Police were also looking into the possibility that other people were involved. Mississippi blogger Clayton Kelly (pictured), 28, had bail set at $100,000 by City Magistrate Dale Danks on Sunday . 'That is certainly one of the focal points of the investigation,' Sanders said in an email. Kelly was arrested Friday on a charge of exploiting a vulnerable adult. He's accused of using an image of Cochran's wife, Rose, who suffers from dementia and has been in a nursing home since 2000, in an online video. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who is challenging the six-term senator in a GOP primary in June, said he does not have any ties to Kelly. 'I've reached out to Senator Cochran directly to express my abhorrence for the reprehensible actions of this individual,' McDaniel said in a statement Saturday. 'This criminal act is deeply offensive and my team and I categorically reject such appalling behavior.' Kelly voluntarily took down the video about 90 minutes after uploading it last month and is cooperating with investigators, said his attorney, Kevin Camp. Cochran's attorney Don Clark said on Saturday that the photo of Rose Cochran was taken near her bedside. Kelly's attorney said it was taken through an open door during visiting hours. Republican U.S. Senator Thad Cochran's (pictured far left in February) wife was unwillingly photographed while in her nursing home . 'He didn't do anything that was out of the norms of visitation. He took the photo and put it on the blog,' Camp said. Kelly's Facebook page includes a photo of a McDaniel campaign sign and a photo of him with McDaniel at a campaign meet-and-greet event. On his blog, Constitutional Clayton, Kelly wrote: 'When it comes to Republicans with a bad voting record, you can't get any worse than Thad Cochran.' Since Kelly's arrest, the campaigns have traded barbs over when Kelly came to the attention of the McDaniel campaign. Cochran's campaign released a voicemail it received from McDaniel's campaign manager, trying to show that McDaniel's camp knew about Kelly before his arrest. The recording was first reported by The Clarion-Ledger and later provided to The Associated Press. Cochran was elected to Senate in 1978 after six years in the House. He is a former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 'I have been fortunate to have a wonderful family, and like so many families, we are deeply affected by my wife's serious, long-term illness, that we consider to be a very private family matter,' Cochran said in a statement Saturday. 'We will continue doing everything we can to protect my wife's safety and security.'","Clayton Kelly, 28, was arrested on charges of exploiting a vulnerable adult .

"By . Lydia Warren . An archivist has unearthed a long-lost letter written to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939 by a London stockbroker asking the United States to help Czech children escape the Nazis. Nicholas Winton, who ended up saving 669 children - many of them Jewish - on the eve of World War II, later received a letter saying that U.S. immigration laws meant that nothing could be done. Winton, now 104, mentioned the letter in an interview with CBS 60 Minutes and when it aired, David Langbart, an archivist at the National Archives and Records Administration, went searching for the note, which had not been seen in 75 years. 'And lo and behold, I came up with his original letter to President Roosevelt,' Langbart told CBS. Scroll down for video . Hero: Nicholas Winton, now 104, helped 669 children escape Nazi Europe on the eve of World War II. In 1939 he sent a letter to President Roosevelt asking for help but the U.S. responded that it could not . Found: A letter dated 1939 and written to President Franklin D. Roosevelt has been found in the National Archives. It asks the U.S. for help granting refuge to European children . Plea: It is signed by Winton - then a young London stockbroker who made it his mission to save children . The letter, which is dated May 16th, 1939, writes to President Roosevelt, calling him 'Esteemed Sir'. 'Perhaps . people in America do not realize how little is being and has been done . for refugee children in Czechoslovakia,' the letter says. 'Is it . possible for anything to be done to help us with this problem in . America?...

But ultimately, Winton received a letter that the U.S. was 'unable, in the absence of specific . legislation, to permit immigration in excess of that provided for by . existing immigration laws'. Unassuming: Winton was 29 when he went to Prague and made a list of children to be saved . Speaking on CBS, Winton said: 'The Americans wouldn't take any [children], which was a pity. We could've got a lot more out.' But he still helped 669 children escape from certain death - a heroic feat . that he kept quiet for decades. And he said that he didn't loiter on the . response from the U.S. 'We had not much time for negative attitudes,' he explained. It was 1938 and violence was escalating against Jewish people in Europe when Winton, then just 29, traveled to Prague on his work vacation. As . the Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia, Winton - who had no experience . or connections in this sort of work - decided that he would see if he could save people. He . had actually booked a vacation to go skiing in Switzerland, but changed . his plans at the last minute when a friend involved in Jewish refugee . work asked him for help. 'All . I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out,' Winton, who . was born to German Jewish parents in London, told CBS' 60 Minutes in a . special interview. 'And . they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out... I . work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a . way of doing it.' He set up shop in the city and people soon started coming to him, forcing him to work late into the night, historian David Silberklang told CBS. Rescuer: Winton, pictured in Prague in 1938 with a young boy, kept his involvement quiet for 50 years . Esteemed Sir, . Perhaps people in America do not realize how little is being and has been done for refugee children in Czechoslovakia. They have to depend entirely on private guarantors to get into England, which means that somebody has to take full responsibility for maintenance, upkeep, and education, until they are 18 years of age. No other country is taking an interest in them except for Sweden, which took 35 children last February. We at this office have case-papers and photos of over 5000 children, quite apart from a further 10,000 whom we estimate have to register. Actually, so far, we have brought only about 120 into England. In Bohemia and Slovakia today, there are thousands of children, some homeless and starving, mostly without nationality, but they certainly all have one thing in common: there is no future, if they are forced to remain where they are. Their parents are forbidden work and the children are forbidden schooling, and apart from the physical discomforts, which all this signifies, the moral degradation is immeasurable. Yet since Munich, hardly anything has been done for the children in Czechoslovakia. Many of the children are quite destitute having had to move more than once since they originally fled from Germany. Is it possible for anything to be done to help us with this problem in America? It is hard to state our case forcibly in a letter, but we trust to your imagination to realize how desperately urgent the situation is. Believe me, Esteemed Sir, with many thanks, . Your obedient Servant, . Nicholas Winton. When he . returned to London, he had lists of hundreds of children and got to task . convincing the British authorities to take them. He . pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an . established refugee organization, adding 'Children's Section' to its . header and making himself chairman, CBS reported. He . admitted it took 'a little smoke and mirrors' to convince authorities . to believe him - but he said it mostly took getting a printing press to . print the paper. He . continued his work as a stockbroker by day, before returning to the . office to work on getting the children to the UK. His mother and . volunteers also helped at the office. He said he contacted American authorities to take the children, but they said they were unable. But . British authorities said they would take them if Winton found each one a . home, so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families . would take them. When . he had secured them homes, the youngsters were ready to leave - but he . found that the British authorities were slow to issue their travel . documents. Desperate to help the children get out, he forged their documents and also paid off officials, he said. 'Took a bit of blackmail on my part,' he admitted. 'It worked. That's the main thing.' The first children left Prague on March 14, 1939 - just hours before German troops occupied Prague. Eventually, seven trains carried more than 600 children to Holland, where they caught ferries to England. The Nazis allowed them to leave, happy that the country was being 'cleansed' of Jews. Another train was scheduled to leave on September 1, but was stopped by the declaration of war. Winton said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived. One of the children who did escape, Hugo Meisl, recounted the moment he was put on a train by his parents. Saved: Among the children saved were 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, left, and 10-year-old Hugo Meisl, right . Thankful: Alice, who now lives in Bethesda, Maryland, said she only heard Winton's name after 50 years . Survivor: Meisl said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents . 'I remember that they told us that we were going to England maybe two or three months,' he said. 'It would be a holiday for us. And that they would join us very shortly thereafter...' But his parents never came for him, and their names are now painted on the walls of Prague's Pinkas Synagogue, where every Czech Jew who was murdered in the Holocaust is remembered. Also among the children was 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, now 88 and living in Bethesda, Maryland. She recounted her mother handing her items, including a delicate, embroidered nightgown, to take on the train when she left for England. She never saw her parents again. 'Many survivors feel guilty for having . survived - I feel very grateful to my parents,' she said. 'Our parents' courage, I think, is the most . important because most people said, ""We will go together or not at . all"".' After the war, Winton trained pilots for . the Royal Air Force, married, raised a family and lived comfortably. He . cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly. After the war, Winton married, cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly . Recognized: He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2002 (pictured) and has been the subject of a film. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father . But he hardly told anyone about what he had done. 'I didn't really keep it secret,' he told CBS. 'I just didn't talk about it.' But in 1988, his wife Grete found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names of the children, their parents and the families that had taken them. Later that year, the BBC learned about the story and he went on a show, where he met scores of the children he had saved. In 2002, he was knighted, and he was also celebrated in a documentary called 'Nicky's Family'. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father. But he doesn't care for the attention. 'I'm not interested in the past,' he said. 'I think there's too much emphasis nowadays on the past and what has happened. And nobody is concentrated on the present and the future.'

The aim of the project is to offer a new standard of care designed to defuse tense situations, and as it is a state funded hospital, the air hostess nurses are on hand for all patients in the ward. In the pilot project 12 nurses from the hospital Lianshui county in Huai'an city began discarding their traditional white nurse garbs for a new air hostess getup.

"By . James  Nye . A beautiful Mother's Day gesture for a San Diego cancer victim will now grant her three children the gift of her burial. Renee Finney, 42, passed away on May 7 in her Moreno Valley home after being diagnosed the year before last. Her children's agony was compounded by the fact her sudden passing left them unable to pay for her funeral - so on Mother's Day weekend they held a bake sale and car wash to try and raise the $10,000 they needed. Scroll Down for Video . Distraught: Davion (left) and Karries Finney lost Renee Finney before Mother's Day and were unable to bury her . Brother and sister: Karries and her brother reflect on the good fortune their letter's to their mother have brought them and the relief of her burial . As part of that they wrote letters to their recently passed mom, tied them to balloons and left them fly away - in memory of Renee. The letters told their mother how much they love her and asked why she had left so soon according to ABC 10. One of the heartbreaking messages begins, 'Hi mom. I miss you and I hope you come and visit me soon because I have questions to ask like why you had to leave so soon.' To their amazement, a kind-hearted good Samaritan, Yvette Melton discovered one of the balloons  30-miles away on her doorstep.

Melton was so touched by the letters that she started to do some research online using the names written in the letters. She found Finney's obituary online and called the funeral home, which confirmed the family was in need of money for a proper burial. Melton then told her boss, Jerry Halamuda of Fallbrook-based Color Spot Nurseries, about her discovery.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The country's wealth should not be measured solely by money - but also include birdsong and lollipops, the UN has claimed. Governments should look beyond profits and economic growth and take into account benefits which are less easy to measure, the global body said. Trees, a good night’s sleep, and being able to wash clothes in a washing machine should be used alongside traditional GDP measures, Professor Anantha Duraiappah said. The Song Thrush's distinctive song has been celebrated in poetry, but now the UN wants it to be measured alongside economic growth to gauge the health of a country . The Director of the UN University’s International Human Dimensions Programme said MPs were ‘missing some of the most meaningful and simple signs’ of successful countries . He said the number of teenage schoolgirls on a city street, as birds sing in the background is an important sign of a wealthy nation. In poorer countries young girls are often forced out of education at a young age, while overcrowded and polluted cities discourage wildlife. He said: 'New research has begun to show that people often value non-material wealth just as highly, if not more, than monetary wealth. 'When you wake up to the sound of chirping birds, you are listening to one of the simplest indicators of local environmental health. 'More sleep has been proven to lead to better interpersonal relationships, emotional intelligence and empathy toward others. 'A crowd of teenaged schoolgirls lining the streets of an African town is a rare sight. Fewer than one in five girls in sub-Saharan Africa are able to attend secondary school.' At the moment, most countries measure GDP to gauge the health of a country’s economy. This measures the value of everything that Britain produces in a year. But Prof Duraiappah believes that other signs of a good life are just as important. The number of ice creams enjoyed during the summer could soon be measured alongside GDP to rank how wealthy a country is . He suggests monitoring smiles, random acts of kindness and access to lollipops, washing machines and eye glasses. He said: 'Without glasses, school kids miss out on their potential to learn, and adults are unable to make the best of their most productive years. 'A man pulling his laundry from a washing machine is more well-off than a big portion of the world population - only 2 of 7 billion have access to a washer. 'With policymakers focusing on complex indicators to measure societies' success, it often seems as if they are missing some of the most meaningful and simple signs there are.' Cambridge University economist Sir Partha Dasgupta said governments has also urged the Government to change what it measures. He said MPs should think about the value of green spaces like parks. He said: 'To leave a forest unmolested would be to invest in the forest - to allow a fishery to restock under natural conditions would be to invest in the fishery; and so on.' Zakri Abdul Hamid, a member of the UN Secretary-General's Scientific Advisory Board, said adding new indicators did not mean eliminating GDP altogether. He said: 'GDP provides valuable information about a country's production, expenditure, and income streams, as well as the flow of goods across borders. 'But the world's perspective on progress needs to be enlarged, balanced and integrated with social and environmental indicators. 'Only in this way can we respond to the unprecedented opportunities and challenges facing us in the 21st Century.' The academics were speaking at a UN backed symposium in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","Governments should think about other factors that make life better .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A state panel has effectively killed a bid to name a Lake Tahoe cove for Mark Twain, citing opposition from a tribe that says he held racist views on Native Americans. The Nevada State Board on Geographic Names this week voted to indefinitely table the request after hearing opposition from the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, whose ancestral homeland includes Lake Tahoe. Supporters had sought to name a scenic cove on the lake's northeast shore for Samuel Clemens, Twain's real name. 'Racist': The Washoe tribe in Nevada claim Mark Twain was racist towards Native Americans . Tahoe: Supporters of Twain wanted to name a scenic cove on Lake Tahoe after Twain because of the time he spent in the state . But Darrel Cruz, head of the tribe's cultural resource department, said Twain was undeserving of the honor because of derogatory comments about the Washoe and other tribes in his writings. Among other things, he cited Twain's opposition to the naming of the lake as Tahoe, which is derived from the Washoe word ""da ow"" for lake. Cruz also objected to a Twain quote about Lake Tahoe: 'People say that Tahoe means ""Silver Lake"" - ""Limpid Water"" - ""Falling Leaf."" Bosh! It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the digger tribe - and of the Pi-utes as well.' Cruz said Washoes dislike being referred to as the 'digger tribe,' a derogatory term applied to some tribes in the West who dug roots for food. Other tribes ate grasshoppers. 'Samuel Clemens had racist views on the native people of this country and has captured those views in his literature,' Cruz wrote in a letter to the board. 'Therefore, we cannot support the notion of giving a place name in Lake Tahoe to Samuel Clemens.' Washoe: Twain referred to members of the Washoe tribe as the 'digger tribe' which is a derogatory name term used to insult the tribe . But James Hulse, history professor emeritus at the University of Nevada, Reno, said it's irrelevant whether Twain's writings were insulting to Native Americans. The cove should be named for Twain because he praised Tahoe's beauty while visiting the lake in 1861-1862, and he became one of America's most beloved authors after assuming his pen name as a Nevada newspaper reporter around the same time, Hulse said. 'In his early days, (Twain's) ironic-comic mode was insulting to everyone, including governors, legislators, mine bosses and journalistic colleagues,' he told the board. 'He learned and overcame his prejudices far better than most of his contemporaries and successors.' Thomas Quirk, an English professor emeritus at the University of Missouri and leading Twain scholar, said the author eventually overcame his racism against blacks. But Quirk said he has found no evidence that he significantly changed his views on American Indians. The Washoe tribe still exists in Nevada, where Twain lived for many years . Twain did not embrace the idea of idolizing what he called the 'noble red man,' Quirk said, and poked fun at writer James Fenimore Cooper for doing so. 'When it comes to African Americans, he was ahead of his time substantially,' he said. 'When it comes to Native Americans, his record is not very good. If he were alive today, he would sing a different tune.' Board member Robert Stewart, who initiated the plan to name the cove for Clemens, said it's unlikely it would resurface. He said he dropped his support of it, even though he learned about a later letter Twain wrote objecting to the treatment of tribes in Arizona and New Mexico. 'I have a great deal of respect for the Washoe Tribe. And if their cultural committee is unhappy with naming the cove for Mark Twain, I'm not going to fight them,' Stewart said. 'We need to show sensitivity to the tribe.' Twain first used his pen name - 'Mark Twain' - while a reporter at a newspaper in Virginia City, Nevada in the early 1860s . Stewart said he still believes the cove near Incline Village is where Twain camped and accidentally started a wildfire while preparing to cook dinner in September 1861. But David Antonucci, a civil engineer from Homewood, California, maintains Twain camped on the California side of the lake. It's the second time the bid to name the cove for Twain failed. In 2011, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names rejected the request after the U.S. Forest Service said Twain's influence on the Sierra Nevada lake was minimal and other historical figures were more deserving of the honor. Supporters sought to honor him because there is no geographic feature in the state named for Twain, whose book 'Roughing It' put Nevada on the map.","Twain spent many years in Nevada in the early 1860s and supporters wanted to name a scenic cove on Lake Tahoe after the writer .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Leading author Val McDermid said women crime writers were better at scaring their readers . Popular crime writers have revealed that women love to read about other women being murdered, especially if the novel's killer is also female. In countless works of crime fiction female characters often meet a sticky end at the hands of a killer, with publishers frequently using images hinting at terrified women victims on their front covers. And in recent years the genre has become even gorier, according to some crime writers, with one claiming that women prefer her books to be as gruesome as possible, and that women prefer the killer to be female. Crime fiction is one of the UK's most popular genres of literature with around £90million of the books sold every year, and an increasing number of fictional detectives making the leap from the page to the screen in television adaptations. Leading author Val McDermid, whose . series of novels featuring characters Tony Hill and Carol Jordan . inspired the television show Wire In The Blood, said that women authors . were able to add a more personal perspective when writing about women . than their male counterparts - and were better at scaring their readers. The Scottish author, who recently published her own version of the Jane Austen classic Northanger Abbey said that female writers were also better at scaring their readers. And she said that publishers who used images featuring female victims on their front covers were merely doing what was necessary to attract readers. 'Publishers have never been able to see a . bandwagon without leaping to catch it. We can take the moral high ground . but the job of a publisher is to sell books,' she told The Times. Last week's CrimeFest convention in Bristol was attended by hundreds of fans who flocked to discussion panels featuring some of their favourite authors - including one entitled Death In High Heels: Women As Victims. Ms McDermid's series of novels featuring characters Tony Hill and Carol Jordan inspired the television show Wire In The Blood, starring Robson Green and Simone Lahbib . One of the authors featured in the discussion was Jessie Keane, who is behind the Annie Carter series which is set in the London criminal underworld and features a women at the heart of a powerful East End gang. Ms Keane told the convention that her female readers preferred her books to be violent, and that one of her contemporaries - another woman writer penning novels for a largely female audience - had found her sales had increased once she started writing about hard crime and graphic violence. Moderator and fellow crime writer Ruth Dudley Edwards told the convention that a large proportion of readers of violent crime novels were young women. Ms Keane responded: 'Young women find it fascinating. Maybe they feel they can examine violence in a safe way: they are . seeing it at a safe distance.' It has been claimed that British authors have upped the violence in their novels after being influenced by novels such as The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo, later made into a film staring Noomi Rapace, pictured . It has been claimed that British authors have upped the violence in their novels after being influenced by a wave of Nordic writers including Stieg Laarson who wrote the Millennium Trilogy including The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo. However, authors speaking at the convention said that novels by British writers had featured graphic subject matter. Jessica Mann, an author and fiction reviewer, did add that she had noted an increase in sadism in recent years, and added that a fellow female writer had argued with her publishers who had wanted to put a naked woman on the front cover - even though her victim was a man. Alison Joseph, chairman of the Crime Writer's Association and author of the Sister Agnes novels told MailOnline that many young women were fans of crime fiction because the victims were female . Describing the practice of having a tortured woman on the front cover as strange she added: 'There has been a ratcheting up of torture in books. The books start with a woman being abducted and then she has lots of nasty things done to her, then it gets worse and worse.' Alison Joseph, chairman of the Crime Writer's Association and author of the Sister Agnes novels told MailOnline that many young women were fans of crime fiction because the victims were women. 'When you write a crime novel your reader needs to believe in what is going on,' said Ms Joseph, whose latest novel Dying To Know centres on the mysterious death of a particle physicist. 'A woman in danger is believable and a lot of crime readers are young women because those are their real concerns. 'Although a crime novel is an escape, it's a story, we need it to be believable and there needs to be something that makes you think ""what if that was me?"" There is a huge market for it. 'I don't know if there will be a backlash against the genre but I can't see we'll want to go back to drawing room stories again.' Ms Joseph said that though crime novels were sometimes violent she did not know if this was a recent phenomenon. 'Some of the crime novels written after the First World War where people were used to seeing streets strewn with rubble and bodies so maybe they wanted a lower body count,' she said. 'But I was reading Margery Allingham, who was writing after the war and is normally lumped in with polite crime stories, but there is still a lot of violence in her work. There is still murder and it is still believable.' She added: 'I don't know if crime writing is getting gorier, it's an easy thing that people say.'","Around £90million crime novels are sold every year in the UK .

The Harrisburg Patriot-News reports that when the officers arrived at the trailer, they became concerned for the children living there. The child gave them permission to enter the home. Inside, they found horrendous living conditions. 'The entire home was consumed with animal feces and filth,' according to a police report. The children were taken into state custody and the elderly woman was taken by ambulance to the hospital for treatment. Bohn and Karns were arrested later that evening. Their Facebook pages show at least two dogs and cat. Among the family pets is a miniature dachshund named 'Coco Jelly Bean.' Bohn appears to work at GameStop and Karns is employed at Al's Pizza in Mechanicsburg.","Monica Bohn, 31, and Michael Karns, 28, were charged with endangering the welfare of children .

"By . Associated Press . A commencement speaker fed up with the recent wave of students shaming speaker choices at multiple colleges blasted graduates as 'immature' and 'arrogant.' Former Princeton University president William Bowen used his Sunday commencement speech at Haverford College, in suburban Philadelphia, to criticize students who campaigned against the speaker he replaced - Robert Birgeneau, former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley. Dozens of students demanded he write a letter explaining his reasons for calling in police to disperse a 2011 Occupy protest on the UCB campus, and to support payments for protesters harmed by police during the dispersal, Birgeneau instead withdrew. Irate: William Bowen, former president of Princeton University, issued a sharp rebuke to 'immature,' 'arrogant' student protests that forced former University of California at Berkeley president Robert Birgeneau to withdraw from speaking at Haverford College's commencement . 'I am disappointed that those who wanted to criticize Birgeneau's handling of events at Berkeley chose to send him such an intemperate list of 'demands,' Bowen said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'In my view, they should have encouraged him to come and engage in a genuine discussion, not to come, tail between his legs, to respond to an indictment that a self-chosen jury had reached without hearing counter-arguments.' Forced out: Former University of California at Berkeley president Robert J. Birgeneau was to be commencement speaker at Haverford College until protested caused him to cancel . Birgeneau is among several commencement speakers who canceled their appearances this spring amid student protests, and Bowen's criticism did not stop there. 'I think that Birgeneau, in turn, responded intemperately, failing to make proper allowance for the immature, and, yes, arrogant inclinations of some protestors,' Bowen continued. 'Aggravated as he had every right to be, I think he should be with us today.' More than 40 students and three professors had protested Birgeneau's invitation to speak, objecting to his handling of a 2011 incident at Berkeley in which police used force at a student protest during the Occupy movement. The group wanted Birgeneau to apologize, support payments for victims and write a letter to Haverford students explaining his position on the events and 'what you learned from them.' Bowen then directed his outrage at a student leader who called Birgeneau's withdrawal 'a minor victory.' 'I regard this outcome as a defeat, pure and simple, for Haverford - no victory for anyone who believes, as I think most of us do, in both openness to many points of view and mutual respect,' he said. Bowen's rant drew a standing ovation. Birgeneau was also supposed to receive an honorary degree from Haverford, but he refused those demands and others in a terse email. The former UCB chairman is one of several high-profile commencement speakers including former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, from Rutgers University, and International Monetary Fund chief Christine LeGarde, from Smith College, to pull out of ceremonies in response to student protests. Bowen was one of three speakers to take Birgeneau's place as part of what Haverford president Daniel Weiss previously referred to as 'plan b.'

"By . Jonathan Block . A Florida mother has been reunited with her now 12-year-old daughter who was abducted by her father almost five years ago. Cara Cox is now back with her mother after her dad Aaron Cox, 55, used a court ordered visit in 2009 to steal his daughter away to the remote mountains outside Mexico City. In Miami on Saturday, Jodie Borchert of Deltona saw her daughter for the first time since the little girl was just eight years old. Home after five years: Authorities say Cara Cox, who is now 12, is thrilled to be back with her mother in Florida after she was allegedly abducted by her father and taken to remote mountains in Hidalgo, Mexico. Cara is seen at 8-years-old at right before her abduction and in a computer-aged police photo at left . Charged: Aaron Cox, 55, in a mug shot taken after he was extradited to Miami. He has been charged with interference with child custody for abducting his daughter, Cara, in August 2009 . Unraveling mystery: Initial reports indicate that 55-year-old Cox (pictured here before the alleged abduction) had no connection to Mexico and yet somehow managed to hold up their with his daughter . Nearly five years had passed since since Cara and her dad disappeared into thin air from his Deltona home without a single clue as to their whereabouts. Borchert had legal custody of her daughter while the girl’s father had weekend visitation rights, which were evidently not enough for Cox. Police searched diligently for Cox and his daughter and were soon joined by experts at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Every two years, investigators released a new computer-aged photo of Cara in hopes she would be recognized. Her mother clung to hope despite the sad dearth of clues and as recently as May 12 had shared a new missing persons post on Facebook. She also posted a tear-jerking Mother's Day message to her daughter that day, writing in part: . 'Hi Cara baby, this is mommy wishing you had been here on this my fifth Mother's Day without you, I miss you more than words can say! Please keep trying to reach us, don't ever give up we are all still here and looking for you.......always.' And on that very same day, a miracle happened. A tip came into the National Center for . Missing and Exploited Children that revealed Cox and her . father were in the mountains near Hidalgo, Mexico, about . two hours northeast of Mexico City. Holding out hope: Cara's mother never gave up hope and happened to post a Mother's Day message of hope to her long-missing daughter on the very day a tip line got a call about Cara's whereabouts . Reunion: Cara saw her mother for the first time since August 2009 on Saturday when they were joyfully reunited in Miami . Over the following five days, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office worked with U.S. Marshals Service, the State Attorney's Office and the Florida/Caribbean Regional Fugitive Task Force. Cox was arrested without incident, authorities said. The man and his daughter had been living in Mexico under assumed names. 'It is such a huge relief to bring this case to a successful conclusion,' said Brandon Haught, a spokesman for the Volusia County Sheriff's Office. 'Reports are the girl is extremely happy to be reunited with her family.' Cox has been charged with interference . with child custody and was extradited to Miami. He will be moved . shortly to Volusia County, where the abduction took place. The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported an investigation is ongoing and Cox could face more charges.

"By . Damien Gayle . Hooters, the restaurant chain which makes a feature of its buxom, scantily-clad waitresses, has claimed the appearance of a joke about rape on its Facebook page is the work of hackers. The picture shows a young blonde, wearing hotpants and with legs akimbo, her hands pointing to her groin, with the caption: 'The proof that she was asking for it your Honour'. It was just one of a string of questionable posts that appeared on the Hooters official Facebook page over the weekend. Others included jokes making fun of small-breasted women. Sexual appeal: Two Hooters 'girls' hold a plate of chicken wings. The restaurant chain insisted it had been hacked after a tasteless rape joke was posted on its Twitter account, prompting a storm of criticism . Hooters PR moved quickly to disown the content, sending a tweet insisting that the page had been 'compromised' and saying the company was working with Facebook to 'resolve the issue'. But that was not before commentators launched a tirade of criticism against the chain, which has 460 restaurants across the U.S. and more overseas. PolicyMic's Elizabeth Plank wrote on Twitter: 'So @Hooters just posted this rape joke on Facebook. Really hope someone is losing their job.' Jezebel writer Mark Shrayber said: 'Whoever was running the social media over on the site this morning really messed up when they thought that posting a picture that suggests that women ask to be raped would be an appropriate thing to put on the site.' And Laura Beck of Cosmopolitan.com posted: 'It's disturbing when you see this type of juvenile, dangerous garbage being posted to Facebook by jackasses you went to high school with, but it's wholly unacceptable when done by a multinational corporation.' She also pointed out that a woman is raped, on average, every two minutes in the U.S. Apologies: This statement was posted to the Hooters Twitter account after the hack . Hooters quickly responded to Ms Plank on Twitter, saying that the page had been hacked and its staff were trying to regain control. 'Apologies. Our page has been compromised. We are working w/ @Facebook now to resolve the issue. Please be patient with us,' tweeted the restaurant's official Twitter account. But it appeared that many of Hooters' Facebook fans did not even notice that their favorite restaurant was posting discriminatory content. Jezebel's Mr Shrayber cited one top comment that simply read: 'lOve [sic] Hooters.' The incident is an embarrassment for Hooters, which has regularly been on the receiving end of sharp criticism for its policy of employing only female waitresses and requiring them to wear tight, low cut vests and orange hotpants. Of critics queuing up to condemn the rogue rape-joke post, none guessed or apparently even suspected that its sudden appearance was the result of an online security breach. In other posts on its Facebook fan page, the chain makes a feature of its waitresses' sexual appeal to sell such products as beer and chicken wings. More apologies: Hooters also posted this statement on its Facebook fan page, where the post appeared . Ms Beck, while registering her disappointment with the post, nevertheless wrote on Cosmopolitan: 'I don't expect much from a restaurant that makes its female employees wear bright orange booty shorts with taupe tights and pretend to laugh at its male customers' sh*t jokes.' Hooters posted a fuller apology on the page yesterday. It read: 'Today, our Facebook page was hacked and all admin rights were suspended. We apologize for the unauthorized posts made and are distressed by the insensitive material that was posted out of our control. Hooters does not share these opinions. 'As of 7 p.m. EST, we have regained admin rights to our page and are working closely with Facebook to investigate the matter.'","Restaurant chain slammed online after tasteless viral appears on fan page .

"By . Leon Watson . Police in China are trying to unravel a bigamy case that resulted in three children being poisoned to death. The three victims were a boy and two girls  who ate the poison at the family home in Xinglong Village in the Ningxia autonomous region. A fourth child, a girl, survived the ordeal. Following a police probe lasting 40 days, officers discovered the killer was the second woman in a bigamous relationship, and the mother of two of the girls that died. Family photo: Father Zhao Fu and his first wife and son, his elderly father and their surviving daughter . The boy was the grandson of the first wife, who was also mother to the girl who survived. Yang Juan, 35, is the illegal second wife of Zhao Fu, 48, who fathered three of the four children with the two women living in his home - a serious crime under China's strict one-child-only law. Police said Fu had been taken ill after marrying his second wife and that had put strain on his relationships. Despite that, to others in the village, the whole family 'seemed to live happily together' in the village Xinglong in Tongxin County in north-western China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

Police say she hid the poison purchased from a pharmacy in the wall of their garden and brought it out in March to murder the youngsters. 'We cannot understand why she acted so brutally against innocent children, especially killing her own, we suspect that she may have poisoned her own children with a lesser dose to deflect the blame, but still ended up giving too high a dosage,' said a police spokesman. 'There is only one child now and a grieving mother and father.' Her husband also faces charges of bigamy and breaching China's one-child policy, while Yang Juan will almost certainly face a firing squad for murder.","The three victims ate the poison at the family home in the .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, said on Saturday that executive editor Jill Abramson left the paper 'for reasons having nothing to do with pay or gender.' 'During her tenure, I heard repeatedly from her newsroom colleagues, women and men, about a series of issues, including arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication and the public mistreatment of colleagues,' Sulzberger said in a statement. Problems: Publisher Arthur Sulzberger, pictured, said he heard 'repeatedly' of problems with Abramson's conduct . Fired: Sulzberger announced the departure of Jill Abramson, pictured, last Wednesday . 'I discussed these issues with Jill herself several times and warned her that, unless they were addressed, she risked losing the trust of both masthead and newsroom,' he said. Sulzberger said he and Abramson spoke about the problems, but 'the gap was too big to bridge.' He also said that her pay was 'comparable' to that of Bill Keller, who served as the paper's executive editor from 2003 to 2011. 'Jill’s pay package was comparable with Bill Keller’s; in fact, by her last full year as executive editor, it was more than 10% higher than his,' Sulzberger said in the statement. Sulzberger earlier wrote in a Thursday memo that the firing stemmed from 'concerns I had about some aspects of Jill's management,' the Times reported. Tough: Abramson's daughter Cornelia Griggs uploaded this photo of 'Mom's badass new hobby' Mysterious: Abramson's daughter shared this upload on Instagram, in an apparent reference to her termination from the New York Times . A spokeswoman for the the paper told Times reporter Ravi Somaya 'We're comfortable with this statement' after pressed about a non-disparagement clause. Last week The New Yorker alleged that Abramson was fired after she found out 'several weeks ago' that her pay was lower than Keller's after a series of issues with Times management. The magazine said that she may have been deemed '""pushy,"" a characterization that, for many, has an inescapably gendered aspect.' The 'pushy' description seemed to spill over into the Instagram account of Abramson's daughter, Cornelia Griggs. On Thursday, she shared an image of Abramson wearing boxing gloves and standing next to a punching bag with the caption 'Mom's badass new hobby #girls #pushy.' A Friday upload from Griggs included a screen grab of a text message conversation that appears to be between Griggs and an unidentified woman, with the caption 'Big thank you to all the #pushy #bossy #polarizing women and men who get it.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A youth club gifted a Banksy artwork has been offered £1million for their piece because it comes with a rare letter from the mystery artist. The painting, called Mobile Lovers, had appeared overnight on a plank of wood screwed to a wall close to the Broad Plain Boys' Club in Banksy's home town of Bristol. The struggling club hoped that by selling the piece they would be able to remain open. However, the artwork was removed by the city council, who maintained they owned the wall, and put on display in Bristol. Scroll down for video . Open to offers: A boys' club gifted this Banksy artwork has been offered £1million for their piece because it comes with a rare letter from the mystery artist . But the artist, whose identity is shrouded in mystery, waded in to the row by writing a letter to Dennis Stinchcombe, who runs the youth club, giving him his 'blessing' to do what he felt was right with the art. Mr Stinchcombe now says he has had offers in the region of £1 million for the piece - with bidders from across the globe hoping to get their hands on the painting of two lovers entwined in an embrace while checking their mobile phones. Some art critics have said the man in the painting resembles former Prime Minister Tony Blair. 'We have had big offers from as far away as Beverly Hills,' he said. 'But I am concerned about choosing an appropriate auctioneer and one which is respectful of the work. Confirmation: The artist waded in to the row by writing a letter to Dennis Stinchcombe, who runs the club, giving him his 'blessing' to do what he felt was right with the art . 'I seen Banksy be critical of some of these auctions for the types of his art they sell so you have to be sensitive. 'For now it is in the gallery for everyone to see but we are hoping to pin down an auctioneer this week some time. 'Some of the offers we have had have . been in excess of £1 million and the letter we have from Banksy is also . thought to be very rare. 'It’s all great news for the club and . we hope to sell it for as much as possible to settle our finances and . secure our future over the next few years at least.' The painting was first discovered at the club in St Jude’s, Bristol, on April 15 after Banksy posted a picture of the new design on his website. Funding: Mr Stinchcombe said the sale of the piece would safeguard the club (pictured) as well as help fund other youth projects in the area . Popular: A couple joke around next to the Banksy artwork, painted onto a wooden board bolted to the wall . The cash-strapped youth group, who needed to find £120,000 just to stay open after struggling due to the recession, insisted Banksy wanted them to have it and planned to sell the work to fund the future of the club. They removed the artwork to protect it from vandals and put it on display inside the club. However, Bristol City Council said it was not '100 . per cent sure of the ownership' of the wall the artwork was attached . to, and days later removed the piece with the support of police. It was put on display at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery while its ownership was decided and more than 10,000 people viewed it over the Easter weekend alone. But on May 6 Mr Stinchcombe received the letter from Banksy, who gave the cash-strapped boys club permission to sell it. The following day the city's Mayor George Ferguson received a similar letter from Banksy confirming it was genuine. Row: Bristol City Council said it was not '100 per cent sure of the ownership' of the wall the artwork was attached to, and days later removed the piece with the support of police . Safe keeping: Before the artwork was taken by the council, the club had removed it from the wall and positioned it inside to protect it from vandals . The artist had written: 'I don't normally admit to committing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges won't be brought anytime soon you have my blessing to do what you feel is right with the piece. 'I'm a great admirer of the work done at the club and would be chuffed if this can help in some way.' After confirming the origin of the letter, Mr Ferguson tweeted: 'Just received confirmation by #Banksy that note to #Bristol Broad Plain Boys Club is authentic. Great to have a clear resolution. 'As far as I'm concerned it [the artwork] now belongs to the club as I'd agreed once confirmation received from Banksy. Resemblance: Some critics of the piece have suggested the man in the painting looks like former Prime Minister Tony Blair . 'I've received confirmation by #Banksy that note is authentic & 'Mobile Lovers' can go to the #Bristol Broad Plain Boys Club :-)' It is thought the letter from the artist has helped significantly increase the value of the artwork which was initially estimated to be worth up to £400,000. Mr Stinchcombe said the sale of the piece . would safeguard the club, which has been running for more than 100 . years - offering activities such as boxing and other sports, for future . generations, as well as help fund other youth projects in the area. Mr Ferguson said the painting was currently still on display at the museum, and that visitors who had come to view the artwork had raised £2,000 for the club. 'This has been a wonderful Bristol story and typical Banksy mystery,' he said. 'I had agreed with Dennis at the club, after they had removed it from the wall of the adjacent council depot, that it was best that we took care of the picture and displayed it to enable people to view it while we waited to hear Banksy’s intentions. In the meantime it has resulted in us raising over £2,000 in donations for the club. 'I shall be delighted to hand over the picture to the Boys’ Club once we’ve ticked all necessary boxes when it comes to the proper legal process. 'We shall be planning the handover of the picture and assisting the club in any way we can in their ambition to raise maximum funds through its sale. In the meantime it will remain on display in Bristol.' UK-based street artist Banksy is known worldwide for his stencils which . often carries political messages or questions about society. Despite his worldwide fame and his artwork selling for thousands, his true identity remains a secret - leading to a network of myths surrounding him and it is rumoured that his own parents don't know what he does,  believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator. There is also the suggestion that Banksy is actually a collective of artists and doesn't exist at all. Banksy's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism. However by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation. He has allegedly been photographed in the past but has always been wearing a mask or hood. In 2008 he was reportedly 'unmasked' as Robin Gunningham, a former public schoolboy from Bristol with a passion for art. At the time Banksy's agent refused to confirm or deny the story. Banksy then wrote on his website:'I am unable to comment on who may or may not be Banksy, but anyone described as being 'good at drawing' doesn't sound like Banksy to me.' Fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film Exit Through The Gift Shop - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated. His most famous artworks include Naked Man - a lover hanging out the window of his mistress - and Balloon Girl, which he has created several versions of across London including Hackney and the South Bank. Banksy's top sellers include: .","Painting Mobile Lovers appeared on a wall outside Broad Plain Boys' Club .

"By . Michael Zennie . The parents of Jennifer Martel have spoken out for the first time to reveal that she was planning to escape her boyfriend Jared Remy just days before he allegedly stabbed her to death. Patty and Brian Martel said they saw Remy, the son of legendary Red Sox broadcaster Jared Remy, becoming increasingly controlling of their daughter - demanding she take naps, dictating what time she was allowed to cook him dinner and calling her dozens of times throughout the day. For years, they say, Jennifer, 27, rebuffed their suggestions that she should leave the relationship. She said her daughter, Arianna needed her father. And she always seemed to see the good side of the 35-year-old Remy. Speaking out: Brian and Patty Martel says Jared Remy wore their daughter Jennifer down before he allegedly murdered her . Tragic: Mr and Mrs Martel said they said a pattern of increasing control that Jared Remy (left) put on their daughter Jennifer, 27, (right) through the years . The Martels spoke to the Boston Globe - their first time ever speaking out about their daughter who was brutally attacked on the front lawn of her home in Waltham, Massaschusetts, on August 15, 2013 - just three days after Remy was arrested for battery for allegedly slamming her into a mirror in a fit of rage. On Monday August 12, Mrs Martel said she talked to her daughter her the phone. After six years in an abusive relationship, Jennifer had finally had enough. 'She said, ""Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape,""' Mrs Martel told the Globe. Mr and Mrs Martel said they always knew Remy was controlling. They said they could see him wearing down their 'effervescent' daughter - but they never knew how dangerous he could be. 'She used to always tell me, ""Jared, he’s got a big bark, but he’ll calm down,""' Mrs Martel said. 'We don’t come from violence. We didn’t recognize domestic violence. We just thought he was a jerk,' Mr Martel told the Globe. His wife added: 'It’s so clear to us now.' 'Mom, don’t worry; I’m planning my escape.' -Jennifer Martel, three days before she was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend Jared Remy . In February 2013, Mrs Martel - who lived in Virginia with her husband, her son Brian Jr and his wife and kids - drove to Massachusetts to visit her daughter. What she saw there upset her. Remy, an alleged steroid abuser, called her 'trailer trash' and blew up at her over the smell of the cigarettes she smoked on the couple's patio. One day, he declared that it was 'nap time' for Jennifer, Mrs Martel and little Arianna and made them lay down in a dark room for several hours. When they were allowed to come out, he wouldn't let Jennifer cook dinner until he was ready to eat. Mrs Martel said Remy became jealous any time Jennifer left the house without him - except for her work time and his scheduled visited to the gym. She said she cut the visit to her daughter two days short when Remy became enraged with Jennifer. He called her 17 times in a row. By the time she picked up, she broke down in tears in a Kmart as Remy screamed at her. Jennifer told her mother she had to leave - that her presence was agitating her boyfriend. Jennifer, 27, had finally had enough and was planning to leave when Remy allegedly stabbed her to death on the front lawn of their Massachusetts home, her parents say . Jared Remy's father, Jerry Remy, is a Boston sports legend and still works as a Red Sox broadcaster . Mrs Martel says she begged her daughter to take Arianna and come back to Virginia with her. According to the Globe, Mrs Martel exchanged several tragic text messages with her daughter that day. 'I need to see [if] I can get him help first. I talk with his family to see what we can do. he is Ariannas father and I need to do this for her,' Jennifer wrote. Her mother replied: 'I just want you to be happy you don’t deserve this Arianna loves him but as she [gets] older she going to see what he really is... Sometimes you can’t change someone like that ... He has a bad control on you.' Jennifer said: 'I not going to let him control me. I have help here. jareds parents wants what is best for Arianna and they know jared is a mess.' Later, she added: 'I cant handle another blowout like the other day. i am emotional exhausted.' The . next day, her brother, Brian Martel Jr. text Jennifer and said he would . rent a UHaul and move her out of her home with Remy if she wanted. Again, Jennifer refused. Brian . and his wife got custody of Arianna after a lengthy court battle with . Remy's father, Boston sports legend Jerry Remy. She will be raised with . her cousins. However, Jerry Remy and his wife have visitation rights. Jared Remy has pleaded not guilty to murder charges and denied he killed Jennifer.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The mother of a college sophomore who died last year from a rare case of bacterial meningitis honored her daughter's memory over the weekend by taking a group of young students to Canada to get the vaccine for the deadly disease. Currently, the vaccine is not approved for use in the United States - had it been, Emily Stillman might still be alive. Stillman, 19 at the time, was a sophomore at Kalamazoo College in Michigan when she called her mother to tell her she had a headache. Tragedy: Emily Stillman (left) died last year after she caught a rare case of bacterial meningitis and her mom, Alicia (second from right) doesn't want it to happen to anyone else . Action: Alicia Stillman started the Emily Stillman Foundation to spread awareness of the disease in honor of her daughter . Less than 36 hours later, Stillman was dead, killed by the first case of bacterial meningitis at Kalamazoo College in at least 15 years. 'I told her, ""It's okay.

Recently, there have been outbreaks of the highly contagious disease at Princeton University and University of California at Santa Barbara - and there still is no vaccine approved for use in the United States. Outbreak: Last year, there was an outbreak of the rare disease on a number of college campuses across the U.S. So, Alicia Stillman took a bus filled with students across the U.S./Canadian border to Windsor, Ontario, to get immunized. Stillman has a son who is getting ready to attend the University of Michigan in the fall. According to NBC News, Stillman's sone and many of his classmates will be on the bus. 'I feel like I'm giving them such a gift,' Stillman told the network. 'I tell them, ""I'm so honored to be able to help you . protect your family in a way that I could not protect my daughter.'"" Vaccine: Alicia Stillman took her other children, seen here with Emily, to Canada along with dozens of other students to get immunized . The students were each given doses of Novartis' Bexsero, which has been approved in Europe, Australia and . Canada. The drug also was given to thousands of college students throughout the U.S. during the meningitis outbreak last fall. The drug is not yet approved for use in the U.S. but health officials say they are working on gaining approval for a bacterial meningitis vaccine. 'I couldn't help my own daughter and so now I'm going to help everybody else's,' Alicia Stillman tells PEOPLE. 'It's going to be emotional.'","Emily Stillman, 19, contracted bacterial meningitis in fall of 2013 and died just hours after going to the hospital .

"By . David Mccormack . More than 10,000 American toddlers are being given drugs for ADHD despite pediatric guidelines stating that it shouldn’t be administered to children aged younger than four years old. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report found that children aged 2 and 3 – particularly those covered by Medicaid - were especially prone to being prescribed medication such as Ritalin and Adderall. The American Academy of Pediatrics' ADHD guidelines don’t make reference to diagnosis in children under four, because experts believe hyperactive and impulsive behavior are appropriate for toddlers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that more more than 10,000 children under four years of age are being given ADHD drugs each year . It is widely considered within the . medical profession that ADHD symptoms – such as issues with paying . attention - begin after age six and should be present for more than six . months for a diagnosis to be made. The CDC states in the report that it has serious concerns about the safety and effectiveness of ADHD drugs being used on children at such a young age. ‘It’s absolutely shocking, and it shouldn’t be happening,’ Anita Zervigon-Hakes, a children’s mental health consultant told the New York Times. ‘We obviously don’t have our act together for little children.’ The report, which was presented on Friday at the Georgia Mental Health Forum in Atlanta, was based on Medicaid claims in Georgia and claims by privately insured families nationwide kept by research firm MarketScan. Drugs like Ritalin and Adderall can help calm hyperactivity, but carry risks for growth suppression, insomnia and hallucinations . With no nationwide Medicaid data . currently available, Dr. Susanna Visser said Georgia’s rates of the . disorder are very typical of the United States as a whole. 'If we applied Georgia’s rate to the number of toddlers on Medicaid nationwide, we would expect at least 10,000 of those to be on ADHD medication,' she said. Drug-free alternatives, such as teaching parents and day care workers to provide more structured environments for children, are being ignored, she warned. 'Families of toddlers with behavioral problems are coming to the doctor’s office for help, and the help they’re getting too often is a prescription for a Class II controlled substance, which has not been established as safe for that young of a child,' said Visser. 'It puts these children and their developing minds at risk, and their health is at risk.' Visser didn't have an explanation for why toddlers covered by Medicaid are being medicated for the disorder far more often than those covered by private insurance. Drugs like Ritalin and Adderall can help calm hyperactivity, but carry risks for growth suppression, insomnia and hallucinations. A nationwide CDC survey last year found that 11 percent of children ages 4 to 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD and that about one in five boys are diagnosed during childhood.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that more more than 10,000 children under four years of age are being given ADHD drugs .

"By . Associated Press . George Knoop, 77, was stabbed multiple times Tuesday afternoon in the Delmas section of Haiti's capital. The missionary from Chicago was alone at the time and apparently knew his assailant, according to friends and police. Detectives have taken two statements, but no arrests have been made in the case and the motive for Knoop's murder is still not known, said John Munsell, chairman of the board for the Quisqueya Chapel in Haiti where Knoop worked.

'We're definitely wanting this person to be found and brought to justice,' said Munsell. The Quisqueya Chapel is a non-denominational and evangelical church. A memorial for him was held at the church on Wednesday by his shocked friends and fellow church members. 'It's a small community and we're all pretty devastated,' friend and . fellow church member Zach Segaar-King said. After he was stabbed, Knoop called a security guard who worked at the church and cried for help. Munsell said Knoop may have called the guard because it was the first number he could reach in his cellphone. Church members then went to Knoop's home, a two-minute drive away, and he was found on the floor. Police later recovered the knife. A computer was apparently stolen during the attack but it does not appear robbery was the motive . Knoop was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead at 5:09 p.m. 'In terms of us here at the chapel we are not aware of any conflicts he had with people,' Munsell said. 'He was well-liked.' Knoop also worked in Haiti as a . volunteer for U.S.-based Missionary Flights International. Larry . Campbell, vice president of operations for the organization, said Knoop . had been a teacher in the Chicago area who felt called by God to work in . Haiti after attending a church presentation about the devastating . January 2010 earthquake. 'He . felt that God wanted him to work there, where people had need,' Campbell said. 'And he went down and tried to see what he could do.' Knoop also mentored young men and led Bible study groups. 'He worked with guys, take them under his wing and follow up with them. 'How's it going?' That kind of stuff,' Munsell said. Knoop came to Haiti for the first time in 2010 in the aftermath of the earthquake. He became an elder with the Quisqueya Chapel and a worked as a volunteer for U.S.-based Missionary Flights International. He was divorced and didn't have any children, Munsell said.","George Knoop, 77, was stabbed multiple times on Tuesday at his his in Port-au-Prince .

Niu Tuan, 35, launched into a frenzied assault on Zhang Mintong when she saw him writing out a ticket for her illegally parked car in Haikou City, southern China.

The eyewitness who photographed the assault said that Niu had told Officer Zhang she had only been parked in the spot on Zijing Road, Jinmao District, for a minute. She flew into a rage after he refused to tear up the ticket. The eyewitness who took the photographs gave them to police when they arrived, and then also posted them to the internet.

Officer Ou said: 'She slapped Zhang in the face knocking off his hat, and then she punched and scratched him and was screaming all the time that he was attacking her. 'She was pretty hysterical and I am not quite so sure why she decided to just fly off the handle, but my poor colleague who wouldn't hurt a fly was pretty traumatised. 'He had to go to hospital and is still off work while she was left without a scratch.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A drug used as a cancer treatment has been found to slow the progression of a fatal lung disease significantly. Scientists from Southampton General Hospital discovered that nintedanib makes a dramatic difference to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The condition, which affects mainly men and former smokers, causes inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue. Sufferers have an average life expectancy of between three and five years, with 5,000 deaths and 5,000 new cases every year. The drug nintedanib was previously used to treat cancer and has been shown to slow the progress of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Nintedanib works by blocking the chemical signals that activate the disease by creating excess tissue and scarring and causing breathing problems. The two studies, led by Professor Luca Richeldi, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Southampton General Hospital, compared the breathing capacity of 638 people with IPF who used the drug with 423 who took a placebo. Breathing capacity is measured by the amount of air a person can expel after their deepest breath, which is seriously affected in IPF sufferers. Researchers found that the decline in the breathing capacity of patients taking nintedanib was cut by around half over the two studies. The drug is now likely to be licensed worldwide within the next year, and avail-able to patients in the near future. Researchers hope that the drug will be licensed to treat IPF within the next twelve months (picture posed by model) Professor Richeldi said: ‘The impact of this study cannot be overstated. These are exciting results and mean nintedanib has the potential to offer patients a new direction in treating this aggressive disease.’ He said: 'The prognosis for patients with IPF is worse than many cancers and cases are increasing by 5,000 a year in the UK alone, so the need for new, targeted and more effective treatments has never been greater. 'Nintedanib specifically targets some key molecular pathways known to be involved in IPF, which gives us a much clearer insight into how the body works and how we might be able to further develop treatments. He added: 'We expect an advance use programme to begin in Europe before next summer, so the drug may become available to at least some patients within the next few months.' Researchers based at Southampton General Hospital (pictured) conducted the ground-breaking clinical study .","5,000 people are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis each year .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Candice Swanepoel, certainly a woman of many talents in the looks department, has revealed she has another, lesser-known trick up her sleeve. 'I am very good at pretending that I am not nervous!' admits the 25-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel. And you'd hardly guess the self-confessed 'shy' model was ever short on confidence, judging by her latest stunning bikini spread for Marie Claire. Cool exterior: Candice Swanepoel (pictured) looks stunning as usual as she appears in a beach spread for Marie Claire and admits her hidden talent is hiding her nerves . The blonde bombshell, who seems to . practically live in swimwear when she's not on the red carpet, poses on a . (perhaps chilly) Miami beach in which she dons a selection of coats, . towels and wraps. Miss Swanepoel, who looks as lovely as ever draped in jewelry with windswept hair, clearly takes her prized role as a Victoria's Secret Angel very seriously, nervous or not. 'It comes with a different kind of responsibility,' she explains. 'It’s not just about posing for shoots. People know your name and your personality.' Covering up: The blonde bombshell spoke about the nature of her esteemed role as a Victoria's Secret Angel, saying it 'comes with a different kind of responsibility' She also opened up about her childhood hobby: ballet, and how it later informed her career as a professional-beautiful-person. 'It has helped a lot with modeling because I think about all parts of my body, from my fingers to my toes,' she says. Miss Swanpoel has spoken previously of her affections for the challenging dance form, telling V Magazine in 2011: 'I had been dancing from a very young age. My mom was a dancer too, so it was something that bonded us. Dancer's legs: Miss Swanepoel (pictured in New York last week) also opened up about her love for ballet, having been a dancer in her youth, and says if wasn't a model she'd 'probably' still be doing it . Little . Candice: For Throwback Thursday last week, the 5ft 9in stunner shared a cherubic . childhood snap from her hometown back in South Africa, where she grew up on a dairy farm . Model pals: Miss Swanepoel shared this snap today, captioned 'All black errythang. NYC nights [sic]' posing with fellow Angel Lily Aldridge . I loved the discipline and elegance of ballet, and the training has helped me so much.' In fact, she tells Marie Claire that if she hadn't become a blindingly successful model, she'd probably have continued with ballet, 'or maybe I would have become a veterinarian,' she muses. Quite a leap from what she told the magazine in an interview last year, when she said she would 'definitely' have been a make-up artist, but a girl is entitled to change to mind. Covergirl: Jennifer Lawrence fronts Marie Claire's June issue . Miss Swanepoel grew up on a farm in her native South Africa, and was discovered by an agency scout at the age of 15, while shopping at a flea market with her mother. She has been with her boyfriend, Brazilian model Hermann Nicoli, throughout her sky-rocketing career, ever since they met in Paris in 2005 when she was only 17 years old. Miss Swanepoel earned her Angel wings in 2010 and has been a firm favorite of the lingerie giant ever since, counting fellow South African Angel Behati Prinsloo and Dutch beauty Doutzen Kroes as some of her closet friends. She appeared last month at the brand's Bond Street store in London, alongside marketing director Ed Razek, where they announced that its 2014 fashion show will cross the pond from its previous home in New York to the British capital on December 2.

"By . Ashley Collman . In addition to burrito bowls, Chipotle is now serving food for the soul as well. The chain started publishing the works of famous writers on their take-out cups and bags on Thursday. Author Jonathan Safran Foer came up with the idea for the fast-food flash-fictions while eating at a Chipotle restaurant, having forgot to bring a book or his smart phone to entertain him. Taco text: Chipotle is now publishing the work of famous writers on the side of its take-out cups and bags . 'I really just wanted to die with frustration,' Foer told Vanity Fair of the boring experience. Foer knew Chipotle CEO Steve Ells, and pitched him the idea in an email. 'I said, ""I bet a shitload of people go into your restaurants every day, and I bet some of them have very similar experiences, and even if they didn’t have that negative experience, they could have a positive experience if they had access to some kind of interesting text,""' Foer recalled. Ells went for it, and let Foer take charge of editing. In the end, he convinced writers Toni Morrison and George Saunders to get on board as well as journalists Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis. Flash fictions: The new cups and bags will feature the work of writers Jonathan Safran Foer, Toni Morrison and George Saunders as well as journalists Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis . 'I selected the writers, and insofar as there was any editing, I did it,' Foer said. 'I tried to put together a somewhat eclectic group, in terms of styles. I wanted some that were essayistic, some fiction, some things that were funny, and somewhat thought provoking.' The new 'Cultivating Thought' cups debut Thursday, but Morrison, Foer and Lewis' contributions can be read now on Vanity Fair's website.

Something felt very democratic and good about this.' Unlikely collaborator: Foer's collaboration with Chipotle was somewhat surprising considering he is a noted critic of mass food production in the United States, a topic he explored in his book 'Eating Animals'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A well-regarded Canadian fashion designer has created a line of clothing specifically for individuals who use a wheelchair. Izzy Camilleri’s IZ Adaptive offers clothes for both disabled men and women whose fashion needs are dictated by their constantly seated form. Because of this, conventional clothes often pose the problem of bulky fabrics, awkwardly-placed zippers, and odd draping. IZ Adaptive seeks to eliminate these issues through specially-engineered designs. Catering to seated forms: IZ Adaptive is a Canadian label designed for wheelchair users . Both genders: The label designs men's and womenswear with wheelchair users' special fashion needs in mind . Ms Camilleri created the line after . Canadian journalist Barbara Turnbull, who was paralyzed after being . shot, asked her to make a custom shearling cape in 2004 – having found . it immensely difficult to find a proper winter coat, as the garment’s . fabric tends to pool in awkward places on a wheelchair. The . two embarked on multiple years’ worth of collaboration before Ms . Camilleri decided to take the concept to the next level and create a . line. Hence, IZ Adaptive was born. Prior, . Ms Camilleri had operated a more conventional fashion line in Toronto, . later becoming a TV and film costumer. She even created a few of the . furs worn by Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada. Tailor-made: Designer Izzy Camilleri has installed the clothes with magnetic buttons and well-placed zippers so that wearers have an easy time using the garments . Concious approach: Ms Camilleri chose the fabric for her designs based on what would be most comfortable for consumers, as well as what would drape best when placed on a seated form . But . now she is designing motorcycle jackets, shirtdresses, denim skirts, . and even bathrobes for women who use a wheelchair. Designs range from . $29 for a T-shirt to $299 for a biker jacket. Menswear offerings include button-down shirts, sweaters, chinos, and even blazers that range from $39 to $199. Of . creating IZ Adaptive, Ms Camilleri says on her site: ‘I was just at a . point in my life where it all made sense that I could make clothes where . it was making a difference in people’s lives with work that had never . been attempted before.’ Cool prints: Ms Camilleri has included many contemporary prints in her designs to help consumers express their personas . Professional appearance: Many of IZ Adaptive's menswear designs are perfectly suited to the office . In . engineering the designs, Ms Camilleri said that she had to revisit how . clothes are even constructed. Because many wheelchair users find it . difficult to get clothes on and off she has largely used magnetic . buttons, rather than conventional ones. Similarly . she has placed zippers in strategic places, like the front of a garment . instead of the back or side. She has also chosen lightweight stretch . fabrics that don’t add bulk, as well as clothing silhouettes that will . not awkwardly pool or drape when placed on a seated form. More than fashion: Ms Camilleri says her work goes beyond clothes, and is about giving people their personality back . But according to Ms Camilleri, IZ Adaptive’s concept is about much more than just fashion. She . said: ‘It goes beyond the clothes, it’s giving someone their . personality back, their sense of inclusion – there just hasn’t been . anything like this.’","IZ Adaptive, based in Toronto, creates clothing intended for the seated form .

"By . Emily Crane . It is usually teeming with surfers but Australia's iconic Bondi Beach could now easily be mistaken for a lake as warm weather and a lack of wind drives the waves away. The famous Sydney beach was overrun by boats on Sunday as people took advantage of the remarkably flat water during a 10km swimming race from Bondi to Watsons Bay. Forecasters say the surf may not return for several days as the entire NSW coast experiences similar conditions. Scroll down for video . Australia's iconic Bondi Beach was overrun by boats on Sunday as waves along the popular surfing hot spot were remarkably absent . 'The lack of waves relates to the same reason we've had the really stable and clear weather for the past week,' Simon Louis, a Bureau of Meterology forecaster said. 'There's a real high pressure system that's sitting over the Tasman and extending over NSW.' Mr Louis said the warm weather meant there was no low pressure systems around to build up some swell and was affecting areas as far as Byron Bay on the north coast of NSW. 'Byron looks like it's slightly higher (than Bondi) but even that's not high,' he said. 'There's very light winds on the coast at the moment so there's no wind waves being generated closer to the beach,' Mr Louis said. 'It's probably fairly common when there's very stable weather. 'But it would vary during different parts of the day – in the afternoon there's more likely to be a sea breeze.' The waves are expected to pick back up later this week. 'We're expecting a bit of a change on Wednesday with a southerly wind and a bit of a temperature drop,' Mr Louis said. 'It looks like there’s a chance it may break down.' Forecasters said the warm weather meant there was no low pressure systems around to build up some swell and was affecting areas as far as Byron Bay on the north coast of NSW . The calm Bondi waters continued on Monday morning with the waves expected to pick back up later this week . 'We're expecting a bit of a change on Wednesday with a southerly wind and a bit of a temperature drop,' Simon Louis, a Bureau of Meterology forecaster said . The calm Bondi waters continued this morning and lifeguards from Bondi North Lifesaving Club managed to capture a whale frolicking close to the beach. The sighting is one of many in recent days with two humpbacks playing with a pod of dolphins off Bondi Beach on Saturday morning. Another five were seen around the same area that afternoon. Jonas Liebschner from Whale Watching Sydney said the large number of animals sighted was extraordinary. '(It) is a phenomenal number for this early in the season,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Bondi is normally home to big waves and the clear absence corresponds with the warm weather Sydney has experienced in the past week .

"By . Damien Gayle . Three-year-old Damai looks sombre as he plays in his enclosure at Surabaya Zoo, in Surabaya, Indonesia. Indeed, despite his carefree age, the baby orangutan has lately had little joy in his life. Just last week he was found, along with his brother Rizki, languishing alone in the wild. The pair had been separated their mother in Kutai National Park, a vast expanse of supposedly protected tropical rainforest on the east coast of Borneo. Damai, a three-year-old Bornean orangutan, plays in his enclosure at Surabaya Zoo after being rescued from the wild . The young orangutan looks pensive as he gets used to his new environment just five days after he and his brother were found alone in Kutai National Park . Damai and his brother were found separated from their mother, who may have been killed while clearing forest for palm oil plantations . Damai stares into the distance from his enclosure at the Surabaya Zoo, where he and his brother have been treated for various injuries . The Centre for Orangutan Protection says that many of the orangutans it rescues are orphans whose mothers have been killed by loggers . They were in a malnourished and in critical condition when they were rescued by wildlife conservationists from the Centre for Orangutan Protection, with wounds mainly to their feet and hands. Now they are being nursed back to health, but the pair - like all Borneo's orangutans - face an uncertain and difficult future. Deforestation on the island has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of orangutans, says COP. As loggers move in to clear a path for palm oil plantations, they often slaughter orangutans they come across. Many of the animals the group rescues are severely traumatised orphans whose mothers have been shot and hacked to death with machetes. Damai appears a little more cheerful as he plays with netting installed in his enclosure as a diversion for the captive orangutans . Damai with his brother Rizki, who was found with him. The pair were malnourished and in a critical condition when they were picked up . Now they are being nursed back to health, but the pair - like all Borneo's orangutans - face an uncertain and difficult future . The brothers cuddle while playing on the net hammock in Surabaya Zoo's orangutan enclosure . Deforestation on the island of Borneo has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of orangutans, says the Centre for Orangutan Protection . Many of the animals the group rescues are severely traumatised orphans whose mothers have been shot and hacked to death with machetes . A keeper checks on Damai. He and his brother were suffering multiple injuries to their hands and feet when they were rescued by conservationists . A spokesman for COP said: 'COP realises the absolute vital importance of protecting rainforest – home for the orangutans and many other species of wildlife. As far as we know we are the only organisation in Indonesia out there every day investigating and reporting forest crimes. 'Our work takes us all over Kalimantan (Indonesia Borneo), documenting the devastation to forests caused particularly by oil palm companies. Some of what we observe is ‘legal’, but wrong. A lot of what we see is definitely illegal and we do our best to stop it. 'We regularly file reports with our government and hold protests in Jakarta to raise awareness of the problems. Because of what we do, we make ourselves very unpopular with the government and even some conservation organisations who prefer to remain friends with those who tear down our forest and kill orangutans. Damai and his brother are being prepared for release back into the wild some day. But with the world's appetite for palm oil - widely used in the commercial food industry since the switch away from trans fats - only growing, there may not be much wild left for them to return to.","Damai and his brother Rizki were found wandering alone in Kutai National Park on the east coast of Borneo .
They were separated from their mother, severely malnourished and had suffered injuries to their hands and feet .
Much of Borneo's tropical rainforests, orangutans' natural habitat, is being cleared to meet demand for palm oil ."
