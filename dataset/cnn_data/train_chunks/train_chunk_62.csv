"Mosul, Iraq (CNN) -- The last U.S. brigade combat team in Iraq has left the country, a move that helps U.S. President Barack Obama reach his goal of 50,000 troops in the country by September 1. Their departure leaves about 56,000 U.S. troops in the country, according to the U.S. military. Capt. Christopher Ophardt, spokesman for the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, said the last of the 4,000 members of the unit crossed the border into Kuwait early Thursday. A few hundred members stayed behind to finish administrative and logistical duties but will fly out of Baghdad later Thursday, Ophardt said. Much of the brigade departed more than a day ago, but the announcement was delayed for security reasons. Tell us how the Iraq War has affected your life . Their departure comes more than seven years after U.S. combat forces entered, though their departure does not signify the end of all U.S. combat forces in the country. Another 6,000 U.S. troops must leave Iraq to meet Obama's deadline for the end of U.S. combat operations in the country and the beginning of Operation New Dawn, in which the remaining U.S. forces are expected to switch to an advise-and-assist role. A public information officer at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, said it will take a few weeks for all of the 4-2's members to return home. ""It is one flight at a time,"" she said. ""We are expecting most of them to be home by mid-September."" As they prepared to depart, some soldiers laughed and some expressed relief at having survived multiple deployments. A few reminisced about having endured firefights and helping carry the bodies of buddies off the field of battle. Many said they would never forget the war. ""The first time you get shot at, it's just, I mean, it wakes you up,"" said Sgt. Terry Wetzel, the company's senior sniper. ""You think, before you come here, that you're an adult, that you're a grown man. But this place will change you."" Wetzel said he was ready to go home. ""I feel like we have done as much as we can do here now. It's pretty much up to the Iraqi army and Iraqi police and their government,"" he said. ""We have helped them out as much as we can."" ""We put our blood, sweat and tears since we've been here for 12 months and we know we did our job and we know it's not going to be in vain, but there's a lot of excitement right now,"" said Spc. Don Lanpher as he prepared to depart. ""We're keeping the promise that we've made when I began my campaign for the presidency,"" Obama said Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio, where he was attending a Democratic fundraiser. ""By the end of this month ... our combat mission will be over in Iraq."" Obama said that more than 90,000 U.S. troops have left Iraq in the past 18 months. ""And, consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all of our troops will be out of Iraq by the end of next year,"" he said. Former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told CNN that the United States has plenty of work left to do in Iraq. ""Iraq is still at the beginning of the story of its evolution since 2003,"" he said, referring to the date of the U.S.-led invasion of the country. ""As tired as many Americans may be, this process is still just at its beginning."" In fact, Iraq remains without a functioning government, electricity and other utilities are available only sporadically in the capital, and violence appears to be increasing. At least 48 people were killed Tuesday outside a military recruiting center in Baghdad. ""We're going to have to leave a large footprint behind, and this is not going away for us as an issue,"" he said. The State Department is preparing to leave much of that footprint. It will handle many of the responsibilities currently shouldered by the military, increasing its security contractors from 2,700 to nearly 7,000, sources said. They are expected to work with diplomats and police trainers in some facilities. The State Department has asked for an additional $400 million to cover the costs, though it was not clear they would get it. The State Department has asked the U.S. military to leave behind surveillance systems, about 50 bomb-resistant vehicles and a few dozen UH-60 helicopters, a military official said. Though they got a lot of what they wanted, the Pentagon said it could not give them all the helicopters because they are needed in Afghanistan, the official said. According to the Pentagon, 4,419 U.S. troops have died in Iraq.

"(CNN) -- If masculinity could take the form of a 2-inch frosted cupcake, David Arrick would have the recipe. His New York cupcake company, Butch Bakery, is an anomaly in a world seemingly dominated by all things dainty and cute. Arrick refuses to serve the ""frilly, pink-frosted, sprinkles-and-unicorns"" variety. Instead, customers can proclaim their machismo with cakes made with beer, whiskey, bacon and crushed pretzels. ""It was born out of necessity and a love of buttercream,"" Arrick said of his 9-month-old business. Each Butch cupcake sits under a generous layer of frosting and a chocolate disc with a camouflage, wood grain, plaid, houndstooth or other ""manly"" pattern. Like a mixed-martial arts fight, Arrick's cupcakes can pack a serious punch. Six of his 12 varieties feature alcohol -- and customers feel the hit. ""The ones with alcohol are actually pretty potent,"" said David Barrineau, who ordered Butch cupcakes as a joke for the men and women in his advertising agency. ""The first one I tried ... it had wood grain on it. It definitely had whiskey in it,"" Barrineau said. ""I think we all got a buzz from these -- it was pretty strong!"" But can whiskey-infused cupcakes disguised in camo really transform cupcakes into macho fare? ""I think if you try them, you wouldn't have to ask,"" Barrineau said. Arrick said he doesn't think the average man would necessarily turn down a pastel, ladylike cupcake. ""Men like to eat,"" he said. ""I'm not saying I'm not going to go for a cupcake with a peony on it."" But, if given the option, ""a guy is going to go for the one that has camo or plaid on it."" The flour-and-frosting world seems a far cry from Wall Street, home to a major law firm where Arrick worked as an asset-backed securities attorney. But like many in 2007 and 2008, Arrick's career caved unexpectedly. ""I was laid off. I didn't know what I was going to do,"" he said. ""I'm 40 years old, I have student loans out the wazoo. What am I going to do?"" As Arrick looked around the streets of New York and mulled his options, he marveled how the city's vast array of bakeries and cupcake shops kept growing and making money during a recession. But all the cupcakes seemed too cookie-cutter. ""There's been a vacancy in the market with marketing toward men,"" he noticed. That's when the epiphany hit. Arrick liquidated his 401(k) and gambled $25,000 on the macho bakery of his dreams. Butch Bakery went from selling 40 cupcakes a week to 400 cupcakes a week -- all without a storefront. The bakery operates out of a commercial kitchen shared with other businesses and sells its manly confections online. While most cupcakes are, stereotypically, feminine or frilly, Arrick is keenly aware that he himself is playing on stereotypes with his use of bacon, beer and in-your-face manly advertising. ""It's so tongue-in-cheek,"" Arrick said. Ironically, 95 percent of Butch Bakery's customers are women. Arrick said many are searching for creative gifts after exhausting cliche ideas such as neckties. Arrick has received order requests from around the world, including from troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kathryn Donaldson tried to place an order for her husband, who is stationed in South Korea. Donaldson said the Butch baked goods would be the perfect pick-me-up for soldiers overseas. ""The stuff we send them, it means a lot to them,"" Donaldson said. ""We can send them care packages and everything, but something like that is so much more special because it's so unique. We can't do the flavorings like rum and coke. We can't figure out how to make them taste like rum and coke."" Butch Bakery delivers to Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, but does not ship out-of-state. Arrick said his growth is limited by storage and oven space, but he hopes to start shipping orders outside New York by the end of this year. Arrick doesn't have a target date for setting up a storefront. But Barrineau, a loyal fan of the ""Tailgate"" cupcake, says he can already forecast the entrepreneur's future: . ""I think he would see a line of big, hairy men waiting in line for cupcakes.""","Butch Bakery features flavors such as mojito, beer run and jackhammer .

"(CNN) -- Using high-tech robotic cameras, a team of scientists is getting a rare first glimpse of marine life in the North Atlantic that could shed light on the ocean's ecosystem and climate to as far back as 1,000 years. Images of tulip-shaped sponges, brightly colored corals, delicate pink stars and feathery organisms were among the breathtaking marine life beamed up by a submersible robot that scoured the ocean bed at a depth of some 9,800 feet [3,000 meters] off the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland. The team, led by Fisheries and Oceans, Canada and including scientists from three Canadian universities and the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, is in the midst of a 20-day expedition to study 11 areas under the protection of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. Exploring these areas is important because they contain the ""trees of the ocean,"" said Ellen Kenchington, research scientist with the Fisheries Department of Canada. She is among the lead scientists in the expedition. ""It's been really spectacular,"" she told CNN affiliate CTV from her office at the institute as pictures from the robot streamed on her computer. ""It's really changing our perception of the diversity that's out there. ... We're seeing new species in deeper waters."" Kenchington told the Montreal Gazette that scientists potentially can look at the coral's chemical composition and determine the temperature of the water and other data from 1,000 years ago. ""That's how we are able to say if there is warming or a change in climate direction,"" she said. ""In order to understand the present, we need to put it into context."" Corals have been a highly successful life form for 250 million years. They are tiny animals and polyps that exist as genetically identical individuals and can eat, defend themselves and kill plankton for food. In the process they also secrete calcium carbonate, which becomes the basis for an external skeleton on which they sit. These calcified deposits can grow to enormous sizes over a long period of time and form coral reefs. The reefs are among the world's most productive ecosystems and can harbor more than 4,000 species of fish and many other marine life forms. Some estimates have suggested 20 percent of the world's coral reefs are already dead and an additional 24 percent are gravely threatened. In the week they have left in the expedition, Kenchington and her team hope to collect samples and video from the depths of the ocean to gain a new understanding of these corals as well as other marine life. The underwater robot, operated by crew aboard the Canadian Coast Guard ship Hudson, is enabling the crew to go about 500 meters deeper than they have before. Kenchington told CTV the research will also help them evaluate areas that are still too deep for current fishing technologies but could be accessible in years to come. ""This will enable us to give advice in the future about what types of organisms are in these areas before they're fished,"" she said.","The scientists discovered deep-sea marine life that could shed light on the ocean's climate .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian Muslims have been praying in the wrong direction, the country's highest Islamic authority has said. The Indonesian Ulema Council told the country's Muslim populace in March to turn west when they offered their daily prayers. Muslims are supposed to face the Kaaba, the religion's most sacred site in the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the council said that the direction of Kaaba from Indonesia laid to the west. Turns out, it didn't. Africa did. So, on Friday, the council issued a new edict: face northwest. ""After the first fatwa (edict) a few months ago that stated that the praying direction is west, we have announced that the correct direction for praying is indeed northwest, and we have issued a new fatwa (edict) to correct it,"" said Ma'ruf Amin, the head of fatwa division in the Indonesian Ulema Council. ""This is important because facing west will mean that people were facing Africa when they pray,"" he said. Amin said the new edict does not mean that mosques in the country will need to be torn down. ""They (those praying inside) just need to adjust their praying direction slightly,"" he said. Some residents of the world's most populous Muslim country took the change in stride. ""I don't really worry about the praying direction,"" said Riza Irwansyah, an office worker in Jakarta. ""The important thing is I prayed to Allah and I believe He will listen, no matter which way I'm facing.""","Earlier edict from Islamic council had Muslims facing west, where Africa lays .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama and his family begin a week-long vacation in Martha's Vineyard on Friday -- the president's second time on the island off the coast of Massachusetts. In 2009, Obama spent time there golfing and hanging out with family and friends. ""It's a beautiful part of the country. It has really nice beaches and the folks are really great,"" Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton told reporters Thursday. ""The food is terrific. And it's some place that the president went before he was president and likes to go back because it's a comfortable place where he can rest and recharge the batteries a little bit."" Some have questioned why the Obamas have chosen to go to an elite holiday spot in Massachusetts instead of the Gulf Coast, as Obama had encouraged Americans to help bolster tourism there.  The first family -- minus eldest daughter Malia -- did visit Panama City, Florida, August 14-15, however.  There, the Obamas swam in the Gulf of Mexico and played miniature golf, and the president met with business leaders about the BP oil spill and its effect on the region. Burton said this vacation, which will last 10 days, will also include some work. ""Well, he'll continue to get his intelligence briefings, and he'll also be getting briefings on the economy and other issues as they come up,"" he said. ""But as any of you guys who have covered these vacations before know, there's other things that come up and he'll obviously attend to those as necessary."" The island, a vacation spot of the rich and famous, was a favorite getaway for another Democratic president as well: Bill Clinton, who spent plenty of time there. George W. Bush, however, preferred to unwind at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.","Critics question why Obama did not choose the Gulf Coast .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona prison escapee and his alleged accomplice appeared in court Friday afternoon after a tip from an observant forest service staffer led to the pair's arrests, ending a three-week manhunt. An Apache County judge read a lengthy list of felony charges to a quiet John McCluskey, 45, who was wearing an orange-and-white striped jail uniform and was flanked by sheriff's deputies. He faces three counts of kidnapping, two counts of escape in the second degree, two counts of armed robbery, two counts of aggravated assault with a dangerous/deadly weapon and two counts of misconduct involving weapons. McCluskey's brief, initial court appearance was immediately followed by one for Casslyn Mae Welch, 44, who faces similar but fewer charges. Welch sat before the judge in a bright green uniform, barely audible in the virtually empty courtroom. Bail was set at $1 million for each, and the next set of hearings was scheduled for August 27. McCluskey and Welch were arrested late Thursday at a campground on the edge of Apache and Sitgreaves National Forests in Springerville, Arizona, U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said Friday. They have been linked to a supremacist group, Gonzales said. Welch, who allegedly helped McCluskey escape, had agreed to be a police informant but failed to stick to her agreement, Gonzales said. A forest service employee noticed an unattended fire at a campsite and spotted a suspicious car backed into some trees, authorities said. The U.S. Forest Service is not identifying the employee, said Apache County Sheriff's Deputy Brannon Eager. A license plate check determined it matched the description of one recently stolen in New Mexico, near where a couple was murdered. McCluskey and Welch are suspected in the killings of the couple, whose bodies were found in their burned camper this month, according to authorities. A SWAT team from the Apache County Sheriff's Department was called to the campground site, where they arrested McCluskey and Welch, Gonzales said. ""Once they felt they had the opportunity, they rushed in very quickly ... so they couldn't get to their weapons,"" Gonzales said. Authorities said Welch attempted to pull out a gun tucked in the small of her back, but SWAT members were able to stop her before the weapon was fired. McCluskey was lying down outside a dome tent and said later he should have fired at the deputies and the park ranger, Gonzales said. ""We were convinced that this would go down in a bloody shootout,"" Gonzales said of how law enforcement officials had anticipated the apprehension of the couple would take place. Apache County Sheriff Joe Dedman called the forest service staffer a ""true hero."" ""He was out there doing his job,"" Dedman said at morning news conference. McCluskey, 45, was serving a 15-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder and other charges when he and fellow convicts Tracy Province and Daniel Renwick broke out of the prison July 30, allegedly with Welch's help. Province and Renwick are already in custody. Welch, who was on the visitation list for one of the inmates, threw cutting tools over a prison fence to help the men escape, corrections officials said earlier this month. The hunt for McCluskey and Welch ranged from the Southwest to western Montana, and along the border with Canada, marshals said. Renwick, 36, was captured August 1 in a shootout with police in Rifle, Colorado. He was serving 22 years for second-degree murder when he escaped. Province, 42, was caught August 9 in Meeteetse, Wyoming, near Yellowstone National Park after authorities were notified by a local resident who sat and talked with Province a day earlier on the steps of a church in town. He was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. Renwick remains in the Garfield County, Colorado, jail on charges of attempted first-degree murder and eluding police, the U.S. Marshals Service said Sunday. Authorities are working to coordinate the transport of Province back to Arizona from Wyoming -- expected to occur within the next month, the marshals service said. Last week, a warden and a security official resigned their posts at the Arizona state prison where the three inmates escaped, a spokesman for the private company that runs the facility said Sunday. CNN's Ninette Sosa and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","Judge sets bail at $1 million for each .

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Angry protests are a common sight in Pakistan. Crowds often gather to denounce the United States or the Pakistani government, which critics accuse of being an American puppet. AntiTaliban protesters in Lahore. But in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore this week, several hundred protesters gathered on a scorching day to take on a very different target: the Taliban. ""I will fight them to my last breath and the last drop of my blood in my body. I'm not scared,"" vowed newspaper publisher Jugnu Mohsin. She was leading a crowd of several hundred students, artists, writers and others, chanting ""the Taliban is the enemy of Islam"" in Urdu. Public protests against the Taliban started cropping up in various Pakistani cities after a video emerged showing militants publicly flogging a teenage girl. The Taliban's recent declaration that the Pakistani government and judicial system are ""unIslamic"" has also outraged many educated Pakistanis. Neha Mehdi moved to Lahore to study. Now, she fears her way of life is being threatened by the Taliban. ""I cannot give up my education, and I cannot give up the way I'm living,"" the 23-year-old student said. ""These Talibans have ruined the reputation of Islam."" ""There were threats here also from the Taliban that if we gather they might just bomb us,"" Mehdi said.  Watch how the anti-Taliban movement is growing » . More than 250 miles away, Pakistan's military continued its assault against Taliban militants who want to impose a radical interpretation of Islamic law in the country's northwestern tribal regions. Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the tribal belt as long as the law was imposed in accordance with the country's constitution. Mehdi and others in Lahore fear that the Taliban's version of sharia -- which forbids girls from attending school, as well as music, poetry and dance -- is slowly creeping into Lahore, the center of Pakistani culture. ""Our way of life is being threatened,"" said Kamiar Rokni, a fashion designer who took part in the protest. ""And if we don't do anything about it, then you're just going to be sitting around and one day the way you live and what this country's all about is going to stand for nothing."" Rokni said he fears the Taliban ""want to change the way we exist."" Lahore may be hundreds of miles away from the Taliban-held areas outside Islamabad, but it is no stranger to militant attacks. ""Last year we lost 39 people in acts of terrorism and this year we have lost 17 people in Lahore alone,"" Lahore police Chief Parvez Rathore said. As he speaks, a heavily armed escort is one step behind the police chief even as he walks outside the walls of the city's police headquarters. In March, gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan national cricket team in Lahore, killing six Pakistani police officers and the team's driver. Weeks later, militants dressed in police uniforms stormed a police training center in the city, prompting an eight-hour stand-off with police. Eight cadets were killed during the March 30 siege, which the government blamed on Pakistan's Taliban. Police in Lahore said the attacks would not have been possible without local support. Residents say there is no doubt that the Taliban have support in Pakistan's second largest city. ""They're here in Lahore, this is the thing,"" said Jamal Rahman, who plays guitar for the Lahore-based band, ""Lal"" which means ""Red."" ""Little groups of the Taliban are going around and intimidating people, causing fear, telling women to cover up and if they don't they'll shoot them."" Rahman and his cousin, Aider -- who plays flute for ""Lal"" -- are using their music to rally society against what he says is a growing threat by the Taliban. ""We want to try to get people aware, and try to get people activated and motivated to fight against this militancy,"" he said. It is unclear if the protests and rallying cries from Rahman and the others in Lahore are the start of a mass movement or simply the swan song of Pakistan's wealthy, urban elite who could be the first to leave if the suicide bombers and insurgents succeed in further destabilizing the country. Either way, their message is a sign that more Pakistanis believe the Taliban's threat is directed at them, and not just a reaction to the so-called U.S.-led ""war on terror."" Mehdi said she fears her life as a student could come to a violent end if the people of Lahore do not stand up to Islamic extremists. ""If the Taliban take over then I'll be on the road being flogged by one of them like they did in Swat and I don't want that,"" she said. Some Pakistanis are resorting to violence to defend their turf. More than 30 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi this week as members of the city's Mahajir ethnic majority group engaged in deadly clashes with ethnic Pashtuns. The Taliban is a mostly Pashtun movement. The government in Karachi has issued a ""shoot on sight"" order to security forces, to try to maintain calm in the city. A week before the clashes erupted, a leader of the MQM political party, which represents the Mahajir community in Karachi, said his supporters would fight back against what he called the ""Talibanization"" of his city. ""You have to take the nasty decisions now,"" Haider Abbas Rizvi told CNN last week. ""You have to take effective measures to control these Taliban ...otherwise the Taliban will take over.""","Protests in Lahore, Pakistan, against Taliban .

"Washington (CNN) -- The companies that have recalled more than half a billion eggs following a salmonella outbreak fell short of safety standards at their farms, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Sunday. ""There's no question these farms involved in the recall were not operating with the standards of practice we consider responsible,"" Hamburg told CNN. She said ""about 1,000"" people have been sickened by a salmonella outbreak that federal regulators have traced back to two Iowa egg producers. One of those companies said Sunday it is ""devastated"" by the possible connection between its product and salmonella. Hillandale Farms of Iowa announced Friday it was recalling more than 170 million eggs. Another 380 million have been recalled by another Iowa producer, Wright County Egg, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration linked the eggs to an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened hundreds of people nationwide. ""We are devastated that our eggs have been implicated in making people sick,"" Hillandale Farms, one of the largest U.S. producers, said in a statement issued Sunday. ""We have never had a product recall in our 45-year history, and it flies in the face of our mission to provide wholesome, nutritious food for the American public. We regret that anyone might have become ill, and the concern and disruption this has caused our customers."" The eggs were shipped to 17 states across the country. The company said it would work with the FDA to review its ""every phase of our operation"" and fix any problems. Hillandale Farms said it shared ""a number of common suppliers"" with Wright County Egg, including a company called Quality Egg, which provided feed and young birds. Both Wright County and Quality Egg are owned by the DeCoster family, which has a string of agribusiness interests in the Midwest and Northeast. Those companies' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month. In June, company owner Jack DeCoster admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in Maine after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to Maine animal welfare officials. Dr. Donald E. Hoenig, the Maine state veterinarian, said the allegations included keeping too many birds in case, failing to treat injured chickens or promptly remove dead animals and improper euthanization. Hoenig said DeCoster and his company agreed to a $25,000 fine and made a $100,000 payment to reimburse the state for future monitoring of the facility. In 1996, the Labor Department accused DeCoster of maintaining ""sweatshop conditions"" for migrant workers at its Turner, Maine, chicken farm, where then-Labor Secretary Robert Reich said workers risked salmonella by handling dead chickens and manure with their bare hands. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined it $3.6 million. In January 2002, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission hit another DeCoster company with allegations that its supervisors sexually assaulted and harassed female employees, including some of whom were in the country illegally, and threatened to retaliate against them if they complained. The managers were fired for ""unrelated reasons,"" the EEOC said, and DeCoster agreed to pay a settlement of more than $1.5 million. And in 2000, Iowa's attorney general declared DeCoster a ""habitual violator"" of state environmental laws after a series of discharges of manure from his hog-farming operations. He paid a $150,000 penalty, had to build six concrete storage structures and his company was barred from expanding those operations. In a statement issued Sunday night, Wright County Egg said it was working with the FDA on the current recalls and defended its record. ""When issues have been raised about our farms, our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively, working with recognized outside experts to identify and establish corrective measures for our operations,"" it said. ""We are approaching our work with FDA in the same forthright manner."" While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the trade association Egg Safety Institute. ""This is one of the larger recalls that have happened,"" Eberle said. But she added, ""This is an extremely rare occurrence.""

"(CNN) -- The death toll from massive floods in Pakistan rose to 1,497 on Friday as U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said the crisis is a ""slow-motion tsunami"" that is expected to grow. The number of homeless as a result of flooding has doubled to 4 million. Ban urged the international community to give more aid during a special fundraising meeting Thursday night. ""Make no mistake,"" he said. ""This is a global disaster, a global challenge. It is one of the greatest tests of global solidarity in our times."" The U.N. secretary-general, who traveled to Pakistan last weekend to visit sites devastated by the disaster, said almost 20 million people need shelter, food and emergency care. ""That is more than the entire population hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Kashmir earthquake, Cyclone Nargis, and the earthquake in Haiti -- combined,"" he said. Are you there? Share your photos and videos . The United Nations has already appealed for $460 million over the next three months, Ban said, and although donors delivered more than a half, the available resources are not sufficient to meet the needs on the ground. The European Commission has pledged 40 million euros ($51 million) since July 31 for the flood victims. It said it will mobilize an additional 30 million euros (about $38 million). ""This disaster is like few the world has ever seen. It requires a response to match,"" Ban said. ""Pakistan needs a flood of support."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also attended the General Assembly meeting, announced an additional $60 million in U.S. aid. The funds bring to $150 million the amount pledged to Pakistan by the United States. ""I want the people of Pakistan to know: The United States will be with you through this crisis,"" she said. ""We will be with you as the rivers rise and fall. We will be with you as you replant your fields and repair your roads. And we will be with you as you meet the long-term challenge to build a stronger nation and a better future for your families."" Clinton urged other nations to help the nation meet its funding goals. Analysts have blamed ""donor fatigue"" for the delay in aid. Pakistan has been on a seemingly constant round of donor needs -- to revive its feeble economy, to fight the Taliban and to recover from the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2009 refugee crisis.","U.N. chief calls Pakistan floods ""a global disaster""

"(CNN) -- A police chase through central Dallas, Texas, ended on the runways of Love Field after a man driving a stolen pickup truck crashed through the airport's gates Thursday afternoon, officials said. Police had tried to stop the truck on a nearby street after they realized it was taken during an aggravated robbery in Fort Worth, Texas, on Wednesday, Dallas police said in a statement. The driver refused to stop and the chase began shortly after 2:30 p.m. The man drove the silver Chevrolet through an airport gate and down one runway, drove across the taxiway to another and back in the opposite direction. ""Air traffic was suspended on that runway, however there were several plane[s] at the opposite end of the runway that the suspect began driving towards,"" the statement said. ""Supervisors monitoring the pursuit made the decision to terminate the pursuit by whatever means necessary so as to preserve the safety of the occupants of the planes. Officers were able to strike the suspect vehicle with their police car, causing it to spin out and ultimately come to a stop. The suspect was taken into custody shortly after that."" A knife believed to have been used in the Fort Worth robbery was recovered in the truck, police said. The suspect was identified as Michael Laurence Brown, 46. Police said the suspect may be linked to other crimes. Charges in the airport incident will follow an initial investigation, police said. ""Although all major incidents such as this are reviewed to ensure all proper procedures were followed, it appears all the officers involved did an outstanding job to bring a dangerous pursuit to a safe end while getting a violent criminal off the streets,"" according to the police statement. Four commercial carriers and several general aviation companies use the airport, located just north of downtown Dallas. The chase shut down operations for about 10 minutes, forcing one arriving aircraft to delay its landing and holding departing planes on the ground, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said.","NEW: Police were worried suspect would try to drive into planes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Xe, the private security firm once known as Blackwater, has reached a $42 million settlement with the U.S. State Department over alleged export violations, a State Department official said. Darby Holladay, a State Department duty officer, said the civil settlement was reached Wednesday for 288 violations between 2003 and 2009, when the company personnel were guarding U.S. staff overseas. They involve the ""unauthorized export"" of defense articles and services to ""foreign end-users in multiple countries"" and ""false statements and misrepresentation or omission of material facts in information provided to the department."" Also, Holladay said, there were violations ""of provisos or limitations on export licenses."" But the violations, he said, ""did not involve sensitive technologies or cause known harm to U.S. national security."" Xe is pleased with the settlement, which will allow it to continue to get government contracts. Company spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke also said the settlement ""will resolve outstanding allegations, continues external compliance oversight, and continues and improves compliance measures."" ""Most violations occurred in training programs for U.S. or allied governments. The vast majority of the exports were eventually authorized"" and that ""most of these violations were committed when the company was undergoing rapid growth."" She said that in reaching the resolution, ""a number of significant steps"" have been made ""to remedy the situation,"" including the replacement of senior management. In October 2008, Xe established an independent committee to oversee its compliance procedures. Blackwater's actions stoked controversy in Iraq and Afghanistan. An incident involving its personnel in 2007 left 17 Iraqi civilians dead in Baghdad. Blackwater lost its contract to guard U.S. staff in Iraq there after Iraq's government refused to renew its operating license. The company changed its name to Xe, and continues to receive multimillion-dollar contracts in Afghanistan. However, Afghan President Hamid Karzai is in the process of disbanding all private security firms in his country. CNN's Joe Sterling and Scott Spoerry contributed to this report.","There were dozens of alleged export violations .

"(CNN) -- In this tech-saturated world, few things are more annoying than car navigation systems that yell at you for making a wrong turn. ""Re-CALC-ulating,"" the system says in that condescending robot voice, as if it is offended by having to rethink the route. ""Turn left at ... [sigh] ... recalculating ..."" Such interactions lead people to think GPS devices are nagging them, said Mark Gretton, chief technology officer of TomTom, a GPS maker. ""The main interaction you have with the device is a series of commands, so that starts the tone of the relationship right from the start,"" he said. ""It's 'Do this, do that, turn right.' "" And it doesn't help if the computer sounds snippy, he said. Despite advances in ""text to speech"" technology, current computer voices can still be socially tone deaf. Car systems are bossy. E-readers read to us aloud, but they don't know what they're reading, so Shakespeare can sound just like a monotone reading of a spreadsheet. None of them can get intonations, pauses or emotional context quite right. Farhad Manjoo, a tech columnist at Slate, compared the Amazon Kindle's reading voice, for example, to ""Gilbert Gottfried laid up with a tuberculin cough"" and ""a dyslexic robot who spent his formative years in Eastern Europe."" So what gives? With more than a decade of voice research under our belts, why can't computers speak our language -- or at least sound a bit more human? Well, they're trying, tech researchers say, but these machines face a striking number of technological hurdles in their efforts to sound un-robotic. Complex speech patterns . The most obvious reason the computers have trouble is that human speech is almost infinitely complex. There are about 40 phonemes -- or basic sounds -- in the English language, but there are seemingly limitless combinations. To try to get computers on the right track, voice technologists record human actors reading all kinds of wacky sentences, which are designed to elicit as many phoneme combinations as possible. Computers store all these sentences in a database, chop them into sounds, and then remix them to make any possible combination of words. The result is intelligible, but it's not quite human. A super-high-quality computer voice might require 40 hours of voice recordings in order to sound nearly human, said Andy Aaron, a computer speech researcher at IBM. That's just for one voice, one accent. Computing power . Aaron said computers that have lots of voice data to pull from can sound, at times, nearly human. But the issue is that not every computer has an entire server farm waiting to process every sentence it would like to say. Mobile phones and GPS devices, in particular, just don't have enough computing power or storage space to thumb through mountains of voice files in order to sound as realistic as possible with current technology. The result: Corners are cut in the name of workability, and some of the nuances of the spoken language are lost, said Gretton of TomTom. This will improve as computers continue to get faster and able to store more data, he said. Parts of computer voices are also generated entirely from equations and models, not actor-read sounds. Those bits act as filler, and cut down on database sizes, too. Speak thy heart . Another major problem for talking computers is that it's somewhat difficult for them to replicate the sound of human emotion and inflection. This, however, is a major topic of speech research, and the technology appears to have made some strides. People who record the sentences that are the grist for computer speech sometimes are asked to read in different emotional states. Computers can pull from these sounds if they want to flip the pitch of a computer voice up at the end of a sentence, for example, in order to ask a question. Or they pull from higher frequencies to sound happy or excited. IBM Research has posted a demo of this on its website in order to show the differences between emotive and robotic computer voices. Take this example sentence: . ""These cookies are delicious."" Listen to that sentence as read by a computer with no emotion. Here it is again, spoken by a computer using a system called Naxpres, which tries to take emotional cues into account. Notice that the voice perks up at the end, as if the computer is saying the cookies are ""de-LISH-ious."" It makes some difference. Emotional context . But copying the sounds of human emotion is only half the battle. To really make computers sound more human, the machines have to understand what they're reading -- at least to some degree -- so that they know when to inflect. This part of computer science is much more challenging, said Aaron. Consider another sample sentence: . ""I say tomato, and you say tomato."" Most people would have heard that line before, and would automatically pronounce ""tomato"" as ""to-mah-toe"" the second time, said Aaron, of IBM. But not a computer. ""How would the computer know that those two words are supposed to be pronounced differently?"" Aaron said. ""It's only real-world knowledge that can tell the computer that those two words are supposed to be pronounced differently."" The same applies to emotions and inflections. It's difficult for a computer to know how to read a passage of text, and what emotions should apply. ""If you read a passage to somebody, you're obviously going to read it a way that does justice to the content,"" said Vlad Sejnoha, chief technology officer of Nuance, a company that develops speech technologies. ""If you're reading a technical report, you're probably not going to read it in a way that's much different from a computer, but if you're reading a poem, it's a different kettle of fish,"" he said. ""You're really trying to communicate a lot of emotional meaning through the pauses you introduce and through the pacing and such. That really requires a pretty deep understanding"" of language. 'You want to punch them' As it turns out, the best computer voices may be those that sound exactly like the person who's listening. If a computer voice matches your mood, your speech patterns, your accent and your tonal range, you're less likely to be annoyed by it, researchers said. How well a computer voice matches the listener's mood is not just a matter of preference -- it's a matter of safety, said Clifford Nass, a Stanford professor who studies computer voices. In a 2005 study, Nass found that these emotional mismatches may actually be dangerous in driving situations. Sad drivers who get instructions from happy computer voices -- and happy drivers who listen to sad voices -- are more likely to have accidents, he said. The emotionally confused drivers are also less likely to be able to pay attention to the road. So, if you're having a groggy sort of morning, instructions from a GPS device that sounds like a caffeinated cheerleader might just push you over the edge. ""If you think about it, when you're happy, you want to be around happy people. But if you're sad, do you really want to hang around chirpy, happy people saying, 'Let's turn that frown upside down?'"" he said. ""No. You want to punch them."" Sejnoha, from Nuance, said his company has developed a prototype computer voice system that listens to a person speak and then tries to mimic it. Gretton, from TomTom, said his company hasn't looked into matching drivers' emotions to the voices of their navigation systems yet. But one interim solution, he said, gives drivers many options when it comes to the voices of their computerized companions. TomTom offers a range of downloadable voices -- from the fictional Darth Vader and Homer Simpson to celebrities like the rapper Snoop Dogg. Users can also read a set of test sentences and have their own voices transferred into the GPS -- so that they're, in effect, bossing themselves around. Perhaps it's a little less tempting to yell at the computer if the computer sounds exactly like you do -- or as close as technology allows.","Computers still don't sound human, even after years of research .

"(CNN) -- ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" is an uplifting spiritual, one that's often heard in churches and popularly recognized as the black national anthem. Timothy Askew grew up with its rhythms, but now the song holds a contentious place in his mind. ""I love the song,"" said Askew, an associate professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. ""But it's not the song that is the problem. It's the label of the song as a 'black national anthem' that creates a lot of confusion and tension."" The song and its message of struggle and hope have long been attached to the African-American community. It lives on as a religious hymn for several protestant and African-American denominations and was quoted by the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery at Barack Obama's presidential inauguration. After studying the music and lyrics of the song and its history for more than two decades, Askew decided the song was intentionally written with no specific reference to any race or ethnicity. Askew explains his position in the new book, ""Cultural Hegemony and African American Patriotism: An Analysis of the Song, 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,'"" which was released by Linus Publications in June. The book explores the literary and musical traditions of the song, but also says that a national anthem for African-Americans can be construed as racially separatist and divisive. ""To sing the 'black national anthem' suggests that black people are separatist and want to have their own nation,"" Askew said. ""This means that everything Martin Luther King Jr. believed about being one nation gets thrown out the window."" Askew first became intrigued with ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" while working on his master's degree at Yale University. He was a Morehouse College music graduate, young, passionate and hungry for knowledge about African-American culture. A fellow classmate suggested Askew explore Yale's collection on James Weldon Johnson, an early civil rights activist who wrote the song decades earlier. Johnson first wrote ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" as a poem in 1900. Hundreds of African-American students performed it at a celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birthday at Jacksonville, Florida's Stanton School, where Johnson was principal. Johnson's brother, John Rosamond Johnson, later set the poem to music. By 1920, the NAACP had proclaimed the song the ""Negro National Anthem."" ""I remember methodically going into the Yale library every day and sitting there on the floor, rummaging through 700 boxes of James Johnson's work,"" Askew said. ""I became so fascinated in his life and letters, that I wanted to know more about the creation of the song and how it related to our modern understanding of it."" He found letters of appreciation to Johnson from individuals of all different ethnic backgrounds. At that moment, Askew had a revelation: The song he'd known as the ""black national anthem"" was for everybody. Some will call his perspective on the song a contradiction, Askew said, especially because he works at a historically black college. But he argues that universities like Clark Atlanta accept students of many races and ethnicities; a national anthem for one race excludes others, and ignores an existing national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" by Francis Scott Key. ""Some people argue lines like 'We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,' signify a tie to slavery and the black power struggle,"" Askew said. ""But in all essence there is no specific reference to black people in this song. It lends itself to any people who have struggled."" He's not the only one who sees fault in a national anthem just for African-Americans. Kenneth Durden, an African-American conservative blogger, responded to Askew's claims on his blog, ""A Free Man, Thinking Freely."" He said in an interview that Askew is right to make connections to King's view of one America. ""King always appealed to the American dream for all,"" Durden said. ""He was a patriot and he never wanted blacks to deny or separate themselves from being American. I think claiming an anthem for ourselves as black people is doing just that."" What troubles Askew more is that the song became an identity marker for African-Americans. ""Who has the right to decide for all black people what racial symbol they should have?"" Askew said. ""Identity should be developed by the individual himself, not a group of people who think they know what is best for you."" Hilary O. Shelton, senior vice president for advocacy and policy for the NAACP, said Askew's ideas might be far-fetched. ""I don't see anything that is racially exclusive or discriminatory about the song,"" Shelton said. ""The negro national anthem was adopted and welcomed by a very interracial group, and it speaks of hope in being full first-class citizens in our society."" ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" isn't meant to cloud national identity or persuade African-Americans to be separatists, Shelton said. It's often sung in conjunction with ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" or with the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance at NAACP events. ""His presumption is that this song is sung instead of our national anthem -- that we are less American and we are not as committed to America because we take pride in the Negro national anthem,"" Shelton said. ""It is evident in our actions as an organization and here in America that we are about inclusion, not exclusion. To claim that we as African-Americans want to form a confederation or separate ourselves from white people because of one song is baffling to me."" This isn't the first time ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" has sparked debate. In 2008, jazz singer Rene Marie substituted the words of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" with the words of ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" at Mayor John Hickenlooper's State of the City address in Denver, Colorado. Marie said it was a matter of artistic expression, but critics viewed the lyrical switch as disrespect toward the national anthem, a lack of patriotism and an insinuation of racial division. ""I think that we often try to separate the black experience from the American experience,"" said Marc Lamont Hill, an associate professor of education at Columbia University who studies hip-hop culture. ""It's a black national anthem, but it's also a quintessential American song because of its message of fighting for freedom. It's not 'lift the black voices,' it's 'lift every voice.'"" Askew, though, maintains there's only one national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" and that ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" could take on a new role: a message of victory for all ethnic groups in the United States. ""We need to consider eliminating this alternative label of 'black national anthem' in order to promote unity,"" Askew said. ""I know people will probably think that I'm a sellout, but I think it is important that African-Americans nationally understand that we should be moving towards racial cohesiveness.""","""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" was written by James Weldon Johnson in 1900 .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- U.S. cities are racing to cope with ever-increasing demand on public transportation as gas prices remain at record levels. High gas prices in recent months have had a considerable impact on commuters using public transportation, statistics show. Even regions that have traditionally resisted giving up cars and have limited access to mass transit are reporting a surge in public transportation use. From trains and trolleys to subways and buses, the growth encompasses all modes of travel, according to the American Public Transportation Association, a Washington D.C.-based industry group. Cities are using a variety of measures to meet that demand, according to an informal APTA survey of some transit systems. For example, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which is currently operating at capacity during peak periods, ordered more subway cars, buses and coaches for its commuter rail. In North Carolina, the Charlotte Area Transit System has increased the frequency of light rail service on the weekends, ordered new buses and is taking a look at low-performing routes to cut down on costs. And the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which serves Philadelphia and has seen about 20,000 new daily customers since last July, has ordered 400 new hybrid buses and 120 new rail cars. Other measures being used or considered by transit systems include changing schedules to increase frequency of buses and trains, creating bus-only lanes and taking out seats on trains to make more room for commuters. 'The paradox of public transportation' While the rise in ridership has been a relatively easy adjustment for some systems, others are facing difficulties in meeting operating costs, which hampers their ability to ramp up service or maintain normal levels. Cal Marsella, the head of Denver, Colorado's transit system, calls it the ""paradox of public transportation."" Denver's system, like many U.S. cities, is partly funded by revenues from sales taxes. As consumers spend less because of high fuel costs and a sour economy, the city earns less revenue. Consequently, funding for the transit system is decreasing just when their operating costs are higher than ever before. ""Just when our demand is highest, our ability to provide is being undermined by the whole crunch,"" Marsella said. ""The last thing we want to do is curtail service but there is not a lot you can do when revenues are down and fuel prices are up."" The Denver Regional Transit District, however, saw the high prices coming and was able to lock in the price of diesel fuel earlier this year at $3.20 a gallon -- a price far cheaper than what the market is right now. That contract expires at the end of this year.  See a map of gas prices across the country » . Marsella is pessimistic prices will drop much by the end of the year. ""I'm budgeting next year for $4.55 a gallon,"" he said. ""Everybody is hurting, and I have real concerns about our ability to sustain services and maintain infrastructure."" A sharp rise in ridership . Americans used public transportation in record numbers the first three months of this year, according to the APTA. They took 2.6 billion trips on public transportation during that period, an increase of 85 million more trips compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile, the number behind the wheel dropped. Americans drove 1.4 billion fewer highway miles from April 2007 through April 2008, according to figures released by the Department of Transportation in June. The numbers represented the sixth consecutive monthly drop. In some places, the growing embrace of public transportation has been an ongoing trend for the past few years, reflecting a steady and gradual change in commuter behavior. iReport: Show us your commute . For instance, ridership increased during a period of high fuel prices from 2005 through 2006 in Tulsa, but did not decline after fuel prices went back down, said Cynthia Stabb of Tulsa Transit. ""Once people get a chance to try public transit and they find it works for them, they stick with it,"" she said via e-mail. Asked about the current high levels, she responded, ""We believe the demand is here to stay."" Turning point? Some observers such as Dr. Robert Lang, an expert on urban affairs and planning at Virginia Tech University, say the gas crunch could be a turning point in perceptions of public transportation and how cities plan development. Consumers are beginning to believe the high prices are a result of structural changes in the global economy, not the result of a single event like Hurricane Katrina, which produced a period of high fuel prices earlier this decade, Lang said. That change in perception is providing more momentum for some cities that were already moving away from six-lane highways and suburbs dozens of miles apart, to a series of urban centers connected by light rail and other mass transit systems. He cited cities like Denver and Phoenix, Arizona, where residents, motivated by traffic frustrations and the promise of economic development, approved massive transportation projects during the past few years despite the costs to their pocketbooks. Marsella said Denver's suburban and exurban commuters were as enthusiastic as its urban residents in approving the multibillion dollar project in 2004. ""People want to drive their cars a mile or two to a park-and-ride, and then take the rail in on the most congested part of the trip,"" he said. Other cities, like Atlanta, Georgia, for instance, are struggling to make the pivot. Often cited in discussions about urban sprawl, Atlanta has been bedeviled for years by a lack of consensus among city and regional leaders on the need to expand its transit system. ""Some of it is just the fear of change,"" Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin said. ""People acted as if transit was a dirty word and the only thing that would be successful in Atlanta would be to build more roads, but we can see from the congestion that you need an integrated transport system.""  Watch Mayor Franklin talk about Atlanta's transit system » . ""Unfortunately, there's no quick answer for the problems that we have."" Roads, and the cars on them, will not likely disappear anytime soon, Lang said. ""We're a settler nation. And people had to get moving to do that,"" he said. ""There's something deep within the American psyche about the freedom of movement."" But the current environment may lead to a future where hybrid cars coexist with denser transit systems. ""2007, for all we know, might be the peak use of gas in the United States,"" he said. CNN's Mike Senzon and Jarrett Bellini contributed to this report.","Statistics suggest Americans are driving less and using mass transit more .

"(CNN) -- King Nut Companies issued a total recall of peanut butter that it distributes Saturday amid fears of a salmonella outbreak that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said has infected 399 people in 42 states. Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. Ohio-based King Nut acknowledged in a statement that salmonella had been found in an open 5-pound tub of King Nut peanut butter. ""We are very sorry this happened,"" Martin Kanan, president of King Nut Companies, said in the statement. ""We are taking immediate and voluntary action because the health and safety of those who use our products is always our highest priority."" King Nut peanut butter was identified as the source of an outbreak that may have contributed to one death in Minnesota, state public health officials said Friday. King Nut said Saturday that peanut butter sold under its label was manufactured by Peanut Corporation of America. The release gave no other details on the manufacturer, but Peanut Corporation of America's Web site lists its headquarters as Lynchburg, Virginia, and says it has processing operations in Virginia, Georgia and Texas. Peanut Corporation of America could not be immediately reached for comment. The CDC is working with public health officials in the 42 affected states to determine the cause of the outbreak of a type of salmonella called Typhimurium.  Learn more about salmonella » . The first cases were reported September 3, but most cases occurred between October 1 and December 31, the CDC said. About 18 percent of victims were hospitalized as a result of their illness, and patients' ages have ranged from 2 months to 98 years. California is reporting the highest case count, with 55, followed by Ohio with 53 cases, Massachusetts with 39, Minnesota with 30 and Michigan with 20. The other 37 states are each reporting fewer than 20 cases. Eight states have reported no cases connected to the outbreak. They are Montana, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida, Alaska and Hawaii. In its statement, King Nut said it distributes peanut butter ""only through food service accounts. It is not sold directly to consumers."" The statement added, ""King Nut does not supply any of the ingredients for the peanut butter distributed under its label. All other King Nut products are safe and not included in this voluntary recall."" Strains of salmonella linked to previous outbreaks have been traced to contaminated eggs, meat, poultry, vegetables, pet food and peanut butter. Salmonella infections can be treated with antibiotics, though some strains are resistant to these drugs, according to the CDC. Most people infected develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection, and their illness can last up to a week. Most recover without treatment, but some may suffer dehydration and, in severe cases, require hospitalization. Children, senior citizens, people with chronic illnesses and those with weak immune systems tend to be at highest risk for complications, according to the National Institutes of Health.","King Nut says salmonella found in 5-pound tub of peanut butter .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Authorities do not plan to file charges against a Florida orange grove owner who fatally shot a 21-year-old woman, saying he is protected under the state's controversial ""no retreat"" law. Bullet holes pocked the windshield of the crashed SUV, and blood stained he passenger seat. But the woman's boyfriend faces second-degree murder charges in her death, because the woman was shot to death during an alleged felony -- the theft of an SUV. Tony Curtis Phillips, 29, didn't fire a single shot. He didn't even know his girlfriend, Nikki McCormick, was dead until police showed him an online news story. Police said McCormick accompanied Phillips as he attempted to steal the SUV from a barn in an orange grove near Wahneta, Florida, before daylight Tuesday. Grove owner Ladon ""Jamie"" Jones opened fire as the SUV approached him, according to an affidavit released by the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Phillips fled; McCormick was shot in the head and later died. Authorities said Jones is protected by Florida's ""no retreat"" law, which gives him the right to use lethal force if he reasonably believes his life is in danger. Phillips, however, faces charges because police allege he was committing felony grand theft auto at the time of McCormick's death. ""Because his conduct caused her death, he gets charged with a felony,"" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. Phillips was arrested late Tuesday in Polk County, near Lakeland, after a day on the run. Police said he didn't believe McCormick was dead at first, telling officers, ""Of all the times you've questioned me, this is a nasty trick you're playing on me this time."" He agreed to cooperate if detectives could prove she was dead. Judd said detectives called up the shooting story on the local newspaper's Web site and ""let him read it online, and that's when he broke down and cried, and gave us a confession,"" Judd said. According to the affidavit, Jones heard his Toyota Land Cruiser, parked in the barn at his orange grove, start up before daylight Tuesday. Jones told police he grabbed his gun, a 9mm that he keeps with him while working at the grove. He said he could see two people in the SUV as it backed out of the barn, according to the affidavit. He said he saw the passenger's arm reach outside the vehicle, and believed that person might be holding a gun. The Land Cruiser stopped directly in front of him, Jones said in the affidavit. He said he raised his gun and pointed it at the occupants, shouting ""Stop,"" but the vehicle appeared to be moving directly toward him. ""Fearing for his life, he then fired what he thought to be six to eight rounds into the front windshield of the vehicle,"" the affidavit stated. The vehicle backed up at high speed, crashed through a fence and ended up in a ditch. Jones told police a man jumped out of the SUV and ran away. Sheriff's deputies found McCormick inside the vehicle with a bullet wound to her head. She was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center, where she died. Jones did not return a call from CNN seeking comment. Authorities will forward their information to prosecutors, Judd said, but are ""not going to file any charges [against Jones] at this point, because we don't see any reason to arrest Mr. Jones,"" Judd said. ""... It appears, at this point in the investigation, Mr. Jones was completely, legally justified in his actions."" A Polk County judge on Thursday ordered Phillips held without bond. A public defender was appointed to his case. Polk County Public Defender J. Marion Moorman declined to comment on the charges to CNN. ""We will, of course, be interviewing the client very soon, and will be undertaking his defense from there,"" he said. Phillips told police he assumed McCormick had also gotten out of the vehicle and run away, according to the affidavit. He said he was sorry for what happened ""and said he knew he was partially responsible for her death,"" the affidavit said. Polk County State Attorney's Office spokesman Chip Thulberry said his office will review the case when the sheriff's investigation is completed. The Brady Campaign to prevent Gun Violence says Florida is one of 16 states that have enacted ""no retreat"" laws, which some call ""shoot-first"" laws. The laws extend the right to use deadly force beyond a person's home and into public places. ""The shoot-first law is not needed,"" said Brian Malte of the Brady Campaign. ""This person, regardless of the situation, may have done the right thing, but he cannot be prosecuted for doing something wrong if he hit an innocent bystander,"" he said. Other groups stand by the ""no retreat"" laws. ""At the moment a crime occurs, victims don't have the luxury of time,"" said Andrew Arulanandam of the National Rifle Association. ""They have seconds to decide on a course of action to protect their lives and their families. This law provides law-abiding people with options.""","Tony Curtis Phillips, 29, charged in girlfriend's shooting death .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand has revoked the visa of a Russian pianist accused of raping a 14-year-old boy, an immigration official said Thursday. Thailand's immigration bureau revoked the visa of Mikhail Pletnev because it believes he poses threats to the country, according to Maj. Gen. Pansak Kasemsan. The development means that even if the charges against Pletnev are eventually dropped, he will be deported from the country. Although the revocation of the visa is already in place, an exception allows him to enter the country while his case is pending. Pletnev was arrested and charged July 6 with raping the teenage boy in the Thai beach town of Pattaya, where he owns a house. The crime carries a maximum prison term of 20 years. The judge released him on a $9,000 bail until the criminal charges against him are resolved, with the provision that he return to the seaside town of Pattaya every 12 days to renew the conditions of the bail. That means Pletnev can travel abroad as long as he continues to make his court dates. Pletnev was in Thailand on Monday and is due back in the country on July 30. His attorney said he left the country Wednesday to see his mother for her 89th birthday. Thailand remains a destination for child migrants, many of whom enter the sex tourism industry, according to the Child Protection and Development Center. ""Pattaya in particular has developed an international reputation for child sex tourism,"" the nongovernmental organization says on its website about the town two hours south of Bangkok. ""Anti-trafficking researchers targeting street children estimate that Pattaya hosts about 1,500 to 2,000 homeless and impoverished children per year, while numbers are increasing.

"(CNN) -- For a man whose previous nickname was ""the Bulldozer,"" balance might not be thought of as one of South Korean president Lee Myung-bak's strong points. Promises of pragmatism and a more balanced society from the new president. However, speaking to CNN for Talk Asia just a few weeks after his inauguration as president, restoring some equilibrium to South Korean society is one of the key aims of his presidency. ""My country has undergone rapid industrialization and development, as well as democratization,"" he told Anjali Rao. ""And throughout this process, I believe some sort of balance has been lost. The gap between the haves and the have-nots has widened lately, which I believe must be rectified."" It's not an unfamiliar sentiment for a politician to express, but Lee's journey from childhood poverty to the pinnacle of political life perhaps makes him more qualified than many politicians to relate to his electorate. For many of his supporters his life reflects the recent history of South Korea itself. Lee Myung-bak was born in Osaka, Japan in 1941 during the Japanese occupation of the Korean peninsular and returned to Korea with his parents at the end of the Second World War. Without any money to pay for his education, he paid his own way through university in Seoul, at one point taking a job as a garbage collector, working during the day, while studying at night. As a student he led protests against the authoritarian government, receiving a caution from police in 1962. After graduating he took a job with Hyundai. His hard work and ambition saw that he became its CEO after just 12 years, at the age of 36. It was as a dynamic young CEO, part of the new generation that was rapidly building South Korea's industry and economy in the 1970's and 80's, he gained the nickname ""the Bulldozer"" for his single-minded approach and tenacity to drive through difficult projects. His transition from CEO to politician came when he became mayor of Seoul in 2002 and undertook one of the city' most ambitious and popular programs of urban renewal. He was elected on the promise of transforming the city, ripping out a traffic-clogged elevated highway that ran through its center and restoring the Cheonggyecheon stream that had been covered over. It's completion in 2005 led to a blooming example of the growing emphasis on quality of life in a country that had sacrificed economic and industrial growth for all else. It also propelled him into the international spotlight, with TIME Magazine naming him one of its Heroes of the Environment in 2007. He has not been without his detractors, however, and even after the election there were questions surrounding his ethics. While South Korea has been trying to shed its image of corporate corruption, just four days before his inauguration as president he was cleared of accusations of stock manipulation. ""During this rapid period, yes indeed, there were a lot of side effects. And one of them was corruption and that transparency was not prevalent in our society,"" he told CNN. ""Now that I am president, such a culture in the political culture, as well as the corporate culture, must change.""","South Korea's new president Lee Myung-bak plans for a pragmatic presidency .

"(Mashable) -- In an interview that will air tonight on ABC's ""World News with Diane Sawyer,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked frankly about an upcoming IPO, the Facebook movie, a shady lawsuit and much more. As far as the movie ""The Social Network"" is concerned, Zuckerberg seemed to echo Facebook co-founder Dustin Moscovitz's opinion that the film seems a lot more exciting than the real-life version of Facebook's history. ""I just think people have a lot of fiction.... The real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time,"" Zuckerberg said in his interview with Sawyer. ""I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? ...We just sat at our computers for six years and coded."" Somewhere in that six years of coding, however, it is alleged that Zuckerberg signed a contract that would give ownership of his website to a web designer and former associate at Harvard, one Paul Ceglia. Although a Facebook lawyer said yesterday the company is ""unsure"" whether such a contract was ever signed, Zuckerberg told Sawyer unequivocally, ""We did not sign a contract that says that [Ceglia has] any right to ownership over Facebook."" As far as an initial public offering of stock is concerned, Facebook's IPO is one of the most hotly anticipated by many in the tech world. The company is currently valued at upwards of $20 billion and is expected to generate around $1 billion in revenue in 2010. Zuckerberg told Sawyer that, while he and the rest of the Facebook team are still rather single-mindedly focused on product, ""At some point along the path, I think it'll make sense to have an IPO. But we're not running the company to do that. We're running the company to serve more people."" Of course, Sawyer's interview also touches on the privacy debacle (""We have made mistakes, for sure,"" said Zuckerberg) and the site's crossing the 500-million-user mark (Zuckerberg said the journey had been ""surreal"") as well as several other topics.

"(Wired) -- Facebook is primed to announce this week that it's amassed a half billion active friends, a milestone reinforcing its status as the king of social networks -- a company to be regarded with the seriousness and power (if not revenue) of Google, Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft. Five hundred million and rising also makes it clear to anyone not paying attention that Facebook is no fad, that it is a cultural force shaping our collective culture. Even if you have no desire to ever set up a profile, you can't ignore it and you are now oddly defined in the negative and left out of the zeitgeist. A service of that size won't disappear anytime soon, even if Facebook has hit its plateau in the U.S. But net users are fickle and the web's short history includes dozens of sites that were once high-flying that have either since died (Geocities), lost their luster (Yahoo) or faded into irrelevance (Friendster). So how could Facebook lose its place at the center of the web? 1. Open, distributed alternatives . A pack of college kids drunk on Free Software launched an open-source, federated alternative to Facebook called Diaspora. After collecting an astonishing $120K in donations, the group is knocking out code. Meanwhile, there's other cool stuff going on, including OneSocialWeb, the Appleseed Project and WebFinger. Get enough of these open protcols into decent shape and someone is likely to build them into an improbably powerful stack. Research the LAMP stack, if you don't get my drift. What might that look like? An elimination of the need for a centralized home and coordinator of social networking -- where your social profile lives wherever you want it to (as your e-mail does) and can interact with any other profile around the net, on your own terms. While it sounds far-fetched, a recent poll suggests that people are as happy with Facebook as they are with their cable company, even if they do find it similarly indispensable. 2. Google Me . There's rumors the search giant is hatching its own social network system, despite the fact that it's just not particularly good at social networking. Its Orkut social network has flailed and even seems to be losing its final two treasures, India and Brazil, to Facebook. Google's take on Twitter, called Buzz, isn't bad, but it's not been much of a hit -- despite some fine features such as threaded coversations. And then it's got Wave and Google Talk, and Google Chat and Google Profile and Google pages and Google Docs. I wonder if anyone has tried stacking any of those together over there in the Googleplex to create a place where people actually want to hang out -- the clear difference between a site like Facebook and a site like Google search. Interesting things happen when people hang out. 3. Location-based services and the mobile device . With the stunning popularity of pocket computers -- starting with the iPhone, location-centric services such as Foursquare are gaining users at the rate that Facebook used to. Perhaps most importantly, they are figuring out ways to use the addictive mechanics of gaming to create services even more engrossing than Facebook. To compete, Facebook has its own, very well-liked mobile app, and is set to expand how it interacts with the real world. But there's a real threat here that Facebook could get outflanked by clever kids not too much unlike themselves, who figure out how to create a more potent digital heroin. 4. The U.S. Postal Service . For those who love dark horses or the old and familiar, there's always a chance that the world suddenly tires of their Facebook wall or virtual farming and decide to get off the net's grid entirely. Socializing will still be necessary, of course, so we'll see the return of sockhops, neighborhood restaurants and church socials. As for written messages, the Postal Service is actually quite good at delivering hand-written correspondence anywhere in the States for a nominal fee. The photo postcard will be huge again. But since the Postal Service is proposing to cease Saturday delivery, its social networking service would be a weekday-only affair. Vive la Poste! 5. Overreaching on the part of Mark Zuckerberg . Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has changed the culture of the world with his single-minded devotedness to making people share more information with more people. In a world where software can determine culture, Zuckerberg's unwavering drive to make more and more of the details of our lives public by default has triumphed in nearly every instance over prevailing cultural norms -- with the glaring exception of the Beacon project. But as with all visionaries, there is always the danger that in his attempt to lead his flock to the land of milk and honey, there will come a moment where he steps too far ahead, and the flock abandons the frontier for the pasture, leaving him alone and howling in the wilderness.

"(CNN) -- The father of a missing Oregon boy is asking that his estranged wife be held in contempt of court for violating a restraining order against her, court documents filed Monday show. According to the documents filed in Multonamah County Circuit Court, Kaine Horman, the father of missing 7-year-old Kyron Horman, is alleging that Terri Horman leaked information from the sealed restraining order against her to Michael Cook, a high school classmate of her husband's. The documents also allege that Terri Horman, Kyron's stepmother, began a sexual affair with Cook after her stepson's disappearance and that she attempted to ""abduct"" her daughter from Kaine Horman. Kyron has been missing since June 4. Terri Horman is the last person known to have seen him before he disappeared. Authorities have asked anyone who was at Kyron's Portland elementary school that day if they saw Terri Horman after she told police she last saw him walking down the hall to his classroom. Kaine Horman abruptly moved out of the family home in late June, taking the couple's 20-month-old daughter, Kiara, with him. He then filed for divorce from Terri Horman and was granted a restraining order June 28. Portions of the restraining order were unsealed last week, however access to the address of Kaine Horman and Kiara remained restricted. In the restraining order, Kaine Horman alleges his wife knows what happened to Kyron. ""I believe respondent is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron who has been missing since June 4,"" Horman wrote in his request for the order. ""I also recently learned that respondent attempted to hire someone to murder me. The police have provided me with probable cause to believe the above two statements to be true."" Monday's court documents allege that Terri Horman violated the restraining order's remaining restrictions by allowing Cook to photograph pages of the document, including Kaine Horman's address. ""The search of Mr. Cook's cell phone also revealed that a Google Maps search of the address was later performed by Mr. Cook,"" the documents say. ""Mr. Cook told law enforcement when interviewed that he got the address from the paperwork, that he did an internet maps search for the address, but never went to (Kaine Horman's) listed residence."" The documents say Kaine Horman had requested restricted access to the address information because of ""concerns about the investigation into the disappearance of his son, Kyron, and concerns about (Kaine Horman's) personal safety and the safety of his children."" Monday's documents also say law enforcement authorities told Kaine Horman's attorney that his wife's ""relationship concerns and sexual overtures to Mr. Cook resemble those made to the man (that Terri Horman) previously attempted to hire to murder"" her husband. The alleged sexual relationship between Cook and Terri Horman began on or about June 30 after Kaine Horman had moved out of the family home, according to the documents. Law enforcement said the pair began exchanging text messages that included ""several photographs of (Terri Horman) in various stages of undress and graphic sexual activity,"" according to the documents. The documents further allege that Terri Horman went by the gym where Kaine Horman works out ""looking to 'abduct' her daughter, Kiara, from the gym daycare center,"" citing a gym employee. CNN has reached out to Terri Horman's attorney and Cook for comment and is awaiting a response. Cook told CNN affiliate KATU Monday that he had not seen the documents but said based on what he has heard about the contents that a lot of it is not true. He also told KATU he would not comment on the case until he consults an attorney. Authorities have not named any suspect or person of interest in connection with Kyron's disappearance.","Documents allege Terri Horman violated terms of restraining order against her .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush has approved the Army's request to execute a soldier convicted of rape and murder, the White House announced Monday evening. Pvt. Ronald Gray, seen here in 1988, has been on the military's death row for 20 years. Pvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, since 1988. His execution would be the first for the U.S. military since 1961, but the White House said it expects further appeals before the sentence is carried out. ""While approving a sentence of death for a member of our armed services is a serious and difficult decision for a commander-in-chief, the president believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted,"" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. Gray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was also convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at Fort Bragg. ""The president's thoughts and prayers are with the victims of these heinous crimes and their families and all others affected,"" Perino said. Both military and civilian courts found Gray responsible for the crimes committed between April 1986 and January 1987. Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms. A general court-martial at the Army's Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders, an attempted murder and three rapes. He was unanimously sentenced to death. Members of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history, but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the military's modern-day legal system. Military courts have not yet set an execution date for Gray, who can still appeal through civilian federal courts. The Army also has sought Bush's authorization to execute another condemned soldier, Pvt. Dwight Loving, who was convicted of killing and robbing two cab drivers in 1988. The last U.S. military execution was in 1961, when Army private John Bennett was hanged for raping and attempting to kill an 11-year-old Austrian girl. Bennett was sentenced in 1955. The U.S. military hasn't actively pursued an execution for a military prisoner since President John F. Kennedy commuted a death sentence in 1962. Six men are currently on military death row. Bush allowed 152 executions as governor of Texas and has signed off on three executions of federal inmates since he became president -- including that of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, who was put to death in 2001. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Bush OK's Army's request to execute a soldier convicted of rape, murder .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A teenager accused of killing and mutilating 19 pet cats in Miami, Florida, has been released on bond and is under house arrest, authorities said Wednesday. Tyler Weinman, 18, is under house arrest, accused of killing 19 pet cats in Miami, Florida. Tyler Weinman, 18, was fitted with an ankle bracelet for electronic monitoring and escorted home by Miami-Dade Police. He also has been charged with improper disposal of dead animals and burglary in the monthlong cat killing spree. Judge John Thornton ordered Weinman released after a court-appointed psychologist found the teen was mentally competent and not a danger to himself or others. Weinman, who had been on suicide watch, flashed a quick smile to photographers and reporters as he entered the courtroom. He made no statements at the hearing. ""He's an innocent man. There's no evidence,"" said defense attorney Michael Walsh. ""When the case starts to unfold, you'll see,"" he added. ""The first thing that happened is an evaluation. He's not a danger. He's not a threat to himself or anyone else,"" Walsh said. Weinman was ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling twice a week. The teen was arrested at a party in Miami on Saturday night. Police allege he's responsible for the vicious series of cat killings that has put the manicured neighborhoods south of Miami on edge. Some of the carcasses were posed, police said. Thornton ordered the court file sealed. Investigators said Weinman might have been part of a ring committing the crimes. ""This is an ongoing investigation. We're looking to see if any other individuals are involved,"" said Terry Chavez, a spokesperson for the Miami-Dade State Attorney's office. But Weinman's defense attorney doesn't buy it. ""Police say a lot of things,"" Walsh responded. ""There obviously has been a public outcry to solve this crime, and that motivates police in certain directions. And now, this young man has to sit there and bear the allegations,"" he said. Weinman was charged with 19 counts of animal cruelty with intent to harm and kill. He faces up to 158 years in prison if convicted of all counts. He was arrested after phone tips came in to police and he was placed under surveillance. As he left court, the suspect's father, Douglas Weinman was asked if his son was guilty. ""Absolutely not,"" he said. He also expressed his condolences to pet owners who lost their cats. ""We are cat owners ourselves. We love our pets,"" he said. ""We certainly understand the grief that other cat owners are going through, and we sympathize with them, but it is not our son,"" he added. ""We've seen him play with our pets for years and he's a great kid and he plays with pets and he's fine with them,"" he said. Extra police and a special investigator from the State Attorney's Office had been working the investigation, which had worried many residents who feared the cat killer might graduate to people. One pet owner, Donna Gleason, said her family cat, Tommy, was ""partially skinned"" and left dead in her yard. ""Part of his skin was missing underneath ... and part of his legs,"" she said. But Weinman's defense attorney said the police have not gotten their man. ""He's not a violent kid. He's just a good kid who's a victim of circumstance. He did not do this crime,"" Walsh said. Weinman is due back in court July 6 for arraignment.","Tyler Hayes Weinman, 18, suspected in Miami serial cat killings, is released on bail .

"(CNN) -- A woman gored by a bison at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming said she is happy to be alive days after the attack. ""I thought it was the end,"" Cathy Hayes told CNN by phone late Wednesday. Hayes said she was vacationing in Yellowstone on Monday with her husband and a friend. The group was driving through the park when they spotted a bison. ""My friend is from California, and had never seen a bison before,"" she said. ""So we pulled over and went to get a closer look."" Minutes later, the bison attacked. And it was all caught on tape. ""So we're here in the park and there's a buffalo, and he's just wandering across the road,"" she says in the footage. Hayes, a native of Farr West, Utah, says they were about 30 feet away from the bison when her friend decided to get closer. ""There was another group in front of us, and I never noticed it before looking at the video on my small camera, but you can see a stick fly off the back of the bison,"" she said. ""It looks like it came from the group that was in front of him. Before that, the bison was just chillin.'"" In the video shot from Hayes' perspective, her friend falls as he runs away from the charging bison. At that point, she says, the bison turned its attention to her. Hayes crouched behind a tree to protect herself, but it wasn't enough. ""There was a pause when I could tell that he was backing up and getting ready to ram the tree again,"" Hayes said. ""I thought, 'He won't ram the car,' so I made a run for it. You can probably see in the video when he got me and flung me up in the air."" Hayes' husband was in their car when the attack happened, and was able to scare the bison off by making loud noises. ""He was going to throw his cell phone at it, but it took off. It was gone as quick as it came,"" she said. Luckily, Hayes did not suffer life-threatening injures, but said she is still in a lot of pain. Her knee was swollen to the size of a football, and she had minor cuts and scrapes throughout her leg. Her friend broke his shoulder when he tripped and fell. But for the Utah teacher, it could have been worse. ""I was waiting for black. I thought I was going to die,"" Hayes said. Signs throughout Yellowstone warn visitors to not get close to wildlife.","Attack happened at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor checked out of a Los Angeles hospital ""sore, but intact,"" the actress said in an online message posted Friday evening. Elizabeth Taylor posted on her Twitter account that she was grieving for her close friend Michael Jackson. Taylor, 77, used her Twitter handle, @DameElizabeth, to tell fans that she was home, just as she did last week to announce she would go into a hospital to ""to complete a test I was in the middle of."" Her publicist this week denied tabloid rumors that her hospitalization was brought on by her grief over the sudden death of her close friend Michael Jackson in June. Taylor, in her latest tweets, addressed her sadness over Jackson's death: . ""I'm home from the hospital sore, but intact. Of course I'm still grieving for Michael ... I always will."" ""But as I said before I went into the hospital, 'I am a survivor,'"" Taylor tweeted. ""I've had many tragedies in my life, but I guess they have all taught me something. I have to look at it that way."" ""I have to be stronger and more appreciative of what I do have."" ""I give love and I'm surrounded by love ... and I thank God for that."" Twitter is a social networking site that allows users to update what they are doing using 140 characters or less. Taylor regularly posts short messages to her 116,000 Twitter followers through the account she opened earlier this year at the suggestion of her close friend, author and actress Kathy Ireland, publicist Dick Guttman said. She posted emotional messages earlier this month to counter rumors about how she was dealing with the news of Jackson's death. ""Although my grief over Michael could not be any deeper, I am not on suicide watch as some of the cheaper 'rags' would have you believe,"" Taylor tweeted July 5. A New York Post column published Tuesday quoted an unidentified source saying she was hospitalized because the ""heart's gone out of her"" after Jackson's death. Taylor, who uses a wheelchair because of scoliosis, or abnormal curving of the spine, gave fans several days advance notice of her hospitalization. ""I wanted you my friends to know that I'm going into the hospital Wednesday or Thursday to complete a test I was in the middle of,"" she wrote. Taylor said she declined an invitation to speak about Jackson at his public memorial because she ""cannot be part of the public hoopla."" ""I just don't believe that Michael would want me to share my grief with millions of others,"" Taylor tweeted. ""How I feel is between us. Not a public event.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chanthu, the third typhoon of the West Pacific season, slowed down Thursday as it made its way over land in southern China. As the tropical storm drenched a region already inundated by heavy rain and deadly flooding, its top winds slowed to 63 mph (101 kph). It had made landfall with winds above 70 mph at 1:45 p.m. in Wuchuan City in southern China's Guangdong Province, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The government ordered evacuations in severely affected areas, especially in ports, fishing farms on the sea, dilapidated housing and low-lying ground. It urged local governments to step up flood control efforts. No casualties have been reported so far. Torrential rains and flooding this year already have been the worst in a decade, claiming the lives of 701 people and leaving 347 missing, Xinhua said, citing government figures. Chanthu could drench some rain-swollen areas with another 20 inches of rain, said CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. As the storm moves by, an area of particular concern is the region along the Yangtze River, which already has experienced the worst flooding in 30 years. Floodgates on the Three Gorges Dam have been opened to control the flow, and pictures from the scene show huge volumes of water pouring from it. Throughout the country, floods have hit 27 provinces and municipalities, affecting 110 million people, according to Xinhua. It said more than 8 million people have been relocated. About 287,000 military personnel have been mobilized in anti-flood operations, and schools are being advised to do what they can to ensure students' safety.","NEW: Typhoon is downgraded as it crosses over land .

"(CNN) -- Get a kick out of this: Researchers reported Wednesday finding the world's oldest leather shoe in a cave in Armenia. The 5,500-year-old one-piece shoe antedates Stonehenge by a millennium and precedes every loafer, mukluk, wader, clog, bootee, stiletto, wingtip, mule, Oxford and cross trainer anyone has ever seen, according to Ron Pinhasi, a lecturer in prehistoric archaeology at University College Cork in Ireland. The effort that resulted in the find dates to 2005, when Pinhasi and his team of archaeologists first entered the cave about an hour south of the capital city of Yerevan, in Vayotz Dzor province on the border with Iran and Turkey, and decided it looked promising. Two years later, Pinhasi returned, dug down about half a meter and ""started discovering everything,"" including rare, well-preserved organic material such as textiles, ropes and wooden stakes, leading them to redouble their efforts. The next year, they excavated in a house that had been constructed inside the cave and found a pit covered with sheep or goat dung. Below the dung, they found broken pottery and goat horns covering the shoe, said the authors, who published their findings in the online scientific journal PLoS ONE. The right-footed, undecorated shoe -- today it would be a size 5 -- probably belonged to a woman, ""but we cannot be certain; it could be a man with small feet,"" Pinhasi said. A leather thong is stitched through four sets of eyelets in the back and 15 sets in the top. The shoe was lightly worn. Some of the eyelets have been recut, but the sole shows little wear. ""We thought originally it could be a discard, but at the same time, it's very strange, because we have only one shoe, and it's in very good shape,"" Pinhasi said. ""It looks like it was more than likely deliberately placed in this way."" If so, it would join a number of other items that appear to have been placed as offerings. At the back of the cave, the archaeologists found pots full of grain and three pots, each containing the skull of a child -- their jaws removed. ""It's pretty weird,"" he said. Two leather samples were taken: One was sent for carbon dating to the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at the University of Oxford and the other to the University of California-Irvine Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility; a piece of the straw was sent to Oxford. Age estimates were the same for all three. Pinhasi said he had no idea how common it would have been at that time for people to wear shoes. His is the second-oldest shoe find; a pair of 7,500-year-old sandals made of fiber was found in Missouri, he said. But that doesn't mean shoes were not commonly used. The fact that so little footwear from those days has been found could be explained by the fact that shoes don't tend to age well. Had it not been for the conditions inside the cave, the shoe would probably have disintegrated long ago. Though temperatures in the region range from sweltering in the summer to icy in winter, the interior of the limestone cave remains a dry, consistent 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees F), key to the shoe's survival, he said. ""What was exciting was that it is so complete and it looks so much like a modern shoe, with the eyelets and everything. Obviously, these people already knew how to make it."" And there was a level of sophistication in the product that he did not expect. The cow leather appeared to have been split and cured with a vegetable oil, said Pinhasi, who favors size 10½ Birkenstocks. ""They actually look a little bit like the shoe,"" he said. ""Not quite -- a bit more sophisticated."" The fact that the cave remained untouched for so many millennia is surprising. It can be seen from a heavily traveled road and is only about 300 yards from a fish restaurant, he said. But government authorities are now posting a guard to keep away looters. ""It's turning [out] to be sort of the most important site in Armenia,"" he said. Though he wants to display the shoe in a museum in Armenia, he first wants to take it to Switzerland or Germany for preservation. In the two years since the footwear was unearthed, the elements have taken a toll. ""When it came out [of the ground], the leather was absolutely soft,"" the Israeli archaeologist said. ""Now, it's hard as a rock."" But legislation does not exist in Armenia that would allow him to remove a national treasure from the country, so he is waiting. Meanwhile, the shoe sits in the Institute of Archeology at the National Academy of Sciences in Yereva. On Friday, Pinhasi plans to return to the region, this time to dig in a cave near the one that held the shoe. ""We want to see if it's unique,"" he said. Even if nearby caves turn out to hold no such treasure, the 41-year-old researcher has plenty of work ahead of him. ""We must have excavated about 2 percent of it,"" he said. ""It could take decades"" to finish the rest.","5,500-year-old leather shoe found in Armenian cave .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- An attorney for alleged ""Barefoot Bandit"" Colton Harris-Moore on Thursday agreed with a request by federal prosecutors that the captured teen fugitive remain in prison -- for the time being -- and said his client does not want to be considered a role model. Harris-Moore gained notoriety for allegedly stealing planes without a pilot's license and sometimes without shoes. His run from authorities ended on July 11 when he was captured in the Bahamas. Authorities there said he had flown 1,000 miles in a stolen plane from Indiana. On Wednesday, Harris-Moore was returned on a U.S. marshals flight for federal prisoners to Washington state where he faces a dozen state charges including burglaries, identity theft and fleeing from police in a stolen automobile. He also has been charged with the federal crime of piloting a stolen plane from Idaho to Washington state. If he is found guilty of the charge he could face 10 years in prison, according to the criminal complaint. At his initial appearance Thursday in U.S. District Court, dressed in a gray prison jumpsuit, the 6-foot-5-inch Harris-Moore was the tallest person standing as the courtroom rose for Magistrate Judge Brian Tsuchida. Harris-Moore's attorney, John Henry Browne, waived his client's right to a preliminary hearing and did not contest the prosecutor's request that the 19-year-old stay behind bars. If a grand jury hands up an indictment in the case, Harris-Moore would next appear in court for his arraignment in which he would enter a plea. His attorney said he may ask the judge for bail. Browne said he didn't ask for his client to be freed since multiple jurisdictions also suspect him of crimes, which would ""start a traveling road show."" Following the hearing, Browne told reporters that his client was no role model, despite Facebook sites dedicated to him with thousands of fans. ""He was scared,"" Browne said Harris-Moore told him of what authorities say was two years ducking investigators and police. ""It was not fun."" ""He's very bright,"" Brown said, describing his client. ""But probably not very mature."" U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan said in a press conference following the hearing that investigators continue to look into Harris-Moore's alleged activities and he could face additional federal charges. She also said that anyone who helped him flee from authorities could face charges and that the following Harris-Moore generated was misplaced. ""There is nothing in the acts that should be admired or glorified,"" Durkan said. However the case has spurred talk of book and movie deals and discussion of who would play Harris-Moore on screen. Harris-Moore's mother, Pamela Kohler, hired an entertainment attorney to field requests for her story. But she was absent in court Thursday despite the fact she reportedly has not seen her son in over two years. ""She really wanted to be here,"" said her attorney, O. Yale Lewis. ""But there was a mix-up with her ride.""","A lawyer for the alleged ""Barefoot Bandit"" says his client does not want to be a role model .

"(CNN) -- The trial of a man who confessed to killing a Kansas doctor who performed late-term abortions began Friday, with the prosecution telling jurors they will hear from witnesses to the shooting. Jurors also learned they will hear the 911 calls made moments later. Roeder's murder trial began in Wichita, Kansas, on the 37th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston told jurors that among the trial evidence are blood-shattered shoes, shell casings and a calendar belonging to the defendant that had the day of the shooting circled. ""All those things combined will be the state's case to show this jury without reasonable doubt that this defendant, Scott Roeder, should be convicted of all charges,"" Foulston said. Throughout the opening argument, Roeder listened without emotion. Roeder, 51, has said he justifiably killed Tiller while trying to save unborn children. The doctor was shot in the foyer of his church in Wichita on May 31. ""Dr. George Tiller was pronounced dead at the scene of the Reformation Lutheran Church,"" Foulston said. ""Dr. Tiller died from a single contact gunshot wound to the head."" She said the gun was never recovered, . Roeder's defense did not present an opening statement Friday morning. Foulston walked the jury through the crime, saying that Tiller was to be an usher for a Pentecost Sunday service. ""Unexpectedly, a sound was heard, described by many as like a popping of a balloon,"" the prosecutor said. Drawing on what she said was a witness's account, she said, ""A man [was] standing next to George Tiller, with his arms still raised. .... Dr. Tiller fell to the floor."" After the opening argument, the jury heard the 911 call made shortly after the shooting. ""Dr. Tiller, Dr. George Tiller, was just shot!"" a woman told a 911 operator. With Roeder's beliefs expected to be the focal point of his defense, the trial could become the next forum in the fierce national debate over abortion rights. In several media interviews after his arrest, Roeder expressed no remorse over shooting Tiller, saying it prevented the doctor from carrying out abortions at the Women's Health Care Services clinic in Wichita. Prosecutors have called the defense argument flawed. ""Case law is clear, both in Kansas and nationwide, that the circumstances of this murder do not justify an imperfect self-defense instruction,"" they wrote in court papers. ""The state urges this court to exclude any irrelevant evidence of abortion, the defendant's views on abortion and the character of Dr. Tiller,"" they said. Tiller was among the most enduring targets of the anti-abortion movement, withstanding several legal challenges and many death threats, including one in 1993 in which he was shot in both arms. His killing sent shock waves through both factions in the abortion debate, with most from the anti-abortion movement condemning Roeder's actions. Roeder faces life in prison if he is convicted of first-degree murder. He also is charged with two counts of aggravated assault for allegedly pointing his gun at two other ushers as he fled the church.

"(CNN) -- A Kosovar man was arrested overseas and faces charges of participation in a terror plot involving several suspects from North Carolina, federal authorities said Thursday. Bajram Asllani, 29, a resident of Mitrovica, Kosovo, is charged with providing material support to terrorists and conspiring to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people abroad, the Department of Justice said in a statement. He was arrested early Thursday in Kosovo on a provisional U.S. arrest warrant from the Eastern District of North Carolina. The United States will seek his extradition, authorities said. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 40 years in prison. ""People who are plotting to harm America and Americans are no longer a world away from us.  This case began in Raleigh, N.C., and now stretches across the globe, a circumstance no one would have thought possible less than ten years ago,"" said Owen D. Harris, special agent in charge of the FBI in North Carolina, in the statement. Eight people were indicted last year in North Carolina on terror-related charges. According to a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday, Asllani was a member of the same conspiracy. The April 19 criminal complaint, unsealed Thursday, alleges Asllani ""solicited money from the conspirators to establish a base of operations in Kosovo for the purpose of waging violent jihad"" and ""accepted funds from the conspirators to help him travel."" Kosovo, which declared independence more than two years ago, was once a restive province of Serbia with a majority ethnic Albanian population. Islam is Kosovo's dominant religion in the Balkan nation. The complaint alleges that Hysen Sherifi, one of the eight indicted last year, left Raleigh for Pristina, Kosovo, in 2008 ""to pursue violent jihad"" and formed a relationship with Asllani while in Kosovo. Asllani allegedly provided Sherifi with videos to recruit militants and directed Sherifi to collect money to buy land, where weapons can be stored and a base of operation could be established. The department said Sherifi returned to the United States, collected money and received a $15,000 check but was arrested before he could take the money back to Kosovo. The complaint also alleges Asllani received money from Sherifi for the purpose of obtaining travel documents. ""Sherifi often referred to Asllani as 'the brother' in Kosovo who was advising him and who was 'wanted.'  According to the complaint, Asllani had been arrested by Kosovar law enforcement in 2007 and been placed on house arrest for a period of time. He was later convicted in absentia by a Serbian court in September 2009 for planning terrorist-related offenses and was sentenced to eight years of confinement,"" the department said. Sherifi, a native of Kosovo, is a U.S. legal permanent resident in North Carolina. Five of those indicted are classified as U.S. citizens who are residents of North Carolina: Daniel Patrick Boyd, Zakariya Boyd, Dylan Boyd, Ziyad Yaghi, and Mohammed Omar Aly Hassan. Others indicted are Anes Subasic, a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of North Carolina, and Jude Kenan Mohammad, a U.S. citizen. The complaint says Daniel Boyd wanted to help Sherifi raise money. ""Boyd stated he wanted to send his sons, Zakariya Boyd and Dylan Boyd, and himself to Kosovo after Sherifi returned.  Zakariya and Dylan Boyd spent time online with Sherifi chatting with Asllani in Kosovo,"" the department said. Another indictment last year added new charges against Daniel Patrick Boyd, Hysen Sherifi and Zakariya Boyd. It alleged that Daniel Boyd and Sherifi conspired to murder U.S. military personnel in a plot to attack troops at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia. The three were also charged with weapons possession.","Man seized in Kosovo, charged with providing material support to terrorists .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has agreed to hold talks Friday with the U.S.-led U.N. Command on the peninsula over the sinking of a South Korean warship. It will be the second meeting between the two parties since the March attack on the Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. An international investigation blamed North Korea for the sinking, an assertion the North has denied. Officers from both sides will meet in Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. The talks are designed to set the stage for higher-level discussions on the disputed naval incident. The demilitarized zone was created as part of the armistice signed between North and South Korea in 1953 that halted fighting in the Korean War, but the war has never officially ended. The United Nations and North Korea began occasional meetings between generals -- ""general officer talks"" -- at Panmunjom in 1998 in an effort to lessen tensions. There have been 17 such meetings so far. Earlier this month, the United Nations formally condemned the sinking of the Cheonan but did not specifically name North Korea. ""The Security Council deplores the attack,"" the 15-member council said in what is known as a presidential statement. It urged that ""appropriate and peaceful measures be taken against those responsible for the incident aimed at the peaceful settlement of the issue."" It also called for full adherence to the 1953 armistice agreement. About 8,000 military personnel from the United States and South Korea are to participate in joint military exercises dubbed ""Invincible Spirit"" from July 25-28, Combined Alliance Joint Naval and Air Exercises announced Tuesday. ""The purpose of this readiness exercise is to highlight Alliance resolve to face any threat North Korea may pose,"" it said in a news release.","NEW: Joint military exercises are to be held July 25-28 .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A weather system moving over the southern Bahamas has been upgraded to a tropical storm, with sustained winds now reported at 40 miles an hour, as it heads toward the southern tip of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. The system has been named Tropical Storm Bonnie. At 11 p.m. ET, it was moving northwest at 14 miles an hour as it approached the northwestern Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center. It could pick up strength as it moves over the long stretch of open water in the Gulf of Mexico, but the latest computer models do not show it becoming a hurricane, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Forecasters had predicted that it would cross over central Florida, but the models now show it passing farther south, over the Florida Keys or the Straits of Florida and then into the Gulf. The storm is expected to pass the southern tip of Florida on Friday afternoon and then make landfall Sunday between New Orleans and the Beaumont-Port Arthur area in southeastern Texas. Myers said it's more likely to bear down on Louisiana. And on that path, it could push oil in the Gulf from the BP oil spill to shore. But at this point, no oil has spilled into the Gulf for the past seven days, with BP's crippled well contained with a cap that appears to be bearing up under ""integrity"" tests. BP's chief operating officer, Doug Suttles, said Thursday that skimmers had been able to recover only 56 barrels of oil the day before, because that's all they could find. With the weather turning bad, BP has suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well.  And late Thursday, the federal official overseeing the effort, retired  Adm. Thad Allen, ordered ships in the area to come to shore. That could delay operations at the well site for 10 to 14 days. But Allen said there's enough confidence in the well that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather. Ships used to skim oil off the surface are likely to have to come ashore as well. Currently, 215 are operating off the coast of Louisiana. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has issued an emergency declaration, intended to speed state help to parishes that need it, when the storm hits. He said mandatory evacuations are not expected, but parishes might call for voluntary evacuations in some low-lying areas. The weather system is drenching the Bahamas and has caused flooding in Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Florida's east coast, from Golden Beach south to the Keys, and along the west coast, northward to Bonita Beach. In Monroe County, Florida, which comprises the Keys, officials warned boaters to secure their vessels and remain in port until winds and seas subside. They warned drivers to use extreme caution on the Overseas Highway, especially on exposed bridges. The hurricane center predicted that the storm would bring 2 to 4 inches of rain to south Florida, with isolated areas receiving as much as 6 inches. The central and northwest Bahamas are likely to receive slightly more, the hurricane center said. CNN's Anna Rhett Miller contributed to this report.","Louisiana declares emergency as storm approaches .

"(CNN) -- Country music artist Taylor Swift has told CNN she never dreamed she would shoot to stardom so quickly. At just 19 years old, she is one of the most successful recording artists of the decade in the United States. Her album ""Fearless"" is certified quadruple platinum, and her 60-date tour of the U.S., UK and Australia sold out in minutes. Talking to CNN's Becky Anderson, she said: ""I think for me the most satisfying thing is going out with my first headlining tour and having every show sell out. That was something that I never dreamed would be so quick to happen. ""Putting Madison Square Garden on sale and having it be sold out in 59 seconds. Like I can't believe that. I'm still completely blown away by that. ""And I think my parents are most proud of the moment when where we were all sitting in the crowd at the CMA Awards and they heard my name announced as entertainer of the year. ""I think my parents cried more for that moment than any other moment."" She has had two number one albums in the Billboard Charts, and in 2009, Swift became the first country music artist ever to win an MTV Video Music Award. Asked what she would have thought had someone told her 10 years ago that she would be famous by the age of 18, she said: ""I thought I was going to do what my parents did. They went to college. They went into business and I loved music and I never imagined that I would actually get to do that as a job. It's wonderful."" Asked why it is that her songs are considered country music, she said: ""I think that what categorizes country music, to me, in my head. I think a country song is when you are singing about being proud of your life. ""I sing about love and boys and that's my life. So that's what fascinates me, feelings, and so I think if you are singing and writing songs about the way that you live your life, that's a country song."" On reports that she is dating teen heartthrob Taylor Lautner, Swift said: ""He's a great guy and we're really close."" But she refused to be drawn on her thoughts about Kanye West, who cut her off as she accepted the award for Best Female Song at the MTV Music Video Awards ceremony. ""I just haven't really changed my mind and that I don't like to talk about it,"" she said.","Most satisfying thing is having every show in her tour sell out, she tells CNN .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Police say one thing was clear when authorities showed up at a house in Arizona looking for a California girl who had been missing for seven years. The family inside was hiding something. They were ""evasive and untruthful,"" said Capt. Patrick Maxwell of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Norwalk Station. When family members were asked to produce a birth certificate or adoption papers for Amber Rose Nicklas, they could not. Maxwell says that is when they admitted the 7-year-old girl was not theirs. The child had been missing since September 2003. She was in the care of foster parents in Norwalk, California, when she was snatched by three of her aunts. Two of the aunts were caught at the time but a third got away with the infant. Maxwell says it appears Amber had been living with the same family in Phoenix, Arizona, for most of the time she was missing, but police are still investigating how she ended up with people who are not her biological family. Authorities got a tip that Amber could be at a home in Phoenix and went there with a court order Wednesday afternoon. When investigators tried to serve the court order, they found that a woman in the home had hidden the child in a shower under a pile of clothes and towels, said Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump. Amber's identity had been changed, including her name and date of birth, police said. Authorities confirmed Amber's real identity through footprints, photographs and DNA swabs. The child is in state custody in California and prosecutors will file charges, Crump said. CNN's Nick Valencia and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","Police say the Arizona family holding the girl was ""evasive and untruthful""

"(CNN) -- Two suspects were arrested over the weekend after authorities found two tons of raw elephant ivory and five rhinoceros horns at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, the Kenya Wildlife Service said Monday. The cargo had been disguised as avocados, according to the service, which says its mission is ""to sustainably conserve and manage Kenya's wildlife and its habitats in collaboration with other stakeholders for posterity."" ""Most of the tusks seem to have been collected from natural deaths of about 150 elephants over the last 20 years with the latest likely to be 6 months old,"" it said in a news release. ""None of the tusks had the indelible ink used for marking government-held stocks. DNA tests will be conducted to determine the tusks' actual origin."" The seizure and arrests resulted from a joint operation that included the Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Revenue Authority, Lusaka Agreement Task Force and the Kenya Police, the wildlife service said. On Saturday night, the airport's warehouse security contacted a canine unit after becoming suspicious about a cargo destined for Malaysia through Dubai by Emirates Airline, it said. ""The cargo, which was falsely declared as containing only fresh avocado fruits, was packed in 12 wooden boxes, which raised a red flag due to its mode of package, weight and destination,"" it said. Inside the boxes, officials found the contraband packed among avocados and wrapped in black paper and banana leaves -- packaging used in an attempt to evade detection, the wildlife service said. Last year, 204 elephants were illegally killed in Kenya, up from 94 in 2008 and 47 in 2007, the service said. Also last year, 13 rhinoceroses were illegally killed in the country, up from five in 2008, it said. In 1979, Africa was home to some 1.3 million elephants; by 1989 only 600,000 remained, a drop blamed almost wholly on the killing of elephants for ivory, the service said. There are currently about 400,000 elephants in Africa, it said. After the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned international commercial ivory trade in 1989, demand dropped as did the price of ivory -- from $300 per kilo to about $3 per kilo, it said. As some southern African elephant populations appeared healthier, restrictions eased in 1997 and 2002, when Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe were allowed to sell limited stocks of ivory to Japan.","Two tons of ivory, five rhino horns seized Sunday at Nairobi's airport .

"Washington (CNN) -- Setting national standards for U.S. students has been tried in the past without success -- but a new state-led effort is gaining momentum, according to an official of an educational think tank that compiled a nationwide study comparing standards. The new benchmarks -- called Common Core Standards -- are a move initiated at the state level to come up with a set of standards that will be used by all states to create cross-border consistency in what students will be expected to know. In June, the Common Core recommendations were released to the public by the National Governors Association and state education heads. So far 26 states have signed on to the national Common Core Standards while several have opted not to use the standards. Each state currently evaluates its elementary and secondary students according to its own state benchmarks, which vary greatly across state lines. ""You look at these standards and most Americans would say, 'Sure, this is what we want our students to know,'"" says Fordham Institute Vice President Mike Petrilli. Since the Common Core Standards are part of a state-led effort, Petrilli says they have avoided the debate about the federal government pushing standards on the rest of the country. Also, the writers of the recommendations have done ""a pretty good job of putting together good standards,"" according to Petrilli. Read the Common Core Standards . The Washington-based Fordham Institute on Wednesday released results of its study comparing the standards-of-learning of all 50 states and the District of Columbia with the Common Core Standards that have been proposed for the whole country. Additionally, the study graded the Common Core Standards themselves. The Common Core Standards overall get a B+ in English language arts and an A- in mathematics, according to the institute. On the more local level, California, the District of Columbia and Indiana received the highest marks in English language arts with more stringent standards than the national recommendations, according to the institute's study, while 37 states fell below the recommended Common Core standards. In mathematics, there were no states that had standards that were clearly better than the Common Core Standards, but California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Indiana and Washington were close to the mark. The report found that, overall, the Common Core Standards scored well in clarity and content. It will take several years for plans to be put in place for the states to actually start testing students under national guidelines. The Massachusetts State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education signed onto the Common Core Standards on Wednesday. The high-profile vote was made after three hours of public comment that included a gubernatorial candidate who spoke against the adoption and two former commissioners of education that spoke for the change. In the education community, Massachusetts is considered to have high state benchmarks already, so there was a question as to whether or not they should alter their current criteria. Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker said that ""tinkering with this proven track record makes no sense."" But State Education Secretary Paul Reville said, ""All along, the conversation about Common Core has been about the Commonwealth seizing the opportunity to improve upon our already high standards.""","A state-led effort has created proposed national standards for U.S. students .

"(CNN) -- A confidential report on safety conditions aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, conducted about one month before the rig's explosion, points to widespread fear of reprisal for reporting employee mistakes that could undermine safety aboard the rig. ""There was a stated fear of reprisal related specifically to the reporting of dropped objects,"" states an executive summary of the report obtained by CNN. ""Only 46.3 percent of participants felt that, if their actions led to a potentially risky situation (e.g., forgetting to do something, damaging equipment, dropping an object from height), they could report it without any fear of reprisal,"" the report states. Transocean, the rig operator, commissioned the survey of about 40 employees, about half its staff aboard the Deepwater Horizon. The report concluded, ""Deepwater Horizon was relatively strong in many of the core aspects of safety management."" But it also uncovered fear among workers of suffering reprisal for reporting conditions that could lead to a ""risky"" situation onboard the rig. The study also found some Transocean employees entered fake data to try to circumvent a safety system, according to a person familiar with the full report. The study was based on surveys conducted March 12-16 by Lloyd's Register Group, a consultant that analyzes the safety of business processes and products. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded the night of April 20 while drilling BP's Macondo oil well. Two days later it sank. The Lloyd's report was completed afterwards; it is dated May 11. Lloyd's said it was retained by Transocean to ""proactively understand their safety culture and assess the equipment on the Deepwater Horizon."" Transocean has commissioned safety surveys of its staff aboard 20 other drilling rigs. A spokesperson for Transocean insisted the study of employees aboard Deepwater Horizon reflected the company's commitment to safety. ""This rig did go seven years without a lost-time incident or any major environmental accidents,"" said spokesman Lou Colasuonno. ""This rig was exhibit-A for a well-run rig."" In assessing the safety culture onboard the rig, the consultants gave ratings of between 2.9 to 3.5 on a scale of 1 to 5 for policies such as leadership, communication, training and monitoring. A separate report by a different Transocean consultant on the Deepwater Horizon's equipment cited at least 26 components and systems out of 129 categories on the rig that were in ""bad"" or ""poor"" condition, according to a report in Thursday's New York Times. Transocean's spokesman told CNN all equipment on the Deepwater Horizon was in line with government guidelines.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was the stench. That was what really hit Danny Boyle the first time he went into a slum in India. In ""Slumdog"" a poor man wins a place on India's version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" ""There's this smell you get first of all,"" recalls the British director. ""This incredible mixture of our excrement -- it belongs to all of us -- and then saffron. It's just this mixture of sweet and sour."" Boyle's experiences shooting in the teeming, chaotic port city of Mumbai could also be described as sweet and sour. The director, who is renown for films like ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later,"" had never even been to India before he and his crew traveled there to make the critically acclaimed Oscar contender ""Slumdog Millionaire."" ""It's pretty mad,"" admits Boyle. ""Everything is extreme. It's too hot, the tea is too sweet; everything is kind of too much."" But, he adds: ""That's wonderful for drama, absolutely wonderful."" He and his crew threw themselves into shooting their drama in the streets and landmarks of India's ""city of dreams"" using passers-by as extras. They also shot in the Dharavi -- Asia's largest slum -- and Juhu slum which can be seen from the city's airport. ""Slumdog"" is a classic rags-to-riches story about a young boy from the slums, Jamal Malik (played by British actor Dev Patel), who beats millions of other Indians to bag a coveted place on the country's version of TV game show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Through the timely story of the young ""slumdog,"" Boyle illuminates the contradictions of present day India -- the nuclear power that does not provide public sanitation for its population -- and Mumbai was the ideal city in which to do it. ""Mumbai is a city of extremes,"" Boyle explains, ""Life is raw. It's incredibly powerful and rich because their economy is expanding, the richest men in the world are there ... but then there is also this enormous poverty as well."" Do you think Danny Boyle has captured India in ""Slumdog Millionaire""? Tell us below in the SoundOff box. Boyle's film shows these extremes with great realism. He takes the audience from the cheerfully money-grubbing micro-commerce of the slums where young boys charge slum dwellers to use filthy latrines, to Jamal's job as a ""chaiwallah"" (tea boy) in one of India's much-publicized call centers, and later, to the Indian game show phenomenon, ""Kaun Banega Crorepati."" Boyle achieved this realism by immersing himself, his crew and actors in the Mumbai sprawl, and shooting as much as possible in real locations. ""I wanted to feel really involved in the city. I didn't want to be looking at it, examining it. I wanted to be thrown into the chaos as much as possible. ""There's a period of time between about 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. where it all stops and just the dogs move around, but other than that, the place is just a tide of humanity."" With limited time in India, Boyle made the decision to travel to the places he intended to shoot and film the cast's rehearsals there. This was something the film's star, Patel, found challenging at first. ""It's daunting at first doing these scenes outdoors with loads of people watching, but they just warm to it and everybody is, like, laughing and they start clapping at the end of the scenes,"" Patel laughs. His co-star Frieda Pinto, who plays love interest Latika, was born and brought up in Mumbai and knows the city well. Watch Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto talking about the making of ""Slumdog Millionaire."" ""You can't stop the bystanders in Bombay,"" she explains, ""It is something that you attract anyway, especially if you have a camera out there and a foreign crew and a song and dance. ""You are definitely going to attract a huge crowd and you can't do anything about it. The only thing you can do is enjoy it."" For Boyle and the crew, on the other side of the camera, the energy and chaos was a pretty intense experience. ""You just don't have any control in India,"" he explains. ""If you seek it, it will drive you insane. You've got to go with it really and just see what happens."" But they did have some tricks up their collective sleeve. Boyle and veteran cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle shot crowd scenes, like the chase through Juhu slum at the beginning of the film, using the people who happened to be passing by on the street for added realism. They wanted to draw as little attention to themselves as possible to keep the crowds looking natural. To achieve this feeling of being right in the middle of everything without disturbing the local communities too much, they used a variety of small digital cameras and digital stills camera. ""[We used] a Canon stills camera, which takes 12 frames per second. If people see a stills camera, they don't think it's recording live action,"" he explains. For Boyle, who believes his first film, ""Shallow Grave"" (1995) is still his best, because ""you haven't a clue what you are doing"" and ""you haven't learnt the tricks yet,"" he says, shooting in Mumbai was a way of recapturing that early originality.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he is breaking off relations with Colombia. His decision comes as the Organization of American States meets to discuss Colombian claims that Venezuela is protecting FARC and ELN rebels in its territory. The move is the biggest escalation in a year of simmering tensions between the two countries and their presidents. Chavez said that under President Alvaro Uribe, Colombia has isolated itself and become ""aggressive and violent."" He called Uribe ""crazed"" and accused the United States of using Uribe as a puppet. Uribe is in the final month of a presidency that has had many tensions with neighboring Venezuela, mostly over accusations that rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (also known as FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN) have camps in Venezuela. Chavez said he hoped for better relations with Colombian President-elect Juan Manuel Santos, who was Uribe's defense minister and whose election was viewed as an affirmation of Uribe's policies. The Venezuelan leader spoke from his presidential palace, where he was holding a news conference with Argentine soccer coach Diego Maradona. Maradona's visit was unrelated to the spat with Colombia. Venezuela recalled its ambassador to Colombia on Friday in reaction to the accusations of protecting rebels. Uribe is a two-term president who has received high approval ratings for his tough stand against FARC guerrillas, who have been waging war against the government for decades. Colombia has accused Chavez of supporting the rebels, and Chavez has said Colombian officials and right-wing paramilitary units have plotted his assassination. Security analysts say FARC guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador. FARC is said to traffic in cocaine to finance its insurgency. Colombia has also accused another neighbor, Ecuador, of giving refuge to rebels. In 2008, Colombia carried out a raid in Ecuadorian territory that resulted in the killing of a top FARC leader. Thursday was not the first time Chavez cut off diplomatic ties with Colombia. A year ago, Chavez ""froze"" the nations' relationship over Colombian accusations that Venezuelan weapons had made it into the hands of rebels. Colombia said it had evidence that shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons recovered from FARC guerrillas were of Venezuelan origin. Venezuela denied the allegations and said the rebels may have stolen the weapons from a Venezuelan base.","Hugo Chavez says relations with Colombia are totally broken .

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- Prosecutors in Pinellas County, Florida, on Wednesday sought to convince jurors that a young woman accused of stabbing to death an 18-year-old woman last year did not act in self-defense but intended to attack her because both women were fighting over the same man. Rachel Wade, 20, is accused of killing Sarah Ludemann in the early hours of April 15, 2009. According to court records, the two women were involved with Joshua Camacho, then 20, and over a period of several months engaged in a series of nasty confrontations over him via MySpace postings, text messages and voicemails. The situation escalated when the two women confronted one another outside a friend's home. Wade stabbed Ludemann, who was unarmed, twice in the chest, and Ludemann died at the scene. The defense is arguing that Wade, at 5-foot-4 and 110 pounds, acted in self-defense -- fearing for her safety when she was confronted by Ludemann, 5-foot-9 and 166 pounds, and two other women. But in the opening day of the trial Wednesday, the prosecution sought to portray Wade as the initial aggressor, who waited for Ludemann with a knife and barely gave her time to get out of her vehicle before attacking her. Four witnesses to the night of the confrontation testified before the six-person jury Wednesday: Janet Camacho, the sister of Joshua Camacho and a friend of Ludemann's; Jilica Smith, a friend of Janet Camacho's; Ashley Lovelady, Ludemann's best friend; and Dustin Grimes, a friend of Wade's ex-boyfriend. Smith and Janet Camacho both testified that while they were driving to a McDonald's with Ludemann in her minivan, they heard their friend on the phone with Wade and said they heard Wade tell her, ""I'm going to stab you and your Mexican boyfriend."" Ludemann grew upset, according to the testimony, and learned of Wade's whereabouts when she happened to pass Lovelady on the road on their way to McDonald's. Lovelady told the women that she had seen Wade at her ex-boyfriend Javier Laboy's house, according to Camacho. Ludemann then rushed over to Laboy's house, where Wade was at her car with a knife nearby, Janet Camacho and Smith testified. Ludemann pulled her minivan to an abrupt halt, its nose about 5 feet from the front of Wade's Red Saturn, and began to get out of the vehicle, according to testimony. Within a matter of seconds, prosecutors say, Wade grabbed the knife and approached the driver's side of the minivan and attacked Ludemann between the driver's open door and the minivan. However, Grimes, the final witness of the day and who was standing outside Laboy's house when the stabbing occurred, testified that the three women jumped out of the minivan at the same time and approached Wade. He said the attack occurred between the two cars. His testimony, given via videotape from his military posting overseas, could be key to the defense as it seeks to build its case around self-defense. Prosecutors played the 911 call placed on the night of the incident by Smith, who can be heard screaming that ""Rachel just ... stabbed her."" Both Smith and Wade wiped away tears as the audio recording was played. Prosecutors are expected Thursday to play other recordings of threatening voicemail messages left on Ludemann's cell phone by Wade in the eight months before the attack. In an August 29, 2008, voicemail, Wade can be heard saying ""I'm guaranteeing you I'm going to ... murder you,"" according to testimony at a prior hearing in the case. The jury will also hear from police officers who responded to the incident, as well as the medical examiner. Wade, who was 19 at the time of the killing, faces life in prison -- a minimum of 20 and a half years -- if convicted of second-degree murder in the case. In Session's Beth Karas contributed to this report.","Rachel Wade is accused of stabbing to death 18-year-old Sarah Ludemann .

"(CNN)  -- Park Ji-sung headed a second half winner as Manchester United beat bitter rivals Liverpool 2-1 to reclaim top spot in the English Premier League on Sunday. Spanish international striker Fernando Torres gave Liverpool a shock fifth-minute lead at Old Trafford, but Wayne Rooney quickly equalized from the penalty spot. The goal came in controversial circumstances with Javier Mascherano's foul on Antonio Valencia appearing to start outside the area. Rooney's initial spotkick was saved by Pepe Reina, but the England striker continued his rich scoring vein by hitting home the rebound in the 12th minute. In a second half of few openings, South Korean star Park dived to power home the winner on the hour mark from man of the match Darren Fletcher's superb cross. Torres, who had started and finished the move to put Liverpool ahead, fluffed a great chance to equalize in the the last minute, but his shot ballooned high and Yossi Benayoun could only head it straight at Edwin van der Sar. The win takes United two points clear of Arsenal on 69 points after 31 games. Third-placed Chelsea were later held to a 1-1 draw at Blackburn to be four points adrift, but with a game in hand. It was another setback for Chelsea, who were knocked out of the Champions League by Inter Milan in midweek. Didier Drogba gave Carlo Ancelotti's men an early lead at Ewood Park as he neatly converted Nicolas Anelka's cross, but they were unable to press home their advantage. El-Hadji Diouf equalized for the home side in the 70th minute when he rose above Paulo Ferreira to cleverly direct Michel Salgado's cross past Petr Cech. Fletcher claimed their earlier victory over Liverpool, who are battling with Tottenham, Manchester City and Aston Villa for the final Champions League spot, had put the pressure on Chelsea. ""The team that puts the most consistent run to the end of the season will probably be the champions,"" Fletcher told Sky Sports. United's city rivals Manchester City also enjoyed a crucial 2-1 win on Sunday as they beat Fulham at Craven Cotage. Fulham were feeling the effects of their famous win over Juventus in midweek and fell behind to first half goals from Roque Santa Cruz and Carlos Tevez, who starred for the visitors. Fulham captain Danny Murphy pulled one back from the spot in the 75th minute but they could not force an equalizer. City move above Liverpool into fifth place, two points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham, but with a game in hand.","Park Ji-sung heads a second half winner to give Manchester United 2-1 win .

"(CNN) -- Amnesty International on Friday urged Saudi Arabian authorities not to paralyze a man as punishment for his having paralyzed someone else, allegedly during a fight. The Saudi newspaper Okaz reported that the judge in the case had sent letters to several hospitals in Saudi Arabia asking if they could sever a man's spinal cord, as the man he allegedly stabbed had requested and, under sharia law, was his right to seek. But such a punishment would amount ""to nothing less than torture,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, acting director of the organization's Middle East and North Africa Programme. ""While those guilty of a crime should be held accountable, intentionally paralyzing a man in this way would constitute torture, and be a breach of its international human rights obligations."" The paralyzed man, 22-year-old Abdul-Aziz al-Mitairy, told Okaz that the accused stabbed him in the back with a large knife during a fight more than two years ago. ""The accused confessed to the crime in front of police, resulting in a general sentence of seven months,"" he told the newspaper. During that time, the court in the northwest province of Tabuk debated how to carry out the surgery the paralyzed man was seeking as punishment for his alleged attacker, news reports said. Riyadh's King Faisal Specialist Hospital, one of the kingdom's leading hospitals, responded that, from a medical perspective, it would not be possible for them to cause the injury by performing such surgery, Okaz reported. But apparently at least one hospital said it would be possible. ""According to one report, one hospital said it would be possible to medically administer the injury at the same place on the spinal cord as the damage the man is alleged to have caused his victim using a cleaver, during a fight more than two years ago, causing similar paralysis,"" Amnesty said in a news release. It is up to the court to decide whether to impose the paralysis punishment or sentence the man to imprisonment, financial compensation, or flogging, it said. The alleged attacker, who has not been identified publicly, ""was convicted and sentenced following a trial where he was said to have had no legal assistance,"" Amnesty added. International human rights law would consider such a sentence to be a violation of the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and to break the U.N. Convention Against Torture to which Saudi Arabia is a party, Amnesty said. It would also violate the principles of medical ethics adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, it said. Other sentences of retribution in the kingdom have included eye-gouging, tooth extraction, and death in cases involving murder, it said. International organizations are not the only ones to protest. Outrage has been expressed by bloggers in Saudi Arabia over the sentence, which underscores the societal struggle in Saudi Arabia between hardliners, who hew to tribal justice, and progressives, who consider such verdicts to be draconian and bad for the country's international image. The fact that newspapers and bloggers are questioning decisions by courts -- institutions traditionally considered above reproach -- is a relatively recent phenomenon in Saudi Arabia, where other such sentences have captured international attention. ""This case in Saudi Arabia is not the only case of its kind,"" said Akbar Ahmed, a former commissioner of justice in Pakistan who is chairman of the department of Islamic Studies at American University in Washington. ""We see many cases like this -- stoning or beheading or cutting off hands or feet in Iran, Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, which are very tribal."" Under Islamic law, compassion is an important virtue for any judge, Ahmed said. ""However harsh the punishment would be in tribal law, an eye for an eye, the compassion element that must be exercised by the judge overrides it, and I'm afraid we don't see much of that in cases like this where, very often, the victim becomes twice punished,"" he added.

"(CNN Student News) -- August 23, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Iran • Pakistan • Korean Peninsula . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Back from the weekend and ready to launch into 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines, including dueling protests, an Iranian announcement and one teen's push for peace. I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News. First Up: Egg Safety . AZUZ: First up, a recall gets bigger as more than half a billion eggs are pulled off the shelves. Now last week, we told you about an egg producer that did a recall because of concerns about salmonella, a bacteria that can be found in eggs, and it can make you very sick. Well now, another producer is involved. Experts think that around 1,300 people have gotten sick from the tainted eggs. One doctor offered some safety tips. DR. RANDY MARTIN, PIEDMONT HEART INSTITUTE: Eggs are actually a great source of protein and a lot of the good vitamins. But there are other sources. So, if you're really concerned, have some tofu, other things like that. Refrigerate your eggs. They've got to be less than 40 degrees. Store them individually, like you've done, and then cook them. They've got to be more than 160 degrees for 10 minutes. And eat them promptly. Islamic Center Debate . AZUZ: In New York City, things are tense over plans to build an Islamic center with a mosque a few blocks away from Ground Zero. That's one site of the 9/11 terror attacks. And Sunday, hundreds of people turned out in protest, both against the plan and for it. Most of the protesters are opposed to the plan; they're opposed to the Islamic center. They argue that it's insensitive to build it so close to Ground Zero. According to a CNN poll that was taken earlier this month, nearly 70 percent of Americans agree with them; they are against the plan. But on the other side of the debate, those folks who support building the Islamic center argue that the issue is freedom of religion. New York Governor David Patterson says there are no laws that prevent the construction of the Islamic center. But he says the controversy shows him that ""the wounds of 9/11 haven't healed."" One of the leaders of the group that's behind the development of the Islamic center says that there are no plans to move the construction site, at least not for now. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What is the name of the Middle Eastern country that's highlighted on this map? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Saudi Arabia, B) Iran, C) Pakistan or D) Oman? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Islamic Republic of Iran is highlighted here. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Drone Unveiled . AZUZ: And Iran is making a new type of military weapon. It's a long-range drone, an unmanned arial vehicle. They're pretty common in modern combat. The U.S. uses something called a Predator drone. And American officials say the unmanned vehicles help cut down risk for troops because no one actually has to be on board piloting it. Iran started producing its drones back in February. The first ones were unveiled yesterday. Iranian officials say the drones have a range of about 620 miles and can carry different types of bombs and missiles to hit ground targets. They claim that the goal of the new vehicles is to prevent aggression against their country. Meanwhile, Iran has started fueling a new nuclear energy plant. It says the plant will help make electricity. But other countries, including the United States, think Iran may try to make nuclear weapons. Flood Economy . AZUZ: Moving east from Iran to Pakistan. We've told you about the severe flooding there. We're starting to see some of the aftermath of that flooding in terms of disease: skin diseases, respiratory infections, malaria. The World Health Organization says nearly a million Pakistanis are suffering some kind of illness. The floods are making a massive impact on the country's economy as well, and Jonathan Mann has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) JONATHAN MANN, CNN ANCHOR, ATLANTA: More than half of Pakistan's people live off the land. Now, much of the land is covered by dirty water, and the people are reduced to misery. WENDY CHAMBERLIN, PRESIDENT, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE; FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO PAKISTAN: It's hard to imagine a country that is least prepared or had the thinnest of margins to be able to absorb a shock of this type. MANN: Under all of that water, there are homes, farms and factories, bridges, roads and irrigation canals. Five hundred thousand tons of stored wheat is now reported ruined. Add potentially two million bales of cotton. Food prices have been rising in markets around the country. Pakistan's long-standing electricity shortage is suddenly so much worse because power plants have been shut down or damaged as well. The county's high commissioner to Britain told the Reuters news agency that it might cost $15 billion to rebuild from the devastation. And Pakistan -- already deeply in debt -- will have less money to spend, because its ability to earn with exports has been dramatically reduced. CHAMBERLIN: What the floods have done is to virtually wipe out an infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure that it depended upon for its wheat exports. And because about 60 percent of the population worked in the agricultural sector, so the amount of investment that will need to go in just to bring Pakistan back up to a status quo, a status quo that was not sufficient, is going to cost billions and billions of dollars. MANN: The world has responded with millions in aid. The World Bank alone has pledged $900 million more. But Pakistan will need so much more money than that, even long after the water is gone. Jonathan Mann, CNN. (END VIDEO) Is this Legit? SHELBY ERDMAN, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The demilitarized zone, or DMZ, divides North and South Korea. Legit! It was established in 1953 as part of the agreement that ended the fighting in the Korean War. Peace Mission . AZUZ: The fighting ended a while ago, but technically, North and South Korea are still at war. And the DMZ is patrolled at all times by troops from both countries. It doesn't sound like the kind of place you might want to spend a vacation, but there's a 13-year-old from Mississippi who thought so. And Emily Chang introduces him and his hope to us. (BEGIN VIDEO) EMILY CHANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: He's a 13-year-old boy turned international envoy. JONATHAN LEE, PEACE ADVOCATE: Hello, my name is Jonathan, and I'm the founder of a youth humanitarian environmental group called ""I See Hope."" CHANG: Just off a plane, Jonathan Lee greeted throngs of global media after a mission to one of the most isolated nations in the world. LEE: Actually, I was really kind of scared at first. But once I got there, I was kind of relieved because I felt, in my experience, very safe. CHANG: As a Korean-American from Mississippi, his idea was simple but ambitious: to convince Kim Jong-il to plant a children's peace forest in the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea, two nations technically still at war. LEE: I would really like, if possible, maybe of children from both countries to be able to meet and play with each other, like a big playground. CHANG: How did you feel when he came up with this idea? MELISSA LEE, JONATHAN'S MOTHER: I was like, really? You want to go to North Korea, and when? And then he was so adamant and so strong about how he felt, I was like, okay. I was cool with it. I was fine. KYOUNG LEE, JONATHAN'S FATHER: I said, no way. CHANG: Completely opposite. His father, originally from South Korea, was hesitant, but eventually agreed and the family embarked on their journey. LEE: My idea for the mission statement of the children's peace forest is ""Above politics, above borders, above ideology, above conflict."" CHANG: Jonathan's humanitarian work started three years ago. He created Go Green Man, a superhero who teaches kids to protect the environment. He's met with President Obama and other top leaders. He's filed more than 30 iReports on CNN and waged a seven-day campaign to urge McDonald's to recycle. But his trip to North Korea would be the most challenging and eye opening. LEE: I went to a school children's palace and I found out the children there are very talented. They learned piano and did it really impressively. The accordion, calligraphy, embroidery. CHANG: He didn't meet with Kim Jong-il, but says he did meet with other government officials who told him a peace treaty would have to be signed before there could ever be a children's peace forest. LEE: Well, I was a little disappointed, but I'm going to keep trying. Maybe if I keep trying, I don't know, maybe eventually, hopefully. CHANG: Emily Chang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: All right, before we go today, we've got a story that's just too doggone cute -- or ugly -- to ignore.  This is Izzy, a two-year old Chihuahua. But she's only half the story. Look down by her leg. That's a baby squirrel! Two of those were abandoned under the tree. Izzy's owner took in the squirrels, but Izzy decided to take over, adopting the little ones. We've actually been holding on to this video for a few days, kinda waiting to show it off to you. Goodbye . AZUZ: I guess you could say we've been squirreling it away.

"(CNN) -- Soldiers and rescue workers on Friday pulled stranded people out of deluged swathes of southern China inundated by 11 days of heavy rain, state media said. The rains have led to the deaths of 211 people in 10 provinces, while 119 others are listed as missing, according to Xinhua news agency. Two dikes on the eastern Fu River in Jiangxi broke on Wednesday, forcing another 100,000 people to join the 2.3 million already evacuated, state officials estimated. More than 29 million people have been affected by the flooding, Chinese media reported. The government sent thousands of soldiers and rescuers to the region to assist in the evacuation effort and help repair the broken dikes. Officials said the repairs will run through next week, though storms could hamper the effort, Xinhua said. Eleven days of heavy rains in China caused the flooding, according to Xinhua.","Death toll from China flooding rises to 211 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A major figure in the project to build an Islamic center and mosque near ground zero in New York City said Sunday that moving the project to another site is not under consideration for now. Daisy Khan, who is heading the development of the project with her husband, told ABC's ""This Week"" that a move could be considered after consultations with ""all major stakeholders"" take place. ""We will meet and we will do what's right for everyone,"" Khan said, noting the project has the backing of the community board as well as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other politicians. Moving from the planned site two blocks from where al Qaeda attackers destroyed the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,700 people, raises constitutional issues and would be noted by Islamic extremists, Khan said. ""We have to be very careful and deliberate in making any move,"" Khan said. The issue has become an emotional topic in the United States, with conservative Republicans and some families of victims leading an effort to prevent the Islamic center and mosque from being built. A protest against the project was scheduled to take place Sunday in New York. President Barack Obama, Bloomberg and others, including a group representing some families of victims of the September 11 attacks, have supported the right of Khan's group to build the facility near ground zero. Khan appeared on the program with Rabbi Joy Levitt, the executive director of the Jewish Community Center in New York. Khan said the facility she and her husband, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, are developing would be modeled after the Jewish Community Center.","Daisy Khan and her husband are developing the controversial Islamic center .

"Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange said Swedish authorities reached ""the height of irresponsibility"" by issuing an arrest warrant alleging rape against him, then revoking it less than a day later. ""It is clearly a smear campaign,"" Assange told Arabic news network Al-Jazeera in a live telephone interview Sunday. ""... The only question is, who was involved?"" Asked who he thinks was behind the accusations, Assange told the network, ""We have some suspicions about who would benefit, but without direct evidence, I would not be willing to make a direct allegation."" Meanwhile, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said in an update on its website that Assange's name was leaked to the media, and the authority -- which does not normally publish the names of suspects -- ""did not in this case initiate publication."" However, the office did confirm Assange's identity and later published his name in statements about his arrest and the subsequent revocation. An arrest warrant was filed against Assange in absentia on Friday. Swedish media, citing unnamed sources, reported that two women, ages 20 and 30, reported the allegations to police, leading to the warrant being filed. The AftonBladet, a respected Swedish daily, said the 30-year-old told the newspaper that the younger woman had approached her with a story similar to hers -- that she had consensual sex with Assange but that the situation had turned abusive. Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, would not confirm the reports. But on Saturday, less than full day later, Chief Prosecutor Eva Finne said in a statement posted on the authority's website that Assange was ""no longer wanted"" and ""is not suspected of rape."" The prosecution authority said on its website Sunday, ""When Ms. Finne became in charge of the matter on Saturday, she had more information than the first prosecutor had on Friday night. Decisions on coercive measures, like arrest, should constantly be re-evaluated during an investigation and must always be based on the actual information."" ""The decision to appoint Eva Finne as prosecutor in charge was made on Saturday,"" the authority said. ""Under most circumstances the duty prosecutors on Monday morning hand over all weekend matters to different prosecutors who will be in fully in charge of the investigations."" However, serious crimes or high-profile matters can be handed over earlier to lessen the burden on the duty prosecutors, the posting said. ""The matter concerning Mr. Assange was judged as such a matter."" Rosander told CNN affiliate TV4 that the decision to issue the warrant was made by an ""on-call prosecutor"" and that Finne revoked the warrant on Saturday. Such differences in prosecutorial judgment are common in Sweden, she said. The arrest warrant also mentioned a molestation charge, but molestation -- which is not limited to child victims in Sweden -- is not a crime punishable by jail time. Rosander told TV4 Assange is still under investigation for molestation. Asked about that investigation by Al-Jazeera, Assange -- who said he is on holiday in the north of Sweden -- said, ""I have no details on what that is about. I cannot imagine any event where that would be credible."" He said he has not been contacted by Swedish police, but has directed his attorney to contact them. Assange told the network he was warned of an impending smear campaign. In a posting Saturday on the WikiLeaks Twitter page, Assange said, ""the charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing."" Asked if he had anything to tell Swedish authorities, Assange said he would ask that they be cautious ""and not issue statements and retract them six hours later"" given the seriousness of the situation. Finne, the posting Sunday said, ""will work with the investigation"" next week. ""At the moment, it is not possible to estimate when more information can be given or which decisions will be made."" WikiLeaks has triggered controversy by recently posting some 76,000 U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan. An elusive figure, Assange reportedly lives part-time in Sweden. He told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet last week that he had been in Sweden because he wanted a safe-place to go after the high-profile document leak -- which has been called the biggest leak since the Pentagon Papers about the Vietnam War. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates criticized the leak, saying it would have a significant negative impact on troops and allies, revealing techniques and procedures. And Afghan President Hamid Karzai has expressed concern that the leaks will put informants' lives at risk. Asked Sunday by Al-Jazeera about Karzai's comment that he has blood on his hands, Assange said it was ""extraordinary thing to hear, a comment like that, from a man like that, who has waded his whole life in blood."" He pointed out that the Pentagon has said it was not aware of anyone coming to harm because of the documents' release. Another 15,000 documents are being reviewed and will be released soon, Assange said. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","WikiLeaks founder won't say who he thinks is behind allegations .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities are reviewing concerns from a Massachusetts sheriff who is threatening to reject federal detainees at her jail. In an August 13 letter to the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral noted a ""staggering lack of communication and respect"" from the federal agency. She told CNN Radio that if her concerns aren't addressed, ICE ""would no longer be allowed to house federal detainees at the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department. They would have to take them to a different facility."" ICE is reviewing Cabral's letter and will offer a direct response to her concerns, said Harold Ort, a spokesman for the agency. ""We remain committed to reforming the nation's civil detention system and will continue to work closely with our state and local partners to ensure that these necessary reform measures are successfully implemented,"" he said. Cabral received $8 million this year to house about 260 federal detainees at a time. She says the amount is much less than it seems after costs are weighed in. ""The state allows us to have a retained revenue account, and that simply means that you're getting revenue from a source other than state appropriation,"" she said. ""Your state appropriation is then diminished by the amount of money you may bring in from an outside source, and in this case that's a federal reimbursement,"" she said. ""Our retained revenue account is $8 million a year. We spend more than $6 million a year staffing the building."" Cabral said her department is specifically frustrated with ICE not sending documentation about the Suffolk jail, including federal audits and complaints from detainees. Most recently, she said she was unaware of the findings of a federal investigation into the October death of a federal detainee until they were reported by Boston media. ""There hasn't been that level of communication and information sharing, and it's very important that we're able to be very consistent with issues in this department,"" she said. CNN Radio's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","Sheriff is warning feds that their detainees will be turned away .

"New York (CNN) -- The flight attendant whose dramatic departure from a JetBlue plane at a New York City airport has transformed him into a folk hero to some wants his job back, his lawyer told reporters Thursday. ""That's his life,"" Steven Slater's Legal Aid defense attorney Howard Turman told reporters outside his client's home in Queens, near John F. Kennedy International Airport, where Slater's exit via an emergency slide vaulted him to national attention. ""His father was a pilot; his mother was a flight attendant. That's in his blood. That's what he likes to do."" Whether Slater can regain his wings was unclear. ""We're conducting an internal investigation regarding his status as an employee at JetBlue,"" said airline spokeswoman Jenny Dervin, who added that Slater has been removed from duty pending the outcome of that internal inquiry. She described Slater's behavior as unlike that of the New York-based airline's other 2,300 flight attendants. ""I would say this is highly unique,"" she said. But an internal memo sent Thursday by JetBlue Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Rob Maruster and obtained by CNN describes a company that appears unlikely to forgive. ""Intentionally arming and deploying an evacuation slide for anything other than the express purpose of protecting the safety of our crew and customers is unacceptable,"" it says. ""It will not, and can not, be tolerated."" During the defense lawyer's remarks, the 20-year flight attendant stood at his side and smiled occasionally but made only one brief remark: ""Thank you all so much,"" he said. ""It's been amazing -- the support and the love and everything that's been brought to me and given to me by my community and my friends and the industry at large. It's been absolutely wonderful."" The incident may not have appeared so wonderful when it began unfolding Monday morning at Pennsylvania's Pittsburgh International Airport where, according to JetBlue spokeswoman Dervin, Slater was one of two flight attendants aboard an Embraer 190 flight that was scheduled to depart at 10:35 a.m. and arrive 84 minutes later at JFK. Problems began before the flight, carrying a full load of 100 passengers, took off. ""A number of passengers were competing for overhead carry-on luggage areas,"" Turman, Slater's attorney, said. ""With great difficulty, they were shoving the bags around, attempting to get it in. Steven came over to assist and either the bag or the overhead (bin door) hit him in the head and at that point he suffered an injury."" Turman offered a more graphic description of events on Wednesday, when he said a woman ""started cursing and -- based on the information -- slammed the overhead luggage bin on his head."" Then the woman said, ""F--- you"" to Slater, Turman said. After the flight landed at JFK, Slater approached the woman as she attempted to retrieve her bag from the bin while the plane was still taxiing to the gate, according to a source familiar with the incident. Passengers are required to stay in their seats with their seat belts fastened until the pilot has reached the gate and gives the all-clear sign. ""We hear Slater on the intercom, 'Will people on the aisle please sit down? We're on an active runway,'"" recalled passenger Howard Deneroff, an executive with the Westwood One radio network. Then Slater made a second announcement, Deneroff told CNN. ""Please sit down and shut the overhead bin. We cannot move this plane while you're standing."" The passenger cursed Slater again, Turman said Wednesday. Her fury grew upon learning she would have to wait at baggage claim to retrieve luggage she had been forced to check at the gate in Pittsburgh, he said. At that point, Slater got on the plane's public address system. Passenger Phil Catelinet wrote on his blog that Slater said, ""To the passenger who just called me a motherf-----: f--- you. I've been in this business 20 years, and I've had it."" The plane was blocked into the gate at 12:07 p.m., eight minutes late. After making an expletive-filled announcement, Slater had a confrontation with another crew member, according to passenger Gib Mendelson of Cape Elizabeth, Maine. ""We see him grabbing his roller bag that all flight personnel use. He tossed it out the right door of the plane,"" Mendelson, a semi-retired attorney, told CNN. ""He was scuffling with either the pilot or the co-pilot. I noticed a lot of blue; there was a lot of movement in the galley area."" Slater then grabbed some beer from the beverage cart before deploying the emergency slide and leaving. The flight crew reported the slide deployment at 12:12 p.m., according to Maruster's memo. Turman sharply denied a JetBlue passenger's assertion published Thursday that the flight attendant instigated the confrontation. ""It's not so,"" said Turman. ""Sometimes, some people in our society are not courteous and are impatient,"" Turman said. ""For 20 years, Steven has been very patient, has dealt with the passengers in each of the airlines he worked for in an effective and courteous and polite manner. Sometimes that point can be taken advantage of by others."" He added, ""If you think it's easy for flight attendants to get on a plane every day and be concerned for the safety of each and every passenger -- without a tension, without a stress -- you're fooling yourselves."" Slater has pleaded not guilty to charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief -- both felonies -- and criminal trespass. If convicted, he could face a maximum of seven years in prison. But Turman said Thursday he had spoken with the district attorney's office, ""and I believe there will be a favorable outcome for my client that should satisfy all parties in this case."" A spokeswoman for the prosecutor did not respond directly to Turman's remarks. ""We will prosecute this case in the court,"" said Meris Campbell of the district attorney's office. ""We're not going to respond to every press conference the attorney gives."" Slater has a court appearance scheduled for September 7. Meanwhile, Slater had amassed more than 191,000 ""fans"" on a public Facebook page as of Thursday evening. CNN's Allan Chernoff and Tom Watkins contributed to this story.","NEW: JetBlue memo shows management may be unwilling to forgive .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- The flag of Arizona, skeletons and the Statue of Liberty are just some of the images evoked by a group of artists to give life to their views on Arizona's new immigration law. The collection of prints, sculptures, paintings and photographs are featured in the traveling exhibit, ""SB1070: An Artist's Point of View,"" which opened at the Arizona Latino Arts & Cultural Center in Phoenix the weekend before the law took effect on July 29. The show will move to galleries throughout Arizona and across the country in an effort to educate the public on how artists from the state that has become ground zero in the immigration debate perceive the matter, said the show's organizer. ""This educational exhibit was born from the thought that there has to be a different way of reaching people's hearts on this issue,"" said Annie Loyd, founder and CEO of The FUSION Foundation, which organized the exhibit in collaboration with the cultural center. ""This show is not a protest show,"" she said. ""This was truly meant to be something that evokes people's emotions, that allows you to work your way into the art and really consider what's going on."" The show took shape quickly after its conceptualization in a marketing meeting in early June. A call to artists in Arizona for contributions was quickly met with more submissions than the show could hold, prompting its organizers to rotate pieces each time the show moves to a new space. In their works, the artists bring their personal history and experiences with immigration in Arizona -- a divisive issue in the border state long before SB1070 brought it under the national microscope. ""My mother was undocumented, my father born in Texas, and she feared immigration all her life, even after she became a citizen,"" said Martin Moreno, whose painting, Born in the USA, depicts the wake of a son of a Mexican-born wife and American husband. ""She never went back to Mexico, and that same scenario has played over thousands of times. Even today, my son is in the same situation. He is a citizen and my daughter-in-law is undocumented. History repeats itself,"" he said. Moreno describes his piece as ""a portrait of a family sharing two cultures,"" with the father in his National Guardsman uniform, and the mother in traditional Mexican garb, lighting a candle of the Virgin of Guadalupe. ""The piece tries to address that many couples have a foot in two worlds,"" he said, ""and that hasn't changed in my lifetime.""","Artwork in ""SB1070: An Artist's Point of View"" uses skeletons, flags to express views on law .

"(CNN) -- A sailor has described her ""miraculous"" escape after a whale leapt out of the water and crash-landed on the deck of her boat off the coast of South Africa. Paloma Werner, 50, of the Cape Town Sailing Academy, and her partner Ralph Mothes had been watching the whale from a distance in Table Bay, near Cape Town harbor, when it moved toward their 10-meter vessel and breached 20 meters away. Southern right whales are a common sight in Cape Town waters during the breeding season from June to November, drawing whale watchers to the region. Werner said the couple -- both experienced sailors -- expected the creature to go under the boat before re-emerging on the other side. ""I looked around and I saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat,"" Werner told CNN. ""The whale slipped back into the water but we just saw the mast with all its rigging and everything flying towards us, and that was scary, actually."" Werner said Mothes ducked behind the steering wheel which bore the impact of the mast. And while the masts need replacing, Werner said the steel structure of the boat was undamaged. ""Miraculously nothing happened to us,"" she added. A tourist on a nearby boat captured the moment when the whale breached out of the water on camera. Werner said she had spoken to a local marine mammal expert who had told her that the incident was a ""freak accident."" Because the couple had been sailing without the engine on, the whale had failed to hear them, she said. ""It was a young southern right whale and he was just having fun. They have very poor eyesight and obviously if they're breaching visibility is very poor. The whale did not intend to attack us, it just did not hear us."" Whale experts have taken DNA samples from blubber left on the deck to see whether they have any existing records on the animal. Werner said the whale appeared to be unhurt by the experience: ""We saw it afterwards and there was no blood or anything. I think for a whale it was just a scratch and a bump."" In future, the couple would make sure they had the engine on while sailing during whale season, she added. ""We were just going out sailing because it was an awesome day. Obviously it's a bonus if you see a whale but we didn't quite count on having one on top of the boat.""","Southern right whale lands on sailing boat in ""freak accident""

"(CNN) -- A Swedish political party dedicated to copyright reform and privacy rights says it has agreed to host several new servers for the whistle-blower website WikiLeaks. The Pirate Party said Tuesday it agreed to host the servers during a visit last weekend by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. ""The contribution of WikiLeaks is tremendously important to the entire world,"" Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge said in a statement on the group's site. ""We desire to contribute to any effort that increases transparency and accountability of power in the world."" By hosting WikiLeaks information on the party's computer servers, WikiLeaks information will be available to more web users. The party said it will host the information free of charge as part of its political mission. Assange welcomed the decision in a statement on the party's site. ""Our organizations share many values, and I am looking forward to future ways we can help each other improve the world,"" he said. ""We see more opportunities down the road in cooperating with the Pirate Party."" The Pirate Party is pushing for representation in the Swedish and European parliaments on a three-point platform that includes reform of copyright law, to make all non-commercial use of copyrighted material free and to limit the terms of current copyrights; getting rid of the patent system; and tightening privacy rules. WikiLeaks sparked controversy last month by posting some 76,000 pages of U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan, in what was called the biggest leak since the Pentagon Papers about the Vietnam War. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates criticized the leak, saying it would have a significant negative impact on troops and allies, revealing techniques and procedures. Assange has defended the leak by saying it can help shape the public's understanding of the war. He said the material was of no operational significance and that WikiLeaks tried to ensure the material did not put innocent people at risk.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea crushed Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa 7-1 on Saturday to keep the pressure on English Premier League leaders Manchester United ahead of next weekend's showdown between the two top teams. The London club briefly returned to the top of the table before champions United won 4-0 at Bolton in the late match to restore their one-point advantage. With the title race set to go to the wire, Chelsea will take a two-goal for-and-against differential over United to Old Trafford on Saturday after thrashing Villa at home to follow up the midweek 5-0 romp at Portsmouth. Frank Lampard fired four goals, two of them from the penalty spot, to become Chelsea's third-highest scorer on the club's all-time list with 151. Norway striker John Carew canceled out Lampard's 15th-minute opener for his ninth goal in eight games, but Chelsea led 2-1 at halftime with the England midfielder's first spot-kick just before the break. France winger Florent Malouda, who set up the opener, scored the first of his two goals 12 minutes after the interval to open the floodgates, with four more coming in the final half-hour as Lampard took his season tally to 21 in all competitions. The result was even more remarkable given that Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti opted to rest 30-goal striker Didier Drogba, while John Terry broke the club record with his 325th outing as captain. It ended Villa's 10-match unbeaten run, leaving the visitors seven points adrift of Tottenham in the battle for the fourth Champions League place. Manchester United, by comparison, cruised past a struggling Bolton team thanks to a fortunate own-goal from JLloyd Samuel and a second-half double from Dimitar Berbatov. United's top scorer Wayne Rooney and England captain Rio Ferdinand were rested due to minor injuries ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarterfinal against Bayern Munich. Defender Samuel inexplicably slotted Ryan Giggs' low cross past his goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in the 38th minute as United profited from a record 11th own-goal this season -- the club's second highest scorer. Veteran keeper Edwin van Der Sar preserved the lead with a flying save from Fabrice Muamba, but the Dutchman was lucky to avoid an embarrassing moment when the home side took a quick corner while he was well out of his goal arguing with the referee. Berbatov, playing on his own up front, made it 2-0 in the 68th minute when he was first to react after Jaaskelainen could only parry Darren Fletcher's shot, then the Bulgarian sealed victory 10 minutes later with a slick finish from Nani's low cross. Portugal winger Nani, who signed a new contract during the week, then set up young substitute midfielder Darren Gibson on 82. Third-placed Arsenal's title hopes were dented after conceding a late equalizer at Birmingham. France midfielder Samir Nasri put the Londoners ahead with a low drive in the 81st minute, but veteran substitute Kevin Phillips netted a fortunate leveler in injury-time as Bacary Sagna's attempted clearance hit him and rebounded into the net past goalkeeper Manuel Almunia. The draw left Arsenal four points behind United with six matches to play ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal against holders Barcelona, while ninth-placed Birmingham are unbeaten at home since last September. Tottenham consolidated fourth place with a 2-0 victory at bottom side Portsmouth as England striker Peter Crouch and Croatia midfielder Niko Kranjcar scored in the first half against their former club. Portsmouth suffered injuries to defender Hermann Hreidarsson, striker Danny Webber and veteran goalkeeper David James ahead of next month's FA Cup semifinal between the two teams. Fifth-placed Manchester City will seek to close the deficit on Spurs to two points again with victory at home to Wigan on Monday, while Liverpool will look to keep their slim top-four hopes alive with a win over Sunderland on Sunday. Everton remained in eighth place with a 0-0 draw at Wolverhampton, who are now five points clear of the relegation zone. Stoke moved up to 10th with a 1-0 win at West Ham, who were left hovering above the drop zone on goal difference. Hull joined West Ham on 27 points with a 2-0 victory against Fulham, who dropped to 11th.","Chelsea crush Aston Villa 7-1 to stay a point behind English leaders Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- The husband of a Texas woman missing since March has a ""completely watertight alibi"" on the day his estranged wife disappeared, his lawyer said Wednesday. Julie Ann Gonzalez was last seen March 26 by her estranged husband, George De La Cruz, and Austin police said this week that they consider De La Cruz a ""person of interest"" in the disappearance. But the husband's lawyer told HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that the documents are between three and nine months old. ""If anyone would look at the timeline of the day that Julie Ann disappeared and the timeline my client has provided from morning till night, it is physically impossible that he had anything to do with her disappearance,"" the attorney, Patrick Fagerberg, said. ""It is a completely watertight alibi everywhere he was."" Gonzalez, 21, was last seen March 26 when she came to pick up the couple's 2-year-old daughter. De La Cruz has said his wife appeared ""out of it"" when she came to the house, changed her mind about picking up their daughter and said she would come back later. The couple was going through a divorce, and Gonzalez had told a friend about a new man in her life whom she said was taking her away for the weekend, her mother, Sandra Soto, said in May. But she said Gonzalez's MySpace page was updated by a mobile phone user after her disappearance to add posts that read ""I wanted to run away"" and ""I'm sick of the BS in my life."" Her car, which was almost brand new, was found abandoned outside a Walgreen's drug store. Gonzalez worked as a pharmacy technician at another Walgreen's. And Gonzalez has not accessed her bank account since her disappearance, but someone used her credit card to purchase the movie ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" at a store in Austin, her mother said. Fagerberg said De La Cruz was the one who purchased the movie. He said he spent three hours with detectives Tuesday, ""going over the warrants and giving the logical, innocent explanation for some things in those warrants which may appear incriminating on the surface."" But he said that when all the facts emerge, ""You will see that there was an innocent explanation for everything that happened that day,"" he said.","Julie Ann Gonzalez has been missing since March 26 .

"(CNN)  -- Colombian military forces killed 18 leftist guerrillas Friday in two operations, the National Defense Ministry said. Another 13 members of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) were captured and two more were ""demobilized"" in the attacks by the air force and special forces troops, which took place in a rural area of Vista Hermosa in the central department, or administrative district, of Meta. There, air force jets bombarded encampments capable of housing 200 people and belonging to Gang 43 of FARC, the ministry said in a posting on its Web site. After the bombing, special forces troops surrounded the camp and began fighting with the FARC forces. They found 25 rifles, explosives and ""information of interest to military intelligence,"" the posting said. Friday's actions are part of an offensive against FARC in Meta and the southern department of Caqueta to find those people responsible for the death of Gov. Luis Francisco Cuellar, who was kidnapped and killed December 22 in Florence, Colombia, by FARC members, the posting said. ""The successes confirm that, in spite of cowardly and sporadic terrorist acts of this organization, the state continues landing serious blows and dismantling what remains of the terrorist structure,"" Defense Minister Gabriel Silva said. On Wednesday, the army seized 1¾ tons of cocaine in Puerto Escondido in the department of Cordoba, it said. During 2009, the Ministry of Defense reported capturing more than 200 tons of cocaine worth $5 billion. For its part, the national army reported in its annual report that during 2009 it was involved in 1,200 fights that ""permitted the neutralization of 1,348 terrorist actions and the occupation and destruction of 1,172 encampments, many of which were used as laboratories to process cocaine. FARC has been at war with the Colombian government for more than 40 years. Although the government says the FARC's military force has been severely compromised in recent months, authorities still accuse it of trafficking huge quantities of cocaine to finance its insurgency. Security analysts say FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas. The guerrilla group was established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party. The guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, according to the Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program.","Colombian military: 18 leftist guerrillas killed in two operations .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a good week for the White House. President Obama would celebrate the passage of Wall Street reform, and Democrats would move toward the midterms with some wind at their backs. But on a day the president signed the landmark legislation, the narrative from the White House was more contrite than laudatory. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs apologized on behalf of the administration for what former Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod had been through this week and that, to his knowledge, no one from the White House ordered her ouster. Questions about Sherrod dominated the media briefings in a week the administration hoped would be focused on the most sweeping overhaul of the financial system since the New Deal. Sherrod was forced to resign because of a misleading video of a speech she delivered at an NAACP event. Conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart posted a portion of an address she gave in which she spoke of not offering her full support to a white farmer. However, it was later determined that her speech, unedited, focused on how the incident changed her outlook and made her realize people should move beyond race. The NAACP retracted its original condemnation of Sherrod's remarks and issued a statement saying it was ""snookered by Fox News"" and Breitbart. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack apologized to Sherrod and offered her a new job. ""This is a good woman. She has been put through hell,"" Vilsack said. ""I want to renew the commitment of this department to a new era in civil rights. I want to close the chapter on a very difficult period in civil rights."" Sam Fulwood III, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said he thinks the administration's initial reaction was spawned out of fear over how the right-wing media would cover the incident. He said administration officials ""allowed themselves to be bullied into doing something without thinking about it."" ""The White House, the administration, the Agriculture Department, whomever ... allowed themselves to be bullied into doing something without thinking about it,"" said Fulwood. Instead of summoning Sherrod, reviewing the speech and asking what happened, the administration failed to knock down the lies and disseminate the truth, he said. ""If they had done this in Ms. Sherrod's case, they would be looking pretty. They would have done great legislative work, and they would have scored a PR coup. As it turns out, the legislative works gets obscured,"" and they are taking a PR-hit, Fulwood said. Fulwood said that Obama's problems stem from opinions being traded as though they are facts. Throughout Obama's time in office, the administration has done a weak job of quashing rumors, such as claims Obama was born in Indonesia, studied at a madrasa and has a forged birth certificate, he said. ""I think if he is able to articulate an honest reaction to these nonsensical stories, they'll be exposed for what they are -- nothing. And that's exactly what the case was with Shirley Sherrod,"" Fulwood added. Obama spoke to Sherrod by phone Thursday and expressed his regret about what transpired this week. He further said this misfortune ""can present an opportunity for her to continue her hard work on behalf of those in need, and he hopes that she will do so,"" according to a White House statement. The call came exactly a year after Obama made a surprise appearance at a media briefing to discuss the controversial arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. The president, Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, later met for a ""beer summit"" to discuss the event that sparked a nationwide debate about racial profiling. The Congressional Black Caucus this week said it's time for a national dialogue on race. Gibbs called the incident ""one of those teachable moments"" and said that while he was unaware of plans for a broader discussion, he wouldn't rule it out. John Quelch, professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, said that though the administration should have avoided this situation in the first place, the damage control has been rapid and effective. As for a national discussion on race, Quelch said it's not an issue the administration is interested in addressing in a high-profile manner right now. But, he said, the White House now must balance ""the need to cope with emergency distractions versus the desire to stay on course with the longer-term agenda."" ""Obviously the objective is to remove this unscheduled story from media coverage in order to highlight the landmark financial reform legislation,"" he said. By Friday afternoon, Obama was trying to get back on message before the weekend. In an event added to the president's schedule Friday morning, he tried to remind Americans what had been overshadowed during the week. ""So, taken together, we made enormous progress this week on Wall Street reform, on making sure that we're eliminating waste and abuse in government and in providing immediate assistance to people who are out there looking for work.""","Discussion about Shirley Sherrod dominates White House news briefings this week .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Berlin Wall came down 20 years ago and in that time the world game has opened its arms to a tidal wave of talent from behind the former Iron Curtain. Czech Republic midfielder Pavel Nedved has spent almost 15 years at the top of European football. Here, Football Fanzone picks the 11 finest footballers to emerge from the old Eastern Bloc since 1989. Let us know what you think of our selection in the Sound Off box below. 1 Pavel Nedved (Czech Republic) Nedved, who has announced his retirement at the end of the season, has become Mr. Czech Republic in the eyes of football fans of the last 20 years. And this is for a country not short on talented players -- Vladimir Smicer, Karel Poborsky, Jan Koller and Tomas Rosicky to name but four. His breakthrough came at Euro 96, after which he signed for Lazio; four years later he was nothing short of inspirational for the Czechs at Euro 2000. When Zinedine Zidane left Juventus for Real Madrid in 2001, the Old Lady paid a staggering $54M for Nedved. It proved to be an inspired move: The midfielder, with his flowing hair, thunderbolt shot and all-action style, proved an able replacement. Now 36, he is one of Europe's finest players of the last 20 years. 2 Gheorghe Hagi (Romania) Romania's most famous footballer, Hagi was known as the ""Maradona of the Carpathians"" during a 16-year international career. Blessed with a left foot from the gods, the audacious midfielder could dance past opponents at will and he would shoot from anywhere -- witness his goal at World Cup 1994 against Colombia, a swirling, dipping strike from 40 yards. At club level, Hagi played for both Real Madrid and Barcelona and is still idolized in Turkey for his achievements with Galatasaray from 1996 until his retirement in 2001. Hagi, who was a member of Pele's 125 top living footballers, holds the record for most goals for his country. 3 Andriy Shevchenko (Ukraine) Shevchenko might now be considered one of the game's great goal scorers, but things might have been very different had he not been evacuated with his family in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. After starring for Dynamo Kiev alongside Sergiy Rebrov -- and scoring a hat-trick in the Nou Camp against Barcelona in the Champions League -- Shevchenko earned a move to AC Milan in 1999. At the San Siro, Shevchenko scored at will, so it was a big surprise that he flopped so badly after an eye-watering $43M move to Chelsea in 2006. A return to Milan has not revived his career, but 127 goals in 208 games from 1999-06 ensures his legacy is intact. Have we missed one of your favorites out? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. 4 Matthias Sammer (Germany) Elegance personified, Sammer's career high point came at 1996 in a Germany side that would go on to lift the European Championship trophy. Sammer could play in midfield or as a ""libero"" and it was in the latter role that he underscored just how good he was. Time after time, Sammer brought the ball out of defense, echoing Franz Beckenbauer's peerless ability to start attacks from the back. He was named European Footballer of the Year in 1996. One of the first notable East German players to join a Western club after German reunification, Sammer signed for Stuttgart from Dynamo Dresden in 1990. He went on to play for Inter Milan before returning to help Borussia Dortmund win the 1997 Champions League. 5 Hristo Stoichkov (Bulgaria) Stoichkov was an explosive left-sided attacker and remains the finest player to emerge from Bulgaria, Berbatov included. ""The Raging Bull"" was not just explosive for his speed off the mark and trademark free-kicks; he also had a short fuse and wore his heart on his sleeve. While playing for Barcelona, he was given a two-month ban for stomping on a referee's foot, and his rows with coaches, including Johan Cruyff, were legendary. But these only added to his reputation as a fan's favorite at the nine clubs he played for in a 21-year career. His six goals at the 1994 World Cup gave him a share of the golden boot, and the European Footballer of the Year accolade followed later that year. 6 Michael Ballack (Germany) No one swans around the pitch better than Ballack, who, at 32, is still Germany's star player. Having impressed at Bayer Leverkusen during their brilliant but ultimately fruitless 2001-02 season, Bayern Munich swooped. By that time, Ballack had become the key man for the national side for his ability to control play from the middle of the park and score goals. He did the same for Bayern until 2006 when Chelsea signed him on a free transfer. Ballack has never replicated his international form in West London, but he has been confirmed as Germany captain for the 2010 World Cup. 7 Petr Cech (Czech Republic) In Cech, the Czech Republic can lay claim to the world's best goalkeeper. Tall and commanding yet alert and agile, his glaring mistake at last summer's European Championships, which resulted in Turkey's progressing at the Czechs' expense, was a rare blip in his short trophy-laden career. Rennes spotted him playing for Sparta Prague while he was still a teenager in 2002 and two years later moneybags Chelsea spent $10M on him -- a fee that now looks like a bargain. After helping Chelsea to back-to-back Premier League titles, Cech fractured his skull in 2006, but he has returned -- headgear and all -- just as good. Only 26, his best years are ahead of him. 8 Dimitar Berbatov (Bulgaria) Berbatov was always one of Europe's semi-hidden gems while he was plying his trade for Bayer Leverkusen. After scoring a goal every other game for CSKA Sofia in his homeland, Berbatov made the move to Germany until Tottenham Hotspur signed him in 2006. His touch, vision, movement, skill, strength and goal scoring prowess made it seem likely he would move on to a more successful club. And so it proved when Manchester United paid $44M in 2008. The languid Berbatov has yet to set Old Trafford alight but 41 goals in 67 appearances for Bulgaria speaks volumes for his class. 9 Alexander Hleb (Belarus) Is there a more delicate player in world football? Such a wonderful talent, but one capable of driving fans and doubtless teammates to distraction at times. Hleb's assets are also his weaknesses -- a deft touch, two feet, dribbling ability, an elusive style and a keen eye for a pass, especially the killer one. But on an off day, he can be frustratingly ineffective. Given he is now at Barcelona, though, it's fair to say the Belarusian forward has talent. He showed it plenty of times for Arsenal, although he didn't find the net as often as he should have. Tall and wiry, Hleb came to the fore as Stuttgart's creative force before the Gunners paid $15M for him in 2005. 10 Andrey Arshavin (Russia) Like Berbatov, Arshavin has been a late bloomer. Arshavin was little known outside Russia in his early days but he shot to prominence in 2007-08, when he was the inspiration behind Zenit St Petersburg's UEFA Cup triumph. Arshavin then demonstrated his wonderful dribbling and playmaking abilities at Euro 2008 for a Russian side beaten only by eventual winners Spain. The pint-sized Arshavin had been linked with moves to Europe's biggest clubs for a while but it was Arsenal who made the deal happen -- after much wrangling -- in 2009. 11 Adrian Mutu (Romania) Unfortunately for Mutu, his career will forever be tarnished by his dismissal by Chelsea for testing positive for cocaine in 2004 and his subsequent ban from the game. Up to that point, he was a star on the ascent. Prolific for Dinamo Bucharest, Mutu was snapped up by Internazionale in 2000, but it took moves to Verona and then Parma for him to begin to shine. Skillful and tricky, Mutu's move to Chelsea in 2003 looked like a perfect move for both parties and after a difficult first season the striker was beginning to justify his $21.5M fee. Then came the failed drug test. Subsequent moves to Juventus and Fiorentina, where he has scored freely, have helped his career recover.","All 11 players come from former Eastern Bloc countries from the last 20 years .

"GLASGOW, Scotland -- Ronaldinho scored twice as Barcelona wrapped up their Scottish pre-season tour with a convincing 3-1 win over Hearts before a record 57,857 home crowd on Saturday. Two-goal Ronaldinho played a key part in Barcelona's convincing 3-1 win. The Brazilian put Barca ahead with a 21st-minute penalty and restored their lead with a 40th-minute header after Finn Juho Makela had stabbed in a quick equalizer from Christophe Berra's header across goal. Second-half substitute Thierry Henry, who scored in Barcelona's 1-0 win over Dundee United on Thursday, set up the third six minutes after the interval for Mexican teenager Giovanni Dos Santos. The Frenchman ended a fine run by squaring a pass to the 18-year-old who slotted home from close range. The friendly was played at Murrayfield, home of the Scotland rugby union team, to accommodate a bigger crowd. The previous record for a Hearts home match was 53,396 for a Scottish FA Cup match against Rangers in 1932. Arsenal were 2-1 winners over Paris St Germain and Valencia beat Inter Milan 2-0 on the first day of the pre-season Emirates Cup tournament. Both games were played at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium where the friendly tournament ends on Sunday with Arsenal playing Inter and Valencia facing PSG. Valencia recorded a comfortable win over the Italian champions. Jaime Gavilan opened the scoring, collecting a long ball forward and beating Inter keeper Francesco Toldo from a tight angle. Striker David Villa made it 2-0 before the break with a deflected free kick. Arsenal's French midfielder Mathieu Flamini put the hosts ahead on the stroke of half-time in the day's second game, with his first-time shot flashing in off the post. Danish forward Nicklas Bendtner poked home their second in a goalmouth melee in the 70th minute and Peguy Luyindula scored PSG's consolation goal 10 minutes from time before Bendtner missed a late penalty. Rangers beat Chelsea 2-0 with both goals coming in the last four minutes of their pre-season friendly at Ibrox. Spanish substitute striker Nacho Novo fired home the opening goal with a 20-meter shot, after taking a neat pass from Chris Burke in the 86th minute. Three minutes later Slovakian striker Filip Sebo cracked home another goal from 20 meters out. The ball appeared to be flying wide until it took a deflection off a defender and went into the net. The match was played in a competitive spirit with several tough tackles flying in from the two sides who finished runners-up in their respective Scottish Premier and English Premier leagues last season. Chelsea's best chance came with a first half header from Didier Drogba which flashed across the face of the goal. Darren Bent's double and a goal by Dimitar Berbatov enabled Tottenham Hotspur to end their South African tour with a 3-0 win over Orlando Pirates on Saturday. All the goals came in the first 22 minutes, with Bent opening the scoring in the 10th with a stinging shot before providing a simple tap-in for strike partner Berbatov eight minutes later, after dispossessing Pirates defender Destin Makita. Bent then hit the bar before finding the net again following a fine flowing move at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium. Tottenham won the three-team tournament having beaten the Pirates 2-1 in Cape Town on Tuesday after starting their tour last weekend with a 2-1 win over Kaizer Chiefs in Durban.

"LONDON, England -- Younes Kaboul scored in injury time to earn Tottenham a remarkable 4-4 Premier League home draw with Aston Villa, sealing a remarkable fightback after trailing 4-1 and possibly saving manager Martin Jol from the sack. Tottenham players celebrate Dimitar Berbatov's opening goal in an amazing match at White Hart Lane. Dimitar Berbatov opened the scoring for Spurs but two goals from Martin Laursen edged the visitors ahead and Gabriel Agbonlahor and Craig Gardner added to the lead. However, Pascal Chimbonda and Robbie Keane pulled goals back and deep into added time Kaboul found the top corner to level the scores. Jol appeared a man on the brink after Tottenham fell 4-1 behind but his side dug deep to earn a point on the evening of their 125th anniversary celebrations -- although they remain third bottom of the table. Bulgarian striker Berbatov put Spurs ahead in the 20th minute, powerfully heading home from Tom Huddlestone's corner. But Villa hit back immediately when England goalkeeper Paul Robinson dropped Gareth Barry's corner, allowing Laursen to prod home after a ricochet off Pascal Chimbonda. Laursen got his second of the game in the 33rd minute when Barry's free-kick on the left was met by Zat Knight -- and the ball struck the Danish defender before finding the net. Agbonlahor made it 3-1 five minutes from half-time when he won the ball off Michael Dawson after a Luke Moore flick-on, twisted into the penalty area and finished neatly, low into the far corner of Robinson's net. Tottenham's hopes looked forlorn early in the second half when Gardner powered home a free-kick off the post but the hosts quickly pulled one back when Jermain Defoe hit the post from Gareth Bale's cross and Chimbonda followed up. With eight minutes remaining Marlon Harewood fouled Darren Bent in the area and Keane fired home the spot-kick. That set up an exciting finish and Tottenham's relentless pressure finally paid dividends when Kaboul slammed home in stoppage time after Villa failed to clear a corner.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United and Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov has announced his retirement from international football with immediate effect. The 29-year-old was captain of his country and scored a national record 48 goals in just 74 matches. However, Bulgaria flopped in their World Cup qualifying group -- failing to reach the finals in South Africa -- and the former Tottenham's star's performances drew widespread criticism from within his own country. Confirming his decision at a press conference in Sofia, Berbatov said: ""It isn't a decision I took lightly and I have reconsidered making it several times. ""Everything has a beginning and an end and that end is today. I feel exhausted and now there are many guys who can emerge from my shadow. For them the moment has come."" Berbatov, who overtook Hristo Stoichkov's scoring record in a friendly match against Malta last year, has endured a troubled season at Manchester United. He has struggled to make an impact since his big-money move from Tottenham in August 2008 and was overshadowed by strike partner Wayne Rooney as United failed to retain their English Premier League title.","Bulgaria captain Dimitar Berbatov announces his retirement from international football .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian authorities stopped two people suspected in the theft of a painting by Vincent Van Gogh, nabbing them just moments before they were to board a plane and flee the country, according to Egypt's official news agency, MENA. Egyptian Culture Minister Farouq Hosni said in a statement Saturday night that efforts to recover the stolen ""Poppy Flowers"" painting are still ongoing, despite earlier reports that the painting had been returned to Cairo's Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum. Hosni said later that those reports were unconfirmed. Two Italians -- a man and a woman -- suspected of stealing the painting were preparing to board a plane to Italy when they were stopped at Cairo International Airport. An interior ministry spokesman told CNN that the man was arrested. The painting was stolen earlier Saturday. ""Poppy Flowers"" has an estimated value of about $50 million. It also had been stolen in 1978 and returned under unknown circumstances, causing some to think that the piece was copied in the process, according to MENA.

"New Orleans (CNN) -- A control unit on the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid before the explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history, a BP official testified Tuesday. Ronald Sepulvado, one of BP's well site leaders -- ""company men,"" in rig jargon -- told the Coast Guard-Interior Department board investigating the drill platform's sinking that there were ""off and on"" problems with valves that directed hydraulic fluid inside the mechanism. He said he reported the problem to his superiors, but the rig continued to operate despite the problem. Federal regulations require that drilling work halt if a control ""pod"" is inoperable. Sepulvado said the unit was still functional, but his team leader should have reported the issue to the Minerals Management Service, the recently reorganized Interior Department agency that regulated offshore drilling. ""I guess we assumed that everything was OK, since I reported it to the team leader and he should have reported it to the MMS,"" Sepulvado said. His team leader, BP executive John Guide, is scheduled to testify before the investigative board Thursday. Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer failed to shut down the runaway well at the heart of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill after the April 20 explosion aboard the rig. The resulting fire sank the platform, leaving 11 workers dead and releasing an undersea gusher that engineers were unable to contain until last week. Sepulvado and Donald Vidrine were the two ""company men"" who worked aboard the rig, but Sepulvado was ashore at the time of the blast for additional training on blowout preventers. He was replaced on the rig by Robert Kaluza, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination Tuesday when called to testify. Vidrine has been excused from testifying for medical reasons, the company said Monday night. The board released a list of more than 20 reported anomalies with the well in the 18 hours before the explosion, ranging from low pressure readings and larger-than-expected returns of ""mud,"" the drilling fluid used as a counterweight and lubricant aboard the rig. Both Vidrine and Kaluza were involved in discussions about the anomalous pressure readings in the hours before the explosion, the according to the list. BP, rig owner Transocean and well cementing contractor Halliburton all blamed each other for the disaster. Previous hearings have included testimony about maintenance backlogs aboard the rig and disputes between BP and Transocean managers about procedures as they prepared to shut in the well, which was already behind schedule. Ross Skidmore, a subsea supervisor for BP contractor Swift, testified Tuesday he questioned why BP was waiting to install a ""lockdown sleeve"" -- a fitting placed atop the well to secure the casing -- after drilling fluid was replaced with seawater for pressure tests. ""I asked why couldn't we go ahead and do this in mud,"" he said. In response, Skidmore said he was told ""It wasn't going to happen. We were going to go through the sequence we were given."" Skidmore said he's ""selective"" about questioning his orders. But he added, ""If I would have seen something and recognized it as being unsafe or a threat, I would have taken it all the way into town."" This week's hearings come as scientists continue testing pressure in BP's ruptured deepwater well and weighing options for permanently sealing it. Even as lawyers and witnesses resist some questions before the panel, the hearings are providing dramatic details of what happened on the rig, and could form the basis for criminal charges down the line. A sworn statement from Deepwater Horizon Chief Engineer Steven Bertone sparked particularly heated debate Monday. In it, Bertone described the rig's captain screaming at a crew member who issued a distress call and ordering an injured man left behind. Lawyers repeatedly attempted to ask Bertone about the document, which has not been publicly released. But his lawyer, Steven London, said the statement was made while his client was ""detained"" aboard a rescue ship and told Bertone not to answer questions about it. ""This statement was obtained from him while he was held 26 hours right immediately after this incident, which was extremely traumatic to say the least,"" London said. ""It is what it is. We're not going to be cross-examined on something that occurred, that was written down at that time."" An attorney for rig captain Curt Kutcha criticized lawyers for introducing the statement. It was ""an attempt to assassinate his character in one aspect of what's being done where all their lives were at risk,"" attorney Kyle Schonekas said. But BP lawyer Richard Godfrey seized on the statement, saying it showed ""a complete loss of command and control aboard the bridge"" after the explosions. Bertone also testified Monday that the rig's bridge crew was unsure who had the authority to activate the rig's emergency disconnection from the well. When it was activated, it failed to work despite indications on the control panel that it had been activated, he said.

"New York (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors said the defendants had a ""hatred and thirst for violence,"" while defense attorneys argued that an FBI informant was the real culprit as opening arguments got underway Tuesday in the trial of four men accused in an alleged bomb plot. Prosecutors say the men plotted to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in May 2009 and also sought to fire missiles at planes at an Air National Guard base. James Cromitie, David Williams, Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen were arrested on May 20, 2009, allegedly after having placed what they thought were bombs at two sites and before making their way to Stewart Airport in Newburgh, New York. But no bombs went off that night. The men were part of a year-long sting operation led by a paid FBI informant. The bombs and missiles were not, in fact, armed, but were rather part of the FBI's masquerade. And defense attorneys are calling the situation entrapment. Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Hickey painted a picture in court of the defendants -- specifically, James Cromitie -- as having a ""hatred and thirst for violence."" He described the four men as having cased and photographed targets, planned their escape, and talked about public reaction. All the while, a fifth man in their group, a man they knew to be ""Maksud"" and from whom they were receiving all their funding, was actually an FBI informant who had been taping their conversations and meeting with the FBI. Hickey described the informant, whose real name is Shaheed Hussein, as having been hired by the FBI to go to a certain mosque and listen for talk of violence against Americans. According to Hickey, Cromitie and Hussein met several times over a period of months, during which time Hussein convinced Cromitie that he was a representative of the Jaish a-Mohammed, a bogus international terrorism ring he said was based in Pakistan and was looking for recruits. Hickey further charged that Cromitie expressed his desire to ""kill Jews"" and make America ""pay for Afghanistan and other Muslim countries,"" recruiting Williams and Williams -- who are not related -- along with Payen to be part of the mission to target Jewish institutions and military operations in the United States. But defense attorneys argued that it was Hussein, not the four defendants, who planned, funded, and directed the entire operation, seducing the poverty-stricken defendants with food, gifts, and promises of a significant payday. The defense painted a picture of Hussein as a convicted felon who began working for the FBI as part of a plea bargain that kept him from jail and deportation, and paid him $100,000. Defense attorneys alleged that Hussein pressured the four men, whom, they said, he saw as his meal ticket, to agree to be a part of the mission, promising large sums of money and expensive cars and not taking no for an answer. They further alleged entrapment, as the defendants did not have violent pasts and ""could not and would not have been involved in such a conspiracy without Shaheed Hussein."" Vincent L. Briccetti, attorney for Cromitie, called the 100 hours of videotaped conversations between the men ""not a documentary but a work of fiction... a movie produced, directed, starred in, and edited by Shaheed Hussein and the FBI."" Suzanne Brody, attorney for Onta Williams, suggested the FBI was more interested in instigating and initiating, rather than investigating. The trial will resume Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan at 9:30 a.m. ET .","Four men are on trial in New York in an alleged bomb plot .

"(CNN) -- The declining dollar, surging oil prices, and exploding growth across the Persian Gulf are causing inflation levels to rise. Kuwait has already abandoned the dollar. And some analysts say the rest of the GCC may have to do the same to fight inflation. But do the Gulf banks agree? And how far do they think switching to a basket of currencies will bring down prices? Qatar and the U.A.E. registered the highest inflation levels at 10 percent this week. In Oman, inflation was running at almost 4 per cent and 2.8 percent in Saudi Arabia. Strong growth across the region, fueled by surges in oil prices have been a major factor. Supply has been struggling to keep up with demand in the growing economy, causing bottlenecks in supply which drives inflation. Ahmed El Shall, CFO of Dubai Bank said the building boom in the U.A.E. is another ""primary cause"" of inflation. Rents are on the rise, causing other prices to climb. ""If you consider that 36 percent of the inflation measure is made up of housing, you realize the inflation rate for the U.A.E. is 10 percent and above simply because rents have been increasing above 10 percent per annum,"" he told CNN. But the other factor at play has been imported inflation via a weak U.S. dollar. Last week, in response to the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.5 point to 4.75 percent in order to save the nation's economy from a slow down. Because currencies in the Gulf Co-operation Council region including Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Qatar, Bahrain and Oman are pegged to the dollar, their exchange rates also decline. This means prices of imports from non-dollar areas have increased, causing inflation. With currencies pegged to the dollar, banks in the region must also follow the Fed's lead with their interest rates. This is another driver for inflation because lower rates drive investment. But to soften the blow, U.A.E. and Qatar kept rate cuts to a minimum and Saudi Arabia and Oman decided not to budge at all. Rising prices are beginning to take their toll across the region. Dubai is now one of the most expensive cities in the world. Expats, with investments and bills to pay at home, are especially feeling the pinch of a weak exchange rate. As prices rise, the debate intensifies about whether countries in the GCC should review their dollar pegs and link instead to a basket of currencies. As analysts argue, when these countries first decided to peg to the dollar, oil prices were low and the U.S. currency strong. Today the opposite is true. Fitting to a basket, they say, would better reflect the GCC's modern economic situation. Kuwait was the first country in the GCC to jump ship. In May it ditched the dinar's peg and moved to a basket of currencies. But, as Shall told CNN, the Kuwait revaluation is yet to show an effect. ""My understanding is that so far it hasn't really shown any improvement in inflation. To the contrary, it suffers in the exact same way Qatar and the U.A.E. suffer."" Qatar's central bank governor, Abdullah Al-Thani, told reporters and bankers last month that they were taking measures to control prices and rents to decrease inflation. But the dollar peg would remain, he said. Saudi Arabia's refusal to cut interest rates with the Federal Reserve has prompted more speculation that it was preparing to break its dollar currency peg. But the Kingdom has continued to deny this. Saudi bank, SABB, also ""firmly"" believes the Saudi riyal will not be revalued. ""An expected change in the currency regime will take place only if the dollar weakens at an alarming rate and is sustained over the medium term,"" it said in a recent report. Excessive speculation about devaluation, ""could cause observers to overlook the GCC growth story,"" said the report. ""The Kingdom's competitive advantage, in petrochemical exports for example, is not being affected, as most are priced in dollars.""

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Prosecutors can play tapes of 911 calls made by Florida murder suspect Casey Anthony's mother after she learned her granddaughter was missing, a judge ruled Thursday. Anthony's mother, Cindy Anthony, admitted during a hearing Thursday in Orlando that she had made exaggerated accusations about her daughter in those calls in a bid to get police to her home. But Circuit Judge Belvin Perry ruled that Cindy Anthony was trying to use calls to police as a ""ploy"" to get her daughter to tell her what she knew about the missing 2-year-old Caylee Anthony. Defense lawyers sought to have thrown out of court as hearsay, but Perry found the tapes were not being used to prove the facts of the case. ""Whether they are true or false really has no bearing,"" Perry said. ""They were designed to elicit statements from the defendant in this case, to ascertain the whereabouts of the victim in this particular case."" Casey Anthony is charged with capital murder in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee's death. The girl was reported missing two years ago Thursday, and defense attorneys were trying to keep recordings of her mother Cindy's three 911 calls out of evidence. Facing her daughter in an Orlando courtroom, Cindy Anthony said she told police ""whatever I was thinking at the time to get them out there"" -- including the claim, made in her first of three 911 calls, that her daughter had stolen a car from her. ""I wanted to speak to a police officer,"" Cindy Anthony said. ""And I didn't think that if I said that she wouldn't take me to see my granddaughter, that they thought her and I might just be having an argument and think that I was some crazy grandmother and not come out and talk to me."" But she testified that she was in a panic after Casey Anthony told her that she hadn't seen her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, in a month. Cindy Anthony told police her daughter had stolen money from her and that she had asked Casey Anthony to return her car to her brother Lee, from whom she had purchased the Pontiac but never finished paying. She said she did not intend to mislead police with the calls, however. And by the third call, she told investigators that her daughter's vehicle smelled ""like there's been a dead body in the damn car."" And Lee Anthony testified Thursday that he tried to get more information out of his sister while their ""frantic"" mother yelled at her. ""She was very angry,"" he said. ""Her first reaction was she had a clenched fist and hit the bed my sister was sitting on and said, 'What did you do? We could have found her 31 days ago.' "" Caylee's skeletal remains were found in the woods about a quarter mile from the Anthony home in December 2008. Prosecutors say they plan to show Casey Anthony lied repeatedly about her daughter's fate, and that the 911 calls are a critical part of that progression. The Anthony family had not seen the toddler or her mother since June 16, 2008. When Cindy Anthony found her daughter a month later, Caylee wasn't with her. Cindy Anthony threatened to call the police, hoping it would force Casey Anthony to say where her daughter was. After two calls to the police, Casey Anthony admitted to her brother that she had not seen Caylee in 31 days and that she believed her daughter was with a nanny, Zenaida Gonzalez. The third and final call was placed immediately after Cindy Anthony overheard what Casey Anthony told her brother. Cindy Anthony seemed to be agitated and excited as she told the dispatcher that her granddaughter had been missing for a month. Cindy Anthony has since said that the odor emanating from the car could have been from rotting garbage. However, forensic examiners have concluded that Caylee's decomposing body was in the trunk of the car at some point in late June 2008. Thursday's hearing was also expected to focus on a motion from the defense. It will ask the judge to modify a ruling by Judge Stan Strickland, who stepped aside in April. The motion concerns a review of documents from Texas Equusearch, a private company that assisted in the search for then-missing Caylee. While Strickland's order allowed the defense attorneys to review thousands of documents created by Texas Equusearch, the attorneys were prohibited from taking notes during the review. The defense maintains the current arrangement is inefficient and it is seeking a more workable resolution.

"London, England (CNN) -- Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has expressed an interest in buying London's famed Abbey Road Studios after music company EMI reportedly put the building where the Beatles recorded most of their albums up for sale. Lloyd Webber, the man behind musical hits ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Cats,"" came forward following concerns from fans and music industry figures that the historic building would fall foul of property developers. ""He is very interested in buying the studios,"" a spokesman for Lloyd Webber, who is one of the UK music industry's richest figures with an estimated worth of £750 million ($1,150 million), told CNN. EMI has slapped a for sale tag on Abbey Road as it looks to dig itself out of heavy debts following the music company's 2007 leveraged buyout by private equity operation Terra Firma, according to the Financial Times. The news has generated concerns from music industry figures including former Beatle Paul McCartney, but Lloyd Webber is the first to indicate willingness to open his check book. His spokesman added: ""He first recorded there in 1967 with Tim Rice. Andrew has since recorded most of his musicals there, from 'Jesus Christ Superstar' to his new musical 'Love Never Dies.' ""He thinks it is vital that the studios are saved for the future of the music industry in the UK. Abbey Road has such great facilities, with three major recording studios, and Andrew has probably brought more musicians to record there than anyone else, because it has the capacity to record large orchestral productions."" Lloyd Webber's interest in the building follows an announcement from Britain's National Trust, a charity that safeguards many of the country's historic buildings, that it was considering whether involve itself. After opening up the issue to the public via the Internet, the charity, which already owns the childhood homes of Paul McCartney and fellow former Beatle John Lennon, received thousands of votes, plus Facebook and Twitter comments, urging it to act. ""If we can help, we will step forward,"" National Trust director general Fiona Reynolds said, according to its Web site. Abbey Road Studios, located in the wealthy north west London suburb of St. John's Wood, have been a centerpiece of the UK recording industry since they were established in the 1930s. Making its name with classical recordings involving composer Edward Elgar, the studios gained worldwide fame through the Beatles, who named one of their albums ""Abbey Road,"" featuring an iconic photo of the band crossing a road outside the building on its cover. With other bands -- including Pink Floyd, whose 1973 classic ""Dark Side of the Moon"" was recorded there, and Radiohead -- sustaining interest in the venue, it has become a Mecca for music fans who regularly daub tributes to their icons on its walls.","Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber says he is interested in buying studios .

"(CNN) -- While the horrors inflicted by the Nazis during World War II are well documented, ""Defiance"" director Edward Zwick wanted to make sure the stories of those who fought back aren't overlooked. Liev Schreiber, left, and Daniel Craig play freedom fighters in ""Defiance."" ""There is this misperception that the Jews only went willingly to the slaughter,"" Zwick said. ""And in fact, the new history and scholarship tells us that there was so much resistance. This is just one instance."" His new film, which goes into wide release Friday, tells the tale of the three Bielski brothers, who led a Jewish resistance group after escaping into the woods of Belarus in Eastern Europe. The movie stars Daniel Craig -- best known for his work as the latest James Bond -- Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell as the trio who took up arms against the Nazis and helped save the lives of more than 1,000 Jewish refugees fleeing occupied Poland. Portraying a slice of Jewish history was somewhat familiar territory for Craig, who plays brother Tuvia Bielski in the movie. He also co-starred as an Israeli agent in Steven Spielberg's ""Munich,"" the dramatization of the murder of 11 athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics. Craig said the characters' religion had nothing to do with his interest; both roles were just fascinating parts that attracted him. ""I think someone said, 'You did something similar to that in 'Munich,' "" he recalled. ""I said, well it's kind of not. It's a different period in history and I don't think religion is something that should hold me back.""  Watch Craig talk about the movie's power » . Schreiber, who is Jewish, said bringing the story of the heroic yet complex brothers to the big screen gave him ""a sense of pride"" and he found inspiration in their bravery. ""It was in these guys' DNA,"" said Schreiber, who plays Zus Bielski. ""But I also think that it is in our DNA as human beings ... that courage exists, that passion exists, that tenacity to love exists. It's just that we don't experience the kinds of tests nowadays that they did in the 1930s in Eastern Europe -- particularly if you were Jewish."" Filming in Lithuania just across the border from Belarus added an element of realism to the role, Schreiber said. ""We shot in the woods in the middle of winter, but I think as an actor you're always grateful of these little reminders of where you are and what you're doing, especially when you're doing something on film when it's so naturalistic,"" he said. ""When your hands are frozen and you can barely load a machine gun then you know you're on to something with the character."" Jamie Bell, best known for playing the title role in ""Billy Elliot,"" rounds out the cast as younger brother Asael Bielski. He said the bleak setting helped him understand ""the minutiae of what these people actually went through."" Bell had considered himself pretty knowledgeable about the Holocaust and World War II before learning about the project. ""But when I read the script I felt kind of embarrassed that I didn't know about the Bielski brothers and about the Jewish resistance across the board,"" he said. Heralding the triumph of the Bielski brothers to those who are unaware is just what director Zwick had in mind.

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- A 20-year-old Florida woman involved in a love triangle was found guilty Friday of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing her romantic rival in a fight 15 months ago. Rachel Wade convulsed in sobs as the bailiff read the six-person jury's verdict, which carries a sentence of 20 1/2 years to life in prison. She dabbed her eyes with a tissue, chewed on her lips and brushed her long blond hair away from her face, tucking it behind her ear. Then, accompanied by a guard, she stood and walked out of the courtroom, to be taken to Pinellas County Jail. Wade testified Thursday that she stabbed 18-year-old student Sarah Ludemann only after she herself was hit three times in the head during the fight. Ludemann, who was unarmed, died at the scene after being stabbed twice in the chest. The jury didn't buy Wade's claim that she acted in self-defense -- returning its verdict after just 2 1/2 hours of deliberation. Inside the courtroom, Charlie Ludemann, the victim's father, breathed deeply upon hearing the verdict, then turned to his wife and nodded. Wade did not appear to look at the dozens of teenagers who sat on her side of the courtroom. ""There's no doubt that both of these families will be devastated for the rest of their lives,"" defense lawyer Jay Hebert told reporters after the verdict. He said his client had insisted on a trial and had rejected suggestions she approach the prosecution to discuss a plea bargain. ""She wanted to testify her side of the story, and I commend her for that,"" he said. ""The jury made their call."" Hebert described himself as ""somewhat shocked,"" given the short deliberation. ""I just didn't think it would be that way,"" he said. Wade, at 5-foot-4 and 110 pounds, had no criminal record and testified that she had never been in a fight before. She said she headed to a friend's house with a knife only after being told that 5-foot-9, 166-pound Ludemann was heading to her home. Instead, Ludemann and her friends found her outside the friend's house. ""I didn't think they would attack me if they saw the knife,"" she said. She testified that she swung the knife after being hit three times but wasn't aware she had stabbed Ludemann until one of the victim's friends told her so. ""I didn't know where she was stabbed or how severe it was,"" Wade said. ""I was scared."" During cross-examination, Wade -- who worked at a restaurant -- acknowledged Thursday having thrown the knife into a neighboring yard, but said, ""I didn't know what happened, and I didn't want anybody else to get hold of it."" Prosecutor Lisset G. Hanewicz was unpersuaded. ""Why get rid of it if you are acting in self-defense?"" she asked Friday in a closing argument. ""She wanted to get rid of the evidence. She showed no remorse. She knew she stabbed her."" Animosity between Wade and Ludemann had gone back months -- and it centered on their mutual love interest, Joshua Camacho, then 20. In an August 29, 2008, voice mail, Wade can be heard saying, ""I'm guaranteeing you I'm going to ... murder you,"" and in another, she tells Ludemann, ""You are a f***ing fat b**** and I'm going to f***ing kill you, I swear on my life,"" Wade said in a voice mail left for Ludemann. Another one said, ""Josh may have played me, but, b****, I'm going to play your a** out too, so watch."" ""Those tapes were our most difficult obstacle,"" Hebert told reporters afterward. ""Those tapes were very powerful."" Wade testified that Ludemann had left similar messages for her, but that she had deleted them. Camacho testified Thursday that he considered both women ""friends with benefits"" and wasn't seeing either one exclusively at the time.

"(CNN) -- Not many winners of the Cannes Film Festival Palm d'Or thank ghosts and spirits in their acceptance speech. But for Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand's first ever winner of the film award, it was a natural thing to do. ""It was kind of an in-joke. At the same time, I think [""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives""] is about [a person] who believes in spirits, in reincarnation so I kind of thank him for it because he might have been there,"" he told CNN. The award came as a shock to Weerasethakul, who has previously found success at Cannes when he won the Jury Prize in 2004 for ""Tropical Malady,"" but didn't expect to win the big prize. ""When I heard Tim Burton will be head of jury, I was thinking no way... but when I actually won the prize I thought a different way that maybe because Tim Burton has always created his own wacky world and also my film operates in my own world, and it's quite a nutty one."" The ""nutty world"" of ""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives"" has a lead character (played by a real-life roof welder) who talks to spirits and ghosts as he faces the last days of this life. Weerasethakul believes the success of the film at the festival and with international audiences where it has been shown is down to the universal theme of fear of loss. ""Another point is if the trend of movie culture is to be so bombarded by such high production movies, people crave for a personal movie now, a small one,"" he said. While some critics debated if ""Uncle Boonmee"" was a worth winner of such an esteemed award, others praised Weerasethakul for creating a film more like a metaphysical meditation; Tim Burton described it as ""like a beautiful dream that you don't see very often."" Weerasethakul however has been battling with the harsh realities of making what many consider art-house film in Thailand for many years. The ""Uncle Boonmee"" project took three years to complete and many of his other films have faced heavy censorship. His 2006 film ""Syndromes and The Century"" was accused by the Thai authorities as being a potential threat to national security, something Weerasethakul refuted. ""You cannot make anything, I mean, you cannot [talk] basically about politics, and also religion, and other institutions in Thailand. You cannot talk about that in cinema. So that kind of cripples you in a way."" He won a few battles against the film censors and helped to establish a rating system for films in Thailand, but Weerasethakul still believes the need to speak out against limits to freedom of speech. Weerasethakul was not surprised to see the protests and violence that gripped Thailand's capital earlier this year. ""I guess [the violence] is bound to happen because we had such a huge gap in the difference in the classes of people. [It] also makes us think about where we stand especially if you're Thai; it forces us to think about our moral standpoint. ""I think we all should speak more. About how we feel. About this oppression. Because Thailand has become a democracy not long ago. And people still, we are still in obedience? It is a very obedience culture.""","Apichatpong Weerasethakul won the Palm d'Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival .

"(CNN) -- Dear Joel Stein, . Where do I begin? Normally, I write about health care, but your essay in Time, ""My Own Private India,"" caught my attention for reasons that have nothing to do with medicine. Before I read it, I barely had any idea who you were. Your name was vaguely familiar, probably from having seen you on VH1 while channel-surfing in the wee hours. I'm not the only one who noticed. Last I checked, your essay was one of the most read and e-mailed articles at Time.com. Good work. You earned your paycheck. But you did it with a xenophobic, even racist, rant against Indian Americans like me and a lot of other people I care about and deeply respect. Read Joel Stein's essay, ""My Own Private India"" Have no illusions, sir. What you wrote was not funny, insightful, smart or unique. No. Every word, phrase, sentence and paragraph you produced did nothing more than distill the ancient, proud and diverse culture of India down to nothing more than clichés and stereotypes. Calling us dot-heads and Guindians, speaking of spicy food and multilimbed gods with elephant noses -- clarification, Joel: Ganesh has the elephant nose; Siva has the multiple arms. You did it even when you were laying on the backhanded compliments. ""We all assumed Indians were geniuses."" Thanks for that. By the way, I am not some bitter old man trying to lecture you. You and I are contemporaries. I'm just a year younger than you are. In reading a little bit about you, we have some things in common. I was ""dorky enough"" to have played Dungeons & Dragons growing up. Given your esteemed education at Stanford, I suspect both of us excelled academically. But it's clear that our consciences have been on divergent paths. I try to do just a little bit of good in the world by practicing medicine and writing. You took your pricey education and became ... a humorist ... a satirist ... a pundit? A descendant of Mark Twain, H.L Mencken or P.J. O' Rourke you are not. In the future, please leave satire and humor to trained professionals. So ... because you weren't funny or incisive, what's your point? Are you trying to make Indians prove our worth to the fraternity that is America? Is your essay part of some kind of hazing? Put up with your callous insults, and we'll be able to live in the frat house? What litmus test do we all have to pass to become bona fide? Does our God have to wear a big white beard and have only two arms? Do we have to turn in the dots on our foreheads for a baseball cap with ""N.Y."" stenciled on it? Trade in our samosas and chai for potato chips and Bud Light? Should we make our parents throw their Hindi language newsmagazine in the garbage and subscribe to Time? If it's about fitting in with your standards of Americana, please, allow me to prove my culture's utility to you. Some of us have become wildly successful. We run Fortune 500 companies, have been elected to political office and have won Pulitzer prizes. Many of us work 40-plus hours a week to pay our mortgage. Some have paid their dues serving this country in war. Still others struggle to pay the bills, keep their children fed or their marriages together; and yes, there are those of us who are criminals locked up in jail. In other words, we're just like everyone else. It's obvious that you were waxing nostalgic about your hometown. If I follow your logic here, should nothing ever change in America? Should moms stay at home while we men wear our suits and ties and head off to work, cigarette in hand? Should African-Americans still drink from a different water fountain from you? Should we revoke the right of women to vote? If that's the case, I've got a Delorean with a flux capacitor I'd be happy to sell you to get ""Back to the Future."" I also read the apology you pinned to the bottom of the online version of your essay. ""I truly feel stomach-sick that I hurt so many people. I was trying to explain how, as someone who believes that immigration has enriched American life and my hometown in particular, I was shocked that I could feel a tiny bit uncomfortable with my changing town when I went to visit it. If we could understand that reaction, we'd be better equipped to debate people on the other side of the immigration issue,"" you wrote. ""Tiny bit uncomfortable,"" indeed. You should have stopped with ""I'm sorry"" or just retracted the whole article. Stop trying to save face by trying to rationalize what you wrote or pin it to the immigration issue. Finally, I do want to thank you for harshly reminding of one thing: Because the essay was published just before the Fourth of July  -- and incidentally, just a few weeks before India's own independence day -- you and your publication reminded me with no uncertainty that racism, ignorance and fear of new people are as American as apple pie and Time magazine. Like you said, the Statue of Liberty should shed a tear. And Mahatma Gandhi just did. (Time Warner Inc. is the parent company of CNN.com and Time magazine.)

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The weather system known as Bonnie has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a tropical depression as it moves across the Gulf of Mexico -- and there are indications it may not get too much stronger. As of 11 p.m. ET, the system was moving through the eastern Gulf after crossing southern Florida earlier Friday. It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. The depression was moving west-northwest at a very fast clip for such weather systems -- 17 mph. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to cross over the Gulf coast, anywhere from Louisiana to southeastern Texas, late Saturday night, earlier than had been anticipated previously. The fast pace means it won't be spending as much time over the warm Gulf water, leaving less time to build up strength. CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said an area of low pressure in the Gulf has been creating some competing winds that have been pulling clouds away from the cyclone and weakening it. Still, the hurricane center said the system may slow, and a tropical storm warning is in effect from Destin, Florida, to Morgan City, Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain. And Bonnie still could bring drenching rain to Louisiana and other states along the coast, the hurricane center said, creating a storm surge ranging from two to four feet. The hurricane center said Bonnie could bring one to three inches of rain across the region, with rainfall of five inches in some areas. Bonnie made landfall as a tropical storm earlier Friday near Biscayne Bay in southeastern Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. But it weakened as it crossed over the state. Even though Bonnie has weakened, uncertainty over the weather already has hampered operations at BP's cripped well in the Gulf. BP suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well. And the federal official overseeing the effort, retired Adm. Thad Allen, ordered ships in the area to shore because of the choppy seas and gusty winds that Bonnie will bring. That could delay operations atthe well site for 10 to 14 days. But Allen said there's enough confidence in the well's ""integrity"" that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather. Ships used to skim oil off the surface will have to come ashore as well. Hundreds have been operating off the coast. Meanwhile, states of emergency have been declared in both Louisiana and Mississippi. The emergency declarations are intended to speed state help to local goverments that need it and allow emergency crews to respond more efficiently. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Thursday afternoon it's ""good for Louisiana"" that the weather system is moving so fast, since it may not strengthen significantly and is likely to move across Louisiana fairly quickly. Still, he said about a half dozen Louisiana parishes have called for voluntary evacuations from low-lying areas and mobile home parks. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services encouraged residents Friday to prepare for the storm by pre-applying for Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, previously known as Disaster Food Stamps. The program offers help buying groceries for those who do not regularly receive nutrition assistance but who are affected by lost wages or damages because of a disaster. Officials said that pre-applying does not guarantee benefits but is designed to prevent long waits. The weather system earlier drenched the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic as it moved from the Caribbean to the Atlantic. When it reached Florida, residents in Cutler Bay saw tree branches littering the roads as Bonnie passed through Miami-Dade County. ""It was pouring rain for four to five hours straight,"" said Matthew Slack, a bartender at Cutler Bay Sports Bar and Grill. But he added, ""It's not that bad. It's like a regular summer storm in Miami."" The storm also slowed business in southern Florida. ""We've had a lot of people call and say they might have to cancel due to the storm,"" said Susie Bishop of Continental Inn Condominiums in Marathon, Florida. ""I had a few people leave a few days early."" CNN meteorologist Sean C. Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Tropical Depression Bonnie is moving through the eastern Gulf of Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Iran began fueling its first nuclear energy plant in the southern city of Bushehr on Saturday, the nation's state media reported. The effort will help the country create nuclear-generated electricity, Press TV said. The transfer of nuclear fuel was being watched by the International Atomic Energy Agency and senior officials from Iran and Russia, Press TV said. Some Western nations have questioned whether the nuclear fuel will be used solely for electricity or would Iran eventually try to enrich uranium on its own, providing material for nuclear weapons. It will take about two months for the reactor to begin generating electricity, state media has reported. Russia's nuclear agency says it will take longer. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, recently asserted Iran's right to establish nuclear plants. Sergei Kiriyenko, general director of Rosatom, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation said Saturday's arrival of nuclear fuel marks ""an event of crucial importance"" that proves that ""Russia always fulfills its international obligations."" Spent nuclear fuel from the plant will be sent back to Russia. The opening of the plant prompted the White House to question Iran continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. ""Russia is providing the fuel, and taking the fuel back out,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said earlier this month. ""It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program,"" he said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to Russian reporters in the Black Sea resort of Sochi Wednesday, brushed off Western concerns about the Bushehr facility, calling it ""the most important anchor holding Iran to the nonproliferation regime,"" according to the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti. Alistair Burt, Britain's foreign minister, said on Saturday the development ""demonstrates that Iran can have the benefits of nuclear power."" ""The problem is Iran's continued refusal to satisfy the IAEA and international community that its work on uranium enrichment and heavy water projects are exclusively peaceful."" The Bushehr facility was originally scheduled to start operations in 2007, but the date for commissioning the plant has been postponed a number of times due to various technical, financial and political factors.","Western nations question the motive .

"(CNN) -- The fourth former New Orleans police officer pleaded guilty this week in connection with police shootings of civilians on a Louisiana bridge in the days following Hurricane Katrina, authorities said. Former officer Robert Barrios pleaded guilty in federal court to a charge he failed to report a cover-up in the investigation into the Danziger Bridge shooting in New Orleans, the Department of Justice said in a statement Wednesday. He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. Barrios' plea comes after the guilty pleas from three other former New Orleans police officers -- Michael Lohman, Jeffrey Lehrmann and Michael Hunter -- involved in the Danziger Bridge case, the Justice Department said. Two civilians were killed and four others wounded in the shootings on September 4, 2005, six days after Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast. In the first shooting, on the east side of the bridge, one person, later identified as James Brissette, 19, was killed and four people were wounded, prosecutors said. In another shooting on the bridge's west side, Ronald Madison, 40, a severely disabled man, was killed. Madison's brother was arrested but later released without being charged, authorities said. Barrios admitted in court that he met with officers after the shooting to get their stories straight, prosecutors said. He also admitted that he lied when he told investigators that he had seen civilians with handguns. ""In the days following Hurricane Katrina, the people of New Orleans were relying upon law enforcement to protect public safety. Instead, the officers involved in this incident and its cover-up abused their power and violated the public trust,"" said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General in Charge of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.","Former officer admits cover-up in investigation of New Orleans bridge shooting .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- They are the first victims of the oil disaster that has devastated the Gulf region: 11 oil rig workers killed on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, torching the sky and puncturing the sea. Their remains have been lost in the Gulf of Mexico. At least 15 others were injured in the massive explosion. Victims and their families are suing BP and Transocean, the Swiss-based company that owns the drilling rig. But getting a settlement from Transocean, the world's largest offshore drilling company, could be difficult. Q&A on the legal liability of the companies involved in the oil disaster . The company has invoked a 19th century American law to limit its liability to $26.76 million, a fraction of what the plaintiffs are likely to seek. ""It may work,"" said Martin Davies, professor of law and director of Tulane University's Maritime Law Center. ""They've got a chance."" Transocean's pre-emptive strike is part of the legal thicket confronting victims, where a patchwork of arcane and sometimes inconsistent laws will most likely make the ensuing litigation one of the most complex cases in American history. The Deepwater Horizon is technically a mobile offshore drilling unit. Under maritime law, it is classified as a seagoing vessel, just like a freighter or passenger ship. Three weeks after the accident, Transocean petitioned a U.S. federal court for protection under the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. Congress enacted the law to spur investment in shipping and keep the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet competitive with other seafaring nations. To help the American shipping industry, the government limited ship owners' liability to the value of the vessel plus the money the owner would collect for completing its voyage. But now that the Deepwater Horizon is a wreck on the ocean floor, the vessel is worthless, according to Transocean. Read the affidavit stating Deepwater Horizon's value is ""$0.00 dollars"" Transocean says the remaining value of its drilling contract with BP at the time of the April 20 disaster was $26,764,083. That amount, the company argues, is the maximum it is legally required to pay to victims. ""Totally ridiculous,"" said Kurt Arnold, a Houston, Texas, attorney representing two of the victims. Transocean's ability to use the law may depend on a judge's ruling on who at Transocean knew of potential problems and when they knew it. Much of the focus has been on BP and its liability in the Gulf oil catastrophe. Survivors of the explosion told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview that a BP official wanted workers to replace heavy mud -- used to keep the well's pressure down -- with lighter seawater to help speed a process that was costing an estimated $750,000 a day and was already running five weeks late.   More on the survivors' account . In the claims against Transocean, its lawyers will try to prove that Transocean's top managers did not know about conditions that would cause the accident. If they succeed, the Limitation of Liability Act will apply. Lawyers for the victims will argue that Transocean officials had enough of what the 1851 law calls ""privity or knowledge"" to hold the company responsible for the full value of the death and injury claims. Publicly, the victims' lawyers say they are confident they can ""break the limit."" But law professor Davies disagreed: ""It's not a slam dunk."" If Transocean prevails, a relatively small pool of money would be split among the victims. If the money ends up being shared on a pro-rated formula, ""nobody's getting paid 100 percent,"" said Joshua Force, a plaintiff's lawyer in New Orleans, Louisiana. Smaller payouts also affect lawyers who work on contingency fees. The less they recover for their clients, the less the lawyers get paid. Read how some lawyers could get a huge payout . A Transocean press release states, without elaboration, that ""Transocean will honor all of its legal obligations arising from the Deepwater Horizon accident."" The company said the petition seeking shelter under the Limitation of Liability Act was filed ""at the instruction of its insurers and in order to preserve insurance coverage."" ""It's understandable self protection,"" Davies said, ""but it still has an unsavory feel to it."" Especially, he added, since the proposed limit is a ""far smaller amount than what they've recovered from their insurers."" Transocean carried $560 million in insurance on the Deepwater Horizon -- more than its book value, according to company officials. Transocean noted a $270 million ""accounting gain"" -- or profit -- from the insurance payout in a May 6 conference call with investors. Another point of contention is where any future legal battle takes place. Transocean argues that Houston is the proper venue, because its American headquarters is there. But lawyers for the victims want to move the case to New Orleans, which they argue is more convenient for their clients and closer to the scene of the disaster. The lawyers are competing for the ""subterranean sympathy you can get from a judge,"" Davies said. Judges ""are all supposed to be objective, but the New Orleans judges are likely to be more ticked off about it than in Houston,"" he said. Critics, including Davies, say the Limitation of Liability Act is anachronistic and ""no longer serving the purpose that it was intended to serve."" It should be amended, said attorney Scott Bickford, who represents victims. ""The law ought to just deal with cargo at this point,""  not personal injury and wrongful death claims, he told CNN. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the law should be repealed, ""so that no company has the opportunity to walk away from its responsibility."" But if the law is so antiquated, why wasn't it changed years ago? ""You can't get Congress to pay attention to anything on maritime law,"" Davies said. ""It's not a very sexy issue until there's a disaster.""","Families of oil workers killed, hurt in Gulf file lawsuits against BP, Transocean .

"(CNN) -- Police in Northern Ireland appealed for the community's help after a fourth night of Catholic-Protestant violence in Belfast, which saw a number of officers injured. Five people, all in their teens or early 20s, were arrested in connection with the unrest, police said. Wednesday night's violence began shortly before 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) and lasted for about six hours, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said. Are you there? Share your stories, photos and videos . In one incident, a car was stolen as the driver was getting inside and the vehicle was then set on fire, police said. Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland said Wednesday's violence involved a smaller group of people than on previous nights and included a ""hardcore group"" of about 12 people. Northern Ireland's marching season begins . They threw objects including petrol bombs and fireworks at police. Police fired back with stun grenades and water cannons, they said. ""A number"" of police officers were hurt but their injuries were not believed to be serious, the PSNI said. The violence began over the weekend after a decision to allow a Protestant parade to pass through a mainly Catholic neighborhood on July 12, a day when Protestants march to celebrate the victory of England's King William III over his ousted Catholic predecessor, James II, in 1689. Known as The Twelfth, the holiday has previously been marred by violence and has been a source of tension between Catholics and Protestants for years. Police had to remove demonstrators who staged a sit-down protest to block this year's march. Rioting erupted a short time later and more than 50 officers were hurt. The previous night, 27 officers were hurt, including three who were shot at close range by a masked man armed with a shotgun. McCausland said community leaders helped with the situation Wednesday night, but he urged them to do even more. ""A number of community workers worked hard to exercise their influence last night and I would thank them for that,"" McCausland said. ""However, I would ask them to redouble their efforts. In this way, working together, we can help bring these incidents to an end."" British Prime Minister David Cameron on Wednesday denounced the ""completely unacceptable behavior"" of those involved in the unrest. He dismissed any sectarian cause behind the violence, pointing out Northern Ireland's police force is under local control, no longer governed by London. ""There is no excuse for anyone not to cooperate with that police force,"" Cameron said.","Five people were arrested after a fourth night of violence in Belfast .

The global phenomenon picked Spain to beat the Netherlands in the World Cup finals earlier this month. Nearly two weeks later, a Spanish delegation from the town of Carballino brought a gift basket Thursday for the cephalopod in his hometown of Oberhausen, Germany. The gifts included a bronze statue that is the symbol of the town of Carballino, which makes Paul an official ''best friend of the town."" The delegation -- which included Carballino's mayor Carlos Alberto Montes Marques and various businessmen -- also gave the tentacled one an official Spanish soccer jersey. Businessman Manuel Pazo was part of the delegation. Pazo has in the past expressed his intent to buy Paul as the town's mascot. Carballino residents will celebrate Paul again on August 8th in the 43rd ""festival of the octopus."" Paul not only predicted Spain's win over the Netherlands in the final, but also the team's semifinal success against Germany. Before that, he correctly predicted all five of Germany's earlier results, and picked Germany to beat Uruguay in the third-place playoff, ending the tournament with a remarkable eight-for-eight record. For each prediction, two mussel-filled acrylic boxes labeled with a team's flag were lowered into Paul's tank. Whichever box he chose conveyed the winning team. Sea Life staff, where Paul lives, have announced he is retiring from the predictions game, but previously said they were considering offers from around the globe. Spain has expressed an interest in Paul, and a Russian bookmaking company has offered to pay 100,000 euros (about $129,800) for the octopus.","A Spanish delegation brings a gift basket for the cephalopod .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Only at San Diego Comic-Con, the annual gathering of self-proclaimed fanboys and fangirls, can an early screening of a movie feel like a rock concert, and then literally become one. In a surprise on Thursday night, some audience members to the panel for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" --- in which star Michael Cera arrived in a Captain America costume --- were given the chance to see the entire movie early at a nearby theater. The crowd cheered during the movie's opening credits and roared their approval whenever the title character landed a decisive blow while facing off with his new girlfriend's ""evil exes."" The movie, based on a Japanese manga-inspired comic book, has a good possibility of appealing to comic book fans and gamers alike. ""It surpassed my expectations, and I'm a huge fan,"" said Gabriel Simon, after the screening, which ended with a performance by the band Metric, while cast members such as Anna Kendrick from ""Up in the Air"" rocked out in the balcony. Brittany Hernandez of La Jolla, California, is one of several who said the movie was the highlight of the convention so far. ""I thought the movie was amazing. I saw the panel after the one for 'The Expendables.' Sylvester Stallone is hard to beat, but that was pretty awesome."" It's just one of many ways Hollywood studios are trying to get the most bang for their promotional buck among these hardcore filmgoers. Giving them a chance to see early footage is one thing, but some moviemakers are trying a more ""immersive experience"" to make sure that the fans have high praise for their top projects, especially when they post to their favorite social media site. ""Pilgrim"" doesn't stop there, with an off-site area center where attendees can get custom-made T-shirts. Not to be outdone, ""The Green Hornet's"" car, the Black Beauty, and the movie's ""booth babes,"" known as the Green Hornettes are all over Comic-Con. Con-goers can head up to another off-site location, Britt Reid's Garage, to catch a glimpse of the masked hero's vehicle of choice, and others owned by the Hornet. ""We tried to take risks and make something interesting, and also make something that is worth this amount of money,"" said the Hornet himself, Seth Rogen, gesturing towards the cars. ""We went through a lot of different designs [for the Black Beauty] and ended up with basically the same design as the TV show. We just added bigger guns."" A Comic-Con veteran, Rogen prefers Marvel Comics over DC and, as for the convention itself, he says he ""wishes it were a little bit more about the comics, actually."" If cars aren't your thing and you prefer your ""immersive experiences"" to be more on the techie side, ""Tron: Legacy"" has an app for that: an all-new version of the ""Tanks"" game from the Tron arcade can be downloaded onto iPhones. There's also ""Flynn's Arcade,"" returning to Comic-Con for the second year in a row. This year, there is a scavenger hunt of sorts on Twitter, where attentive fans can gain access to special events inside the arcade, which reveal secrets of the film, among other things. As ""immersive experiences"" go, however, ""Salt,"" which had all of 24 hours before the movie's release to make an impression, went the old-fashioned route by revealing a big surprise Thursday: Angelina Jolie favoring the audience with an appearance. Bruce Willis was also on hand to promote the upcoming comic book adaptation, ""Red,"" though Oscar winner Helen Mirren may have stolen the show by talking about her first action role. Speaking of action, the aforementioned Stallone was indeed there Thursday, pushing ""The Expendables,"" along with just about every other action hero who isn't the governor of the most populous state in the union. Another way to grab fans' attention is food, and Robert Rodriguez's upcoming ""Machete"" had a taco stand set up on Thursday night, along with an outdoor screening of new footage. There are still a few more high-profile movies hoping to thrill the Comic-Con crowd. ""Green Lantern"" starring Ryan Reynolds, and the next two Marvel Comics adaptations, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" still have their Hall H presentations coming up over the weekend. Visitors to the booths in the exhibitors hall had an early glimpse of Abin Sur, an alien from ""Green Lantern,"" and both Thor's hammer and Cap's shield were on display. Also, ""Iron Man"" director Jon Favreu is hoping that his third time's a charm at Comic-Con with ""Cowboys & Aliens,"" which is still in production. And believe it or not, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" will mark that successful movie franchise's first appearance in San Diego. Prior to the panel, fans are getting a look at the famous horcruxes as they will appear in the movie. At a convention where there is no such thing as too flashy, even the wildly-popular ""Potter"" might have to pull off every trick up his sleeve to avoid getting overshadowed.","Fans preview entire movie ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"" at Comic-Con .

"(CNN) -- The owner of three pit bulls that killed a 2-year-old boy Thursday has been charged in connection with the child's death, authorities in California said. Steven Hayashi, 52, was arrested on charges of child endangerment and possessing a mischievous animal that causes death or great bodily injury, the Concord Police Department said in a statement. He is being held on $120,000 bail. The dogs mauled the boy after he walked into the garage where they were being kept, police said. Authorities said the toddler was the suspect's step-grandchild. Two adult relatives and a young sibling were also home at the time of the attack, which police said occurred just after 8:45 a.m. Thursday (11:45 a.m. ET). The boy was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police said they were still investigating the incident.","Police say three dogs mauled the 2-year-old .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The sisters of a Los Angeles woman found dead in Cancun, Mexico, in April want the U.S. government to explain why her husband has not been arrested a month after Mexican prosecutors requested his extradition. ""We are tired of waiting,"" Jeanne Burgos said Thursday. ""It's not fair."" She and her sister Carla Burgos staged a rally outside the federal courthouse in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon to demand an arrest. ""We are demanding that the United States authorities just do what they have to do,"" Burgos said. ""We are not asking for anything beyond what their duties are."" Reality TV producer Bruce Beresford-Redman is still living free with his children in Los Angeles nearly two months after a Mexican judge ordered his arrest. Mexican officials said June 23 that they had sent their extradition petition to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the Justice Department in Washington would confirm what has happened with the extradition request. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, who would pursue an arrest, said Thursday that nothing has been filed in California. ""They are not telling us anything,"" said Allison Triessl, the Burgos family's lawyer. ""We have repeatedly asked. We have made phone calls almost daily, and we have received no information at all."" Beresford-Redman was briefly detained after his wife's body was found April 8 in a sewer at Cancun's Moon Palace Resort. His passport was taken by investigators, and he was told not to leave Mexico until the inquiry was concluded. Quintana Roo state Attorney General Francisco Alor said in May that he has a ""very concrete"" case against the former ""Survivor"" producer. Beresford-Redman's lawyer, Richard Hirsch, has said he would fight extradition. Beresford-Redman returned home in May, without the knowledge of investigators, to take care of family business and see his two young children, his lawyer said. His parents have temporary legal custody of the children, ages 3 and 5, but they are staying with Beresford-Redman. The initial investigation suggested that Monica Beresford-Redman ""died of strangulation, because of the bruising,"" Mexican regional police spokesman Adrian Cardena said. A source close to the wife has said that she cleaned out the family's bank account and took her two children to Hawaii because she was upset about her husband's extramarital affair. The couple later traveled to Cancun in an effort to repair their marriage, the source said.","Bruce Beresford-Redman is still free nearly 2 months after murder charge .

"Moscow, Russia(CNN) -- Unidentified gunmen killed two people and injured another two Wednesday in what Russian officials called a terrorist attack intended to blow up a hydroelectric power station. The attackers targeted the Baksan Hydropower Plant in the North Caucasus republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office said. They killed two guards and badly beat two control-room operators, authorities said. ""At about 4 a.m., perpetrators wearing masks penetrated inside the station and tied their hands with tape,"" Valery Shogenov, the hydroelectric station's manager, told Russian state television on the backdrop of his plant still smoking. ""But the operators managed to finally free themselves from the tape and call us about the accident,"" he said. While at the station, the gunmen triggered off four improvised explosive devices that destroyed two of its three hydropower generators and caused a fire in the control room. Later, investigators defused a fifth device planted by the bombers that didn't explode. Russian security officials said the same gunmen had attacked a local police station in Baksan vullage with grenade launchers shortly before storming into the power plant. ""The possible suspects have been determined now,"" the Russian National Antiterrorist Committee said in a statement. ""Government bodies are keeping the situation under their control,"" it said. The special crisis center of the republic's law enforcement agencies said three to five people were behind the attack. RusHydro, the country's power-generating company, said on its website that the fire had been extinguished, but part of the control room's equipment is damaged and needs replacement. RusHydro also said security has been boosted at all its hydroelectric plants across Russia's restive northern Caucasus region. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin instructed government officials to take ""speedy measures to fully restore the power plant."" The Baksan hydroelectric plant was built in 1936. Russian media said this was the first time in the country's history that a power plant was attacked by terrorists.","Unidentified gunmen kill two people, injure two more .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Nearly 1.3 million Mexican residents don't have running water in Mexico City, the nation's capital, a university study has revealed. The study concluded that although a greater number of residents have access to running water, there are still large segments of the population who do not, the state-run Notimex news agency said Tuesday, citing the Council for Evaluation of Social Development in the Federal District. Mexico City is located in the Federal District, much like Washington is located in the District of Columbia. According to the study, nearly 7 million residents, or about 81.5 percent of the city's population connected to the water system, received their supply daily in 2009. More than 1.4 million received water irregularly during the week, the study said. Nearly 1.3 million people received no water at all. Some Mexico City neighborhoods have seen an increase in availability, the study said. Iztapalapa increased from nearly 71 percent of its population in 2000 to nearly 83 percent in 2005. Tlahuac went from nearly 62 percent to more than 77 percent, Xochimilco from about 61 percent to more than 71 percent and Milpa Alta from around 42 percent to about 61 percent. The study was conducted by specialists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.","Nearly 7 million Mexico City residents get water daily .

"(CNN) -- World number one Roger Federer was knocked out of the Estoril Open on Saturday, after losing to defending champion Albert Montanes, 29, of Spain 6-2 7-6 (7-5) in the semifinals of the Portugal tournament. The 16-time champion, who is six weeks away from beating Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks as the globe's top-ranked men's player, lost to Montanes on a rain-soaked clay court in under 90 minutes. Montanes will now face Portugal's Frederico Gil in Monday's final. However, the 28-year-old Federer -- who beat Nikolay Davendenko to win the event in 2008 -- remained confident about his clay-court form, despite this loss coming on the back of an opening match defeat at last month's Rome Masters. ""I'm not worried,"" Federer told the official Web site of the Estoril Open. ""My goal isn't to win 12 tournaments a year, it is the big events: the Masters, the grand slams and keeping the number one ranking. ""My decision to come to Estoril was the right decision. I would like to return again in future. I know that good things are around the corner,"" Federer added. ""I'm disappointed to have played a match like this, where I got off to a bad start again. I didn't play that badly in the second set, I had my moments but my movement was a little slow. ""I'm lacking matches,"" said Federer. ""I'll keep practicing hard again. Conditions will speed up in Madrid and Paris [at Roland Garros]. I must take positives into the next few weeks."" Federer was using the tournament as a warm-up to the French Open, where the Swiss ace will be looking to defend his title when the tournament starts at Roland Garros on May 23.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- As Tropical Depression Bonnie churns through the Gulf of Mexico, several response vessels at the site of BP's ruptured well are in the process of being moved out of harm's way Friday, possibly leaving the sealed well cap unattended for about 48 hours, federal officials said. ""The intention right now is to put the vessels in a safe place so they can return as quickly as possible,"" retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said. The rigs drilling the relief wells and the Q4000 recovery vessel are expected to be fully disconnected by late Friday afternoon, Allen said in a briefing Friday. Operators manning the vessels will begin to move to a position of the ""best survivability,"" he added. Even if the vessels monitoring the well have to depart, Allen said, they'll perform aerial and satellite surveillance and leave recording equipment at the base of the well to continue observation. ""If we have to evacuate the scene, we're probably looking at a very limited window, probably 48 hours,"" he said. Allen also addressed the ""good and bad part"" of a tropical storm hitting the Gulf region: While he acknowledged how a storm surge could drive the oil into beach and marsh areas, where it would have not been driven otherwise, Allen says the increased weather activity may ""actually help"" disperse the oil. ""So we're mindful that those are two consequences and prepared to move out and aggressively attack this once the threat is passed through. But in [the] meantime, preservation of life and preservation of equipment are our highest priority,"" Allen said. Later, Allen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""it's certainly going to be a setback"" in the effort to permanently seal the well and clean up the Gulf. He noted that 800 skimmers that had been collecting oil on the surface across the Gulf Coast will be returning to safety on shore but said authorities are slowly making progress. ""I'm not ready to declare victory, nor should anybody. But we certainly are starting to gain a bit of an upper hand here,"" he said. ""Of course, we still have beach cleanup and marshland areas that are affected."" BP said that pressure in the well continues to ""slowly increase."" Company officials said they will continue to take pressure readings and monitor the well as long as weather permits. On Thursday, officials said the departure of the relief well rig could delay work on the operation -- described as the permanent fix to the ruptured well -- for at least 10 days. Allen said the cap placed over the damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico will remain sealed and continue to stop oil from escaping even if the more than 2,000 people who have been working at the well site are off the water. The weather could force officials to temporarily scale back efforts to search beneath the surface for leaking oil. But Allen said Thursday that the remote vehicles used to monitor the area will be the last to leave and the first to return. Sensors and extensive monitoring have allowed observers to ""rule out any indications that there might be a leak,"" Allen said Thursday, noting that his confidence in the integrity of the well had ""improved dramatically"" after he examined data over the past few days. Once the weather system passes, a plan to pump mud into the well to force oil back into the reservoir below is in the works. BP has Allen's approval to prepare for the ""static kill"" process but would still need the government's final go-ahead before proceeding, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said. Meanwhile, officials monitoring the spill say they continue to track the tropical weather and communicate with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is ultimately responsible for the safety of the more than 40,000 people assisting in recovery and response efforts in the Gulf region. ""The protection of the equipment and crew is paramount to ensure maximum ability to respond to any new challenges a storm may pose to the enormous mission,"" Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, the federal on-scene coordinator, said in a news release Thursday. ""We are repositioning assets away from low-lying areas to higher-ground staging areas to protect our ability to respond to the dynamic requirements of the incident,"" Zukunft said. At 5 p.m. ET Friday, Bonnie had been downgraded to a tropical depression after moving across southern Florida. It was moving west-northwest at 18 miles an hour and had maximum sustained winds of 35 miles an hour. It's expected to make landfall early Sunday between New Orleans, Louisiana, and southeastern Texas. If the storm continues on its path, it could slam into the area of the BP oil spill and possibly push more oil to shore. The tropical weather system could diminish or erase encouraging signs of recovery from the BP oil spill, according to a scientist who spearheaded the first major examination of the Louisiana coast wetlands. ""Early marsh regrowth could easily be taken away with high winds and waves,"" said Tom Bianchi, a Texas A&M oceanography professor who has spent his career researching marshes. Meanwhile, at a federal hearing in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Friday, a Deepwater Horizon chief engineering technician testified that the rig's general alarm system -- which is designed to detect a sudden rise in natural gas -- had been disabled because rig managers ""did not want people woke up at 3 in the morning due to false alarms."" Technician Mike Williams said the alarm system had been been ""inhibited"" for about a year before the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers and started the worst oil disaster in the nation's history. Williams said supervisors on the Transocean rig were aware that the system had been inhibited. Transocean later said in a statement that the disabling was ""intentional and conforms to accepted maritime practices."" ""It was not a safety oversight or done as a matter of convenience,"" it said. The company said there were hundreds of individual fire and gas alarms on the Deepwater Horizon in a ""zone-based"" system. The rig had an option -- which was resorted to -- to prevent the general alarm from sounding when an individual alarm went off. Transocean said it's possible that individual alarms might be providing notification of ""minor issues or a non-emergency,"" and ""repeated false alarms increase risk and decrease rig safety."" CNN's Ashley Fantz, Vivian Kuo and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Retired Adm. Thad Allen says there is ""certainly going to be a setback"" at well site .

"(CNN) -- Poet, dramatist and novelist, Wole Soyinka's work has left a large imprint on the literary landscape of Africa. Poltical activist and Nobel Laureat, Wole Soyinka. His work has been performed internationally and in 1986 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Regardless of the global profile and recognition, writing for Soyinka has always been, and always will be, a part of his life. ""I began writing early, very, very early. ... I was already writing short stories for the radio, and selling poems to poetry and art festivals, I was involved in school plays, I wrote essays, so there was no definite moment when I said, now I'm a writer. I've always been a writer,"" he told CNN. Before being honored with a Nobel Prize, Soyinka had written plays performed across the world, set up drama groups and held academic positions in the UK, the U.S. and Nigeria. Poetry and novels make up the rest of his work, but it is with the medium of drama that he feels most comfortable. ""When I write plays, I'm already seeing the shapes on stage, of the actors and their interaction, and so on and so forth. I don't think I've ever written one play as an abstract piece, as a literary piece, floating in the air somewhere, to be flushed out later on,"" he said. Now 75, Soyinka claims it is a natural curiosity with life and humanity that has always compelled him to write, and should be a pre-requisite for all aspiring writers. ""Before you're a writer, you're a citizen, a human being, and therefore the weapons of the citizen are at your disposal to use, or not use,"" he said. Often he's used those ""weapons"" to take aim at oppression, corruption, the legacy of colonialism and slavery, both in his work and more overtly in his political activism. At times he's suffered for his outspoken views; in 1967 he was imprisoned for 22 months for publicly calling for a truce during Nigeria's civil war and in 1994 was forced to leave the country when General Sani Abacha came to power. ""One of my earliest short stories in fact had to do with the story of a family which escaped enslavement by Portuguese slave leaders, so you can see how early I was preoccupied by that theme of power and freedom, and domination,"" he said. ""If there's one overriding political theme it's my continuing emphasis on the axis of freedom and power. I think that the history of the world, of all societies, has spun on those two axes."" Soyinka spends his time between Nigeria, Europe and the U.S., much of it on the lecture circuit, but the need to write remains. ""I've always written plays for the purpose of getting something out of my system. That's the first stage. And the next stage is, I want to get it onto the platform -- onto the stage. And once I've done that, no matter where, I'm satisfied.""

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A prominent Iranian human rights lawyer was under European diplomatic protection Friday after Turkish authorities released him from a detention center for illegal immigrants. Mohammad Mostafaei had barely made it to his hotel in Istanbul before diplomatic officials rushed to the scene and announced he was not safe. They swept him away in a car for his safety. ""After six days [in detention], I'm so tired I just want to go to my hotel and take a shower,"" Mostafaei said to CNN. ""I feel like I'm still in detention."" He has had to make difficult, life-altering decisions in recent weeks. The lawyer has been a longtime defender of Iranian juveniles facing the death penalty. More recently, he campaigned to attract international attention to the case of Sakineh Ashtiani, the 43-year-old mother of two who was sentenced to death by stoning after she was convicted of adultery. On July 24, as activists around the world staged protests against Ashtiani's death sentence, Mostafaei was taken in by Iranian authorities for hours of interrogation. After they released him, he said, he went into hiding. Around the same time, he said, Iranian security forces detained his wife and brother-in-law. The brother-in-law has been released, but Mostafaei said his wife Fereshteh is still being held in solitary confinement without charge. ""I am extremely worried about my wife and her safety,"" Mostafaei said in an earlier interview with CNN. ""They [the Iranian authorities] told me if you don't turn yourself in, we will not let your family go,"" Mostafaei added. ""I made a decision, after I saw that they were still going to arrest me and mistreat me, that I must leave Iran. It was a very hard decision."" He added, ""The truth is even when someone talks about Parmida and says her name, it's really hard for me to talk and I want to cry when that happens."" Like many other Iranian dissidents, Mostafaei slipped across the border from Iran to the eastern Turkish border town of Van. He blames himself for his detention, which began after he landed at the Istanbul airport from Van. ""It was my mistake. I went to the police officers inside the airport and declared myself as a refugee,"" he said on Friday. According to Turkish law, refugees requesting asylum must go through a registration process with the Turkish government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Normally it can take two years before a refugee is processed and granted asylum in another, typically Western country. But officials at the Turkish foreign ministry told CNN that in Mostafaei's case, he was likely to be granted asylum in a European country within days. According to the refugee agency's Ankara office, around 4,100 Iranian citizens currently are registered in Turkey and awaiting asylum in third-party countries. Metin Corabatir, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' representative in Ankara, estimates that ""on a monthly basis there has been an increase of 25 to 50"" Iranians requesting asylum, compared with before the Iranian government launched a crackdown on opposition activists following a controversial presidential election on June 12, 2009. Corabatir said 150 to 200 Iranians now request asylum in Turkey every month. In his conversation on Friday with CNN, Mostafaei expressed concern for the welfare of his imprisoned wife and his daughter, whom he left behind in Iran with her grandmother. He said he also worries about clients like Ashtiani. ""Who else will do my work?"" he asked. Ashtiani, a mother of two, is reportedly still being held in Tabriz prison. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. CNN's Yesim Comert in Istanbul and Mitra Mobasherat in Atlanta contributed to this report .","European diplomats whisked Mostafaei away shortly after his release .

"New York (CNN) -- The recent suicidal violence in Pakistan coincides with a growing concern that President Obama might be tempted by the same folly that drove President Bush and massively increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- by up to 65,000 if he were to listen to some of his military advisers. This is a deadly mistake that would drag the United States into a quagmire with even more catastrophic consequences than those it has faced in Iraq. The recent comment by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to CNN that ""the Bush administration failed to ask critical questions about the war in Afghanistan"" would be a key point of departure, but the question remains how critically Obama is willing to ask these questions. The fear that is now principally driving this tendency to escalate the war is that the Taliban and al Qaeda are about to declare victory over yet another superpower, and even expand their theater of operation, as the British army chief General Sir David Richards has suggested, into other parts of the world. This is a phantom fear, from a frightful figment of imagination in which the U.S. and European armies are now strategically invested and that has for almost a decade had a crippling effect on any measure of reason and sanity. There is no better way to combat this fearful fantasy than rethink what we have collectively come to understand by these two elusive terms ""Taliban"" and ""al Qaeda."" The only way to defeat these deceptive delusions is not to dispatch tens of thousands of innocent lives across the globe and endanger even more tens of thousands of innocent lives in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but to re-examine the terror that these terms have exercised over our mental faculties ever since the traumatic events of 9/11. What now passes as ""Taliban"" and ""al Qaeda"" fundamentally lack serious popular bases, mass infrastructural support or certainly any coherent ideology. In the history of the militant Islamist ideologies that we have known and examined in detail over the last 200 years, these are conceptual and political aberrations that will wither away almost as soon as they are taken off the radar of U.S. and NATO military operations and, by extension, away from the global limelight. The more you fight these delusions, the more powerful they become -- not as facts on the ground, but as figments of the military's imagination. Obama would commit perhaps the deadliest mistake and the biggest blunder of his presidency if he were not to listen to the wise counsel of Vice President Biden, who is reportedly against this massive increase of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan sought to dismantle the myth of the Taliban when he said, ""there are thousands of them who are not ideologically our enemies. There are thousands of them who don't hate us or hate our way of life, who are not enemies to America, who are not enemies to the world, who just want to live in their own country in peace, who are frightened, are intimidated by bad behavior -- from the very beginning -- by some of the people that the coalition employed and by some of the people that the Afghan government had working on security issues. So, we have to bring those elements back to Afghanistan who are not part of al Qaeda, not part of terrorist networks, and who are accepting the Afghan Constitution and who are willing to come back."" Yet another piece of evidence about the folly of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan came in the resignation of Matthew Hoh, a Foreign Service officer and former Marine captain who resigned in protest over the Afghan war. ""I believe that the people we are fighting there are fighting us because we are occupying them,"" Hoh told CNN last week. ""Not for any ideological reasons, not because of any links to al Qaeda, not because of any fundamental hatred towards the West. The only reason they're fighting us is because we're occupying them."" The regional consequences of not heeding what Vice President Biden, Rahm Emanuel, Hamid Karzai and Matthew Hoh are saying, implicitly or explicitly, will be even more catastrophic. Because of the fundamental flaws of the Obama administration's Afghan strategies so far, exacerbated by the incompetence of the Pakistani political and military apparatus, there is already a massive humanitarian crisis in the North-West Frontier Province. Any further increase of the U.S. military force in Afghanistan will Talibanize these border areas even further, and with them potentially the rest of the country. The Taliban has never been a unified or a monolithic entity, although for a short period in 2001, it had tenuous control of Afghanistan, and even less so has this thing called ""al Qaeda."" At its essence, what is called ""Taliban"" in Afghanistan is nothing more that a Pashtun tribal push for power, and as such it must be distinguished from what is called ""Taliban"" in the Federally Administered Tribal Area of Pakistan, which in turn must be separated from the Tehreek-e Nafaz-e Shariat-e Mohammadi in Swat, and all of those from the band of militant adventurists gathered around Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, self-delusional to the point of calling themselves ""al Qaeda"" (""The Base""). The atrocities of 9/11 were the work of a criminal band of militant adventurers, on par with the network of support that someone like Timothy McVeigh could muster, and certainly not on a scale that could warrant the cross-continental mobilization of a superpower and its allies. The time for conventional military operations, as the Israelis ought to have learned from Hamas and Hezbollah, is long since over. You cannot fight and will not win a conventional war halfway around the globe against an amorphous enemy you can scarce clearly identify -- let alone pinpoint and attack, or target and eliminate. The U.S. Army and its allies are fighting a phantom war in Afghanistan, with massive civilian casualties and increasingly ineffective combat strategies. Obama should not yield to the pressure of the British and the hawks in Washington, D.C., and increase the size of the U.S. military. He and his civilian advisers are very wise to take time to examine this critical condition and not fall into the same trap that Bush did. Instead of increasing the size of the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, there must be a phasing out of the 100,000-plus U.S. and NATO forces that are already in Afghanistan and a corresponding phasing in of massive economic aid to rebuild a country the U.S. and its European allies (the British in particular), and before them the Soviets, are chiefly responsible for ruining. The Taliban and al Qaeda will dissipate like a shadowy shade of a nightmare when the might of the U.S. military stops actually creating what it wants to destroy, and once the limelight of world media is no longer cast upon the Afghan mountains. The Nobel Peace Prize to Obama could not have been timelier as a way to remind him why he was elected to the White House in the first place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","It would be fatal mistake to boost troop levels in Afghanistan, Hamid Dabashi says .
He says the more you fight the Taliban, the more formidable they appear .
He says that in reality, the Taliban is an amorphous entity that will melt away .

"(CNN) -- Somalian supermodel Waris Dirie has graced the pages of glossy magazines and starred opposite 007 as a Bond Girl. Face for change: Dirie is a tireless campaigner against FGM. But her glamorous appearances on catwalks and in magazines and films belies the personal battles Dirie has had to overcome. Dirie is a leading voice against forced circumcision and female genital mutilation (FGM) and struggled to overcome her own circumcision at the age of five. The forthcoming film, ""Desert Flower"", based on her biography, tells her story. Yet it is through her charitable foundation that Dirie hopes that the practice still common in traditions in parts of Africa, the Middle East, South American and Asia will not create more cases similar to her own. Growing up with a nomadic family in Somalia she was one of 12 children. She fled to the London, where one of her uncles was working in the Somali embassy, to avoid an arranged marriage with an older man. She was just 13-years-old at the time. After working as a housemaid and in a McDonald's restaurant she was spotted by chance by fashion photographer Terrance Donovan and became the covergirl for the 1987 Pirelli calendar. Becoming the face of beauty products and design houses, her successful modeling career has given her a life far removed from her childhood. Yet for Dirie more importantly it has created a platform to campaign against FGM. In 2002 she created the Waris Dirie Foundation and has been given a number of honors in recognition of her work.","Somalian supermodel and human rights activist .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A member of Congress Friday called on the State Department to stop doing business with Xe, the North Carolina-based security company formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, on Friday urged the State Department ""not to enter into further contracts"" with  Xe. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whether the State Department had just signed a new $20 million dollar contract with Xe for Iraq, saying she is ""very concerned"" that the State Department may be signing new security contracts with Xe, both in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I urge you not to enter into further contracts with Xe and to immediately review any existing contracts,"" the letter said, according to a copy provided to CNN. ""The behavior and actions of both the company's leadership and a number of individuals employed by the company have harmed our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan and endangered the lives and welfare of our troops and diplomatic personnel serving overseas."" The State Department decided in January not to renew a personnel protection contract with Blackwater, as the company was then known, when it expired in May. That decision came amidst an investigation by both U.S. and Iraqi authorities of a 2007 shooting involving Blackwater guards in Baghdad in which 17 Iraqis were killed. The company has repeatedly denied any wrong-doing. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request Friday for reaction to Schakowsky's questions and criticism. The State Department had said that it would continue a Blackwater air-support contract after the much-larger personnel protection contract ended. Xe spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke told CNN that, ""Right now we have no contracts with the State Department in Iraq."" DeLuke said the company would review calls for bids to provide security for U.S. officials in Afghanistan. ""The thing is we are totally open to bidding on some of the contracts that may come up in Afghanistan just like anyone else,"" DeLuke said in a telephone interview. The Nation magazine released an article Friday that said the State Department had signed a new contract for Iraq with Xe for $20 million to extend an earlier aviation contract. ""The State Department contract is scheduled to run through September 3. In May, the State Department announced it was not renewing Blackwater's Iraq contract, and the Iraqi government has refused to issue the company an operating license,"" the article said. The controversy over the role of Blackwater in Iraq was revived earlier this week by a lawsuit filed in Virginia by two former employees accusing Blackwater guards of smuggling weapons and using excessive force in Iraq. And the lawsuit claims Blackwater founder Erik Prince ""views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe."" Xe said in a statement that it would respond ""to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs,"" in a brief to be filed August 17. Blackwater changed its name to Xe in February.","State Department says it will continue Blackwater air-support contract .

"Editor's note: Ed Rollins, a senior political contributor for CNN, is senior presidential fellow at the Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University. He was White House political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ed Rollins says Obama appeased UN delegations ""led by tyrants and petty dictatorships."" NEW YORK (CNN) -- The president had his first foray into the byzantine world of U.N. politics last week and walked away cheered on by the anti-America crowd. He appeased the delegations led by tyrants and petty dictatorships by condemning President Bush and spelling out how his administration is going to be different. President Obama was applauded by Castro, Chavez, and Gadhafi (no friends of ours) when he said he wanted a ""new era of engagement in the world."" Are either of those three dictators going to be better world citizens or kinder, gentler leaders as a result of Obama's outreach? Put me in the doubtful column. No American president has ever stood before the U.N. body and condemned his predecessor or American foreign policy in such a way. President Bush, like every president before him made some mistakes, but he did not deserve this put down. And let's not forget America was attacked on September 11, 2001, and thousands of American lives were lost. President Bush and his team got us through all that and kept us safe for the rest of his terms. And I hope Mr. Obama realizes the ""haters"" of America are still out there. Historically, American foreign policy has been pretty consistent whether a Democrat or Republican occupies the Oval Office. President Obama's style may be different and more pacifying but at the end of the day he hopefully will be conducting business that benefits American interests and not the lowest common denominator interests of the United Nations membership. If not, he will join his fellow Democrat, Jimmy Carter, as a one-termer. We know President Obama loves lofty rhetoric and he does it well. The public's question should be can he deal with reality? And can he relate that reality to us as he makes the very tough decisions he faces in the weeks and months ahead? Last Thursday, the president, chairing the United Nations National Security Council, pushed through a six-page resolution that was approved unanimously 15-0. The resolution urged a world without nuclear weapons. President Obama stated: ""We must never stop until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the earth."" Some may see that as an admirable goal but the hard truth is that the five permanent members of the Security Council: China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States all have nuclear weapons and none of them -- including the United States -- are giving them up. They may downgrade and diminish the stockpile a little, but nobody's going ""no nuke."" You add the other three nuclear powers -- Pakistan, India and Israel (although they don't admit or deny) -- and nobody is disarming. Russia, which along with us has the largest stockpile, couldn't get out of the room fast enough before saying ""not us!"" The real work of the U.N. Security Council should have been condemning and again warning North Korea and Iran that they are not welcome into the nuclear club and that every effort is going to be used to stop them from continuing on that path. It took French President Nicolas Sarkozy to call the Security Council exercise weak and to chastise its members, including President Obama, for not condemning Iran and North Korea more forcefully. ""How, before the eyes of the world, could we justify meeting without tackling them?"" He went on to say: ""We live in the real world, not a virtual world. And the real world expects us to take decisions."" Iran's reaction to their ""view of the real world"" was to walk away from the U.N. meeting and test-fire missiles with sufficient range to strike Israel and parts of Europe and American bases. Far from being humbled, a senior Revolutionary Guard official told the semi-official Fars news agency, ""Iranian missiles are able to target any place that threatens Iran."" I for one would like to remind them that we have a lot more missiles then they have and we can strike any place they fire a missile from. Of course, I am not a diplomat and never have been one -- for obvious reasons. The second exercise in reality is the very tough decision the president must make on Gen. McChrystal's recommendation for more troops to get the job done in Afghanistan. Gen. McChrystal is the president's handpicked commander of forces in ""the war of necessity"" (President Obama's term) in Afghanistan. The acclaimed and well-respected general was allowed to pick his team and was asked in very short order to make an assessment. He has done that and his assessment -- as everyone else including the British and the Soviet Union, who has ever gone to war in Afghanistan found out -- is that the going is tough and without more troops defeat is a very real possibility. The president wisely is getting the best counsel possible from his foreign affairs team, an experienced group that will have many opinions as to the direction he needs to follow. This maybe the toughest decision of his presidency and whatever direction he takes he will be widely criticized by his friends and enemies alike. The important thing to remember, is this is where he needs to educate the public. If he expands this war, he needs a skeptical public to support him. If he tries an alternative to Gen. McChrystal's plan, he will be judged on the end results and that may be very risky. You combine this with the president's promise to close Guantanamo by the end of the year, (not going to happen) get health care passed, eliminate ear marks (The Senate defense appropriations bill has nearly 800 at a cost of $2.65 billion and no threat of a veto anywhere), and you can see a tough fall ahead. As if he doesn't have enough on his plate, he is flying off to Denmark to head the lobbying effort for his hometown Chicago's final presentation to the International Olympic Committee to host the 2016 games. He will once again find out if his powers of persuasion work on foreign leaders and hopefully for the hometown they will work better then they did last week. At least the president will quickly find out this week if he's as good a salesman as he and his team think he is because the IOC makes its decision Friday. International Olympic politics is as tough as Chicago politics, and being loved has nothing to do with getting results. The outcome will be awaited with great anticipation.

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says a small town in Ohio is one of the most inspiring places in the United States. (CNN) -- All over the world this weekend, people are peering up into the night, trying to catch a glimpse of a sliver of the moon. They're thinking about the moon because of Monday's 40-year anniversary of mankind's first lunar landing. And more than a few people are undoubtedly allowing themselves to dream of traveling to the moon themselves. It's not going to happen. For almost all of us, it can be said with certainty: . We're never going to go to the moon. But there's good news: . We can go to Wapakoneta. Wapakoneta is a town of barely 9,000 people in northwestern Ohio. It may be, in its own quiet way, the most inspiring single place in the United States. I-75 runs right past it; in your car, it's there and then it's gone before you even know it. Yet if you make the decision to leave the interstate and turn onto Bellefontaine Street, which takes you into town, you will find yourself thinking about life's most glorious possibilities in a way you seldom have before. Each time I go to Wapakoneta, I try to put into words the feeling of walking those small-town streets, and each time I fear I come up short. But the lesson of Wapakoneta remains constant. A boy from this town -- a boy born here, a boy whose father, a mid-level state employee, was required to move from city to city some twenty different times before ending up back in Wapakoneta for the boy's high school years -- looked up at the Ohio sky and decided that he would soar. If the town at times felt cloistered and confining -- if the horizons the boy could physically view on the flat landscape of Auglaize County appeared circumscribed -- he did not let that stop him. Down through the ages, it was the one task that was almost beyond conceiving, never mind beyond doing. Until, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong, of Wapakoneta, walked on the moon. You want to talk about the strength of the human will -- of the American will? You want to talk about absolute proof that no matter where you're from, if you set your heart to it, you can do anything? Take a trip to Wapakoneta. Stroll through the neighborhoods, stop in at the stores, maybe catch a movie at the old Wapa Theater on Willipie Street. Try to imagine being the boy who did exactly that, when no one knew his name. His family had had to pick up and move so often, because of his dad's job, that no one could have blamed him if his only desire had been to finally cling to one place. But he decided that if he was destined always to be in motion, then he should make the most of it. He was fifteen when, his family living back in Wapakoneta again, he signed up for lessons at the airstrip north of town. He had made up his mind: He wanted to escape the earth's bonds. The moon was not the dream. The moon was merely the eventual landing strip. The dream was to fly. Walk around that town. If you're feeling hemmed in by life, if all your prospects seem to have dried up, if you feel stuck in place, walk around Wapakoneta. Then ask yourself: Is there anything that can stop a person whose belief in what he can accomplish is fierce and unyielding enough? There is a little museum in town -- you can see it from I-75 -- that is dedicated to the life of the boy who once walked those same streets. The thing I have always loved best about the museum is the display of newspaper front pages from around the world on the day after the moon landing. Every front page in every city in every country on the globe ran huge headlines announcing that the impossible had become real: that a man had walked on the moon. Some of the papers said just that -- that a man had reached the moon. Some made it more parochial -- they said that an American had walked on the moon. But the Wapakoneta Daily News said it in the only good and proper way it could be said, in that town, on that day: . ""Neil Steps on the Moon."" We all need to be reminded, from time to time, of just what we can do. We all, no matter where we live, have moments when we think that the odds are just too great, that life's grandest accomplishments are for someone else. And it's probably true that none of us will ever know the feeling of stepping onto the surface of the moon. But this is really not about the moon. This is about the limitless capacity of the human heart. So if there are moments when you begin to question what is out there for you, here's a suggestion: . Come to Wapakoneta sometime. And look at the sky. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Wapakoneta is a tiny town in northwest Ohio .

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says a beer summit wouldn't unite Chicago police veterans and protesters remembering 1968 conflict. (CNN) -- Beer summits at the White House notwithstanding, not all controversies between the police and the citizens they serve are destined to turn into gauzy, orchestrated ""teachable moments."" Some wounds are so deep that they just may last forever. Which is a lesson in itself. As interesting an evening as I have spent this year took place earlier this summer on a Chicago, Illinois, street well west of downtown. ""Just wanted to come spend time with some old friends,"" said Tom Dempsey, 67, as he arrived at the lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, next door to a plumbers' union training center. He had plenty of company. This was the first reunion of Chicago police officers assigned to the streets during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Not to diminish the heat of the emotions in Cambridge, Massachusetts, this summer, but in terms of international attention being focused on a police department, what happened in Cambridge was rather mild. The mayhem on the streets of Chicago during that long-ago August week, captured on film and in still photographs, has emblemized a moment in history. A federal commission used the term ""police riot""; for more than 40 years the officers who were there have been offended and angry about that. So here they were in 2009, retirees in shorts and in golf shirts, in natty blazers and in khaki trousers. ""A celebration?"" said Bill Jaconetti, 66. ""A celebration of what? This is just some former police officers getting together to remember when we were asked to protect a great American city."" He fully understood it wasn't as simple as that; it never has been. The organizers of the reunion had elected to use uncompromising language on the Web site announcing the event. The anti-war demonstrators of 1968 were ""Marxist street thugs""; criticism of the actions of the police was ""unwarranted, inaccurate and wrong."" The language was destined to get attention, and it did. Thus, half a block to the west of the lodge this summer, protesters were gathering behind police barricades. They felt that the organizers of the police reunion had mischaracterized and purposely insulted the anti-Vietnam war demonstrators of 1968; the police, for their part, have long believed that they were the ones who were provoked at that Democratic convention, that they were goaded in ways that were guaranteed to culminate with violent confrontations. Now, on this summer evening in 2009, the protesters, many of them not born in 1968, looked toward the arriving retired officers and chanted: ""No justice! No peace! No riot police!"" The whole world wasn't watching. In Grant Park near Chicago's lakefront -- site of some of the ugliest convention-week battles of 1968 -- hundreds of thousands of people had congregated on this day in 2009. It had nothing to do with the police reunion. Taste of Chicago, the annual food-and-music festival, had opened its 10-day run. Miles distant from that, out on Washington Boulevard, there were perhaps a few hundred retired officers in the lodge, and a lesser number of demonstrators to the west. Anyone three blocks away would have been unaware of either group. Many of the marquee players from the famous Democratic convention -- Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin from the dissenters, the first Mayor Richard Daley from the city, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley from the national media that spread the pictures -- are dead. And the former police officers who were approaching the front door of the lodge? ""I know there were probably a lot of peaceful demonstrators in '68 who didn't want all that to happen,"" said John Wotring, 63, who had flown up from his home in Sanford, Florida. The one remnant from his life as a street cop is that the nickname his buddies had for him -- ""Johnny Wo"" -- is now, in retirement, a proud part of his e-mail address. They're on the back nine of life. ""You ask about your buddy -- you say, 'How's so-and-so doing?' "" said John Murray, 62, who was 21 during convention week. ""You get the answer: 'He died' "" The calls of this year's protesters summoned certain echoes. Murray said: ""I was the age of the demonstrators in '68. I was a kid, too. But all they saw was the uniform."" The two sides didn't speak to each other then, and not much seemed to have changed. ""I think it's fine they're here,"" said retired officer Harold Brown. ""It's a nice night. They're not hurting anyone."" But the people chanting, kept at a distance, could not hear him. John Eshoo, 68, formerly of the 18th District, said, ""Was I angry convention week? No. I was just so amazed that we were being faced with what we were being faced with."" There's never going to be common ground, or an inch given on either side, even after everyone who was at the famous convention is gone. ""I had served as a Marine corporal in Vietnam for 13 months,"" said Ken Lavorata, 64. ""And then I came home and joined the Chicago police and there I was."" The truly radical thing, on a 21st-century summer evening, would have been for someone to take down the wooden barricades at the end of the block and let the cops and those who were chanting toward them get together and talk. But if that was going to happen, it would have happened long ago. ""I wasn't a big fan of the war, either,"" said retired patrol officer Murray, on a night so pretty it made you half-believe that life can be like that.

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- To say Gregory David Roberts has witnessed much in his life would be an understatement. The 57-year-old native Australian was sentenced in the late 1970s for a series of armed robberies.   He escaped prison and found his way to Mumbai, India, where he lived for 10 years forging a new life, including work as a doctor in the city's slums.   Roberts' other career highlights? He joined the mafia in Mumbai, fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan and married a princess. CNN's Anjali Rao spoke with Roberts in Mumbai, the setting and inspiration for ""Shantaram,"" the novel loosely based on his life. Watch Roberts talk about his life in the slum .

CNN: Is it kind of strange that you used to live here, and you were down to your last pennies I guess, and now when you come back here it's with CNN, or Madonna and Guy Richie. Is it kind of strange the way that your life has just taken that change, that turn? Roberts: No, I know this sounds strange, but I think it was to be expected. I had a dramatic change that occurred in my life 19 years ago. I changed the orientation of my life, took control of my life. I think that if you do that, and you stay true to it, and you stay true to a set of principles -- of being fair, honest, positive, and creative in what you do; of pledging not to harm others, and to minimize any amount of harm that you do to other people or to the world around you; you don't take drugs, you don't poison your mind, you don't take alcohol; you focus on what you're doing, keep your discipline -- then I think it's natural that positive outcomes will occur. There's a sense in which it's a natural progression, from taking control of your life and saying, ""I'm going to make my destiny happen. I'm not going to allow destiny to control me, I'm going to control my destiny."" I think that we can expect it to happen in those ways, so it's not really a surprise. The thing is, it's not surprising that I've come to know these people; the surprising thing for me is that they are almost universally nice people. I haven't met anyone at that level -- whether it's Richard Branson, or Johnny Depp, or Madonna, to name a couple -- who are not very, very nice people, and deeply concerned about the world they live in, and trying to make a difference.

"(CNN) -- Come election time in November, voters in five states might have a decision to make as big as whom to elect president. Ballot initiatives have been proposed in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma that would give voters the chance to decide whether they want to do away with affirmative action in government-funded projects and public schools. Ward Connerly, who heads the American Civil Rights Coalition -- a nonprofit organization working to end racial and gender preferences -- and the main backer of the ballot initiatives, says the 37 word initiative would read: ""The state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting."" ""It would forbid any state or local agency or special district from engaging in preferential treatment,"" Connerly said. Watch what Connerly says about the initiative » . Connerly, who is of African-American and American Indian descent, said affirmative action causes resentment. He criticized cases in which a Caucasian student might be denied a college slot in favor of a black student with a lower grade-point average. ""It's foolish not to think that the kid who is turned away is not going to ... resent that,"" Connerly said. Connerly, who grew up in Leesville, Louisiana, said he experienced oppression because of his skin color during his youth. ""If it was wrong when I was born in '39 ... it's wrong now,"" he said. ""If it was wrong to do it against a brown-skinned man, it's wrong to do it against a white man."" Shanta Driver, National Director of United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund -- an organization dedicated to integrating minority students in educational institutions -- said the ballot initiative is a mistake. ""It places us in the position of denying ... equal opportunity to blacks and Latinos,"" she said. Watch Driver explain her position on the initiative » . Driver and other affirmative action supporters believe this movement would erase the progress made since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ""It's obviously a huge step backwards,"" she said. The ballot initiative, dubbed the Civil Rights Initiative, has already passed in California, Michigan and Washington. Some 140,000 signed petitions have been submitted in Oklahoma. Backers in the remaining four states have until late March to early July to collect enough signatures for the initiative to be on the November ballot. If successful, the ballot measures would cut off tax dollars for programs offering preferential treatment based on gender or race. The issue may have some support in the Supreme Court. In June, justices threw out public school choice plans that relied on race. That leaves many states uncertain about whether their affirmative action policies will stand up in court and against political scrutiny in this election year.

"(CNN) -- Italian veteran Alessandro Petacchi won his second stage of the 2010 Tour de France on Wednesday as cycling's premier event returned to less testing terrain after two days of crash-marred racing. Petacchi triumphed in the fourth leg from Cambrai to Reims as last year's top sprinters Thor Hushovd and Mark Cavendish could manage only ninth and 12th respectively. Fabian Cancellara retained the leader's yellow jersey as he came home 26th in the 163-strong peloton in the same time as last year's winner Alberto Contador (32nd) and seven-time champion Lance Armstrong (36th). British rider Cavendish, who won six stages last year, had a better day after struggling in the wet and on the cobble stones of previous runs but will be disappointed after being forced out of contention at the final sprint. Petacchi timed his dash to perfection as he followed up his win in the first stage into the Belgian capital of Brussels, where several crashes dented the hopes of Cavendish among others. The Lampre team rider came home in three hours 34 minute and 55 seconds to edge out New Zealander Julian Dean and Norway's Edvald Hagen Boasson, with Australian Robbie McEwen fourth and South Africa's Robert Hunter fifth. Saxo Bank's Cancellara retained a 23-second lead over Team Sky's Geraint Thomas, who was 19th, while third-placed Australian Cadel Evans remained a further 16 seconds back after ending in 16th. Hushovd retained the sprinters' green points jersey that he won overall last year and in 2005, but had his margin trimmed to 10 points by Petacchi and acknowledged the threat posed by the 36-year-old -- back at the Tour for the first time since 2004. ""I don't know what happened at the finish today, I just had nothing in the legs when I started to sprint. I just felt tired and I couldn't go in the last couple of hundred meters,"" Hushovd told the Tour de France website. ""Yesterday and the day before I went really deep and I think I'm paying for it now. I still have a lead in the green jersey competition but you saw today that I lost a lot of points to Petacchi and McEwen. It was a fast and nervous sprint today and in the last corner I was too far back. ""I think I spent too much energy to fight with Cavendish and, when Petacchi went on the left, I just couldn't sprint. Petacchi is a threat to the green jersey. He seems really strong now and, if he wants to, he come make it all the way to Paris. ""I'm surprised by how well Alessandro is going. I know he's a good, strong rider but to come back to the Tour de France like he has is impressive."" Swiss rider Cancellara was happy to have an uneventful day after losing teammate Frank Schleck on Tuesday. ""My team was happy and I think many other teams were pleased. We needed something like this after tough, hard, nervous, and stressful opening stages,"" he said. ""We've spent a lot of energy and we need to recover a bit because soon we'll get to the Alps, and that's when another sort of music will play.""","Alessandro Petacchi claims victory on stage four of the Tour de France in sprint finish .

"Editor's note: Below is a chapter from CNN executive producer and author Suzanne Simons' new book, ""Master of War: Blackwater's Erik Prince and the Global Business of War."" This excerpt recounts a trip Prince made to Afghanistan in November 2007. Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, is pictured in Afghanistan in November 2007. (CNN) -- The group would be met by a Blackwater security team in Kabul, Afghanistan. They would be escorted from one meeting to another with employees of the Department of State, the CIA, and the Department of Defense. Erik Prince wanted to know how his company was being perceived half a world away from the Washington media. In addition to the contracts with the CIA and with Defense for airlifting supplies to troops, Blackwater had guards working for the Department of State at the U.S. embassy annex in Kabul. Finally, his men trained Afghans for border patrol and narcotics interdiction. All four contracts needed to be handled with care, given the new controversies the company faced. Prince had realistic hopes of gaining some new business. Clashes between coalition forces and the Taliban along the country's borders had been brutal, and Prince was already in the business of training Afghans to stop the illicit flow of drugs that was believed to be funding the insurgency. Surely more could be done. Afghanistan was a big market for Blackwater, and Prince hoped he could expand his business on this trip. ... The 2½-hour flight to Kabul was packed with a combination of contractors, military types and some random folk who looked as if they had stepped off a movie set. In fact, just a few rows behind Prince sat a bald actor who had played a cameo role in an Indiana Jones movie. For Prince, the trip was not just about clients; it was also a chance to meet some of the eclectic, modern-day soldiers of fortune who worked under him. Prince and his companions were met on the ground by a two-vehicle Blackwater team led by former FBI special agent Ricky ""C.T."" Chambers. After his earlier work for the bureau investigating the embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, he had become Blackwater's regional director of training in Afghanistan in 2003 for the Drug Enforcement Agency and Afghan narcotics interdiction contracts, as well as the Afghan border police training programs. C.T. knew everyone in Kabul. He liked his job, particularly because he was one of the few men who could live in Afghanistan with his wife, a British beauty whom he'd met years earlier during his FBI days in Kenya. M.C., as she liked to be called, now ran Blackwater's administrative efforts in the country, including the oversight of some 40 local nationals. C.T. greeted the boss with a handshake and a bulletproof vest. There had been a suicide bombing in the capital that morning, and at least a few people were killed. It happened not far from Blackwater's safe houses, and some of the employees had gone to the roof to get a better look at the huge plume of smoke rising from the site of the attack. Suicide bombings were becoming more common in the capital, even in broad daylight in crowded areas where security was present. Taliban insurgents were wiring up Afghans who were mentally or physically disabled, the underprivileged who would sit along the side of the busy streets hoping for someone to drop money into their laps. When a U.S. convoy or other acceptable target got close enough, militants would remotely detonate their victims. Prince put on his vest for a five-minute ride to the other side of the airport. One of his planes was being prepared to take him to the country's largest airfield, where his own pilots were based. There were armed security guards in each of the two Blackwater SUVs, but Prince kept his own Glock on the seat next to him. He kept his eyes open as the convoy moved along the crowded Kabul streets, where fresh meat carcasses hung out to dry and barefooted kids played in the narrow, dust-ridden alleyways. He particularly watched for teenagers on cell phones, standing on corners. He had seen intelligence information suggesting teens were being paid by insurgents to scout out Western convoys and report their coordinates for a possible attack. Once safely inside the airport's perimeter, Prince and his team made their way to the Blackwater plane sitting on the tarmac. He greeted his pilots and asked how things were going. They assured him that the Department of Defense was happy with the job they were doing. Despite the crash of Blackwater Flight 61 into the side of a mountain two years earlier, Presidential Airways had continued to sign contracts with the Pentagon several times since then, including a $91 million-a-year contract to provide air support in Guam. Prince's company had eight Cessna aircraft in Afghanistan, working for the Department of Defense. His men flew everything from drug eradication missions to bundle drops. Many of them were high-risk flights from forward operating bases in the countryside. If there was an architect of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, it had been the Central Intelligence Agency. While Prince had used his connection to A. B. ""Buzzy"" Krongard, the former executive director of the CIA, to get his first black contract for security work, the agency had continued to renew Blackwater's work, even after Krongard left. At the secret CIA post, Prince met with a handful of his men who had come to greet him. Several of them looked as if they had walked out of an X-Files convention: long hair, plaid flannel shirts and baggy pants worn much further down than pants were meant to be worn. Prince, in keeping with his conservative upbringing, gave some of them a hard time about their appearance, but they insisted it was what worked best among the local population. Prince's men had apparently made the CIA happy, providing static security and performing unknown other tasks. But some in the European Parliament suspected that Prince's Presidential Airways had operated rendition flights for the CIA, and said so in a report. An attorney for Prince pressed the European Parliament for proof to support such a claim, but proof never materialized. The attorney insisted the statements in the report were false and demanded a correction. While the possibility of Prince's companies taking part seemed plausible, Prince denied it ever happened. ... Eight deputies of Gen. Rahman, the general in charge of the Afghan border police, were already waiting in a large office on the second floor of the two-story building when Prince arrived. He took a seat on a large sofa and listened as the general, through an interpreter, gave him an update on just how Blackwater's training program was working out. Prince's men were responsible not only for training the Afghan force in firearms procedures, but for equipping them as well. It was the ""one-stop shopping"" that Prince had put into place for his law enforcement and Special Forces clients back at Blackwater's Moyock facility so many years earlier. ""Make yourself indispensable to the client,"" he had said, ""and you'll always have work.""","Blackwater is a private military contractor that was founded in 1997 by Erik Prince .

"(CNN) -- Jason Moran is a jazz musician who has one foot in the past, one in the future and a career grounded in the present. From the past, Moran has built on the tradition of Thelonious Monk and other jazz greats. For the future, Moran looks to a new crop of musicians, teaching the next group of performers. In the present, there is his new album, ""TEN."" Moran shares where he has been and why ""knowing when to 'shut up' is extremely important."" Who are you? How do you define yourself? I am Jason Moran, son of Mary and Andrew Moran, brother of Yuri and Tai Moran, husband of Alicia Hall Moran, father of Jonas and Malcolm Moran. I define myself as an American jazz pianist, father and teacher. Music is my livelihood and art is my life. My fatherhood is contribution to the earth, and my music is my contribution to the function of humans. What is something that everyone should know about you? I'm a jazz pianist that makes a living by composing/teaching/performing music. I compose music for my band, for film and in collaboration with artists of all genres. From Simon Schama to Kara Walker. I am currently on faculty at the New England Conservatory. I've been teaching since 1998. I was a student to a lot of great teachers, and now I enjoy sharing my experience with the younger musicians coming up the jazz ladder. I perform about 130 concerts per year around the world. Music is my life. What prepared you for where you are now? The village that raised me in Houston, Texas, prepared me for where I am now. The village is my aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, brothers. ... The values I learned as a young boy in Houston are what have been integral to my success. Southern hospitality is a serious characteristic. Knowing when to ""shut up"" is extremely important. Knowing how to show respect to older people/musicians is a major factor as well. I work with people from 20 to 80, and each musician is different. Having older musicians tell me early on, sometimes very bluntly, what they liked or didn't like in my playing also helped. There is a jazz village that raises its young jazz musician[s]. The jazz village has helped my career tremendously, and prepared me for the climate today as a contemporary musician. What is the biggest obstacle you've ever had to overcome? How did you get there? Deciding to be a jazz musician was the largest obstacle, because I did not understand how to make a living as one. I figured it out once I began working and touring. I got there by studying vigorously, and asking questions of myself and my peers. I studied and conceptualized ideas so much that when the big opportunity arose, performing with then-Blue Note artist Greg Osby, I took the music by the reins and began to run wild with it. What would you tell your younger self about who you are now? How would you advise your younger self about how to get to where you are now? I wouldn't tell my younger self anything. All of the good and bad things that happened to me on my journey all inform me of how to live as a contemporary artist/musician. And I cannot complain about where I am. What are your guilty pleasures? My guilty pleasure is buying contemporary art. An expensive habit I usually cannot afford. What do you believe in? I believe that music can heal.","Jason Moran performs jazz all over the world and also teaches music to the next generation .

"(CNN) -- Nokia Siemens Networks said Friday it rejects a lawsuit filed in a U.S. court by a jailed Iranian journalist and his son, who have accused the European telecommunications company of providing the Iranian government the tools to spy on its own citizens. ""The Saharkhiz lawsuit is brought in the wrong place, against the wrong party and on the wrong premise,"" the company announced in a statement e-mailed to CNN. ""The Saharkhizes allege brutal treatment by the government in Iran, but they have not sued that government. Instead, they are seeking to blame Nokia Siemens Networks for the acts of the Iranian authorities by filing a lawsuit in the U.S., a country that has absolutely no connection to the issue they are raising."" Earlier this week, New Jersey-based Iranian blogger Mehdi Saharkhiz filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court against Nokia Siemens Networks on behalf of his father, Isa, who has been in an Iranian prison since July 2009. The lawsuit accuses the telecommunications company of helping the Iranian government establish ""spying centers"" that allegedly were used to monitor Saharkhiz's cell phone communications. Isa Saharkhiz is just one of hundreds of outspoken critics of the Iranian government to have been arrested as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on opposition leaders over the past year. ""Nokia gave the technology that made this arrest possible,"" said Mehdi Saharkhiz, in an interview with CNN. ""When these people arrested my dad they said, 'We traced your phone.'"" This is not the first time the joint venture between Nokia and Siemens has come under fire from activists critical of the company's dealings with the Iranian government. Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi previously accused Nokia Siemens Network of supplying the technology to allow the government to monitor cell phone calls and text messages. There have also been reports of boycotts of Nokia products inside Iran. Last June, a top executive from Nokia Siemens defended his company's decision to supply a telephone ""monitoring center"" to Iran in 2008 during an appearance before the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights. Barry French, a member of Nokia Siemens' executive board, argued that law enforcement agencies around the world require ""Lawful Interception"" capability from mobile phone operators ""as a condition of their license to operate."" French said the technology is necessary to combat child pornography, drug trafficking and terrorism. However, he acknowledged that his company miscalculated when it came to providing monitoring centers to Iran. ""We halted all work related to monitoring centers in Iran in 2009, including service and support,"" French said, according to a statement distributed by his company's press office. ""We believe we should have understood the issues in Iran better in advance and addressed them more proactively."" Nokia Siemens says it sold off its monitoring center business in March 2009. One prominent Iranian human rights group has applauded the Saharkhiz lawsuit against Nokia Siemens. ""We have to make sure international corporations are not enablers of the Iranian governments' human rights crimes,"" said Hadi Ghaemi of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. ""Even if Nokia Siemens manages to escape a judgment in this case, the message to other corporations will be loud and clear to stay away from such business deals."" As for Isa Saharkhiz, he appeared in a Tehran court last month to face charges of ""plotting to overthrow the government."" After a year in prison, during which Saharkhiz claims he was beaten by his captors, the journalist's health has declined considerably. His son says he can move only with the help of a wheelchair due to back problems. More recently, Mehdi Saharkhiz says, his father's blood pressure has soared to dangerous levels. More then a month after his trial, Saharkhiz is still in prison awaiting a verdict.","Iranian accuses the telecom company of helping the Iran government spy .

"(CNN) -- He may not be hitting the fairways with the same bite as he did in his 1980s heyday, but the man sports commentators nicknamed ""The Great White Shark"" still has plenty of appetite for the game. Plenty of bite: Norman is one of golf's most successful and recognizable stars. Earlier this month Greg Norman appeared in the British Open, 23 years after his debut major win. Yet while he's still driving for success on the course, off it he's taken his life in a different direction. Under his Great White Shark Enterprises company he has numerous business ventures from property, golf course design and turfing to restaurants, wine and even Australian beef. ""There are very, very few athletes that do that on a global basis and to do it takes a lot of energy. You have to be on the ball, you have to be because you are the brand, you are that person walking around,"" he told CNN. Unlike many sports people thinking about their life after sport, he made the conscious decision that he didn't want to end up in a commentary box after his days on the links. ""I think it just grew out of reality, being very much realistic in my 40s. I knew I didn't want to play golf for the rest of my life professionally. I knew physically I couldn't do it as number 1, so I had to think to the future. I wanted to know where I was going to be when I was 60,"" he said. Now 54, Norman took up golf at the age of 15. During his career he spent 331 weeks as the game's number 1-ranked player. Having hit the heights with two British Open titles and a total of 20 U.S. PGA wins, he also suffered his share of disappointments, losing leads and never clinching a U.S. Masters or U.S. Open. ""With golf, you're going to have your ups and downs. You're going to win some, you're going to lose some,"" he said. And it's a reflectively mentality he's taken with him into the business world. ""You have to learn by your mistakes, and in business I've made mistakes. You learn by it, and you build on those mistakes. ... By learning how to build a brand, I had to learn about business. So. ... all that tied into one, and I enjoy the process. I enjoy the idea of being the brand, living the brand."" Away from being the brand, a high-profile wedding in June 2008 to retired American tennis champion Chris Evert (after both had ended long term marriages) provided headlines away from the back pages. For Norman, Evert has given his life, and even his golfing game, new impetus. ""She's been a great support and a role model in a lot of ways ... She brings a lot of peace and calm and happiness around in my life, so it makes it easy for me to go out there and enjoy the things I love to do,"" he said. One of which is expanding his brand into new and challenging territories, including bringing more opportunities to China's growing number of golfers. ""Golf is a great outlet in many ways, you know. It's got a lot of emotional qualities about it, and the Chinese are very, very strong in their mind. They're very, very strong in their belief in doing something. And I think golf completely suits their mentality and style and their physical abilities,"" he said.","Australian golfer spent 331 weeks as world number 1; won two British Open titles .

"New York (CNN) -- Former pro basketball star Jayson Williams was sentenced to an additional year in prison Friday after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office. Williams had a blood-alcohol level of more than twice the legal limit when he crashed his Mercedes into a tree in lower Manhattan in January -- just a week before he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for accidentally shooting and killing a limousine driver in New Jersey, the district attorney's office told CNN. The year will be added on to the current five-year prison sentence the former NBA player is serving in state prison in New Jersey. He also was also slapped with a $16,433 fine to repair the tree he hit. Williams had been sentenced to five years in prison after fatally shooting his limo driver, Costas ""Gus"" Christofi, in February 2002 at his New Jersey estate. Christofi had been hired to drive the former athlete and several of his friends to dinner after a sporting event in Pennsylvania. The group, including four members of the Harlem Globetrotters, later went back to Williams' home. The prosecution argued that Williams was recklessly handling a 12-gauge shotgun when it discharged and that he and two others tried to make it look as if Christofi had shot himself. Williams, who retired from the NBA in 1999 because of a leg injury, played nine seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Nets.","Jayson Williams is sentenced for driving while intoxicated .

"McDONOUGH, Georgia (CNN) -- Huddling in a dark parking lot outside a budget motel near Camp Shelby, Mississippi, the Callaway family held on to the two things they value most in this world: their faith and each other. Ryan Callaway, left, Jared, center, and Seth enjoy a moment before shipping out to Afghanistan in June. Crying, Mark and Karmen Callaway and their daughter Anna Katheryn clutched the family's three soldier sons before the trio shipped off to serve in Afghanistan. Karmen wasn't thinking about how rare it is for three brothers to go off to war together. She was thinking about Ryan, 25, Jared, 23, and 20-year-old Seth all returning home unharmed. ""I know people lose their children every day,"" Karmen said a week later as she sat in her kitchen in McDonough, Georgia.  Watch the Callaway family on how they cope » . ""A fear that I have is that something might happen to all three of them. But at the same time, I have an assurance that I will see them again."" Mark Callaway, describing the farewell, said he was trying to ignore a group of curious beer-drinking construction workers gathered around a nearby truck watching the tearful scene play out. ""These construction workers saw three boys crying and Karmen and Anna Katheryn crying, and I'm sure they were wondering what's going on, because the boys were still in their civilian clothes,"" Mark said with a smirk. ""It was just rough leaving the three of them."" Anna Katheryn, at age 18 the family's youngest child, seemed confident about her brothers' safety with U.S. and other NATO forces fighting Taliban and al Qaeda some 7,400 miles away. ""They're Callaways,"" she said with a smile. ""They're going to be all right. Sometimes, it does worry me, but you have to give it to Jesus and know that he's going to take care of them."" Family sacrifice . All three brothers are serving in Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment of the 48th Brigade, Georgia Army National Guard. The Pentagon says it's unusual for three siblings to serve in the same Army company, which consists of about 100 to 125 soldiers. But it's not unheard of. Siblings who enlist in the National Guard in the same state are more likely to serve together because Guard forces are state-based units, military officials said. Enlistees in regular armed forces could be deployed in units based across the nation. For example, Nevada's Army National Guard counts nine sets of brothers among its ranks deploying for Afghanistan this summer, according to a spokesman. There are no regulations banning siblings from serving together, but for obvious reasons, commanders don't send siblings on the same missions. Carol and Michael Ewens of Gig Harbor, Washington, know the worry of having multiple sons in battle and the pain of losing a child to war. In 2006, an Afghan roadside bomber killed their 25-year-old son, Army Lt. Forrest Ewens. Now, three more of their sons will be serving in the region. Lt. Oaken Ewens, 28, and Staff Sgt. Elisha Ewens, 26, are in the Army's 10th Mountain Division. Just six weeks after his brother's death, their youngest son Stephen Ewens, now 24, announced he had enlisted in the Army's 2nd Infantry Division -- eventually deploying with a Stryker brigade. ""I threatened to shoot him in the foot,"" his mother joked. ""I felt almost like doing something to make him ineligible to go because I didn't want to have a third son there. But no matter how much I begged and cried, it didn't count."" Fighting in the same war that took his brother's life ""was something he felt like he had to do,"" Carol Ewens said. ""It was part of his expression of honoring Forrest and grieving for Forrest and wanting to carry on what Forrest was doing."" She said she relies on God to pull her through. ""My faith has been the only thing that has given me peace with Forrest's death, so I have to prepare myself and trust that God has a greater plan,"" she said. ""When one of my children is taken away from me, I have to believe that it's good."" God and country . Reminders of God and country dot the Callaways' rural Georgia neighborhood about 40 miles southeast of Atlanta. ""God bless our troops,"" said a roadside sign outside a church along a two-lane roadway in Henry County. Afghanistan is the second war that Ryan and Jared Callaway have fought for their country. From 2005 to 2006, they also served in Iraq. But Afghanistan will be the first war for Seth, whom Karmen Callaway calls her ""baby boy."" ""I just know that he is going to do something very important over there,"" she said. Karmen and her husband recall how the brothers as kids would pretend to be soldiers in the woods behind their house. ""They were always out there playing army and making bike trails,"" said Mark. ""They're still playing war, too, but they're playing it for real this time."" Sitting at the kitchen table at the family home, Karmen is surrounded by three sparkling ornamental stars hanging from a shelf on the wall -- reminders of her sons. Karmen said she'll be comforted by the thought that her boys will be relatively close to each other. ""They might see each other some, but it won't be like they're together all the time,"" Karmen said. For most parents, protecting young sons or daughters who aren't serving in a war zone can be stressful enough. Karmen bears the added burden of preparing herself for an unspeakable possibility -- something she learned to deal with when the oldest two were in Iraq. When describing each of her sons, Karmen briefly began to cry. After quickly pulling herself together, she held out three rocks -- all smaller than her palm -- marked with the words, ""count your blessings,"" ""pray,"" and ""laugh."" Each of her sons, Karmen explained, carries a rock with a special word describing their personalities. Ryan's rock is imprinted with ""accomplish."" Jared's bears ""courage."" Seth's says ""strength."" The stones represent her assurance that she will see her sons again, she said. They're meant to ease her worries during the yearlong deployment. Family of educators . The Callaways are a family of educators. Karmen, who teaches an after-school program at a nearby elementary school, will pursue a teaching degree this summer, before returning to help students in the fall. Daughter-in-law Louie just wrapped up her first year as a teacher -- after eloping with husband Ryan. ""We met in November and got married in January, so it's just been crazy,"" said Louie, her family's nickname for Louise. ""The most stressful part was taking a week off work and going to Mississippi ... so I have my students to think about -- getting them prepared for eighth grade -- and my husband's leaving for Afghanistan. So that was a bit overwhelming, I would say."" Louie and Ryan have almost daily contact, thanks to the Internet, as do Jared and his wife, Heather. Sometimes, when Ryan and Louie chat by phone, Louie feels the need to be upbeat and ""try to have something good to tell him."" ""He doesn't want to hear my play-by-play about the students, and I don't want to hear about the danger he's in,"" she said, looking at Karmen across the kitchen. The Callaway home is decorated with scores of family photos in every room. A large, round, old-fashioned analog clock hangs above the family room fireplace, as if the Callaways need to be reminded of the passage of time. The Callaways' 'miracle' In a room off the foyer, Anna Katheryn sometimes plays the family's baby grand piano, a talent that -- in retrospect -- seems more like a miracle to Karmen and Mark. On a rainy night in 2001, Anna Katheryn and Jared nearly lost their lives when their vehicle hydroplaned and Jared lost control of the car. The Honda flipped off the road and into a fence post, leaving Jared shaken and Anna Katheryn in a coma for seven days, Karmen recalled. Doctors told the family that Anna Katheryn probably had suffered brain damage and that they should ""be prepared for a different child."" With support from their church and after multiple surgeries and rehabilitation, AK-47, as she's nicknamed, made a full recovery, graduating from high school with honors this year, her mother said. The real-life nightmare provided Karmen with a valuable lesson in faith that she plans to lean on during the coming months. ""What I learned during that time is that if something were to happen to one of my children, God could sustain me and I could go on,"" she said. She turned to look at the kitchen shelf and the hanging trio of ornamental stars -- gifts from an Army family support group. ""I got three because I have three soldiers, and we decided to put them up and keep them up until the boys return,"" Karmen said quietly. ""That will help us when we're in the kitchen and when they're not around. We will feel that they're near us.""","It's unusual: Three brothers serve in same Georgia National Guard company .

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry called on the Obama administration Monday to deploy more resources to the United States' border with Mexico, two days after a bullet -- likely from a gun battle between drug traffickers and Mexican police -- struck an El Paso building. It's the second time in two months that bullets from shootouts across the border have strayed into Texas, Perry said. ""By the grace of God, the stray bullets from these incidents have yet to injure or kill a Texan,"" he said. ""It is unconscionable that the Obama administration is gambling with American lives, betting that escalating violence from these cartels won't eventually shed the blood of innocent people on U.S. soil."" In Saturday's incident, a bullet struck a building on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso, the university's President Diana Natalicio said. No injuries were reported at the school. That same evening, a ""major gun battle"" between drug traffickers and Mexican authorities broke out in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, just 30 yards from the U.S. border at El Paso, a U.S. Border Patrol spokesman said. Three police officers were injured and one armed suspect was killed in the clash, Mexican federal police spokesman Ramon Salinas said. The bullet found at the university likely came from the shootout, border patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said. ""We must ensure El Paso and other border communities remain a safe place for people to live, work and raise a family,"" Perry said. ""It's time for Washington to stop the rhetoric and immediately deploy a [significant] force of personnel and resources to the border to protect our homeland."" During Saturday's clash, U.S. authorities blocked off a four-mile section of Paisano Street, which runs parallel to the Rio Grande, the international border. Cordero said the closing was the first time authorities have been forced to take such action due to activity across the border. Natalicio said the university will consult with law enforcement and government officials about possible further security precautions. Cordero said his agency doesn't plan to change its security methods, saying border patrol agents are still maintaining the integrity of the border and operating as usual. The shootout took place less than two months after shots fired from a gun battle originating in Juarez crossed into El Paso and hit City Hall, damaging the building. CNN's Nick Valencia and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Gov. Rick Perry wants the White House to deploy more resources to the border .

"(CNN) -- A property dispute between family members apparently led to a shooting in which a man killed two people in the central Virginia town of Louisa before he was shot by police, authorities said. Four others were wounded when the man began shooting outside a home Sunday afternoon, police said. ""This was part of a property dispute,"" Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Monday.  ""Due to a death in the family, there was a dispute over who owns the property, and who has rights to it."" The shooter, Charles ""Zeke"" Sponaugle Sr., had been living at the property recently, Geller said. The incident began when deputies responded to a report of an argument at the home, police said. Believing the situation had been resolved, the deputies left the home. But shortly before 5 p.m., authorities received another call about an active shooting at the residence, said Maj. Donnie Lowe of the Louisa County Sheriff's Office. When officers arrived, a man was shooting at people in the front yard. Two people were killed and four were wounded, said Sgt. Thomas Molnar of the Virginia State Police. The man then directed his gunfire at police and released a pit bull terrier on them, authorities said. ""Based on evidence at the scene, as soon as deputies arrived they were in an active shooting situation,"" Geller said.  She said authorities believe that return fire from deputies killed both the suspect and the dog. No deputies were wounded. ""Since 2000, deputies have been to this property 23 times,"" Lowe said. ""The calls were pretty much all the same -- family arguments, people not getting along -- nothing really violent, mostly verbal."" He added, ""You can't predict something like this."" The four wounded people were taken to the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Molnar said. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","NEW: Shooting was result of a property dispute, police said .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- I'm standing in a land of culinary legends with steaming bowls of turtle soup, plates of deliciously seasoned Louisiana blue crabs, Creole cochon de lait, and too many delectable desserts to imagine swirling past on the raised trays of waiters. The smell of some of the world's finest cooking fills the air, along with the steady hum of expertise as each piece of beef is seared, each shrimp broiled, each crusty baguette done to perfection. This is the kitchen at the New Orleans landmark, Commander's Palace, where Paul Prudhomme, Emeril Lagasse and so many others have sharpened their knives and palates. And in the cherished seat of executive chef these days, Tory McPhail knows he is not merely presiding over a history of gastronomic excellence, but also building up a cornerstone of this city's comeback from Katrina. Almost unbelievably, there are 300 more restaurants here than before the big storm. Sure, that is more competition, but chef McPhail says, ""I embrace it! All these guys are opening up these little, tiny neighborhood funky spots, and I tell you this is really, really an exciting time to live here in the city. And the food is fantastic."" The restaurants, in this city so renowned for food, are leading the way in what has turned into a massively successful charge to reclaim the tourist trade wiped out by Katrina. Aggressive spending and marketing campaigns have seen attractions refurbished and facilities upgraded in almost every spot that tourists would normally go. For the Superdome, a $250 million makeover; for the Convention Center, $93 million in improvements; and $400 million has been spent refurbishing and building up hotels. The result? Conventions that were feared lost forever are coming back in droves. Tourists are rediscovering the Crescent City in all its charms and debauchery (because face it, a late-night walk down the blaring carnival of Bourbon Street is still one of the highlights for many visitors), and all the numbers that city and state leaders count on are trending up. Tax revenues are up. Overall tourist spending is up. And perhaps most importantly in this beleaguered town, of the 85,000 jobs in the tourism industry before the storm, 70,000 have been recovered despite the recession. Down at Jackson Square, with the iconic cathedral rising beside us, I hop onto a buggy with Willie Pickett, and his mule, Pierre, pulls us into the steady stream of tourists he relies on for fares all day. I ask him what he wants them to know about the city he grew up in. ""I want them to know that we love them and we want them to keep coming back. And everything they like and love about New Orleans is just like it was before Katrina."" Beyond the tourist attractions, in some neighborhoods, problems persist. In the 9th Ward, the return has been much slower; sometimes plagued by problems in housing, insurance, bad contractors, and on the hottest, bleakest days, a prevailing sense of despair. But everyone here knew that the No. 1 job-producing industry had to come back if anything was to get better, and that business, tourism, is rocketing forward. The year before Katrina was a record-breaker, with 10 million visitors and almost $5 billion coming to town. New Orleans is not back to that level yet, but it is are much closer than many had hoped. At the Convention and Visitors Bureau, Kelly Schulz is paid to be upbeat, but she insists it's not just a sales pitch when she says, ""Everything in New Orleans that was broken during Katrina is being fixed now; not only back to where it was before, but even better."" She tells me that convention planners from other states who swore they would never come back are now calling her for help with reservations. As a former resident, I have some reference points. I know how incomparably lovely a streetcar ride to Uptown can be, followed by a long, lingering seafood dinner amid friends. I have walked all night in the Quarter, and enjoyed beignets nestled in mounds of powdered sugar as thick waves of fog rolled off of the river like something from a movie. I have danced until dawn in a steamy music club and walked out to the singing of mockingbirds and sunrise lighting up the live oak trees. In short, I have loved this town like no other for a lifetime. So as I leave Commander's Palace, I walk across the street to a little art galley. Inside, it is cool.   The owner and some friends are chatting amid bright images of the bayous, wildlife and the town itself. I stroll around looking at the art, and through the windows at the neighborhood outside, and it is easy to see the beguiling charm coming through once again, the beauty and uniqueness that have drawn visitors here for 300 years, and five years after the disaster, is calling them down to the river again.","New Orleans has 300 more restaurants than it did before Hurricane Katrina .

"(CNN) -- A young baseball phenom has received one of the sport's highest honors -- recognition from the National Baseball Hall of Fame for pitching not one, but two perfect games. And while a perfect game -- defined as one in which the pitcher allows no hits and no walks -- is a rare occurrence for the sport, what makes this 13-year-old pitcher's feat even more impressive is that she did it against the boys. Yes, she. Chelsea Baker, once a student of former major league pitcher Joe Niekro, last week donated the jersey she wore to pitch one of those special games to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The jersey will be part of an exhibit dedicated to the importance of women in the sport, according to the museum. Chelsea, who until recently honed her pitching arm in Plant City, Florida's Little League program, told CNN Sunday that she feels ""really honored and blessed"" to be recognized on a national level at such an early age. In addition to her Hall of Fame achievement, Chelsea was also recently featured on ESPN's ""E:60"" series. Chelsea, who says she has been pitching since she was 7 years old, boasts a fastball in the mid-60s (miles per hour) and a baffling knuckleball that has been known to make her male opponents shed a tear. ""Yeah, when I strike them out with the knuckleball, sometimes they'll throw their helmets and start crying,"" she laughs. ""It's just really funny to watch."" It's a pitch that was perfected with help from Niekro, who was her team's batting pitcher before his death in 2006. ""He would always throw it to us and I could never hit it, and so I'd always beg him to teach it to me and finally one day he just taught it to me,"" she says. The knuckleball has helped propel Chelsea through four seasons without a loss with her Brandon Farms team -- and her batting average isn't bad either, hitting over .600 this season, though she notes ""I like pitching more than batting."" Chelsea is now participating in Baseball for All -- an organization that advocates for women in the sport -- playing on a touring all-girls team made up of players from around the country. And Chelsea says her career is only getting started. ""I want to play baseball for as long as I can,"" she says. ""I want to play high school baseball and then I also want to play on the USA girls' travel baseball team."" Watch out, boys.

"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- Severe overnight storms in the Chicago area caused power outages, flight cancellations and flooded homes and roadways. About 50,000 ComEd customers were without electricity Saturday morning after lightning and heavy downpours pummeled the city overnight, said Laura Micheli, a spokeswoman for the utility. It was unclear when power would be restored to those households because storms were still rolling through the area, she said. The outages started at about 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET) Friday night. CNN iReporter Nancy Holst of Lombard said her husband, who is a firefighter, responded to several calls overnight where he was working in waist-deep floodwaters. She said he took one look at her once-blooming garden now sitting under 6 inches of water and said, ""That's nothing."" The storms caused damage through Chicago suburbs before moving into downtown in the morning, she said. The bad weather also forced the cancellation of 200 flights at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport Saturday morning, according to Karen Pride of the Chicago Department of Aviation. There were delays of up to one hour at the airport at midday, she said, but no delays were reported at Midway International Airport. Pride said there was some airfield flooding at O'Hare Friday night, but flight operations were not affected.  The National Weather Service in Illinois reported that at least 6.3 inches of rain fell at O'Hare and 6.2 inches at Midway. CNN affiliate WGN reported more than 5 inches of rain were dumped over some parts of the Chicago area Saturday morning.  There were also reports of flooded basements and expressway closures.

"Washington (CNN) -- More U.S. soldiers killed themselves last month than in recent Army history, according to Army statistics released Thursday, confounding officials trying to reverse the grim trend. The statistics show that 32 soldiers killed themselves in June, the highest number in a single month since the Vietnam era. Twenty-one of them were on active duty, while 11 were in the National Guard or Army Reserve in an inactive status. Seven of those soldiers killed themselves while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the Army numbers. The spike comes after the monthly suicide numbers had dropped following a January high of 28, and Army officials admit they still haven't answered the question of why troops are committing suicide at a record rate. ""There were no trends to any one unit, camp, post or station,"" said Col. Chris Philbrick, head of the Army's suicide prevention task force. ""I have no silver bullet to answer the question why."" He said he could offer only what he has said before: ""Continued stress on the force and the opportunities we have been facing in terms of the challenges in the Army continue to cause these events to take place."" Including the June numbers, 145 soldiers have killed themselves this year, more than half of the total number for all of 2009, according to Army statistics. In 2009, a record-breaking year for suicides in the service, 245 soldiers killed themselves. In another attempt to put a halt to the trend, the Army released a suicide prevention video, a follow-up to one released last year. The updated video is designed to ""hit home"" with soldiers and instill the importance of getting help, Philbrick said. The video, titled ""Shoulder to Shoulder: I Will Never Quit,"" begins with the compelling story of a soldier whose wife said she was divorcing him. The soldier, Spc. Joseph Sanders, says his wife was his whole world. ""I grabbed my rifle, put it under my chin and pulled the trigger,"" Sanders says. The gun did not fire, he says, and when he took the rifle apart he discovered that a key part was missing. His Army buddy then tells viewers he removed the part because Sanders was showing signs that he could kill himself. Asked why the Army thinks this video will be more effective than the first one, Philbrick said the soldiers will relate to it better. Watch the video on the Army's Suicide Prevention website . The first video, made up of a mix of actors and real soldiers, ""sucked,"" he said. It was rushed out, and troops did not believe in it. He said some even openly laughed at it. ""This video has all real soldiers with real stories,"" Philbrick said. The video is part of a series of efforts to cut the suicide rate. Last year, the Army required all soldiers around the world to stop working and spend a day watching the first video and receiving suicide prevention training. Philbrick said the alarming June numbers will not bring another Army-wide training day, called a stand-down. He said the new video will be incorporated immediately into the standard suicide prevention training for new troops and the yearly training all soldiers go through.","The 32 Army suicides in June marked the highest number since the Vietnam era .

After his final round Woods was asked in a press conference if he was running low on gloves. He replied: ""No kidding, huh. I kept getting everybody out there today. No, but thank God I get them [gloves] for free."" He admitted his form is still patchy but that he was heading in the right direction: ""I have to take it step by step. It's a process.

"Tokyo, Japan(CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan is used to political lashings. But the latest one is not from an opposition party -- it's from his own wife. In a book released this week titled, ""What On Earth Will Change in Japan After You Become Prime Minister,"" first lady Nobuko Kan writes bluntly about her husband's shortcomings. The book says the prime minister is unable to cook a simple meal and has no fashion sense. But it's the blunt review of her husband's ability to govern that will raise eyebrows. She writes that her husband -- a grassroots politician -- is a good off the cuff speaker and is suited to working in supporting political roles. But as the world's second-largest economy's prime minister, she questions, ""Is it okay that this man is prime minister? Because I know him well."" Nobuko Kan says that her husband has trouble reading prepared scripts. Of his policy speech as prime minister, she writes that she couldn't give him a passing grade for his delivery. The marriage between the Kans spans four decades, and is widely regarded by the public as a pairing of equal minds. The prime minister speaks publicly about his sharp-tongued wife and how she is his toughest critic. In her book, she notes that most of their conversations are about politics. They disagree and debate the issues, she writes, from capital punishment to tax reform. The book is selling fast at a bookstore in downtown Tokyo. Yuko Soma, editor of Gentosha Inc. publishing company, says it issued 15,000 books for its first edition that went on sale Thursday. Sales have been so brisk, the company was publishing a second edition of 30,000 books, Soma said Friday morning. By Friday afternoon, Soma called CNN to say the publisher was boosting the second edition print to 60,000. Soma said the initial idea for the book came from Yusuke Nakagawa, an author and lifelong friend of the Kans. Nakagawa helped Kan come up with the idea of a ""spicy tell-all,"" Soma said. Japanese voters may not react badly to this unconventional turn by a first lady. The last prime minister's wife, Miyuki Hatoyama, was embraced by the public for her quirks. Hatoyama wrote that her soul rode on a triangular-shaped UFO and went to Venus, which was very beautiful and green. On a Japanese talk show, Hatoyama also claimed actor Tom Cruise was Japanese in a previous life and Cruise would know her if they met. On the same talk show, Hatoyama said she and her husband get energy by ""eating the sun."" Japanese voters took the eccentricities in stride, disapproving of then-prime minister Yukio Hatoyama for his policies, not his wife's quirks. Prime Minister Naoto Kan appears to have been left out of the writing of his wife's book. Talking to reporters, the prime minister joked, ""I'm afraid to read it.""","Prime Minister Naoto Kan can't cook or dress well, wife says .

"Washington (CNN) -- New rules designed to protect credit card users from ""unreasonable late payment and other penalty fees"" went into effect Sunday as a result of the Credit Card Act of 2009. The rules block credit card companies from charging more than $25 for late payments except in extreme circumstances, prevent them from charging customers for not using their cards, and requires them to reconsider rate increases imposed since January 1, 2009, according to the Federal Reserve, which approved the regulations. They are the final provisions of federal legislation that placed new restrictions on credit card interest rates and fees, completing the most comprehensive overhaul of the credit card industry in history. The banking industry has already made changes in response to the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009, a spokesman said Sunday. ""The industry has moved swiftly to implement all of these changes and the final piece of the puzzle is now in place,"" said Kenneth Clayton of the American Bankers Association. ""It will still take some time before we can really see how the landscape has changed, but it is clear that consumer choice and control will ultimately drive further changes in the marketplace,"" he said in a statement. The Fed's rules could result in lower interest rates for consumers. Banks will have to reduce rates if the reasons for increases imposed in the last 20 months no longer exist, and regulators will review and enforce such cuts. Consumers will most immediately notice the new penalty fee limit of $25. Reducing penalty fees was a central provision of the credit card law, but Congress left it to the Fed to determine how to do it. The Fed leaves room for larger penalty fees to be charged if a consumer has shown a pattern of ""repeated"" violations or if a card issuer can show that a higher fee reasonably offsets its own costs in dealing with the violation that spurred the penalty. Among other new rules, penalty fees can't exceed the dollar amount incurred by the consumer's violation that spurred the fee. For example, if a customer is late making a $20 minimum payment, the fee can't exceed $20. A consumer who exceeds her credit limit by $5 cannot be charged an over-the-limit fee of more than $5. Consumers will no longer face multiple penalty fees if the violation was based on a single late payment. The provisions, which were announced in June, complement previous rules of the 2009 credit card law that are already in effect. Starting in February, issuers were prohibited from hiking interest rates on existing balances as long as customers paid their bills on time. They also have to notify customers at least 45 days in advance of interest rate increases and most fee changes. The Fed was tasked with figuring out a way to set penalty fees in a way that's ""reasonable and proportional"" to the violation that caused the fee. Consumers scored a win, since these fee caps go beyond what the Fed had suggested earlier this year in a draft. The $25 limit will mean significant savings for consumers who face median penalty fees of $39, according to data collected by the Pew Safe Credit Cards Project. However, if a cardholder is late or over his credit limit two times within six months, issuers could hike the second penalty fee to $35, or possibly more if the issuer can justify the fee to regulators, according to the Fed rules. Although the Fed is cracking down on penalty fees, it hasn't addressed the interest rate hikes that are also imposed on consumers who violate the terms of their credit card agreements. So a consumer who spends more than his credit card limit by $15 may only face a $15 fee. But that consumer could still face a permanent penalty hike on his interest rate, which would apply to any future purchases. Still, some banking groups have concerns. Financial Services Roundtable's senior lobbyist Scott Talbott warned that the Fed's cap on penalty fees will limit the industry's ability to offset the risk that credit cardholders don't pay their bills. ""The restrictions in the rules the Fed issued will decrease the ability of the credit card industry to price for risk and the net effect will be a decrease in [credit] availability,"" Talbott said. CNN's Scott Spoerry and CNNMoney's Jennifer Liberto contributed to this report.","The rules block companies from charging more than $25 for late payments in most cases .

"(Parenting.com) -- One Mother's Day, I bought my wife what she had wanted for years -- a weeping cherry tree -- and I threw in a bird bath, so that when the tree matures, our feathered friends can happily splash and drink under its loving protection. Oh boy! Another tie or pair of funny boxer shorts for Dad! For Father's Day, my wife gave me some boxer shorts and a tiny reading light, so I can flip through a book in bed without disturbing her. My wife is the first to admit it: For her, and for many people, Father's Day is an afterthought, a holiday just a few steps above the one that celebrates the groundhog and that other one that promotes trees. If Mom's Day and Dad's Day were in a prize fight, we all know which holiday would wind up lying in the corner of the ring, knocked-out teeth on the mat, dazed head stuck in a bucket. I've been thinking about how our society recognizes parents because Father's Day is upon us again, but also because, a while ago, my worst nightmare happened: My wife had to have surgery. I was an emotional wreck. For a while, it was truly touch and go. Life hung in the balance, and everything near and dear to me seemed in doubt. Why? Because while Susan recovered from her toe surgery, I had to take care of the kids. Parenting.com: Work/family balance harder for men? Sure, for a couple workdays I was able to call in reinforcements (my mom and mother-in-law), but an entire weekend lay ahead in which I was to be the prime caregiver to Lorelei, who was just hitting 6 months, and Isabelle, our 3-year-old. Meanwhile, my wife was upstairs in our bed, on painkillers and armed with her cell phone so that I was always just a speed dial away from doing her bidding. This would be a weekend in which I couldn't do only the fun stuff -- like playing blocks and watching cartoons -- with the girls. I was obviously going to have to feed both of them (three times a day!), and I would have to tackle Herculean tasks like giving baths, changing all of the diapers, putting them both to bed, and even giving medicine to Lorelei, who had an ear infection. Over the decades, standards for fathers have risen. If this were 1897 or even 1974, I could have coasted through the weekend, serving potato chips and cold cereal to Isabelle, and I would have brought the girls to my wife's bed for her to do the changing of the diapers. I could have skipped the baths. I could have ignored the dishes in the sink and the cat litter without a barrage of criticism. As long as I managed to avoid the house catching on fire, and the girls didn't come down with malaria, at the end of the weekend, my family and friends would have laughed heartily at my mishaps, like they used to do in the last couple seconds of those 1970s and 1980s one-hour dramas (you know, after somebody made a joke and the shot went into freeze frame). Then my family and friends would have declared that I had done my best, and nobody would have cared that the bar had been set so low that a chipmunk could have done as well. Parenting.com: His way can be better than yours . But today's dads are different. We not only love our children, we're acutely aware that we have a responsibility to be the best parents we can be. When it counts, I think most fathers really give it their all -- which explains why the Saturday night of my Mr. Mom weekend, instead of ordering pizza, I served Isabelle a chicken casserole with pineapple as a side dish. Don't applaud -- the fruit came from a can, and the rest from a box with four steps. iReport.com: Share your best bonding moment with Dad . Still, I have to admit, I felt proud as the weekend wore on. I grew more confident in my parenting skills and even gave both girls a bath -- at the same time -- not once, but two nights in a row! Just as I was ready to nominate myself for a Nobel Peace Prize, an Oscar, a Grammy -- surely I deserved some award -- I had an epiphany that brought me back down a few pegs. Parenting.com: Mommy skills that'll work on husbands . I was fixing a French dish I like to call poisson et pommes frites (um, fish sticks and fries), when I caught Anderson Cooper on CNN. He was in Baghdad, surrounded by American soldiers, saying he was exhausted and scared. Yet he warned the audience not to be too impressed with him. In a few days, he would fly home. The soldiers would remain at their posts. Now, I'm not comparing our girls to Iraqi insurgents, but I do appreciate more than ever that mothers are usually the soldiers in the parenting battlefield. Even full-time working moms do more child-rearing than us dads, studies have repeatedly found. Fathers tend to play the part of the dashing news reporter, swooping into parenting duties just long enough to get our hands dirty. My wife deserves her weeping cherry tree. And like most moms, she is worthy of much more. Yet I think we dads merit at least a little more than boxer shorts, soap-on-a-rope, and neckties. We don't get the good stuff because we're paying for the sins of our fathers, and our fathers' fathers. But these days, dads are changing diapers, warming bottles, and taking our kids to the park. We may not be where you want us yet, but we've evolved, and we're involved. Just as much as the moms, we appreciate the cards, the praise, and being treated special on our day. So if any of you mothers now feel guilty enough to spring for a slightly nicer Father's Day gift -- say, a plasma TV with a 50-inch screen -- make sure it also has built-in speakers with surround-sound.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- It all started with an acoustic guitar and a MySpace page. John Vesely, better known as Secondhand Serenade, began as a one-man acoustic act. Making a name for himself with his honest tales of love and loss, Vesely utilized the then-budding social networking empire to make his music known. Vesely's songs are an emotional roller coaster that propelled the singer through his self-produced acoustic debut ""Awake"" to his 2008 sophomore release ""A Twist in My Story,"" which included a full band and production team. His third studio album, ""Hear Me Now,"" hits stores Tuesday and will include a more upbeat, electronic feel. Returning to his roots, Vesely self-produced and recorded three new tracks for this latest album in his bedroom with his drummer Tom Breyfogle. Vesely's West Hollywood location is more than just a home. Vesely's band mates use it as a crash pad, the singer's bedroom doubles as a recording studio and his garage/laundry room was converted into the band's rehearsal space. Vesely talked with CNN from his bedroom studio about the production of his new album, the evolution of his music and maintaining his personal relationship with his fans through Twitter and Facebook. CNN: When did you begin writing material for your third album? Vesely: This writing process actually started a lot earlier than you would think. One of the songs on the album was one of the first songs I've ever written. There were a few songs -- like, for instance, a song called Nightmares, on the album ... was a song that I had written for ""Awake,"" which was years ago, like four years ago I think. And there's a song called ""Only Hope in South by Southwest,"" when I went right after I signed with the label, so it was well before I recorded ""Twist in My Story."" And some of the songs I wrote literally in the studio. ... I mean, as far as ""Something More"" and ""You and I"" and all those songs, like literally, ""You and I"" I wrote in February and recorded in February. That was like one of the last things we did. CNN: Your second album had a bit of a darker tone, but you've said your new album is more upbeat and reflective. Did that just come about with the writing of it? Vesely: The new album's upbeat feel definitely came along with the writing of it. All the albums have kind of spread out and become a different chapter of my personal story. ... This album is more about me personally rather than telling stories about a relationship. A lot of it is self-reflection and, you know, owning up to the fact that I wasn't a great person at some points and I'm not proud of some things I've done or some ways I've acted, and it's hard when you make mistakes and kind of brush them under the carpet, and leave them for later, and I finally wanted to deal with that in this album. It was a lot about telling people what's happened and being able to free yourself after that. Once you get that out, you can move on and be happy. I'm in a really happy place right now because I'm so focused on music, surrounded by great people and really talented musicians, and I'm kind of given a second chance now, and I want to really take that and cherish it. CNN: When you first started working with music producers on your second album, did you find you liked that better? And why did you choose to self-produce some tracks on your new album? Vesely: I definitely have always liked to do things by myself, just because I like to be a part of it. The more I do, the more it's my music, personally. Of course, working with a producer is a necessary thing when you're making music, because they're trying to put your creative thoughts together, and make it as effective as possible in a song form. ... Being able to do the three tracks on this new album on my own with my drummer Tom [Breyfogle] was a great experience because it was the first time that I'd gotten to produce something except my first album ""Awake,"" but that was pretty much just acoustic guitar and vocals, so there's not much production going on, so to speak. CNN: ""Awake"" was just you and your acoustic guitar. Now you've added a full band and more production. How have your fans reacted to more production and a bigger sound? Vesely: ""Something More,"" it's the new single, it's been out on iTunes for little bit now, and we've gotten a lot of really, really good feedback. And it makes me happy to see -- going from an acoustic background to this more electronic, rhythmic feel -- they still find the beauty and the honesty in the music, and they can appreciate it, and that's really important. But there's always people that aren't into it. For instance, some people will [give it a bad review] and say, ""What's going on, what is this?"" Then they'll continue, ""It's not a bad song, but it's totally not Secondhand Serenade."" So it's not necessarily a bad review they're giving, it's just that they can't get past the fact that I'm evolving as an artist and I'm trying to break out creatively. And that's OK; you can't please everyone because if I'd still be playing acoustic right now, everyone would be like, ""OK, we get it, you're acoustic, what now?"" I think the evolution's necessary, and it's natural, and I hope people can appreciate it. CNN: You've responded to feedback and sometimes criticism from your fans that you've received online. Why do you think it's important to address that? Vesely: I'm very, very personal with my fans. I Twitter like crazy and I Facebook like crazy, and I respond to them all the time, and it's something that's been important to me since the beginning cause that's pretty much how I got started. They're like part of my army, they work with me, and I can't do any of this without them. I feel it's important, rather than ignore them and be like, ""Whatever, I'm still selling the album and still selling the song, and one person's opinion doesn't matter."" You know one person's opinion, two people's opinions, or five people's opinions, even if it's among thousands or hundreds of thousands of opinions, it still matters.","John Vesely, better known as Secondhand Serenade, started as a one-man acoustic act .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Lawyers for Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend attended a closed hearing with a Los Angeles family court judge for two hours Thursday morning, but neither Gibson nor Oksana Grigorieva were there. Court proceedings in the custody dispute over their 8-month-old daughter are conducted ""under seal"" with reporters kept waiting in the courthouse hallway. The lawyers for each side refused to address reporters' questions as they left the hearing. Grigorieva has accused Gibson of striking her in the face, while he alleges that she attempted to extort him to keep controversial recordings of their arguments a secret. Several explosive audio recordings, purportedly between Grigorieva and Gibson, have been released online in recent days. RadarOnline released another recording Tuesday of a vicious argument said to be between Gibson and Grigorieva, in which the man is accused of striking the woman and the couple's child -- an accusation the man does not deny. Police in Malibu Hills, California, opened an investigation earlier this month into an alleged domestic violence incident between Gibson and Grigorieva. Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said last week that the recordings ""will be part of the investigation"" into the alleged domestic violence. ""In Session"" correspondents have made several unsuccessful attempts to reach out to Gibson for comment and to verify whether the voice on the tapes is his. Grigorieva has filed a restraining order against Gibson, said her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. Meanwhile, investigators are looking into the extortion allegations against Grigorieva. ""Allegations of extortion have been brought to our attention and we are certainly going to look into it,"" Whitmore said Wednesday. Grigorieva's spokesman told CNN Wednesday that she stands by an earlier statement that there is ""no credible evidence"" of extortion. A source close to the investigation told CNN that Gibson's lawyer met with Los Angeles County Sheriff's investigators Tuesday to present evidence that Grigorieva, 40, attempted to extort money from Gibson to keep audio recordings secret. ""To specifically address the allegations, my client, Ms. Grigorieva, has repeatedly stated that there is no credible evidence whatsoever of extortion by her, and she stands steadfastly by that statement,"" Jaffe said. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyers would not reveal what happened in the closed hearing .

"(The Frisky) -- So what did you do this weekend? Chances are, nothing as cool as the folks who traveled to Astoria, Oregon, to commemorate 25 years of ""The Goonies"" at the Never Say Die Anniversary Celebration. A quarter century ago, to the day, on June 7th, ""The Goonies"" opened in movie theaters across the country. And while it came in behind ""Rambo II,"" released on the same opening weekend, the tale of a group of teens who embark on a treasure hunt to raise the money to save their homes -- all while being chased by a crazed crime family -- went on to become a cult classic. To celebrate the movie, fans at the festival ran a 5K race called the ""Truffle Shuffle."" They chatted with cast members -- including Sean Astin and director Richard Donner -- at a dinner where the main dish was Fratelli meatballs. And they were treated to a ""Goonies""-themed concert starring none other than Truth Movement, the band of ""Goonie"" actor Corey Feldman. The Frisky: Madonna's 13-year-old daughter becomes a fashion model . Wish you had gone? Me too. And here are 10 reasons why we still love ""The Goonies,"" even after a quarter of a century: . 1. ""The Goonies"" is a movie about outcasts. (Well, with the exception of cheerleader Andy who becomes an honorary member of the crew.) And you know how much we love nerd movies and TV shows. 2. One word: Chunk. Played by Jeff Cohen, Chunk was hilarious as the flick's comic relief. When the Fratellis demand that he tell them everything, he begins one of the best monologues in 80s movie history. ""In third grade, I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade, I stole my uncle Max's toupee and I glued it on my face when I was Moses in my Hebrew School play. In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and blamed it on the dog."" You'll be happy to know that Jeff is no longer chunky and is now a hot, well-renowned entertainment lawyer in Beverly Hills. The Frisky: 6 celeb couples tell where they went on their first date . 3. ""The Goonies"" was the brainchild of Steven Spielberg. It was conceived during what I like to think of as his golden era -- nestled in between ""E.T."" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" 4. It's hard to believe but true -- Corey Haim and Corey Feldman first met because of ""The Goonies."" ""It was in the waiting room -- we were auditioning for the same role,"" says Corey Feldman, who got the part of Mouth in the flick. Though Corey Haim was frozen out of this one, they'd become one of the iconic duos of the 80s. The Frisky: A ""Real Housewife of NJ"" is $11 million in debt --how? 5. ""The Goonies"" had an awesome soundtrack, with tracks from 80s greats like The Bangles and REO Speedwagon. But the classic track of the movie was Cyndi Lauper's ""Good Enough"" -- the 12-minute, two-part video starred not only the cast but 80s wrestling favorites like Andre the Giant. 6. We know Josh Brolin as the hottie from ""No Country For Old Men"" and the tragic bad guy in ""Milk."" But his first role? Brandon ""Brand"" Walsh -- the Goonie who's able to win the heart of cool girl Andy. The Frisky: The MTV Movie Awards was one big shillfest . 7. I saw ""The Goonies"" in the movie theater, and will never forget the scene where the group makes it through the maze of caverns and puzzles and ends in the cave where they first see One-Eyed Willie's ship. It was breathtaking. Apparently, for the stars of the movie, too. Director Richard Donner didn't let them see the fully re-created ship because he wanted the authentic emotion of awe on film. And he got it. 8. ""The Goonies"" had a good message -- mainly that kids could take action and make real change in their community. Sure, they most likely wouldn't do it by finding a buried treasure from the 17th century, but still. The Frisky: The 10 lamest celebrity publicity stunts . 9. Oh, and I almost forgot about Data. How do you not love a pre-teen who creates his own inventions like the ""Wings of Flight,"" the ""Pincers of Peril,"" and the ""Bully Blinder""? I always wanted him and MacGyver to have a showdown. 10. ""The Goonies"" was thrilling the first time you saw it. But thanks to TBS playing it, oh, every weekend, we've gotten to see it 90,000 times and get all the nuances. While rumors have circulated for years that ""Goonies 2"" is in the works, it just doesn't look like it's going to happen. Luckily, though, Donner is currently working on a Broadway version of the story. TM & © 2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved .","""The Goonies"" is a movie about outcasts .

"(CNN) -- Police have added a second charge of capital murder against an Irving, Texas, woman who allegedly told a 911 operator that she strangled her two young children because they were autistic, a spokeswoman for the district attorney said Friday. Saiqa Akhter, 30, now faces two charges of capital murder of a child under 5 in the deaths of her 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son, Dallas County district attorney spokeswoman Jamille Bradfield said. A woman who identified herself as Akhter called police Monday evening and said she first tried to kill her children with bathroom cleaner, but they would not drink it. She told the 911 operator that she then strangled them with a wire and that they were on her bed. Police and paramedics tried to resuscitate the children, but Zain Akhter died at the hospital Monday, and his younger sister, Faryaal Akhter, died at the hospital Tuesday evening, according to authorities. On the tape, the woman tells the operator, ""I killed them. I killed both of them. I killed my both kids. ... They are not doing anything. They are just blue. They are not taking any breaths. Their heart is not beating."" The operator asks her what happened. ""First, I tried to give them bathroom cleaner. I put in their mouth, but they don't drink it. I want them to drink it. They don't drink it. ... I grabbed their neck ... and they are no more,"" she says on the tape. The operator continues to talk to the woman to keep her on the phone until officers arrive. She asks why she killed her children, and the woman says she wanted normal children. ""They are autistic. I don't want my kids to be autistic,"" she is heard saying in an even tone. The operator then asks her what she is feeling, and she says ""nothing."" Akhter is being held in the Dallas County jail in lieu of $1 million bail. According to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the Akhter family had a referral in 2009 for ""neglectful supervision.""","Saiqa Akhter, 30, of Irving, Texas, is charged with capital murder .

"(CNN) -- A former south Texas prosecutor has been indicted on a felony charge of misusing money from seized property to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses to himself and his staff, state prosecutors announced Wednesday. A grand jury in Alice, Texas, charged Joe Frank Garza with misapplication of fiduciary duty in connection with the payments. In a 2009 interview with CNN, Garza insisted the payments were legal, but the grand jury disagreed. An audit conducted after he left office found more than $1.2 million went to three secretaries Garza called ""my eyes and ears in the community."" But the then-district attorney also paid himself more than $81,000, which he said was for expenses. Attempts to reach Garza for comment were unsuccessful Wednesday evening. State law forbids officials from converting money from forfeiture cases to personal use or to supplement salaries without the approval of county commissioners, prosecutors said. Garza was allowed to post $10,000 bond after being served with the indictment, according to court papers. Garza served as the chief prosecutor for Jim Wells and Brooks counties in south Texas from 2003 to 2008, when he lost his bid for re-election. Garza's successor asked the state attorney general's office to investigate once he left office. Property seizures are a common tactic in drug cases, but critics have argued the practice can lead to abuse by law enforcement agencies. Several motorists have sued authorities in another Texas county, accusing police there of systematically fleecing drivers passing through by seizing cash and other valuables during traffic stops and pressuring the owners to give up the property in exchange for promises not to prosecute. Authorities in the town of Tenaha, near the Louisiana state line, and surrounding Shelby County have denied any wrongdoing, and an effort to restrict the practice failed in the state legislature in 2009.","Audit found ex-prosecutor paid $1.2 million to three secretaries .

"(CNN) -- Sudan's first multiparty elections in 24 years, which wrapped up earlier this week, fell short of international standards but should be recognized as an important step forward for the nation, observers said Saturday. ""While it is too early to offer a final overall assessment, it is apparent that the elections will fall sort of meeting international standards and Sudan's obligations for genuine elections in many respects,"" said a statement from the Carter Center, one of several groups observing the balloting. ""Nonetheless, the elections are important as a key benchmark in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and because of the increased political and civic participation that has occurred over the last several months. Ultimately, the success of the elections will depend on whether Sudanese leaders take action to promote lasting democratic transformation."" The European Union Election Observation Mission criticized the election for showing ""significant deficiencies against international standards"" but said the vote paves the way for democratic progress. Counting of ballots began Friday in Sudan, nearly a week after voting began. Sudan's election commission extended the vote for two days past the original Tuesday deadline after observers complained of technical problems, including ballots being sent to the wrong polling stations and registers that were missing voters' names. The voting -- for president, parliament and other local positions -- was scrutinized by about 750 international and 18,000 domestic observers. Opposition parties accused the ruling National Congress Party of fraud, prompting some parties to partially or fully withdraw from the vote. One of those parties was the SPLM, or Sudanese People's Liberation Movement. In a statement Saturday, the party said that despite his withdrawal, SPLM presidential candidate Yasir Saeed Arman held a healthy lead in southern Sudan. Arman withdrew from the presidential race last month, and the party decided to boycott elections in northern Sudan. In the north of the county, Arman ""predictably did not do well in a race he was never part of,"" the SPLM said in the statement. ""The election days were mostly calm, orderly and peaceful, within a well-maintained security environment,"" the EU observation mission said in a Saturday statement. ""The Sudanese people are to be congratulated on the patience and forbearance shown by their considerable voter turnout despite the challenges encountered during the polling days."" The U.S.-based Carter Center echoed those comments, but noted, ""notwithstanding these generally positive features, Carter Center observers noted important flaws."" The voter registration process faced ""critical shortcomings,"" the center said, and resulted in ""broad but uneven"" participation across the country. It noted that preliminary lists were not posted for public review, especially in southern Sudan, and ""the status of the final voter registry and list of polling stations remained uncertain."" In addition, ""on election day, voters faced a range of operational and logistical problems: late delivery of and/or inadequate materials, incomplete or inaccurate voters' lists, incorrect or insufficient ballots, ballots with inappropriate languages and a lack of consistency in procedures,"" the Carter Center said. The two-day extension in voting helped partially alleviate some of those concerns, it said. The balloting was absent safeguards and transparency necessary to ""verify key steps and build confidence and trust in the process,"" according to the statement. ""Our observers reported problems with ink, ballot box seals, and the process of identifying voters."" There were also reports of underage voters casting ballots, the center said. The election was a key part of a 2005 peace deal, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, that helped end decades of civil war between the country's north and south. The conflict pitted Christian and Animist southerners against Muslim northerners, leaving more than 2 million people dead. The peace deal also called for a referendum next year to determine whether the south should become an independent nation. ""The elections in the South experienced a high incidence of intimidation and the threat or use of force,"" the Carter Center said. ""There were numerous instances of the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army intimidating voters and being stationed too close to polling stations. State interference in the campaigns of opposition candidates was widespread in the South."" However, the EU mission said, the elections showed progress on gender equality, ""as a minimum of 25 percent of all legislative seats will be occupied by women."" ""This election saw the development of the capacity of civil society: hundreds of groups, encompassing thousands of individual citizens, displayed high levels of commitment and engaged in election observation for many days,"" the EU statement said. ""This extensive involvement by Sudanese civil society who showed great commitment, particularly in domestic observation, contributed to the transparency of the electoral process."" Election results are expected next week, observers have said.","Carter Center: ""It is apparent that the elections will fall sort of meeting international standards""

"(CNN) -- Football fans in Madrid are used to getting their way when it comes to attracting the world's best talent. Last summer, Real Madrid, the world's most successful club, splashed out more than $200 million to bring former world players of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka to the city. Now the city's aquarium has launched an audacious bid to bring the unlikely star of the recent World Cup to the Spanish capital with a ""name your price"" offer for Paul the octopus -- the psychic cephalopod who correctly predicted Spain's triumph at the tournament. In an announcement on its blog Thursday, Madrid Zoo Aquarium said it had begun making the ""necessary arrangements"" for Paul's transfer and had offered to beat any offer already on the table. Zookeepers said they were also ready to offer other animals in exchange for the octopus and said Paul could expect the ""best care"" befitting of a national hero. Paul, currently resident at the Sea Life Center in Oberhausen, Germany, not only predicted Spain's win over the Netherlands in the final but also the team's semifinal success against Germany. Prior to that it had correctly predicted all five of Germany's earlier results, and picked Germany to beat Uruguay in the third-place playoff, ending the tournament with a remarkable eight-for-eight record. During each prediction, two mussel-filled acrylic boxes labeled with a team's flag were lowered into his tank. Whichever box he chose conveyed the winning team. Sea Life staff in Oberhausen announced Paul's retirement from the predictions game earlier this week but said they were considering a ""host of offers from around the globe."" PR guru Max Clifford told CNN that Paul could become the world's first multimillion-pound octopus should his handlers choose to cash in on his global fame.

"(InStyle.com) -- We know it's serious news. But we'll admit: The recent arrest of 11 members of a so-called Russian espionage ring -- coupled with coverage of their assumed identities, their old-school tactics (invisible ink!), and even, in the case of ""red-hot beauty"" Anna Chapman, their coquettish Facebook pictures -- got us thinking about some of our favorite stylish spies from film and television. Here's a list of our top 10. 1. Anya Amasova in ""The Spy Who Loved Me""  KGB agent Major Anya Amasova (code name: Triple X) had a love/hate relationship with her British counterpart, James Bond, in the 1977 film. Together, they traveled through Egypt and battled Jaws, a steel-toothed, 7-foot-tall assassin. But when the mission ended, Amasova -- played by American model Barbara Bach (who looked almost as good in her uniform as she did in a bathing suit) -- fell far short of her stated goal of killing Bond; instead, she bedded him (in a submarine escape pod, no less). InStyle.com: The 21 most iconic swimsuits ever . 2. Emma Peel in ""The Avengers""  British agent John Steed had several different partners over the course of the original 1960s series, but Emma Peel, played by Diana Rigg, was the best: A certified genius equally adept at fencing and martial arts, she fought mad scientists in mod black-and-white ensembles (many of which were designed by Pierre Cardin). Uma Thurman stepped into the iconic leather catsuit for a big-screen version in 1998. 3. Sydney Bristow in ""Alias""  Jennifer Garner was nothing short of sensational as Sydney Bristow, a vulnerable-yet-deadly double-agent working with the CIA in the series that kicked off in 2001. More to the point, she looked sensational, masquerading as everything from club kid to hotel maid to geisha with stylish aplomb. InStyle.com: Jennifer Garner's transformation . 4. Nikita in ""La Femme Nikita""  Anne Parillaud played the titular cocktail-dress-clad assassin in Luc Besson's original 1990 film: She went from teenage drug addict to literal femme fatale at the behest of her French intelligence agency handlers. Bridget Fonda starred in Point of No Return, the 1993 Hollywood remake, and Peta Wilson found fame in a late 1990s TV version. This fall, the character will be resurrected yet again, as Maggie Q takes on the title role in the CW series ""Nikita."" 5. Vanessa Kensington, Felicity Shagwell, and Foxxy Cleopatra in the ""Austin Powers"" movies.  They came from three different eras and worked for three different agencies, but Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) and Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyoncé Knowles) had more in common than their line of work and their improbable attraction to the snaggle-toothed spy Austin Powers. They also shared an affinity for truly over-the-top ensembles, as seen above; we like Vanessa's futuristic silver shift best. InStyle.com: Beyoncé's Transformation . 6. Agent 99 in ""Get Smart""  Eminently capable and devastatingly gorgeous, Anne Hathaway's Agent 99 was the only CONTROL agent, aside from Maxwell Smart, whose identity hadn't been compromised at the start of the 2008 film. (The character was updated from the version Barbara Feldon played in the original 1960s show.) The series of ever-more-fabulous couture getups she donned over the course of her and Maxwell's mission wasn't exactly believable, but it sure was impressive. 7. Vesper Lynd in ""Casino Royale""  Eva Green played Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent brought in to bankroll James Bond during a game of high stakes poker in this 2006 ""reboot"" of the series. But she certainly didn't look like a boring bureaucrat: Instead, the terminally conflicted Vesper stunned in a series of dramatic evening gowns, including this sophisticated open-backed number. InStyle.com: Stars in bikinis . 8. Claire Phelps in ""Mission: Impossible""  The pillow-lipped French film star Emmanuelle Béart played a member of the fancifully named Impossible Missions Force in this 1996 big-screen adaptation of the classic TV show. Tom Cruise, as Ethan Hunt, may have suspected that his fellow agent's loyalties were divided, but given how beautiful she looked in her well-cut separates and chic little suits, we understand his inability to keep his guard up. 9. Helen Tasker in ""True Lies"" Our favorite scene in 1995's ""True Lies"" comes when the formerly bored wife of secret agent Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) converts her slightly frumpy high-necked, long-sleeved dress into a short, sexy cocktail mini with little more than her bare hands. After Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) slicks her hair back with a bit of water from a vase of flowers, she's ready for intrigue. InStyle.com: Stars' most memorable dresses . 10. Claire Stenwick in ""Duplicity""  Julia Roberts played a CIA-agent-turned-corporate-spy opposite Clive Owens in this 2009 romp. And, of course, she had all the usual accoutrements -- dark sunglasses, black trench, etc. -- but we loved this romantic V-necked printed dress she wore while shooting in Rome, Italy. Bonus: Evelyn Salt in ""Salt""  Okay, we haven't yet seen ""Salt,"" in which Angelina Jolie stars as a CIA officer accused of being a double agent, and it's not in theaters until July 23rd. But if the action-packed trailer is any indication (and, judging by the numerous shots of Jolie looking chic on set), it looks to be a very stylish entry into the cannon.

"(CNN) -- A bus crashed into the side of a mountain Tuesday in western Bolivia, killing at least 13 people and injuring another 26, the government news agency reported. The driver lost control of the bus, which gained speed and smashed into rocks on the side of the road, said police official Victor Hugo Ona. The bus left the city of La Paz with 28 passengers but was later found to have 41 passengers and excess baggage, Ona told the state-run Agencia Boliviana de Informacion. Among the dead were seven men, four women and two minors, said Jose Villarroel, another police official. At least 19 of the injured were hospitalized. Bus driver Pedro Limachi, 45, was listed among the injured being treated at the Hospital Arco Iris in La Paz. The bus was operated by the Flota Yunguena transit company. Bolivia's mountainous roads often prove fatal.  A bus crash in central Bolivia in June left 28 dead and 44 injured after an apparent brake failure, police said at the time. That bus, which plunged into a ravine, was owned by the El Dorado company. A January bus accident killed 22 people.  And 19 people died and 26 were injured in August 2009 when a bus plunged off a mountain road.","Police: Driver lost control of the bus, which crashed into roadside boulders .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A sister of a 17-year-old girl whose body was found this week two miles from her home in southern California said Friday she would not rest until the killer is apprehended. ""I will not have peace until this this person is found,"" Elizabeth Lopez, 18, said about the killer of her younger sister Norma, who vanished last Thursday as she walked home from summer classes at Valley View High School in Moreno Valley, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles. Authorities believe that Norma, who had planned to meet a younger sister and a friend at home, took a short cut through a dirt field to reach the family's residence. Her sister contacted the police when Lopez failed to return home. The girl's body was discovered Tuesday two miles away and identified Wednesday through dental records, police said. ""I always thought it was something safe,"" Lopez said about the path her sister typically followed. ""I never suspected that my sister would get kidnapped in this empty lot of just dirt."" Sgt. Joe Barja of the Riverside Valley Sheriff's Department declined to reveal the cause of death or reveal any injuries Lopez may have sustained but said the department is treating the death as a homicide. The victim's sister said the family was trying to stay strong and to find the killer. ""That's what's keeping us motivated -- to get that person in custody so no other family could actually go through what we are going through,"" Elizabeth Lopez told HLN's ""Prime."" ""There's a family here that loved her very much, even though sometimes we did fight -- but it was something stupid, something dumb. But we love her and miss her and one day we will be together again."" She expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support the family has received from the community, including a memorial service at the high school, which hundreds of students attended. ""I get a lot of strength from this,"" she said. ""I did not expect this many people to actually support us. I thought this was just going to be one of those kidnappings that people don't really get involved with ... I did not really expect anyone to actually really listen to the story that we had."" Lopez said her sister had hope to become a fashion designer, a makeup artist or a model. ""She had really big dreams in life,"" she said. She recalled the last time she saw her sister, the morning of her disappearance. ""She brought me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I opened up my sandwich and it had a happy face made with banana in it,"" Lopez said. The offering was intended to to persuade her sister to lend her a pair of shoes, she said. Police are looking for a green ""SUV-type vehicle"" that was seen driving from the area at the time of Lopez's disappearance. The parents, who are originally from Guanajuato, Mexico, were being assisted by the Mexican Consulate, said Carolina Zaragoza, head of the consulate's local office. The victim's father, Martin Lopez, 44, told CNN in a telephone interview that the neighborhood was generally a safe one and that Norma usually took precautions to stay safe. ""She never walked around without her mother,"" he said in Spanish. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Sister ""will not have peace until this person is found""

"(The Frisky) -- Soon after Betty White hosted ""Saturday Night Live,"" I remember asking my friend Nate, a fellow ""Golden Girls"" fanatic, what he thought of all the fuss around White's meteoric comeback. He rolled his eyes, shrugged, and said, ""It's just weird that everybody's finally come around to realizing that Betty White is amazing. Where have they been?"" He was right: the recent trend of people catching on to the fact that Betty White is terrific felt patronizing, and not just because most were astonished that an adorable old lady could land a joke better than most ""SNL"" hosts one-third her age (I'm talking about you, January Jones); it was the belated appreciation of White's fabulousness that made all of us look even sillier. The Frisky: Celeb twins - 10 famous females who come in pairs . And now, there's Joan Rivers. Rivers, younger than White by over a decade, has been working steadily since the 1950s, and, after this week's release of a great new documentary about her life, ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,"" she is poised to become the Next Belated Big Thing -- for those who needed 60 years to catch on to the fact that she is wonderful. The Frisky: 6 celeb couples dish on their (cheap!) first dates . Unlike Betty White, Rivers didn't have the benefit of starring in a series of beloved television shows, nor did she play characters as affable, matronly, or warmly dotty. Rivers honed her act as a stand-up in the 1960s, when few other women had the guts to talk about not being desired by men on stage or joke about women who were flying to Puerto Rico for illegal abortions on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" The Frisky: 10 stars who (maybe) have secret babies . Since then, she's worked consistently -- if one seeks out her entry on Wikipedia, you can't find more than three years in a row where she hasn't had a TV show. This is because Rivers, who defines happiness as a full appointment book, doesn't have the luxury of turning down projects that aren't classy, or cushy, or critically celebrated; she'll sell her jewelry on QVC; she'll do commercials and perform on a cruise ship. She would wake up early, shoot an episode of her own TV show, or do a guest spot on another one, wrap for the day, then get downtown in time to do her weekly stand-up show at the Westbeth Theater. Joan Rivers loves to work, and she'll stop only when she's dead. The Frisky: 8 celebrity dudes describe their dream women . So why did it take so long for audiences to respect not just her work ethic, but to realize how talented she is? Based on the reactions so far to her documentary film ""A Piece of Work,"" it seems that what people find most shocking is that she is actually one of the funniest -- and edgiest -- in the comedy biz. David Edelstein, in New York magazine, remarked how, after watching her stand-up in the film, he was ""ready to be her slave,"" and added, ""I never knew she worked this blue, that she had this much Lenny Bruce in her."" The Frisky: Is ""Bachelorette"" Ali really single? A lot of the delayed appreciation for Joan Rivers has to do with the contempt familiarity breeds. She's never left our sights, and even appeared more and more on our TV screen (winning ""Celebrity Apprentice"" last year) over the years. And, why should she leave showbiz? Her act is as resilient as her energy level, which, at 77, is enviable. But, like anything else in comedy, Rivers' comeback is also about timing. As Rivers' agent says in the film, Joan knows that in order to get hit by lightning, you have to stand in the rain.

"(The Frisky) -- Over the past year, Kate Gosselin has come full circle in the court of public opinion. Around this time last year, most people thought of her as the shrewish mother of eight who was constantly nagging and snapping at her laid-back husband, Jon. As soon as they divorced last summer and Jon started dating a string of questionable 20-somethings, Kate became the sane and stable one to Jon's man-boy. Then, Kate appeared on ""Dancing with the Stars,"" and again she became the shrew, as rumors flew that she was nasty to her fellow cast members behind the scenes. Well, I'm going to say something controversial. I like Kate Gosselin. I think she's smart and appreciate her wry, barely-there sense of humor. I think she's handled herself with restraint and class for the past year while dealing with the end of her marriage under the tabloid microscope. I appreciate how open she is about her emotions, and how hard it is to move on. And while millions will be watching when ""Kate Plus 8"" premieres on Sunday, I'm looking forward to having a second dose of Kate on television with her brand-new reality show, ""Twist of Kate,"" coming to TLC soon. Here are 10 reasons I'll be watching. 1. Kate has the best name ever. Not that I'm biased. The Frisky: Kate Gosselin and 7 others rejected by Playboy . 2.

And more often than not, it's not going to be terribly comfortable for her,"" TLC chief Eileen O'Neill told USA Today. 3. Kate wrote in a blog post today, ""I look forward to being dropped into the lives of interesting and unique people and families. ... Kate on the back of a trash truck, anyone?""

Will she keep the extensions or go back to her signature porcupine reverse-mullet? 5. We also know that in one episode, according to local North Carolina press, she will be a waitress at Finch's Restaurant. She was spotted filming in Raleigh, North Carolina, in December. Will she be able to deal with rude diners without sending them to time-out? 6. It'll be nice to see Kate get a break from caring for eight kids. Perhaps we'll get to see her real personality rather than the on-edge OCD mom? 7. Perhaps during one of the 12 episodes airing this summer, Kate will meet a guy. How nice it would be to see her out on a date. The Frisky: Clooney's girlfriend says Jennifer Aniston looks like haggard rocker . 8. That said, we're thankful she's not the next ""Bachelorette.""

"(CNN) -- Virginia police officers can question stopped motorists about their immigration status, the state's attorney general has said, adding fuel to a contentious debate over states' immigration policies in the wake of a controversial law enacted in Arizona. ""It is my opinion that Virginia law enforcement officers, including conservation officers, may, like Arizona police officers, inquire into the immigration status of persons stopped or arrested,"" Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli writes in the opinion. ""However, persons tasked with enforcing zoning laws lack the authority to investigate criminal violations of the law, including criminal violations of the immigration laws of the United States."" In ""any legitimate police stop"" -- for criminal or traffic reasons -- ""law enforcement is allowed to ask about other subjects,"" Cuccinelli told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday. ""And our opinion addressed the fact that they can ask about illegal immigration, immigration status, along with anything else."" Cuccinelli issued the opinion Friday at the request of Virginia Delegate Robert ""Bob"" Marshall, a Republican. He said he is obligated to issue such opinions when they are requested by lawmakers. ""This is an outrage, and citizens rightly want officials to do something,"" Marshall told CNN affiliate WDBJ-TV in a report posted on his website. ""Since Congress has taken this as a primary responsibility, they are primarily delinquent on this."" Parts of Arizona's immigration law took effect last week after a federal judge blocked portions of it following a challenge from the Obama administration. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a provision that would have required police to ""make a reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of a person stopped, detained or arrested"" if the officer has a reasonable suspicion the person is in the United States illegally. Arizona officials have said the law was enacted because the federal government has failed to adequately enforce immigration law. Cuccinelli said Wednesday the difference between the Arizona provision and his opinion -- which does not carry the weight of law -- is that while Virginia officers have the authority to inquire about immigration status, they are not required to do so. ""We're very sensitive to now allowing for racial profiling,"" he said. ""... The way we avoid it is, we apply the same rules to everybody. And law enforcement is expected to do that."" Asked whether his opinion means that stopped motorists must present documentation, Cuccinelli said, ""Well, the first response is simply whether or not they have to answer the questions. There's not a requirement because a police officer is asking that you have documentation. ""However, it is a requirement under our federal immigration law that those who are not citizens carry evidence, meaning their papers, indicating their legal status,"" he said. ""So if someone is not a citizen, they should have papers indicating their legal status. If they do not, they're violating federal law, and that is a criminal violation."" If a police officer can determine someone is in the country illegally at the time of the stop, it provides grounds for arrest, he said. But one advocacy organization said actions like the opinion only serve to muddy the waters on the issue. ""What we are seeing on the issue of immigration is a lot of political gamesmanship and very little in terms of solutions,"" said Clarissa Martinez, director of immigration and national campaigns for the National Council of La Raza, which describes itself as the largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States. ""Given the situation in Arizona, for any state or locality to continue pushing in that direction without at least figuring out if this is going to be ruled unconstitutional or not ... I think it's irresponsible,"" she said. While the issue should be addressed, ""these kinds of antics are just distractions,"" she said. Those who are frustrated and believe the federal government hasn't done enough should pressure the government to take action ""as opposed to just adding more chaos,"" she said. While Virginia does not face the same situation as border states like Arizona, the attorney general said, undocumented immigrants pose a ""significant problem."" Cuccinelli said the federal government presents a ""bottleneck."" ""They are essentially in charge of whether someone is here legally or not. And if they refuse to undertake that, there's nothing we can do as a state,"" he said. If the state determines someone is in the country illegally, its options are to hold the person until the federal government retrieves them -- which is very expensive -- or let them go, he said. He pointed to a fatal crash on Sunday, when a man believed to be under the influence of alcohol slammed head-on into a car carrying three nuns. Sister Denise Mosier was killed instantly and the other two were seriously injured. The three were a few miles from the Benedictine monastery in Bristow, Virginia, heading for their annual retreat. The suspect, Carlos Montano, had two previous convictions for driving under the influence, as well as reckless driving, speeding and public drunkenness, according to Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials confirmed Montano had twice been in their custody. Both times, he was released on his own recognizance pending deportation proceedings because he was not convicted of a violent felony. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has ordered an immediate review of his deportation proceedings. Montano faces involuntary manslaughter charges in the crash. ""This is a serious problem,"" Cuccinelli said. ""It threatens the safety of Virginians, and I know the problem is similar across the country. We're just taking gradual steps to address it as aggressively as we can."" When CNN's Kieran Chetry pointed out that those in the country legally or citizens also drive under the influence and cause fatal accidents, Cuccinelli replied, ""Unfortunately, ICE had this person in their custody and let them go. They knew he was deportable."" Dana Schrad, executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, said Cuccinelli's opinion, while influential, likely won't change the way officers enforce the law, as they were never prohibited from asking about immigration status. The opinion is only an interpretation of the current law that police already operate under, she said. ""I think what this says is, 'OK, Virginia law enforcement, if you ask the question it's not against the law,'"" she said. ""We already knew that."" However, she said officers in general tend to take a ""balanced approach"" to asking such questions, lest they lose the trust of immigrants -- who are also victims of and witnesses to crimes, and whose cooperation can be beneficial. Officers in some communities may ask the question less, while others may ask every time, she said. Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, said he does not believe the opinion will lead to racial profiling, because police officers use their own judgment when deciding what questions to ask and opinions to form. For instance, if a driver lacks a license, registration or insurance when pulled over, a police officer might have reasonable suspicion to ask about immigration status, he said. ""These are legitimate concerns. Police officers do have an obligation to look further when they find reasonable suspicion."" ""Every law is subject to potential abuse,"" he said. ""There are always going to be cops that go over the line."" Mechanisms should be in place to discipline officers who go too far, he said, but laws cannot be thrown out because of that risk. Cuccinelli's office pointed out in a statement that what an officer can and cannot ask in an encounter remains the same, whether the concern is an immigration violation or a bank robbery. ""The law does not distinguish between criminal violations of immigration law versus violations of any other criminal law,"" the statement said. ""Crime is crime."" But ""when a police officer has 'reasonable articulable suspicion,' the officer can briefly detain a suspect and investigate whether a crime has occurred,"" the statement said. ""If the officer has probable cause to believe a crime has occurred, the officer can make an arrest. These scenarios are true whether the crime is bank robbery, murder, trespass or criminal violations of immigration laws. The legal framework does not change just because the crime happens to be an immigration-related crime. ""Although immigration is politically controversial, the legal principles discussed in the opinion are a matter of settled law and do not break any new legal ground."" CNN's Dugald McConnell and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Virginia's AG says motorists can be asked about immigration status .
Ken Cuccinelli says officers are not required to ask .

He is also a former member of the Colombian Communist Party Executive Committee, his official biography says. The vice president's heart attack and surgery was not expected to disrupt a meeting between Santos and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez scheduled for Tuesday. The two heads of state will meet in Santa Marta, Colombia, to discuss how to repair ruptured relations between the two countries.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The town of Bedford, New York, is not happy with a tent set up as part of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's visit to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly, a town attorney said Tuesday. The tent is on property that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is renting in New York, WABC reported. ""I discussed this matter with town officials, and the town building inspector believes that this would constitute a violation of several town zoning and land use laws,"" Bedford town attorney Joel Sachs said. ""I directed the town building inspector to immediately go to the property and issue a stop work order, which would the individuals to cease erecting the tent.""

The property is owned by the Trump Organization, which said in a statement: ""We have business partners and associates all over the world. The property was leased on a short-term basis to Middle Eastern partners, who may or may not have a relationship to Mr. Gadhafi. We are looking into the matter.""  Watch CNN crew look for Gadhafi's tent » . County Executive Andy Spano said earlier Tuesday he had heard unconfirmed reports that Gadhafi may be staying there. ""There is no legal way to prevent this, as he is a head of state, despite the fact that he has a long history as a terrorist,"" Spano said in a statement. ""However, from my point of view, he is not welcome in Westchester."" State Department officials said there are no limitations on Gadhafi's visa that would prevent him from traveling to the area. They said their understanding was that Gadhafi was not staying at the tent, but was visiting and having meetings there. He is staying in New York, the officials said. The U.N. General Assembly begins Wednesday. Under the Foreign Mission Act, the United States does have the right to restrict travel by diplomats to within a certain distance of U.N. headquarters, but the officials said Westchester County is within that radius. Gadhafi travels with a trademark Bedouin tent. Last month, Gadhafi stirred up anger when he permitted a large welcome for Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, the Libyan convicted of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over  Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. Al Megrahi was released by Scottish authorities on compassionate medical grounds, and the celebration of his homecoming infuriated some families of the Pan Am 103 victims.

"New York (CNN) -- For all the discord the Bush administration sowed on the world stage -- withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol and various arms agreements, holding foreign nationals indefinitely at Guantanamo with restricted rights, generally disdaining multilateralism -- the previous president was rightfully celebrated for his commitment to fighting the global AIDS epidemic. In the four years following the unprecedented creation in 2004 of the funding mechanism known as PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), Bush sent some $19 billion to Africa and other hard-hit parts of the world. How much has the Obama administration added this year? Only $366 million beyond the prior year's level. It doesn't come close to the $1 billion a year the current president promised to add as a candidate. That Republican president Bush was a bigger advocate on AIDS than ""liberal"" Obama may come as a surprise, but many people around the world are starting to notice the discrepancy. That includes Desmond Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town and Nobel laureate. On Wednesday, Tutu took the president to task in a sharply worded New York Times op-ed that noted substantially fewer additional African HIV patients will receive treatment than did under Bush if the funding slack persists. Indeed, according to two Harvard researchers, if aid isn't substantially increased over Bush-era levels, an estimated 1.2 million avoidable deaths could occur just in South Africa over the next five years. That would happen on Obama's watch. Domestically, the news isn't much better. When Obama rolled out his ballyhooed national HIV/AIDS strategy last week, there was no new funding attached, just a mandate to re-allocate existing funds to the communities most in need and the tactics that work best. (For all his global generosity, Bush was rightly knocked stateside for prioritizing abstinence-based prevention approaches over condom-based ones. The needs of gay men, one of the most affected groups of Americans, were largely left out of the playbook altogether because of pressure from the Christian right.) Read about men who have survived 30 years with HIV . But for all the innovative ideas in the strategy document, such as using social media to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS, what we really need is money. The federal/state AIDS Drug Assistance Program, which provides HIV drugs to more than 200,000 uninsured and underinsured people, has a wait list of some 2,300 people. And it's growing monthly. That's too many Americans going without medicines that can save their lives. Meanwhile, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. -- more than 1 million -- continues to rise. In some cities, the situation is as bad as parts of Africa. In Washington, 3 percent of residents have HIV/AIDS. Of course, in many parts of Africa, the statistics are much more dire. In South Africa, some 5.7 million people are HIV-positive. That's 11 percent of the population. But you wouldn't believe how few federal dollars go to finding a cure: just $40 million in 2009, according to the AIDS Policy Project. I know the country is lurching back from recession and funds across the board are tight. But if the administration can approve hundreds of billions of dollars for stimulus spending or health care reform -- let alone the countless billions of dollars wasted by a bloated intelligence infrastructure -- then the White House can certainly commit a fraction of these amounts to help out an even worthier cause: people's well-being. It takes vigilance to beat back the HIV/AIDS scourge, to make sure people with HIV get the treatment they need to survive, and that people without the virus stay free of it. We've made important strides in recent years. Just this week, the promising results of a South African microbicide trial were announced, meaning that down the road women may be able to protect themselves from the virus without a vaccine. But there's still a lot to do. If America cuts back on aid, other countries will, too, because we're the pacesetter. The Obama administration defends itself by saying the U.S. is the world's biggest financial contributor to the fight against HIV/AIDS. As important as that is, we need to keep up with the epidemic, which requires more resources every year. Obama should listen to his fellow Nobel laureate Tutu, who helped lead his country out of apartheid, and lead the way on ending this scourge, both globally and here at home. After all, he wants posterity to judge him more favorably than Bush, right? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sean Kennedy.","George W.

County officials plan on using barges, containment boom and an air net to stop the flow of crude, but they need all of these things in place for their plan to work. And the thing they need most is $2.8 million up front and $2.5 million a month to stay operational -- money they've filed for with BP. Are you there? Send us your images . ""We're virtually operating on a credit card. This is a county that's reserves are low. We're impacted by a reduction in ad valorem taxes,"" said Villani. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson says he's seen the same thing happen all throughout this process. ""You had the Coast Guard doing one thing and you had BP doing another thing and this is why I've been raising cane for weeks,"" said Nelson. Nelson met with Okaloosa County officials who asked for his help in getting their check. ""This county and a lot of these other little counties that simply don't have the financial wherewithall to be paying all of these bills, and they've got to have some relief. So, yes. they will get their money."" After the meeting, CNN questioned BP's community cupport coordinator assigned to Okaloosa County, Jay Prothro. Asked if checks were coming and how soon, Prothro responded, ""I can't speak to how soon they will get it, but I can tell you, there is a process in place and we're working to get those refunds."" ""This whole process is new and everybody is learning as they go and trying to figure out what makes the most sense, and that's what they're working on."" Pressed on the delay in the counties receiving funds, Prothro responded, ""Like I say, they've set out some guidelines on how to get the reimbursement and the county has filed, is my understanding, and I have to run some traps to figure out where it is in the process and see what the answer is to that. I just can't tell you right now."" But the counties say there is no real process, and what does exist has been painful for everyone staring at the same problem. ""I kind of make a joke. We're on plan F. We've already gone through plans A through E,"" says Amy Lovoy, bureau chief for management and budget services in Escambia County. ""A check or money order, or a wire. Anything they want to give us is fine."" Escambia County has a $9.1 million claim with BP for its oil protection including booms, reconnaissance flights, and operations. The county says it also needs $4.8 million a month to maintain the plan, for as long as the oil remains a problem. Lovoy says the good news is that BP is returning her phone calls, but the bad news is what she's hearing isn't helping. ""We're definitely hearing back from them, but they keep saying that the process has changed. They say, 'We know you've submitted a claim,' but they say, 'The process has changed and you have to re-submit the claim and paperwork.'"" And in the eastern Panhandle, Bay County, which includes Panama City, has had the same problem. County officials say they need $3 million to build a more robust boom system, and about $8,300 per day to maintain it. Other costs, like workers' overtime pay, are estimated at $10,000 per day. Officials of the Florida Association of Counties and emergency managers are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. Coast Guard representatives and BP officials because, they say, they need the claims process to be fixed right now. The chairman of the Okaloosa County Commission, Wayne Harris, went right to the point. ""We just need them to show me the money,"" he said. ""If they give us an American Express diamond or black (card), I'm happy with it.""","Florida Panhandle counties waiting on checks from BP .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The United States and South Korea began their annual joint military exercise Monday, kicking off an 11-day drill designed to ensure the countries' alliance is ""fully prepared to respond to any potential provocations,"" according to a statement from U.S. forces in South Korea. On Monday, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak ordered his military to ""thoroughly"" prepare with the United States to counter threats from North Korea, the Yonhap news agency reported. The timing of the joint training comes during a time of increased military tensions. South Korea blamed North Korea for sinking a 1,200-ton warship in March, killing 46 sailors. North Korea denied it sunk the ship. North Korea said Sunday that it will ""deal a merciless counterblow to the U.S. imperialists"" and to South Korean ""traitors,"" in response to the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise. ""The military counteraction of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] will be the severest punishment no one has ever met in the world,"" a spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army said in a statement carried by North Korea's official news agency. North Korea's statement Sunday took direct aim at U.S. President Barack Obama. ""The Obama Administration would be well advised to cool its head heated with the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK,"" the spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army said, ""and deeply ponder over what the DPRK meant when it clarified its resolute determination and solemn declaration to defend the country and the nation."" In response, Pentagon Spokesman Bryan Whitman said, ""These are annual exercises that reflect the U.S. commitment to the stability and security of the peninsula."" On Sunday, Yonhap reported the South Korean president proposed a plan to reunite his country with North Korea and suggested a tax to prepare for the costs expected if the two countries come together. ""Inter-Korean relations demand a new paradigm,"" Lee said in a speech to mark the 65th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japanese colonial rule, Yonhap reported. Lee said the two countries should form a ""peace community,"" and stressed the importance of the denuclearization of North Korea, Yonhap reported. He added that inter-Korean exchanges are needed to help build North Korea's economy, according to Yonhap. ""It is imperative that the two sides choose coexistence instead of confrontation, progress instead of stagnation. The two of us need to overcome the current state of division and proceed with the goal of peaceful reunification,"" Lee said, according to Yonhap.","The countries are engaging in an 11-day military drill .

"Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN) -- North Korea on Saturday heightened its threats against upcoming U.S.-supported military exercises after talks over the sinking of a South Korean warship. North Korea ""will legitimately counter with [its] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces,"" the state-run KCNA news agency said. Earlier, the isolated communist nation vowed a ""physical response"" to massive U.S.-South Korean military drills set to begin Sunday. The U.S. Defense Department said the drills are in response to the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and are intended to send a strong message to Pyongyang to stop ""provocative and warlike acts."" At a regional security conference Friday, North Korea lashed out at the impending exercise. ""There will be a physical response against the threat imposed by the United States militarily,"" North Korea spokesman Ri Tong Il said outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam. Two U.S. military officials told there was no sign of significant troop movement in North Korea. Why are the two Koreas so hostile? About 8,000 military personnel from the United States and South Korea are scheduled to participate in the joint military exercises. Meanwhile Friday, in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, officers from the North sat down for talks about the Cheonan incident with their counterparts in the U.S.-led United Nations Command. During the almost two-hour meeting in the international truce town of Panmunjom, the U.N. Command reminded the North Koreans of the Security Council's condemnation this month of the Cheonan attack. The Security Council did not mention North Korea by name but condemned the attack strongly, called for ""full adherence"" to the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the Korean War in 1953 and encouraged ""the settlement of outstanding issues on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means."" An international inquiry found North Korea culpable for the March attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors. But North Korea denies a role in the incident, which elevated tension between the two enemies. North Korea demanded again Friday that it be allowed to conduct its own investigation of the Cheonan's sinking and said the upcoming war games are being conducted under false pretext. ""The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [North Korea] through large-scale war exercises,"" the state-run KCNA news agency said. ""It should immediately stop the [anti-North Korean] nuclear war racket."" ""[This] double-dealing attitude is a dangerous one of driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a war phase,"" KCNA said. At the ASEAN meeting, nation after nation expressed deep regrets and offered condolences to the South Koreans. The United States has accused North Korea of aggressive behavior and imposed new sanctions Wednesday. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for South Korea on Friday. ""Here in Asia, an isolated and belligerent North Korea has embarked on a campaign of provocative, dangerous behavior,"" she said in Hanoi, Vietnam. Later, after a repatriation ceremony for the remains of three soldiers who died in the Vietnam War, Clinton said the door remains open for dialogue if North Korea commits to abandoning its nuclear weapons program. ""We would love for them to have the same opportunities that the people of South Korea have been able to enjoy for the last 60 years,"" Clinton said. ""So, it is distressing when North Korea continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region."" Ri described the planned U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise as ""another example of a hostile policy"" against North Korea. ""It is a grave threat to the Korean peninsula and also to the region of Asia as a whole,"" he said. He said the exercise is a threat to North Korea's sovereignty and security. The military exercise, dubbed Invincible Spirit, is scheduled to run from Sunday through Wednesday. In addition to the 8,000 personnel involved, military officials say, it will include 20 ships and submarines and about 200 aircraft. The exercises are to take place in the Sea of Japan on South Korea's east coast and the Yellow Sea on the west coast, according to a joint U.S. and South Korean statement. China has objected to war games in the Yellow Sea, so close to its coastline. And that is what bothers North Korea as well, said a University of Georgia professor who returned two weeks ago from his 52nd trip to Pyongyang. ""I think it's a bad idea,"" said Han Park, who helped arrange former President Carter's visit to North Korea in 1994 and is the only American to have visited the rogue nation since the Cheonan incident. Park said the United States should never underestimate the resolve of the North Korean military, one that is further emboldened now by Chinese opposition to the military drills. ""I will hold my breath if this takes place anywhere near the west coast,"" he said. CNN's Elise Labott, Barbara Starr and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","NEW: North Korea says it will counter joint exercise with its ""nuclear deterrence""

"(CNN) -- A Milwaukee, Wisconsin, motorist whose SUV fell into a large sinkhole thanked the passer-by who brought an end to the brief but terrifying ordeal. ""The road just went out from under me,"" Lance Treankler, the Cadillac Escalade driver, said Friday. ""When I landed, my head snapped back. I went unconscious for a few seconds. When I looked up, I saw water run over me."" That's when Mark Pawlik, 46, who was walking Thursday evening near Oakland and North avenues on Milwaukee's east side, came to the rescue. Pawlik told CNN affiliate WTMJ that he saw a nearby traffic light in the sinkhole and spotted the SUV heading right toward it. The vehicle disappeared and a traffic light landed on its roof. Pawlik saw the driver standing on the SUV's hood. ""I grabbed your hand. You looked at me and said, 'Get me out of here,' "" Pawlik told Treankler during their reunion, filmed by WTMJ. Treankler suffered only minor cuts and bruises in the incident, which occurred during a storm that brought heavy flooding to the city. It was not clear what part weather played in the sinkhole's formation. Crews will be able to retrieve the SUV from the 20-foot sinkhole Friday evening, said Barry McNulty, spokesman for We Energies. The sinkhole cut off power to the area, but about 200 businesses and homes should regain electricity Friday night, he said. Crews were building a temporary power line. Peter Panos, who owns the nearby Ma Fischer's Family Restaurant, said power was restored to his establishment about 3 p.m. CT. The SUV's engine remained running into Friday as police and fire officers decided how to proceed.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two foreign troops who went missing Friday in Afghanistan are Americans who have been abducted, an Afghan intelligence source told CNN Saturday. NATO's International Security Assistance Force and two U.S. military officials confirmed that the two missing service members are American.  NATO said they went missing after leaving their compound in Kabul city Friday afternoon and did not return. Forces have launched a search for the service members and the military vehicle they were in, ISAF said. Their duty status is ""whereabouts unknown,"" the U.S. officials said.

"(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago, representatives from every nation came together to voice one common goal: to advance the global status of women in the spirit of equality. We were there in Beijing, China, when women broke their silence and a resounding message burst forth from the walls of the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women: No longer would it be acceptable to separate women's rights from human rights. Today, we are seeing a powerful momentum materialize as women in diverse regions raise their voices to claim their rights and inspire change while leading neighborhoods, villages, parliaments and nations forward. As the world navigates through an unprecedented financial crisis, economists and leaders are increasingly turning their attention to the greatest untapped reserve of innovation and resilience -- women. Progress on women's equality is reaching different regions at different paces, but we can see improvement in girls' education, workforce participation and political representation. The global net rate of primary school enrollment for girls is up to 89 percent; the number of women holding nonagricultural, paid jobs continues to increase worldwide; and women's global share of parliamentary seats is rising, now at 18.4 percent. Something much harder to measure, but maybe the most significant of all indicators, is a widespread shift over the past 15 years in the global conversation about women. Our campaign for equality has come out from the darkness of the periphery. We are moving into an age that enables progress and an environment that sustains it. For Rebecca Lolosoli, the light of change is an unsteady flicker. In her home in rural Samburu, Kenya, women who are abused or raped are cast out of their homes; the concept of women's rights is as novel as it is dangerous. She was beaten for raising her voice in dissent, kicked to the ground for promoting a woman's right to live free of violence. Out of injustice that sought to tear her down, she emerged as a courageous voice of change. Rebecca formed Umoja Uaso Women's Village, a cooperative where once-forsaken survivors of violence find healing and independence as artisans who produce vibrant jewelry. Hers is one voice among the millions threatened by a global increase in violence against women -- one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime. We are confronted with a pandemic of violence, and must address it with commensurate force and urgency. Rebecca carries the weight of unrealized human rights on her shoulders. It is our duty to help lessen her load. We must support women like her as equal partners in economic, social and political development, and recognize their ability to practice collaborative leadership and carry their communities forward with each step they take. Recently we honored Rebecca at the 2010 Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards, recognizing her strength and vision as she empowers women and shapes a future free of violence against women. If we want to promote peace and prosperity, we must begin with women. We have seen that in societies where women's rights are respected, economies are stronger, civil societies thrive and political institutions are more open and free. Our progress in the past 15 years is tenuous if it's not shared, reinforced and expanded in all spheres. We must recommit ourselves to women's equality worldwide. Now is the time to build on the momentum and advance positive change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Field and Alyse Nelson.","Sally Field, Alyse Nelson say it's been 15 years since U.N. highlighted rights of women .

"(CNN) -- Lawrence Anthony is an all-action conservationist. The 60-year-old South African grew up in small towns in Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia and developed an affinity with nature from an early age. ""I grew up in the African bush and I formed an early relationship with the African bush which has stayed with me,"" he told CNN. ""As I've grown older I've watched the deterioration [of the natural world], and it really concerns me."" He took action to become a conservationist and created his own game reserve in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal region, but he's also taken his passion across borders. Hiring a car from Kuwait he drove into Iraq during the war there in 2003 to rescue animals from Baghdad zoo. He admits it was more naivete rather than bravery, but once he had managed to get the zoo under some sort of control (which had only around 30 animals left), he ventured out to save even more animals. ""Uday Hussein had lions that were rumored to be man-eaters, that he'd fed them love rivals and things like that. The whole of Baghdad was talking about it back then. It was very difficult. It wasn't the lions' fault; they're just lions. I refused to let anyone harm them, and thankfully they are still alive today,"" he said. Returning to South Africa in 2004 he set up The Earth Organization and expanded his international conservation efforts. He prepared a document that was presented to the United Nations as a draft resolution to make all wildlife parks and conservation areas protected in times of war and their abuse classified as a war crime. In 2006 he reportedly met with the Ugandan rebel organization the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 2006 while they were involved in the bitter civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Anthony reportedly persuaded them to protect endangered species such as the northern white rhinoceros. ""They were very hospitable,"" Lawrence said. ""I found out that the rhino was the spiritual totem of the tribes that they came from and they thought there were hundreds and hundreds of rhinos, and there weren't."" Creating relationships with people has been just as important as cultivating refuges for animals. After years of negotiation with the local chief of the land next to Anthony's reserve, he was able to persuade the local community to convert their own land into conservation areas, so they too could benefit from eco-tourism. ""I don't think I have a mission in life,"" he said. ""I just want to hold together the values that are important to us as human beings. The name of the game is to survive and we can't survive without the plant and animal kingdoms.""","Conservationist has rescued animals from Iraq and negotiated with rebel armies .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africa's former national police chief, Jackie Selebi, was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison after he was found guilty of corruption charges last month. ""You are an embarrassment to the police force ... you are an embarrassment to the country,"" Judge Meyer Joffe said after the sentence was handed down. ""I am satisfied that a sentence of 15 years imprisonment is appropriate in the matter,"" the judge added, according to the South African Press Association. The charges stemmed from Selebi's relationship with convicted drug trafficker Glenn Agliotti -- a friendship that was no secret. Once asked about it at a news conference, Selebi famously said, ""He's my friend. Finished and klaar"" -- an Afrikaans term meaning ""that's the end of it."" After a four-and-a-half-year trial, the court found Selebi gave favors to Agliotti in exchange for money and expensive clothes. Joffe rejected Selebi's defense that there had been a conspiracy against him, although he acquitted the former police chief on a charge of defeating the ends of justice, according to SAPA. SAPA reported that Agliotti, who was appearing in a nearby courtroom on murder charges, had no comment on Selebi's sentencing. Selebi's attorney asked the judge to release his client on bail while he prepares an appeal in the case. South Africa's ruling African National Congress party said the verdict last month clearly indicated ""that South Africa as a country is governed by laws that are applied without any fear or favor to anyone, regardless of their standing."" Selebi was until recently one of the most powerful political figures in South Africa. He served as president of Interpol from 2004 to 2008 and was a close ally of former South African President Thabo Mbeki.","Jackie Selebi, the country's former national police chief, sentenced to 15 years' jail .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- It has been nearly eight years since U.S. forces overthrew the Taliban leaders of Afghanistan, but the war against the Taliban insurgency is bloodier than ever. A U.S. soldier takes his position near a building attacked by the Taliban south of Kabul, Afghanistan, on Monday. The number of Afghan civilians killed in the wake of the war has increased 24 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same time period last year, according to the United Nations. And NATO and American forces suffered record losses this summer, with 75 troops killed in the month of July, making it the deadliest month for Western troops in the country since American warplanes first began bombing the Taliban in October 2001. The U.S. death toll will remain high for some time as the Taliban has gained the upper hand, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published Monday. ""It's a very aggressive enemy right now,"" McChrystal told the newspaper in the interview Saturday at his office in Kabul, Afghanistan. ""We've got to stop their momentum, stop their initiative. It's hard work."" The Taliban insurgency has blossomed in northern Afghan provinces such as Kunduz and Baghlan, long considered some of the safest territory in the country. And just 20 miles east of Kabul, Taliban ""judges"" operate openly in the back of pickup trucks, settling legal disputes between villagers in makeshift ""mobile courts."" The insurgents are filling a vacuum left by Afghanistan's Western-backed government, which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede suffers from nepotism, corruption and predatory practices. Challenge to the Afghan government . Afghans will go to the polls on August 20 to vote in the nation's second presidential election since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Opposition candidates have blamed the Taliban insurgency's continued growth on Hamid Karzai, the man who has occupied the presidential palace in Kabul for the past seven years. ""Because of the failure of the current administration, in losing the support of its own people, there is a vacuum, and that vacuum has led to a deterioration of security as well as in all parts of life,"" said Karzai's top challenger, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah. McChrystal, a former U.S. joint special operations commander who recently took command of the U.S.-NATO operation in Afghanistan, said the Taliban are challenging the very legitimacy of his partners in the Afghan government. ""The fundamental conflict in any insurgency is fighting for legitimacy with the people and the support of the population,"" he explained in a recent interview with CNN. ""Who do they look to as their legitimate government? Who do they pay taxes to? Who do they look to for rule of law? Who do they look to as protection? In the case of this insurgency, what we have is an Afghan government that is trying to establish itself around the country. It has problems with corruption. It has problems in some cases with predatory behavior."" Along the traffic-choked streets of Kabul, residents rarely complain about the Taliban. Instead, they often rail against the Western-backed Afghan state. ""What service has this government provided us?"" asked Fawad, a young street vendor who sells watermelons for 20 cents apiece. He said that at least once a week, Afghan police show up and demand bribes of up to $100 from vendors, who must pay if they want to continue selling their goods. ""We don't want a tyrant who oppresses the people,"" Fawad said when asked who he would vote for in the elections. ""What we want is security."" Earlier this month, an Afghan employee for CNN, who prefers not to be named for security reasons, witnessed how locals turn to the Taliban to resolve their disputes, in a village barely 20 miles east of the Afghan capital. He said openly armed insurgents rolled up in a pickup truck, and a Taliban judge began mediating local disputes. In one case, the Taliban official resolved a disagreement between two shepherds whose flocks of sheep had gotten intermixed while grazing. ""I was shocked,"" said the Afghan eyewitness, who was visiting the village to attend a funeral. ""The villagers were lining up asking for help from the Taliban."" NATO commanders say they have had reports of Taliban ""mobile courts"" operating in similar fashion just outside the southern city of Kandahar. ""There are cases of rule of law being taken care of by the Taliban instead of the Afghan government,"" said Col. Paul Kolken, a Dutch military spokesman at Kandahar Air Base. He said the Taliban are operating mobile courts as close as possible to the city of Kandahar. Afghan corruption at the highest levels? Human rights activists accuse the Karzai government of making deals with some of the country's most notorious warlords ahead of the August 20 presidential elections. ""A lot of Afghans are telling us they're quite disappointed that Karzai's not even running on a platform of promises or performance, but just an old fashioned Afghan cutting of deals,"" said Sam Zarifi of Amnesty International. He pointed to a recent article by Elizabeth Rubin, in the New York Times Magazine, that describes Karzai's choice of Mohammed Fahim, a former Northern Alliance militia commander, as vice presidential running mate. Fahim has long been accused of committing human rights abuses. ""Starting on the top and bringing Fahim back, this is horrific,"" Zarifi said. He lamented that Afghan politicians are rarely prosecuted for crimes, and if they are, they are often pardoned. ""Karzai has really regressed over the past seven or eight years,"" Zarifi said. Many Afghan observers argue this culture of impunity runs directly to the presidential palace. For years, Karzai's brother, Ahmed Wali, has been dogged by accusations that he is a major player in the booming drug trade in southern Afghanistan. One high-ranking Western diplomat stationed in Kabul described discussing the allegations with Karzai in a one-on-one meeting. Karzai asked for advice on how best to address his brother's alleged illicit business dealings, the diplomat said. At one point, the diplomat said, Karzai looked up helplessly, asking, ""He's my brother. What can I do?"" Both Karzai and his brother have repeatedly dismissed the allegations as politically motivated. This month, Karzai made a rare trip outside his presidential palace to woo voters in Baghlan province. He conceded that Afghanistan is still far from stable, but promised that if re-elected he would redouble his efforts to rebuild the country. ""Terrorism is still harassing us. It is still killing us. It is still destroying this land,"" he told a crowd of several thousand supporters. ""The moment I become the president of Afghanistan -- again -- through your vote, through your able hands, my first attempt will be to ensure perpetual peace."" Several days later, at a press conference with Karzai, the newly appointed secretary general of the NATO military alliance, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, called for NATO countries to contribute more troops to support the Afghan government. ""NATO-ISAF is here to protect your elections,"" the former Danish prime minister said at Kabul's presidential palace. ""What we need are credible elections that reflect the will of the people."" ISAF -- the International Security Assistance Force -- is the United Nations-mandated U.S.-NATO presence in Afghanistan. U.S. needs a strong Afghan partner . President Obama's administration has committed more resources and troops to battling the insurgency and training Afghan security forces, while also sending additional diplomats and civilian aid workers to focus on reconstruction and development. When Obama took office, he vowed to redirect military resources from the war in Iraq to Afghanistan, which he described as being -- along with neighboring Pakistan -- the ""central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism."" McChrystal told The Wall Street Journal that he is still considering a request to send 10,000 more troops to Afghanistan in addition to the planned 68,000 troops that are expected to be in place by the end of the year. The information is a preview of a strategic assessment he plans to deliver to Washington later this month. The military initiative is an effort to bolster Afghanistan's weak government, which many Afghan observers argue has been, more than anything, a source of frustration and popular disappointment. ""If the same trend continues, if the same failing of the administration continues, more troops, more resources, more civilian advisors will not be a substitute,"" argued presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah. Security will be on the minds of most Afghan voters as they head to the polls, according to Jahid Mohseni, the Australian-Afghan head of Tolo TV, Afghanistan's most influential TV channel. ""People are frustrated with things not happening,"" Mohseni said. ""In terms of day-to-day life, the development that they wanted in government has not been happening."" ""They are looking at being able to walk down the street at night without ... risking getting attacked, et cetera. They want to make sure that their kids don't get kidnapped.""","Eight years since U.S. forces overthrew the Taliban leaders of Afghanistan .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- As more U.S. troops head to Afghanistan, more families back home long to hear from their loved ones in uniform. Gia Ellis, wife of Marine Lt. Jason Ellis, holds her daughter Ava while watching a video. But the nature of the battle in Afghanistan makes that much harder now than it has been for troops serving in Iraq. Instead of near instant contact through e-mail, texts or even video conference calls, families back home often have to rely on something that once was rare: hand-written letters. ""Can you imagine we're going back to paper and pen. It's so weird to write an actual letter but that's what we have to do,"" Gia Ellis told CNN Pentagon Correspondent Chris Lawrence during a visit to Camp Lejeune Marine Base in North Carolina last week. The problem is two-fold: tactics and infrastructure, according to Marine spokesman Capt. Bill Pelletier, who is currently serving in Southern Afghanistan. The new commander of NATO troops in Afghanistan is sending units out into remote villages to defend the locals from Taliban attacks. Rarely do those villages have modern communications systems. Some units have a satellite phones but the demand on the phones makes it hard for troops to use them to call home.  Watch reporter on move with U.S. troops » . ""Personally I was spoiled last year,"" said Ellis, whose husband Jason served last year in Iraq and is currently in Afghanistan. ""We could talk and see each other on webcam and e-mail almost every day. And this year with the initial push into Afghanistan it's completely different."" Some wives become news junkies, combing through news reports from the field hoping to learn more about their husbands or at least his unit. ""Because we're not getting the e-mails, it means a lot just to even try to find a picture, get a glimpse of them,"" said Melissa Pullen, the wife of a deployed Marine. For older soldiers, previous deployments put the convenience of modern communication in perspective. Capt. David Luber remembers waiting to talk to his wife during a nine-month tour during Operation Desert Storm. With limited phone access and no e-mail, Luber recalls the angst he felt during his deployment. ""It was worse than I imagine prison in some respects. Men in prison know that they deserve to lose their freedom. They have telephones, television and green grass outside that they can be with for a time each day,"" Luber said. Unable to reveal when or where his trips would end, Luber would go weeks without hearing his wife's voice. To make matters worse, Marines only received mail once their ship arrived at port. Sleepless nights and the torment of reckless seas were forgotten when he'd receive a bundle of letters, one for each consecutive day his wife, Belinda, wrote. One by one Luber would put the letters in chronological order and read each one until he read the last. ""There are things that we say on paper that we are not so quick to speak, if at all,"" he says. ""There's the handwriting and the perfume that you can't get through the phone or e-mail, so the letters were precious."" For younger troops and their families, the technological comforts of Iraq can make the new mission in Afghanistan difficult to adapt to. ""Our Marines have been told from day one that Afghanistan is not Iraq,"" Pelletier wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Troops are provided first and foremost with the ""must haves"" to help complete the mission, he wrote. This includes water, food, ammunition and an age old treasure for military personnel, mail. There's already help on the way for those who prefer 21st century communications. Pelletier says an Internet café has been established at Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, the remote area along Afghanistan's southern border with Pakistan where the Marines are involved in a long-term offensive. Pelletier said that the Marine Corps plan to extend Internet service as the mission evolves. Until then, Ellis and Pullen will have to rely on hand-written letters to communicate with their husbands. And that might not be all bad. Luber is now a deputy program manager at the Office of Naval Research. It's been 18 years since his Desert Storm deployment, but the comfort and fragrance of his wife's letters linger. ""I still have them all and she has all mine,"" he said.","U.S. troops warned Afghanistan is not Iraq -- where communication is easier .

"New York (CNN) -- The recently leaked memo from departing chief United Nations corruption investigator, Inga-Britt Ahlenius, to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will make it impossible for the White House to support the UN chief's candidacy for a second four-year term next year. That is, unless the Obama administration itself was only joking when it promised to push for greater transparency and accountability at the United Nations. In a 50-page ""end-of-mission"" report, the widely respected former auditor of Sweden -- who was originally brought in to help the UN fix the spectacular accountability gap exposed during the excruciatingly painful ""oil-for-food"" scandal -- paints a detailed, well-documented tableau of Ban's managerial incompetence. In a spectacular break from tradition, Ahlenius did what few senior diplomats ever dare to do: She spoke truth to power. In her report, Ahlenius documents Ban Ki-moon's repeated efforts to undermine his own senior officials, including her own office of internal oversight, by stemming the flow of information, interfering in the appointment of staff, or worse, failing to appoint people to senior management positions altogether. Critical leadership posts were left vacant for as long as possible, thereby strengthening Ban's power over the bureaucracy. The UN Secretariat, she concludes, is ""in a process of decay ... falling apart ... and drifting into irrelevance."" It may be that many member states do not actually want the UN to get in the way of their realpolitik. But when it comes to standing for the principles of its charter in difficult, often dangerous mission areas, the UN cannot succeed unless its staff are led and supported by a better-managed Secretariat in New York. As it happens, even their very physical security did not appear to be a priority for the Ban Ki-moon administration. It failed to appoint another Under Secretary-General for Safety and Security for a full 11 months after accepting the resignation of David Veness, in June 2008, following the deadly bombing of the UN's Algeria headquarters. Ban's failures to perform his duties as the UN's chief administrative officer in a timely manner -- the Ahlenius report describes these failures as widespread --have repercussions all the way down the line on staff security and morale. Instead of being empowered to do their job, the staff, including Ahlenius herself, end up feeling undermined by their boss. Unless Hillary Clinton and her UN ambassador, Susan Rice, are prepared to contradict Ahlenius' assessment, they will have no choice but to withdraw America's support for Ban's re-election (his term expires at the end of 2011). Unfortunately for Ban's administration, few people were better placed than its own auditor to draw such conclusions. And she is not alone in her assessment. Ahlenius has managed the rather undiplomatic feat of saying out loud what a lot of UN officials, including some at the highest levels, have been murmuring for several years. While it is not altogether unheard of for former UN bureaucrats to blow their top after they leave office, it is without doubt the first time such a senior official has done so with as much competence, and credibility, as Ahlenius. As a former employee of the UN's ""oil-for-food"" operation -- the organization's fraud-ridden $64 billion humanitarian operation that saw billions of dollars diverted from needy Iraqi civilians into the pockets of Saddam Hussein and an international clique of corrupt politicians -- I have learned to recognize the elements that go into making large-scale diplomatic fiascos. After I had contributed to blowing the whistle on that program in 2004, some UN officials spent more time trying to discredit my testimony than to fix the cracks in the system that led to the debacle in the first place. Not so Ms. Ahlenius. In fact, she invited me to spend an afternoon conducting a ""lessons learned"" discussion with her entire senior staff. Her approach was so markedly different from what I had experienced that I caught myself feeling hopeful, thereafter, about the chances of seeing real management reforms happen after all. Unfortunately, it would seem Ahlenius has become a whistleblower herself. If such a senior UN official can't seem to communicate her concerns to her boss and is forced into the very uncomfortable position of having to speak out with such force as she did in her latest report, it is difficult to conclude that all is well at the top echelons of the world body. If Ban Ki-moon were well advised, he would not seek a second term in office. If he were earnest about pushing for UN reform, he would free himself from the pressure the member states may try to exert upon his office, officially make public those parts of Ahlenius's report that do not affect staff security, and dedicate himself to mending the cracks in the system identified by his departing auditor. Instead, Ban left it up to his chief of staff to issue a response which, both in form and substance, does a great job of confirming Ahlenius' criticism. In a July 19 letter to Colum Lynch of the Washington Post, who broke the story, Vijay Nambiar says that his boss ""is also concerned"" that critical senior managerial positions (now including that of Ahlenius) remain unfilled. The problem is, Ban's job is not just to ""be concerned."" It is to actually make appointments -- or ""to put butts on seats,"" as one U.S. official once put it to me off the record. In this instance, Ban ignored the best advice of a 15-member independent panel and refused to appoint John Appleton, the former Connecticut attorney, to head Ahlenius's investigation division. In the wake of the oil-for-food meltdown, Appleton had led an unprecedented exercise in accountability (so successfully, in fact, that his office was shut down in 2008). Perhaps Ban would prefer to appoint someone else who, like he, prefers to show ""concern"" about the challenges facing the world organization than to take them on -- with deeds, not just words. For the UN's own sake, let's hope the leaders of the world's democracies can do better than that when it comes to electing a new leader for the United Nations in 2011.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- The Moscow skyline of the Kremlin and St. Basil's Cathedral vanished Friday as a blanket of thick, noxious smoke shrouded the metropolis, leaving many of the city's 10 million residents with sore throats and burning eyes. On Friday, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visited a Moscow ambulance station, accompanied by top health officials. He was told that the number of emergency calls has increased by about 10 percent lately, related to the heat and smog. The acrid smoke, from thousands of square miles of wildfires, drove carbon monoxide levels in Moscow five times higher than what is considered safe, the Russian Health Ministry said. Residents were encouraged to stay indoors. Many who did not could be seen wearing masks as they walked outdoors. In interviews with the state-run RIA Novosti news agency, health officials likened the pollution levels to smoking several packs of cigarettes a day. Some flights to Moscow were diverted Friday because or poor visibility. The Russian Ministry for Health and Social Development reported Friday that 52 people have died as a result of the extensive fires in central Russia. Another 72 people needed treatment, 43 of whom remain hospitalized, it said. Fires were still burning Friday in 22 of the country's 83 regions. Tens of thousands of firefighters have been deployed to extinguish nearly 600 raging wildfires covering 500,000 acres, among the worst ever. The record heat wave gripping the country showed no signs of abating Friday. Temperatures climbed to 37 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit) in Moscow and hit 41 degrees Celsius (nearly 106 Fahrenheit) farther to the southeast in Tambov. By Sunday, Moscow could reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a figure never before officially recorded in the city. Percy von Lipinski, who is visiting Russia, described the sun as a ""barely visible dot of orange trying to light the sky."" Watch Percy's walk through smokey Moscow . ""I dared venture outside today but can tell you that it was a difficult job,"" he said in a CNN iReport. ""Tomorrow I have decided to take my chances to see if things are any better in the country side.""

"London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will join hundreds of veterans Sunday to commemorate the 65th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, or VJ Day, which was Saturday. ""The service will remember the efforts of hundreds of thousands of veterans operating in the harshest of conditions, and pay tribute to nearly 30,000 British losses suffered during the Far East campaign, (including) some 12,500 who died while prisoners of war,"" Britain's Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Cameron will lay a wreath on behalf of the British government, the statement said. On August 14, 1945, Japan surrendered to Allied forces, effectively ending World War II. ""We must never forget the sacrifices made and the dedication showed by those who served our country in the Second World War,"" Cameron said. ""They fought and suffered around the world in ferocious conditions. They witnessed incomprehensible horrors. They lost their lives -- and many were imprisoned. And they did all this for us -- to protect the freedoms we all enjoy today. VJ Day, the day the Second World War ended, is a time for this generation to reflect and show its gratitude to our veterans for their bravery, dedication and sacrifice."" Chief of the General Staff, Gen. Sir David Richards, will lay a wreath on behalf of the British Army, the Ministry of Defence said. The ministry, along with the Burma Star Association, organized the service. The association, founded in 1951, ""brings together veterans from all three services who experienced the bitter fighting in the jungles of Burma,"" which is modern-day Myanmar, the ministry said.","Ceremony on Sunday remembers the day Japan surrendered in 1945, ending WWII .

"(CNN) -- Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says voting on Tuesday made sense when the day was set in 1845, but a change is needed. Now that the political parties have informally settled on their nominees, the focus turns to November 4, when the nation will go to the polls to choose a new president. But why is Election Day on a Tuesday? Why in the world do we continue to insist on voting on a weekday when we are supposed to be encouraging as many people to vote as possible? Most of the primaries and caucuses during the past four months took place on Tuesdays, but a number went to the polls on Saturdays. The Puerto Rico vote was on a Sunday. What's better than going to church in the morning and then making your way to the voting booth? Officially, Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November (depending on the year, it could be November 2 through November 8). Since 1845, this has been the standard practice in the United States. Congress wanted a set date to elect a president and members of Congress, and because we were an agricultural society, this was the best day for farmers in rural America to get to the polls. That made a ton of sense. Then. But a lot has changed in the past 163 years, and it's time Congress changed this unnecessary law. The purists are likely to argue that everyone knows that a Tuesday in early November is set aside for Election Day. So with that in mind, just leave the election in November. Sure, it would make better sense to go with a month during which it's warm in nearly all of the USA, but the consistency argument also makes sense. But why not the first Saturday in November? If that date were chosen, the majority of voters wouldn't have to worry about trying to vote before going to work, hoping and praying the lines aren't too long so they can zip in and zip out. The same thing happens in the evening. Folks have to hurry up and finish their work, interrupt meetings, and shut down whatever else they are doing and head to the polls. They are likely to confront long lines, and that discourages some folks from voting. (Now, I don't have much sympathy on this one. We'll stand in line for a concert or movie; and that surely isn't as important as electing a president!) Saturday is already a day of leisure, and there is no doubt that more Americans would head to the polls on a traditional day off from work. Because of the excitement generated by this year's campaign, you can bet there will be long lines at the polls, and if there are not enough ballots, we can expect all kinds of delays. Folks will grow frustrated, be afraid to show up to work late, and likely will leave and not come back. That's just not good for democracy. This is one of those simple decisions that doesn't require a ton of debate. I can't imagine there being major opposition to moving the election date. In 2004, 71 percent of all eligible voters were registered, according to a story by the Carnegie Reporter, ""Election Reform: Lessons From 2004."" But of that number, 60.7 percent voted. Someone is likely to say that with the number of people voting up in 2004 from the number in 2000, that's not bad. But when we see 90 percent of voters in Iraq voting -- and we are trying to instill democracy there! -- it's clear that impediments to voting in the United States aren't helpful. It would be nice to see the presidential nominees weigh in on this and pledge to change the election date. Let's see a debate moderator ask this question. Instead of putting up barriers for people who want to vote, we should be the most open society when it comes to giving our citizens as many options as possible to vote, and moving Election Day from a weekday to a weekend makes a lot of sense. We can't speak of our cherished democracy around the world if we aren't willing to improve it every chance we get. Roland S. Martin is a nationally award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Security was tight in Northern Ireland on Saturday for a contentious annual march by a Protestant group. Saturday's march by the Apprentice Boys through the mainly Catholic city of Londonderry is the largest of several they hold during the year, mainly in summer. The march commemorates the Siege of Derry in 1689, when thousands of Protestants died. Before the Londonderry parade was due to begin at 12:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), local members were also holding smaller ""feeder"" parades in their own areas. A feeder parade in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast, a flashpoint for sectarian violence, happened peacefully Saturday morning. Trouble flared in Ardoyne and other areas of Belfast last month after a decision to allow another Protestant parade to pass through a mainly Catholic neighborhood on July 12, a day when Protestants march to celebrate the victory of England's King William III over his ousted Catholic predecessor, James II, in 1689. Dozens of officers were hurt in days of violence surrounding the annual event, known as The Twelfth. Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","The Protestant march passes through a mainly Catholic city .

"(CNN) -- 2010 has, so far, been a great year for women in film. From Kathryn Bigelow's record-breaking ""The Hurt Locker"" to Lone Sherfig's BAFTA-winning ""An Education,"" women seem to be thriving behind the camera. But, these success stories are very much the exception in a male-dominated global industry. Amy Mole and Rachel Millward are two women trying to change that: They are, respectively, the managing director and founder of the Birds' Eye View Film Festival which celebrates and promotes female filmmakers. Bird's Eye View brings together female directors from Europe to Africa to participate in screenings and workshops. Mole hopes to inspire more young women to try their hand at directing and screenwriting -- long considered to be men's work. Movies being screened include Drew Barrymore's ""Whip It,"" Mia Hansen-Love's Cannes winner ""The Father of My Children"" and ""Lourdes"" by Jessica Hausner, a 2009 Venice Golden Lion nominee. Here Mole talks to CNN's The Screening Room about the particular challenges facing women looking for their big break and how the festival hopes to help. The Screening Room: What is the aim of the Bird's Eye View Film Festival? Amy Mole: The festival is there to promote and showcase the best of women across the world. We bring over women from lots of different countries ... this year we have film makers from Kenya and from Spain, and South Africa as well as lots of other places. TSR: What is the situation of women in the film industry and does this vary from country to country? What are the specific challenges women face in, for example, East Africa? AM: The interesting thing about the role of the director as a woman in film is that it doesn't really change depending on which county you're in. The restrictions that exist around that role and the problems for women in that role exist everywhere. TSR: What kinds of challenges do women in the film industry face? AM: Knowing that the role of the director is erratic and the schedule is all over the place and very demanding, knowing that, it means that child rearing actually becomes a massive issue and being on location -- quite often for long periods of time -- makes it really, really limiting and makes it really, really hard to actually be a mom. TSR: What is the single biggest challenge for a woman who wants to enter the industry? AM: I think that bringing up children whilst being in the role of director is the biggest challenge and I think it's something that needs to be recognized, so ideally the industry will respond to that. I think it is a real challenge, and I think since early cinema it has become a very male dominated industry and we've had, sadly, reports of sexism on set which is a real worry. Obviously, those reports aren't commonplace ... Everyone needs to know that that's the case and we need to support the women in the industry. TSR: What is the festival doing to promote women in film? AM: We're launching two training labs, which are held at Bird's Eye View throughout the year. One of them is a screenwriting program called ""She Writes,"" which is for screenwriters who are emerging in the industry. They follow a year long mentoring program, specifically on scripts that they're working on. We're also launching another lab, which is an animation lab called ""Reanimates,"" which is in partnership with WARP Films. Now, that project is about brining together screenwriters and animators. The process it follows is the same as ""She Writes,"" so it's a mentoring program ... the result will be that two or three projects will be taken on the development slate of WARP Films. TSR: Do you have any statistics about women in the industry? AM: We know that in 2007 only seven percent of directors in the UK were women. This spiked up slightly in 2008 to 12 percent, but since the recession hit, we've had reports that it's gone down as much as 20 percent. Screenwriters aren't much better off either. In 2007, it was 12 percent, and it went up to 18 percent in 2008. But again, that's dipped as we've gone into the recession. TSR: What are the most popular roles for women in the industry? AM:; There's a lot of female editors and there's a lot of producers. We had an interesting chat with someone the other day, about women editors in early cinema and how editing was likened to sewing, which is why it was more permissible in the female domain. So, there's more female actresses and producers, but directors and screenwriters is where the real problem is.","The Bird's Eye View Film Festival promotes women in film .

"(CNN) -- Northrop Grumman Corp. plans to close a New Orleans, Louisiana, shipbuilding operation in 2013 and consolidate its Gulf operations, affecting thousands of jobs, the company announced Tuesday. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who has been meeting with company officials, said he will do everything possible to keep the Avondale yard open. ""This presents a tremendous economic challenge to the Avondale area,"" Jindal said in a statement. ""The roughly 5,000 direct jobs at the Avondale site support about 6,500 additional indirect jobs in the New Orleans region, meaning a total of roughly 11,500 jobs are at risk due to this change in the Navy's procurement program."" Northrop-Grumman said the decision was a necessity. ""The consolidation will reduce future costs, increase efficiency, and address shipbuilding overcapacity,"" Wes Bush, chief executive officer and president, said in a statement. ""This difficult, but necessary decision will ensure long-term improvement in Gulf Coast program performance, cost competitiveness and quality."" As a result of the consolidation, Northrop Grumman, which has owned the Avondale operation since 2001, said it will recognize an estimated pre-tax charge of $113 million in the second quarter. The company builds the LPD 17 San Antonio-class amphibious troop and cargo vessel for the U.S. military. Two other facilities that work on the LPD program also will be impacted, said Brandon R. ""Randy"" Belote III, vice president of strategic communications. The LPD vessels will be built only in Pascagoula, Mississippi, after the Avondale closure. Shipbuilding will continue in Gulfport, Mississippi. The company also said it is considering options for its the shipbuilding business. ""Recognizing our company's long-term strategic priorities, we foresee little synergy between shipbuilding and our other businesses. It is now appropriate to explore separating shipbuilding from Northrop Grumman,"" said Bush. Options include spinning the division off to shareholders. Although the state already is considering options for new work at the New Orleans shipyard, Jindal said he is asking Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus and the federal government to prevent jobs at Avondale from being lost. Northrop Grumman will give details of the plans to investors Wednesday morning. Bush said the company will work with federal, state and local officials to ""explore alternate uses for Avondale as the last two ships under construction reach completion."" Northrop Grumman said it anticipates some opportunities in Pascagoula for Avondale shipbuilders who wish to relocate. Belote did not specify how many jobs might be moved.","Northrop Grumman will close New Orleans shipbuilding facility in 2013 .

A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says NY Post editors should have seen that the cartoon would be considered offensive. (CNN) -- President Obama earned kudos from the media when he said he screwed up in nominating Tom Daschle as secretary of Health and Human Services despite his problem with paying taxes. Too bad the leadership of the New York Post didn't follow the lead of the president in admitting that an editorial cartoon they ran today by Sean Delonas was offensive, careless and racist. If you haven't seen the editorial in question, it shouldn't take you long to figure out that the subtle message was clear: comparing President Obama to a chimpanzee. In the cartoon, a cop is holding a smoking gun and, with another officer, looking at a bullet-riddled body of a chimpanzee. The caption reads: ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill."" New York Post: See Sean Delonas cartoons . In a statement to The Associated Press, Col Allan, the Post's editor-in-chief, said the cartoon was an obvious reference to the story of a chimp in Connecticut that viciously attacked a woman and was killed by police. ""The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event, to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut. It broadly mocks Washington's efforts to revive the economy. Again, Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist,"" he said, referencing a news release the civil rights activist sent out blasting the paper and demanding an apology. Delonas, the cartoonist, said to CNN, ""It's absolutely friggin ridiculous. Do you really think I'm saying Obama should be shot? I didn't see that in the cartoon. The chimpanzee was a major story in the Post. Every paper in New York, except The New York Times, covered the chimpanzee story. It's just ridiculous. It's about the economic stimulus bill. If you're going to make that about anybody, it would be [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, which it's not.""  Watch Roland Martin, other CNN panelists debate cartoon » . To the editors who approved the cartoon, as well as the cartoonist, the piece was clearly all fun and laughs. But anyone with half a brain, especially someone knowing the history of African-Americans being called monkeys and gorillas, would have said, ""We need to rethink this."" First, mixing the two stories is ridiculous. Yes, the chimpanzee incident and the passage of the stimulus bill have a lot of folks talking, but to put them in the same element just doesn't make sense.  Watch civil rights groups criticize the cartoon » . Second, the cartoonist didn't hang a sign around the neck of the chimp, so he left it up to the reader to determine exactly who the cops were referring to. We all know that the stimulus bill was the first priority of the new president, so when reading the caption, it was easy to infer that the cartoonist was implying the president of the United States. You know, the black guy. And that's where the problem comes in. What could be seen as silly humor if President George W. Bush were in the White House has to be seen through the lens of America's racist past, as noted by the leaders of the New York Association of Black Journalists, who also are demanding an apology from the Post. iReport.com: iReporter very offended by cartoon . ""How do you think the Jewish community would feel about the use of rats in any depiction of them? How do you think the Italian community would feel about being generalized with mobsters?"" the organization said in a statement. ""Monkey slurs against Africans and African-Americans go back to the days of early colonialism, when Anglo Saxon, Spanish and Portuguese conquerors used these types of drawings and descriptions to dehumanize black people so that their mistreatment and enslavement would not be viewed as wrong or sinful. The practice also took on more sinister roles later in history including during the slave trade here in the U.S. and in Hitler's Nazi Germany."" Ignorant leaders of the New York Post and others may think everything is fair game, and certainly criticizing the president of the United States is just fine. Yet while everyone seems to be caught up in the delusion of a post-racial America, we cannot forget the reality of the racial America, where African-Americans were treated and portrayed as inferior and less than others. And just as some members of the media brotherhood were taken to task for their obvious sexism during the Democratic primaries because of comments about then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, we had to be sensitive to the historical treatment of women. Oh yes, the Post will have its defenders, accusing African-Americans and others of being hypersensitive. The Post has already shown its hand by trying to make this all about Sharpton, since they know he's the black bogeyman to white America. But they should understand that my e-mail box and Facebook page are filled with comments from folks of different backgrounds stunned by the callousness of the Post. iReport.com: Is the cartoon racist? I guess it's fitting the cartoon ran today, because the best statement to sum up the issue can be taken from a black history month speech given today by our first black attorney general, Eric Holder. ""Even as we fight a war against terrorism, deal with the reality of electing an African-American as our president for the first time and deal with the other significant issues of the day, the need to confront our racial past -- and our racial present, and to understand the history of African people in this country -- endures,"" he said. ""One cannot truly understand America without understanding the historical experience of black people in this nation.

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says he doesn't buy all the hype associated with Valentine's Day. (CNN) -- With retailers hurting and the U.S. president trying to encourage Americans to spend money to restore consumer confidence, what I'm about to say may seem like treason. But here goes: Please boycott Valentine's Day and all that is associated with this horrendous ""holiday."" For several years I have ripped into Valentine's Day. Not because I'm against love and relationships, but mainly because the holiday is such a farce. First of all, Valentine's Day is not built around a religious event like Christmas or Easter; nor does it have any special meaning to the nation such as Memorial Day or Veterans Day. It is nothing more than a commercial holiday created by rabid retailers who needed a major shopping day between Christmas and Easter in order to give people a reason to spend money. Now folks, I love my wife. She is truly an awesome woman who is smart, talented, fine, and, did I say fine? But do I really need a special day to show my affection for her? I've long maintained that if I sent my flowers at other times during the year, why do I have to fall victim to peer pressure and send her some roses that have quadrupled in price leading up to February 14? Why should I be inundated with mailings, e-mails and commercials to show her that I love her by buying jewelry or clothing? If we went shopping in June or September or last month, can I get some kind of waiver or ""Get out of Valentine's Day"" card? As for this silly flower thing, it's even got to the point that any flowers can't do. Some years ago I planned on sending a woman some flowers that weren't roses, and the (female) co-workers were aghast. They felt that nothing mattered except roses. First of all, I didn't have a lot of dough and felt a nice bouquet was sufficient, but they were appalled. So I told them to go to hell and I'll do what I want. I guess for them, the thought really doesn't matter. Then there are the women on the job who measure the love of their men based on those flowers. You know how some folks are. If there are flowers on the desk of 10 other women, and one woman doesn't have anything, folks get to talking and whispering as if something is wrong in her relationship. I've learned that even if you get the biggest-ever rose bouquet -- the relationship might be crumbling and  you just refuse to admit it. And Valentine's Day really isn't even a two-way street. Men are utterly irrelevant except to serve as pawns in this commercial game, emptying their wallets in order to satisfy their lovers or those around them. Oh yea, retailers know the con game. Most of these guys are hapless saps who have ignored their wives or girlfriends all year, so they buy the flowers and candy, and set a reservation at one of the city's most expensive restaurants, all to say, ""Honey, I love you."" Ladies, and men, stop it! It's time to say enough is enough with Valentine's Day. What do I want? How about men and women loving, caring and sharing the other 364 days a year? February 14 isn't the only time to send flowers to your woman (ladies, we wouldn't mind getting a surprise delivery as well!). How about dropping her a flower arrangement on May 14? And on that card you need to write, ""Just because..."" Instead of men and women spicing up their sex life on February 14, make the effort to satisfy your mate the rest of the year. If last Valentine's Day was the last time you took your significant other out to a really nice restaurant, you deserve to be in trouble. Are you planning to treat your man or woman to a wonderful day at the spa this Saturday? Well, I'm sure he or she would thoroughly enjoy the same in June or July. It's time that we all take stock of our relationships and learn that we are to be loving and fulfilled 365 days a year, and not reduce our affection to flowers, candy, jewelry, clothes and a meal on one day a year. The people who plan their lives around Valentine's are like those who spend more time planning their wedding day rather than planning their marriage. The day is nice and wonderful, but what makes it last is what you do on the ""non-special"" days. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Valentine's Day is good for retailers but it's a bad idea overall .

"(CNN) -- The Taliban fight against American and NATO troops in Afghanistan ""is forging ahead like a powerful flood,"" according to a purported online message posted Saturday by the Taliban's elusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. A message from Mullah Mohammed Omar, seen here in 1996, appears on a Web site the Taliban frequently uses. ""Anyone who opts to resist it will himself be washed away. Atrocity, torture, brutality, conspiracies, coalitions, the foreign forces and mercenaries could not hurl stumbling blocks in the way of this robust Jihadic movement,"" Omar adds in the written message. The fight against foreign forces ""is approaching the edge of victory,"" according to Omar. ""Our goal is to gain independence of the country and establish a just Islamic system there on the basis of the aspirations of the Muslim nation. We can consider any option that could lead to the achievement of this goal."" Omar also released a statement in December last year. CNN was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the report, which appears in English and Pashtun on a Web site frequently used by the Taliban. However, a Taliban spokesman said the message is authentic.  Watch a report on the message from Kabul, Afghanistan » . When contacted by CNN, the U.S. State Department said it had no direct response to Omar's comments, which take a swipe at President Obama. ""We would like to say, we are victims of the black propaganda of the enemy media. This has created doubts between us and a number of countries of the world. They have wrongly depicted us as a force being against education and women's rights. They also accuse us of our being a threat to the countries of the world,"" Omar wrote. ""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan calls on the public of the West not to be deceived by the assertions of Obama, who says the war in Afghanistan is a war of necessity. The West does not have to wage this war. This war, in fact, started for clandestine motives under baseless reasons. ""The humanity, as a whole, suffers from its negative consequences. The global economic meltdown, instability, lack of trust and violation of international norms is the outcome of the baseless policies [of this war]."" With 48 deaths, August was the deadliest month for U.S. service members in Afghanistan since the mission began in late 2001. The United States now has about 62,000 U.S. troops there, and NATO allies have another 35,000. The Pentagon plans to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year. ""We would like to point out that we fought against the British invaders for 80 years, from 1839 to 1919, and ultimately got independence by defeating Britain,"" Omar says. He advises Western nations to go back even further in Afghanistan's history to study the period of Alexander the Great, who suffered severe losses when his army invaded the country in the fourth century. ""Today we have strong determination, military training and effective weapons. Still more, we have preparedness for a long war, and the regional situation is in our favor. Therefore, we will continue to wage Jihad until we gain independence and force the invaders to pull out,"" the leader says. He urges the mujahedeen fighting the foreign forces to focus on the ""Islamic education of the masses, so that they would voluntarily participate in Jihad in person and by wealth."" In July, CNN obtained a new Taliban military ""code of conduct"" document, which called for restrictions on suicide attacks as well as avoiding the killing of civilians. ""Suicide attacks should be at high-value and important targets, because a brave son of Islam should not be used for low-value and useless targets,"" the code of conduct said. ""In suicide attacks, the killing of innocent people and damage to their property should be minimized,"" it said. ""All mujahedeen must do their best to avoid civilian deaths and injuries and damage to civilian property."" And it says that mujahedeen ""should refrain"" from disfiguring people, such as the severing of ears, nose and lips. U.S. and Afghan military officials characterized the document as propaganda, and called it hypocritical. Omar's message comes as Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr, which ends the fasting month of Ramadan, and less than a month before the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, which took place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Omar criticizes the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and ""the rampant corruption in the surrogate Kabul administration -- the embezzlement, drug trafficking, the existence of mafia networks, the tyranny and high-handedness of the warlords, and spread and increase of the centers of obscenity."" In a recent talk at the Brookings Institution, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton noted, ""Corruption is as big a national security threat as I can imagine"" in Afghanistan. The United States has ""to take some of the responsibility"" for it, she said. ""We aided and abetted it in implicit ways by not demanding more earlier.""","Fight against foreign forces to gain independence nearing ""edge of victory,"" he says .

"(Gannett) -- Obsidian Entertainment's ""Alpha Protocol"" looked promising in concept and presentation, especially with the slickly produced trailers posted to YouTube. But it fell short due to a subpar shooting and cover system, anything-but-intelligent artificial intelligence and outdated graphics. It's too bad, really, because underneath it all is an interesting espionage, role-playing game -- one in which consequences are tied to your actions. But it's difficult to get past the game's shortcomings. ""Alpha Protocol"" is a suspense thriller in which you play as a young operative named Michael Thornton, part of a top secret U.S. agency known as Alpha Protocol. Thornton must traverse the globe and execute dangerous missions. But how you go about tackling a major conspiracy -- whose participants include fanatical terrorists, corrupt politicians and ruthless businessmen -- is up to you. For example, you can choose to be stealthy and hide in the shadows, enter each scene with guns blazing or use persuasion to achieve your goals. At the start of the game, you can choose what kind of an agent you want to be: Soldier (heavy weapon use), Field Agent (stealthier spy), Tech Specialist (good hacker), Freelancer (customize your starting skills) or the challenging Recruit option, who has no starting skills and little equipment. Then, as you progress through the missions, you can upgrade your skills by applying XP -- or ""experience points"" -- in nine skill areas. These include martial arts, stealth, pistol use, sabotage or technical aptitude, just to name a few. Many of the situations in this third-person adventure have a time limit, too, which some players will love and others will loathe. Sure, it adds thrill to the task at hand, but it can be frustrating when you run out of time quickly, such as in some of the puzzle-based mini-games that require a lot of repetition to successfully complete. Conversations are often timed, too, so you'll need to press a button on the controller to respond in a certain way. There are no bad choices, but choosing to be suave over aggressive, or vice versa, might help you get what you want easier, depending on whom you're talking to. Problems with ""Alpha Protocol"" include inaccuracies in aiming (the enemy can be square in your crosshairs, yet you somehow miss when you fire); glitches when taking cover behind objects (Michael's body gyrates when he gets too close to a corner); a camera system that proves more frustrating than helpful; enemies who just stand there and wait to be shot; and graphics that look a few years out of date (though some of the locations are well-designed, including memorable levels in Saudi Arabia, Russia and Taiwan). With more time and polish, ""Alpha Protocol"" could have been one of the more interesting summer blockbusters, but its numerous flaws dampen the overall experience. That said, those looking forward to buying this single-player game might consider renting it for the weekend.","Game has subpar shooting and outdated graphics .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and the British Prime Minister David Cameron Friday pledged to increase cooperation between the two countries on economic development and security issues. Meeting at Cameron's official country residence, Chequers, both leaders affirmed their commitment to further strengthen strategic ties, said Downing Street. Both leaders appeared to be making an effort to smooth relations between the two countries after the diplomatic spat prompted by comments made by Cameron about Pakistan promoting the export of terror. Zardari is also facing criticism for being away from home during devastating flooding in north-east Pakistan. ""It's a friendship that will never break no matter what happens,"" Zardari said. ""Storms will come and storms will go and Pakistan and Britain will stand together and face all the difficulties with dignity and we will make sure that the world is a better place for our coming generations."" Cameron expressed support for Pakistan's democratic government and support for coping with the damage caused by recent floods, Downing Street said. Zardari thanked Cameron for the UK's pledge of £10 million of immediate relief for flood victims. The British PM, who had dinner with Zardari on Thursday evening, has not publicly apologized for his comments about Pakistan promoting the export of terror. Cameron said Friday he recognized the sacrifices made by Pakistan's military and population in fighting violent extremism, Downing Street said. Speaking to the press after their Chequers meeting, which lasted about an hour, Cameron said: ""We want to work together to combat terrorism, that is a real priority for my government.""

"(CNN) -- Vito Maggiolo, an assignment editor in Washington who has been with CNN since the network started in 1980, was sent to Beijing in the spring of 1989 to help cover the historic visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to China -- like everyone else who was sent to Beijing. Vito Maggiolo (right) argued that a letter requiring CNN to stop broadcasting did not have the correct seal, or ""chop."" ""All of us went to China prepared for and expecting to cover what for us was a fairly routine, scheduled, structured event,"" said Maggiolo. ""Then we had this whole event in the square materialize and suddenly ... we found ourselves covering a mini-revolution."" Maggiolo missed the actual crackdown -- his visa had expired so he was pulled out a few days before June 4 -- but what he'll always be remembered for, he says, is his last-ditch role in the confrontation between CNN and the Chinese authorities that ended with the Chinese halting CNN's live transmission on the morning of May 20. Alec Miran, the special events producer for the Gorbachev visit, had been negotiating with the Chinese to try to stay on the air. The entire debate between Miran and the Chinese officials in CNN's control room, filmed by a CNN production person with a handycam, was broadcast live on the network. ""It was riveting television,"" Maggiolo said. Watch the debate between Marin and the Chinese officials in CNN's control room. » . ""Miran was telling them that we had a document that said we could transmit until such and such a time,"" Maggiolo recalls. ""He was saying that if that had changed, we needed a new document saying that. The Chinese officials then handwrote the notice on a yellow legal pad."" Then an ABC producer came in, Maggiolo recalls, and read and translated the document. ""He read this document and then there was this moment of silence,"" Maggiolo said. ""It was then that I chimed in. 'Excuse me, I said, but this doesn't have an official chop on it. China was extremely bureaucratic then. They lived and died by the chop. I was just trying to use their own bureaucracy against them to try and slow things down.""

"(CNN) -- The last U.S. combat brigade has pulled out of Iraq, but does that mean the more than 50,000 American troops who will remain there will never fire a shot or come under attack? A total end to violence seems unlikely, retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt warns. But Kimmitt, a former assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, says Iraq's military forces are ready to handle their country's security challenges and protect the American advisers. Kimmitt weighed in on the situation Thursday on CNN's ""American Morning."" CNN: How vulnerable are we leaving Iraq -- and our remaining troops -- as new spasms of violence occur? Kimmitt: The question is not whether there will be a total elimination of security incidents or not. The fundamental question is: Can the Iraqi security forces manage the process without needing American assistance? Yes, there will be low levels of violence even with a fully competent Iraqi security force. But even with 170,000 American forces, there were low levels of violence there as well. The Iraqis are saying, ""We can handle it now without American assistance,"" and I believe that to be the case. CNN: Are you concerned that the U.S. troops who remain in Iraq as trainers and adviser are at greater risk because of their smaller numbers? Kimmitt: I'm pretty comfortable on the combat capability of the Iraqi security forces. They have demonstrated, over the past couple of years, increasing levels of competence. And I believe the military commanders on the ground judge them to be ready to take over that responsibility in its entirety. So our remaining troops, who are in fact combat capable but in a support role, I think they're in pretty good shape. And the situation's in pretty good shape for the moment. CNN: How much of a change in their work will the remaining American forces see? Kimmitt: Well, first, many people think that the U.S. forces have been engaged in tough combat over the last couple of years. In fact, the Iraqi forces have been in the lead. It has been a gradual process of just handing complete combat responsibility over to the Iraqis. While that's been going on, there has been an advisory and an assistance mission, which the 50,000 troops that are remaining will [continue]. They'll work inside of the Iraqi units, providing assistance, military mentoring, and that will continue for another year and a half. CNN: In 7½ years of war in Iraq, we have seen more than 4,400 troops killed and more than $600 billion spent. Has it been worth it? Have we achieved our goals? Kimmitt: Well, we'll never be able to simply tell the American people that the loss of any life is worthwhile. But what I would say is, let's take a look at where Iraq is today. It's a democratic state, a friend to its neighbors, no longer a threat to the United States. Those soldiers who have sacrificed for the last 7½ years, some who have given their lives, I think they can look back and realize that they left Iraq in a much better position over the last 7½ years by their presence than had they not been there. Home and Away: Casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan . CNN: Were there missed opportunities? Were there things that could have been done differently that would have left us with the same overall impact in Iraq but with less cost and less time? Kimmitt: Look, I think as you look at any military campaign over history, looking back, yes, there are places and opportunities that were missed: Battle of the Bulge, significant intelligence miscalculations in the Korean War. Sure, we'd like to do it over again. We'd like to do it over better. But I think that that's just the nature of warfare. And you're going find that in any historical example, not just Iraq. CNN: What does the change in mission in Iraq mean for the ongoing operation in Afghanistan? Kimmitt: Well, that's still going to be a tough fight. But what reducing the force levels in Iraq does is, number one, it provides more dwell time for soldiers back with their families. We've been looking at setting up a program where [troops will have] one year in combat, two years at home. By having less of a burden inside of Iraq, that may be achieved. Afghanistan Crossroads: Reports from the front . Second, it also frees up critical assets that have been used in Iraq that now can add to those that are already in Afghanistan. So I think overall the net effect will be a positive one for Afghanistan and for our mission there.","All fighting unlikely to stop, retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt says .

"(Ars Technica)  -- Information about a keyboard being included in the ""Rock Band 3"" package was teased in the ""Green Day: Rock Band"" demo. We have now been given some exclusive information by our now-famous Mole about what we can expect from ""Rock Band 3."" Read on to find out what to expect from the instruments in the latest version of the game. It's the '80s! There won't actually be a keyboard peripheral sold with the game; instead there will be a keytar-like instrument supported. For those who didn't listen to much '80s music, a keytar is a sort of keyboard with a strap, held like a guitar. The keytar will be the only new instrument for the game. We were surprised that new instruments were being released at all, since Activision had noted that they were focusing on software and not hardware in order to cut costs. We figured Harmonix would follow what seemed to be a savvy strategy in a world already choked with peripherals. Harmonix will actually be doing something similar, and the peripherals will be created by an outside company. Mad Catz is bringing the instruments . Mad Catz will be creating all the ""Rock Band 3"" instruments and bundles; EA will only be distributing the software. Mad Catz will be offering many different bundles with different combinations of instruments available, and there will be bundles that are exclusive to certain retailers. If you have guitars, you'll be able to find a bundle for drums. If you need everything, that will be available as well. If a store doesn't want to be saddled with huge boxes, they can simply stock the game. This will allow the focus of the launch to be kept on the software, and we're told that there will be a ""pro"" mode included in the game that will require proper technique, and may lead to actual skills on guitars and bass. How this will work isn't known, but it's possible Mad Catz may create a product that more closely mimics an actual guitar. All this information is firmly in the rumor pile, excluding the Mad Catz connection, but our Mole has successfully broken more stories in gaming news and peripherals than anyone else in this business, so we're confident in this data. It also makes sense: Mad Catz has long had the license to release Rock Band peripherals, and large bundles suffer from thin margins and can be expensive to stock. Giving control of the hardware to a company who knows how to release and ship peripherals makes sense for everyone, and more bundles give retailers a new layer of granularity to stock items based on their needs.

"(Gannett) -- In need of a spring fling? Two new but very different video game releases this week should help. Shown for the first time back in 2005, Microsoft Game Studios' oft-delayed ""Alan Wake"" has finally been released. This supernatural adventure is worth the wait, though, and offers plenty of action, atmosphere and creative story-telling. ""Skate 3,"" on the other hand, challenges you to pull off slick tricks, take on team-based challenges and run your own skateboarding business. ""Skate 3"" is arguably the best in the series yet, though it's more evolutionary than revolutionary. Here's a closer look. ""Alan Wake"" 3 1/2 stars out of 4  (Xbox 360; rated Teen; $59.99; alanwake.com) ""Alan Wake"" is a strange single-player adventure about a bestselling author in the middle of a dry spell. To overcome his writer's block, Alan's wife, Alice, brings him to a small northwestern town called Bright Falls, but Alice soon disappears. After awakening from a blackout, Wake discovers an account of what happened that he can't remember writing -- until he starts finding sheets strewn throughout the town that fill in some blanks but foreshadow impending danger. In this game played from a third-person perspective, Wake talks with many residents to gather clues, explores this once-idyllic town and battles supernatural foes (collectively called ""The Taken"") using light as a common element in all the weapons and tools to help ward off what lurks in the darkness. There is some puzzle-solving, too, but most of the game focuses on character interaction, exploration and combat. Gamers who prefer story-driven adventures, such as Sony's ""Heavy Rain"" or EA's ""Mass Effect 2"" should appreciate ""Alan Wake"" as an interactive suspense novel with supernatural undertones. ""Skate 3""  3 stars out of 4  (PlayStation 3; Xbox 360; rated Teen; $59.99; skate.ea.com) It's only been a year since Electronic Arts rolled out ""Skate 2,"" a game that proved the publisher was serious about competing against Activision's ""Tony Hawk"" series. ""Skate 3"" improves on 2009's offering with a new city, extra tricks and deeper online play, but it's not radically different than its predecessor. Therefore, those who own ""Skate 2"" might want to test out the new game first to decide whether it's worth the $60 price tag. ""Skate 3"" focuses heavily on cooperative play, including team-based challenges in the fictitious city of Port Carverton. The goal of the meaty career mode is to start your own business and become the hottest skateboarding brand around. Your online buddies can join your crew to help take on various challenges, which include amassing a high score by pulling off midair tricks, achieving the longest jump, racing against others or taking part in photo shoots. Also, back again is the fun Hall of Meat mode that rewards you for over-the-top spills. If you need more people for team-based events, and your friends aren't online, computer-controlled skaters can fill in. Improved ""Flickit"" controls place a heavy emphasis on the controller's dual analog sticks (to control your skater and board) and trigger buttons (for grabs and grinds).

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 48 people were killed and scores were wounded Tuesday when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden vest in central Baghdad as men were queuing up outside an Iraqi army recruitment center, the Interior Ministry said. At least 129 people were wounded in the blast, which took place in the morning in the Bab al-Moudham commercial area. The spokesman for the Iraqi military command in the capital, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, said Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered a number of officers who were near the attacker to be detained for questioning. Atta told Al-Iraqiya state television that Tuesday had been the final day of a weeklong recruitment drive and that a large number of recruits had been waiting to sign up when the attack occurred. Atta said the bomber's vest was stuffed with 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of the plastic explosive C4, TNT and ball bearings. The attack came amid the country's failure to form a government and the United States' troop drawdown ahead of President Barack Obama's August 31 deadline for ending all combat operations. The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, or UNAMI, condemned the act and expressed concern over continued acts of violence in the country, ""including those perpetrated during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan that symbolizes the values of peace, tolerance, generosity and solidarity."" ""UNAMI reiterates that agreement on the formation of the government will greatly contribute to strengthening Iraq's ability to protect its citizens and respond effectively to those who aim at perpetuating instability and insecurity in the country and reversing its path towards peace and prosperity."" The Iraqi government has been pushing to increase security ahead of the drawdown, which would leave a residual U.S. force of 50,000 troops focused on stability operations as well as advising and assisting Iraqi security forces. Recruitment centers for Iraqi security forces have frequently been targeted by suicide bombers. A recent campaign of bombings and shootings has targeted Iraqi forces, especially in the capital, where gunmen have attacked traffic police and attacked checkpoints, killing Iraqi troops. Many Iraqis have blamed the recent wave of violence on the current political paralysis, in which quarreling parties have failed to form a government nearly six months after parliamentary elections. The attack has increased concerns among Iraqis about the ability of security forces to protect them when they cannot protect a government office. An Interior Ministry official said two roadside bombs detonated last week outside the same center,  wounding three people. Extremist groups, such as al Qaeda in Iraq, are known to take advantage of political fissures to carry out more attacks to create further turmoil. A spate of other incidents occurred Tuesday, said an Interior Ministry official, who cited: . -- A generator caught fire in eastern Baghdad that killed two people and injured 25 others. -- A string of drive-by shootings and bombings in Baghdad and Diyala province that killed three people and wounded five. -- A roadside bomb in the capital that seriously wounded the judge who heads Baghdad's appeals. -- A car bomb that detonated in the town of Balad Ruz northeast of the capital, killing two other judges. -- A drive-by shooting in western Baghdad's Ameriya neighborhood that killed a senior Trade Ministry official. -- A drive-by shooting in eastern Baghdad that wounded three occupants of a car. -- A hand grenade thrown at a police patrol in western Baghdad that wounded a policeman and a civilian. The website iraqbodycount.org estimated that nearly 2,000 Iraqi civilians had been killed this year through June. ""We continue to bleed as a nation,"" Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Samir Sumaidaie, told CNNI. He called the attacks ""despicable,"" but said, ""We do not believe there is any chance that they will derail the political process or destabilize the country. People are fed up with them and I don't believe they will achieve any political purpose."" In Washington, Deputy White House Press Secretary Bill Burton said President Barack Obama condemned the attacks. ""There are obviously still people who want to derail the advances that the Iraqi people have made towards democracy, but they are firmly on track and we're confident that we're moving towards the end of our combat mission there,"" he said. The political crisis worsened on Monday when former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's al-Iraqiya party announced that it was suspending talks with al-Maliki's coalition in response to comments he made in a television interview. Maysoon al-Damalouji, a spokeswoman for al-Iraqiya, told CNN the group decided to suspend negotiations after al-Maliki described Allawi's candidate list as a ""Sunni list"" in an interview aired Monday by the U.S.-funded network Alhurra. Al-Damalouji said they were demanding an apology to the supporters of al-Iraqiya. Allawi, a secular Shiite, heads the cross-sectarian al-Iraqiya list, which won the largest number of seats in the March 7 national elections. Al-Iraqiya garnered most of the Sunni Arab vote. The four top blocs are involved in weekslong negotiations to try to build a coalition with enough seats to form a government. A fragile mega-Shiite coalition was formed in May between al-Maliki's State of Law and the Iranian-backed Iranian National Alliance, which includes the followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, but the coalition collapsed this month after the INA rejected al-Maliki's nomination for a second term. Allawi and al-Maliki both claim the right to lead the next government. The two blocs have been holding talks. To form a government, a 163-seat majority of 325 seats in parliament is needed. Allawi's bloc had a narrow victory with 91 seats, while al-Maliki won 89. Western and Iraqi officials, including Allawi, have said Iraq's next government must be inclusive and representative, or violence could result. Sunnis largely boycotted the 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected and that contributed to the a bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare that gripped Iraq for years. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this story.","Suicide bomber detonates vest as men line up at army recruitment center .

"Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular contributor to CNN.com. Read his column here. Ruben Navarrette Jr. says ""Latino in America"" tells the real story of his community, for better and for worse. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Have you ever seen 47 million people hold their breath and hope for the best? Take it from this Latino in America, when many of my compadres heard that CNN was putting together a documentary on being ""Latino in America,"" that's pretty much what happened. For those of us in the Latino community who worry that those of us in the media are missing the best and most nuanced stories about America's largest minority because we're too busy harping on stereotypes and accentuating the negative -- ""I'll take an order of high school dropouts, with a side of gangbangers and mix in some gardeners and housekeepers"" -- there was a concern that CNN would blow the assignment. At least the cable network had the courage to take it on. Many of its competitors -- ABC, NBC, CBS, etc. -- still broadcast in black-and-white and haven't grasped the absurdity of producing Sunday morning talk shows where journalists and pundits gather for roundtable discussions that touch on Latino issues without a single Latino at the table. Having watched the documentary, which airs October 21-22, I can see that it's time to exhale. This is good work. I can also see that the smartest decision network executives made was putting this project in the very capable hands of my Harvard classmate, María de la Soledad Teresa O'Brien -- more commonly known as Soledad O'Brien. The award-winning correspondent -- whose mother is black and Latino, and whose father is Australian with Irish roots -- appears to have understood instantly why many Latinos are leery of projects like this. In a recent essay on CNN.com, O'Brien wrote: . ""It was clear that the community felt starved for good solid coverage. No one asked me to do a snow job. Just please don't reduce us to crime, immigration and racial conflicts, they asked. Folks just didn't want to see their community hurt anymore and were very blunt about it. One afternoon I had lunch with Lupe Ontiveros in Los Angeles,"" O'Brien wrote. ""She is a beloved Latina actor who has been reduced to the role of the maid or the nanny in scores of movies. I asked Lupe to be a major character in our documentary, and she offered an enormous amount of assistance. When I left the table she turned to my producer and said bluntly in Spanish, ""Please, just don't f-- us."" In the end, what you see isn't all cotton candy and lemonade -- or, in this case, churros and chocolate. There are negative images, peppered throughout stories about dropouts, teenage pregnancy, illegal immigration, crime, depression, etc. But there is also plenty of the positive, and most of the clouds have silver linings. Along the way, we meet ""The Garcias"" -- not one family, but a series of different individuals from throughout the country, all of them named ""Garcia."" There's Isabel Garcia, a fourth-generation Mexican-American immigrants' rights activist in Arizona, who organized a protest against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a media hound who rounds up illegal immigrants and is being investigated by the Justice Department over allegations of racially profiling U.S.-born Hispanics in the process. The protest turns into a piñata party when someone hangs a papier-mâché caricature of Arpaio and protesters whack it with sticks. There's also Lorena Garcia, a Spanish-language TV chef and businesswoman who some consider the ""Latina Martha Stewart,"" who was told to lose her accent and instead has found her language and culture to be assets that help make her unique and successful as she builds her brand. We also meet Bill and Betty Garcia, who moved from New York to North Carolina and now feel disconnected from their culture. He's from Puerto Rico and she's from the Dominican Republic, but their sons think of themselves as American. One of them even flunked Spanish in high school. To think that there are still Americans out there who think that Latinos aren't assimilating. In fact, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan insists that not only are Latinos not assimilating at present, but they also never have throughout history. Buchanan is loco. Following the script laid out by the Irish, Italians, Germans and Jews who came before them, Latinos are learning English, having smaller families, starting businesses, moving to the suburbs, joining the PTA and sending their kids to college. Many of them are just -- like the Irish, Germans and Jews who came before them -- trying to find ways to do all that while still preserving their culture and heritage. In the meantime, many of them are in a kind of holding pattern. They're considered too Mexican or too Cuban or too Puerto Rican to be Americans. And yet at the same time, were they to visit their ancestral homelands, they'd be considered too American to be Mexican or Cuban or Puerto Rican. For American Latinos, this is the Dickensian era, the best of times and the worst of times. They're being pursued by Sheriff Joe and by Fortune 500 companies hungry for their slice of an estimated $800 billion in annual spending power. Latinos are being told to learn English when, for many, the real challenge is preserving their Spanish. They are in all 50 states, representing 15 percent of the population now and on track to make up as much as 25 percent by 2032. Meanwhile, with all the issues out there, some Americans still get stuck on the basics of whether they should call us ""Latino"" or ""Hispanic"" -- or Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican. Who cares? You can call us whatever you want. You just can't ignore us.

"Editor's Note: Ed Rollins, who served as political director for President Ronald Reagan, is a Republican strategist who was national chairman of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. Ed Rollins says failing to find the WMDs in Iraq was far more than a disappointment. NEW YORK (CNN) -- One week from today, a historic presidency begins and a tarnished presidency ends. The inauguration of Barack Obama, the first African-American president, cannot come quickly enough for the vast majority of Americans. This young man with the keen disciplined mind and the buffed body begins a presidency with high hopes, goodwill and a never-ending list of problems left on the Oval Office desk by George Walker Bush, the ever-confident occupant of that high office who seems like the dinner guest who will not leave. In all my years around Washington as an observer and as a member of several administrations, I have rarely witnessed an event as bizarre as President Bush's farewell press conference yesterday. It reminded me of Richard Nixon's November 17, 1973, question and answer session before 400 Associated Press managing editors at the height of the Watergate scandal, in which he declared: ""People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook."" Well, to the best of my knowledge, Nixon wasn't a crook (in the technical sense). He was dishonest, he abused the office of the presidency, and telling the truth wasn't his strong suit. And he resigned in disgrace and would have been impeached if he hadn't. But there were also periods in his presidency that were very good for this country and the world. President Bush is not a crook either. And even more importantly, I don't believe he is dishonest or an incompetent. The mistakes of his presidency were caused by overconfidence, bad information or a certain arrogance that was still fully on display yesterday. How can you reflect on going to war, a war of choice, and argue that ""not finding weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment,"" as President Bush did yesterday? And putting the ""not finding the weapons"" in the same breath as ""We shouldn't have hung the sign, 'Mission Accomplished' ""! A disappointment is when you're a football fan and your team lost in the playoffs or in the national championship game. Eliminating weapons of mass destruction was the rationale for sending hundreds of thousands of men and women to Iraq to risk their lives and spending billions of dollars of American taxpayers' money. Find out how some readers are angry over Bush's legacy . The rationale for the war wasn't that Saddam Hussein was a bad guy -- which he was -- and that he violated every sanction and agreement that the United Nations put on him. President Bush went on to say: ""One thing about the presidency is that you can only make decisions based on the information at hand. You don't get to have information after you make the decision -- that's not the way it works."" That is correct and that may be the most important lesson our new president can learn from the failures of the last. Make sure you get the information to make the right decisions. President Bush, referring to the Abu Ghraib scandal and the missing weapons of mass destruction, said, ""I don't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, but things didn't go as planned, let's put it that way."" The lesson for President-elect Obama is often things don't go as planned. Last week four men who have been president had lunch in the White House with the newly elected president. As I looked at the picture of the five members of the most exclusive club in the world standing in the Oval Office, I felt sad. Two of the men, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, now in their 80s, had been overwhelmingly defeated in their bids for re-election. President Clinton and President Bush, both in their 60s, had periods of great failure. President Clinton was impeached. The present president leaves office with the lowest approval ratings in modern history. None of these were bad men -- just the opposite. Why did their presidencies not live up to those high expectations that we all have for our new leaders on Inauguration Day? In some cases, they fought their natural allies. President Carter was particularly inept at dealing with Congress; so was the current President Bush. Carter and the two Bushes failed at communicating with the public and were unable to articulate what their programs were and build support for them in Congress. Clinton, a good communicator, was terribly undisciplined. President Obama will need to set his priorities early. He can't do all he's promised in the first term. He needs to build strong relationships with the Congress and let them play a big role in setting his agenda. He needs to use his tremendous communication skills and continually explain to the country what he wants to do and why. Then he needs to take his campaign machine and motivate the grassroots organization he built to get Congress to support his programs. He must be patient but persistent in making his case. As we hope for the change which is coming next week, I just want to pause and reflect and say to President Bush, ""Thank you, for serving your country."" To our new president: Best of luck and you have our prayers.

"(CNN) -- Olympic and world 100 meters champion Shelly-Ann Fraser has been suspended after testing positive for the recreational drug oxycodone. Bruce James, the president of MVP track and field club in Jamaica, broke the news on Twitter, the UK's Press Association reported. The 23-year-old was due to run in Lausanne on Thursday night, but withdrew for the start of her event. The cause of her problems date back to a previous Diamond League meeting in Shanghai on May 23 where she tested positive after apparently taking medication for a toothache. ""We are withdrawing her from all competitions until we are able to have a hearing to determine what sanction will apply, or if she will be exonerated. ""Coach (Stephen) Francis is not upset with Shelly-Ann at all. He is actually proud of her for being brave enough to race in Shanghai. ""The IAAF have advised us that the offending substance is oxycodone. Google it. It is not a performance-enhancing drug."" Six Jamaican athletes have tested positive for banned substances over the last year, with all but one resulting in light bans. A defiant Fraser told Reuters.com Friday that she would be proved innocent. ""I have nothing to hide,"" she said. ""I will go home and have a hearing before my federation in Jamaica. ""I hope they will accept my explanation."" The sprinter shot to fame when she won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, racing to an impressive 10.78 seconds in the final. She doubled up as world champion in Berlin the following year. Men's sprint star Asafa Powell, who is a member of the same MVP club and is also coached by Francis, claimed it was ""not a big deal"" as he spoke to reporters ahead of a track meet in Gateshead, England on Friday. ""So I haven't heard much, I don't know what exactly it is. I have heard it is not a big deal. He added: ""Everyone has to be careful in this sport, no matter who you are. Any little thing can turn out to be a big thing.""","Olympic champion Fraser has tested positive for the painkilling drug oxycodone .

"(CareerBuilder) -- I'm probably as sick of writing about job loss as you are reading about it. But I have some good news to report. The Brookings Institute released the Q3 edition of its MetroMonitor, a ""quarterly, interactive barometer of the health of America's 100 largest metropolitan economies."" The MetroMonitor analyzes trends in U.S. metro employment, unemployment, economic performance, housing prices and real estate-owned properties to determine the rate of the country's recession and recovery. So what did they find with regards to jobs? Looking at Q2 2009 to Q3 2009, the overall percent change in employment change in the top 100 largest metro areas was -0.5 percent and also -0.5 percent for the entire U.S. Eleven metros that saw increases in employment in the last quarter and another six saw no change at all. Here are the 11 metros that saw positive job growth: . McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas Change in employment Q2 2009-Q3 2009: 1.3 . New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner, Louisiana Change in employment Q2 2009-Q3 2009: 0.6 . New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, New York, Pennsylvania  Change in employment Q2 2009-Q3 2009: 0.5 .

Madison, Wisconsin Change in employment Q2 2009-Q3 2009: 0.1 . Syracuse, New York Change in employment Q2 2009-Q3 2009: 0.1 . The MetroMonitor also compared the largest 100 metros' peak employment quarter to the most recent quarter (Q3 2009), measuring the extent to which employment has recovered from the recession's full impact. In that respect, only one metro area has seen employment growth from its peak until Q3: McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas, whose employment has risen 1.4 percent. When you consider that the percent change in employment for the 100 largest metro areas was down -4.3 percent since the peak and down -4.6 percent for the entire U.S., there seems to be a lot more healing to go ... but at least we seem to be on the right track. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010.

"(CNN) -- This is a story about a girl and her tree -- a tree that helped keep hope alive, even as the world closed in on her. Three times in Anne Frank's widely read diary, the young Holocaust victim wrote about a tree. She could see it from the attic window of the secret annex where her family hid for two years, before being betrayed. ""From my favorite spot on the floor I look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, appearing like silver, and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind,"" she wrote on February 23, 1944. ""As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be."" The tree that reminded Frank of the promise of life still looms high above the courtyard behind the Anne Frank House, now a museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands, that just marked its 50th anniversary. But at about 170 years of age, Anne Frank's tree is dying. The spring before her family and the others hiding with them were captured, the girl focused on the tree's budding life -- and her own. ""Our chestnut tree is already quite greenish and you can even see little blooms here and there,"" she wrote on April 18, 1944. Two days earlier, she'd recorded her first kiss. Frank died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen just weeks before the Nazi concentration camp was liberated in 1945. But her name, story and message live on through her diary and, also, through her ailing tree. The tree that keeps giving . The tree has been sick for 10 years; a fungus has left two-thirds of it hollow, said Anne Frank House spokeswoman Annemarie Bekker. A battle began in late 2007 between city officials who wanted to chop it down and activists who insisted it stay. But a court injunction, a second-opinion analysis and a committee mobilization later, it still stands, barely alive and supported by steel. About five years ago, the museum began collecting chestnuts from the tree to grow seedlings, so that pieces of the original tree could take root and flourish elsewhere. The tree is a horse chestnut, which is often called a buckeye tree in the United States and a conker tree in the United Kingdom. Its saplings have been distributed to international parks and schools named for Anne Frank. One will be planted later this year at Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. Through a project and contest launched last year by the Anne Frank Center USA, a New York-based educational nonprofit working with the museum in Amsterdam, 11 sites in the United States will see Frank's tree blossom. They range from the White House and various museums and memorials to a high school that changed U.S. history. A handful of winning applications were driven by youth inspired by Frank, who would be 80 if she'd survived, and her diary. One girl in Boston, Massachusetts,12-year-old Aliyah Finkel, felt an immediate connection to the writer, so much so that she chose to have her bat mitzvah -- the coming of age ceremony for Jewish girls -- in the synagogue Frank's family attended in Amsterdam before they went into hiding. ""It wasn't just a diary written by some person, it was written by a 13-year-old girl,"" Finkel said. ""I was interested in the story of her life. She had so much hope. There are some parts [of the diary] that are really sad, but it's more inspiring."" With the help of her family, and contacts they have with local officials, Finkel's inspired push will bring a tree to Boston Common and lessons about tolerance to the city's public schools. Down South, a public school in Arkansas, the only in the nation to become a national historic site, will also see an Anne Frank tree bloom. Little Rock Central High School senior John Allen Riggins, 17, heard about the contest last summer while listening to National Public Radio. His school was racially integrated in 1957 by the ""Little Rock Nine,"" a development that proved a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights movement. An avid follower of history and politics, Riggins saw parallels between Anne Frank's legacy and that of the Arkansas students. ""From all across the world, in different time periods and different social struggles, young people have been caught up in history and these social tensions have come down upon them,"" Riggins said. ""Anne Frank was 14 when she was hiding, and the youngest of the nine was 14."" For Elaine Leeder, it was in many ways her father's youth, and by extension her own, that made her reach out for a part of the tree. The dean of social sciences at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California, Leeder is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. Her father lost his mother, sister and brother when they were taken to a pit outside their Lithuanian village and gunned down with about 2,000 other Jews. ""The shades were always drawn in my house. We were afraid of neighbors,"" she said, describing the legacy she carried. ""I became a genocide scholar over the years because of my personal story."" The sapling she competed for will be nurtured in the university's Holocaust & Genocide Memorial Grove, where genocides across time are remembered. Beside it will be a sign quoting Frank: ""How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world."" Much of what his daughter wrote came as a surprise to Otto Frank, the family's sole survivor. He retrieved the diary and eventually published it after World War II. More than 30 million copies have been sold. In a speech he gave in 1968, according to the Anne Frank House, he spoke of the reactions he had upon first reading his daughter's words. ""How could I have suspected that it meant so much to Anne to see a patch of blue sky, to observe the gulls during their flight and how important the chestnut tree was to her, as I recall that she never took an interest in nature,"" he said. ""But she longed for it during that time when she felt like a caged bird."" It turns out the saplings selected for sites in the United States are caged themselves. When they arrived in the country in December, the young trees were seized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Because of sicknesses ravaging horse chestnuts in Europe, the trees will remain in quarantine for three years. The tree Frank secretly admired through an attic window will be gone in five to 15 years, Anne Frank House officials say. But by the time it disappears, pieces of it will be growing strong, reaching for blue skies and welcoming birds across the globe -- a living legacy to a girl who understood what life could promise.","While in hiding, Holocaust victim Anne Frank wrote in her diary about a tree .

"(CNN) -- Gary Coleman's parents grieve ""more and more"" every day since their son died four weeks ago, but they said they hold no anger toward the actor's ex-wife over how she handled his death. Shannon Price, 24, ordered doctors to end Coleman's life support just a day after he fell into a coma, despite his living will's direction that he be kept alive at least 15 days. Sue and Willie Coleman appeared on HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show"" on Tuesday to talk about their son's life and the controversy surrounding his sudden death. ""We're not holding any animosity towards her because, like my wife said, she was young and inexperienced,"" Willie Coleman told Behar. Price, whom they never met, did not call Coleman's parents after he suffered a brain hemorrhage from a fall in his home May 26 or before he was removed from life support two days later, the Colemans said. His parents said they felt like they were robbed of a chance to say a last goodbye to their son. ""I hurt more and more every day,"" Willie Coleman said. ""More and more."" The Colemans spoke sadly about their estrangement from their son, who they adopted when he was four days old. The estrangement began when he became a legal adult. ""When Gary turned 18 years old, you know how you do a horse?"" Willie said. ""We were put out to pasture."" Willie Coleman said his son told him then that ""I just feel that you were holding me in prison."" ""He wanted to be his own man, do things his own way, so we tried to encourage him the best we could, we tried to guide him as much as we could, but it was his life,"" Sue Coleman said. The Colemans, who had helped guide the child actor's career to that point, left California and returned to the middle-class lives they had left behind in Chicago a decade earlier. ""Gary took on a whole new branch of individuals that wanted to manage his career and also manage his money,"" his father said. Although Gary Coleman sued his parents for mismanaging his money, resulting in a $1 million judgment for him in 1993, there was always love between them, they said. Willie Coleman said he has a handful of letters from his son that offer him comfort. ""Every once and a while, I pull those letters out and read,"" he said. ""In each of those letters is ended with 'Hey, guys. I love you guys and I know you love me too.'"" His father wants Coleman to be remembered by fans as ""the sweet little gentle boy that we raised."" The parents are staying out of the bitter legal fight that is brewing over Coleman's estate. A Provo, Utah, lawyer was named temporary special administrator to control the estate while a Utah judge decides a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray.","No one called parents before ending actor's life support, they say .

"(CNN) -- The whistle-blower website WikiLeaks on Wednesday posted what it said was an internal CIA report into the perception that the United States exports terrorism, but one U.S. official said it does not divulge spectacular developments. The three-page document, dated February 2, 2010, asks, ""What If Foreigners See the United States as an 'Exporter of Terrorism?' "" ""These sorts of analytic products -- clearly identified as coming from the agency's 'Red Cell' -- are designed to simply provoke thought and present different points of view,"" said CIA spokesman George Little. A U.S. intelligence official said, ""it's always disturbing when classified information is inappropriately disclosed.""  However the official added, ""this is not a blockbuster paper."" The document, promised by the group in a Twitter message on Tuesday, is labeled ""secret,"" the lowest level of classification. The website set off a firestorm recently when it posted some 76,000 U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan. The group has said it has another 15,000 documents, which it plans to release soon. The U.S. Defense Department has demanded WikiLeaks return all documents belonging to the Pentagon and delete any records of them. Officials in Afghanistan have also criticized the leak. The founder and editor of the website, Julian Assange, was arrested in absentia last week in Sweden on charges of rape, but the warrant was revoked less than a day later by Chief Prosecutor Eva Finne. Assange told the Arabic-language television network Al-Jazeera on Sunday the accusations are ""clearly a smear campaign."" ""The only question is, who was involved?"" he asked, declining to say who he thinks is behind the effort. Separately on Tuesday, the attorney for the alleged victims told CNN rumors that the Pentagon or CIA was somehow involved in the sex crime accusations against Assange are ""complete nonsense."" U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also has criticized the organization's last leak of documents saying it would have a significant negative impact on troops and allies, revealing techniques and procedures. Assange has defended the leak by saying it can help shape the public's understanding of the war. He said the material was of no operational significance and that WikiLeaks tried to ensure the material did not put innocent people at risk. Assange reportedly has spent his life developing the tech skills needed to set up WikiLeaks. When he was a teenager in Melbourne, Australia, he belonged to a hacker collective called the International Subversives, according to the magazine Mother Jones. He eventually pleaded guilty to multiple counts of breaking into Australian government and commercial websites to test their security gaps, but was released on bond for ""good behavior,"" the magazine said. As WikiLeaks has grown and published increasingly high-profile items, Assange has found himself the target of what he says are many legal attacks. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Official says it's not a ""blockbuster paper""

"(CNN) -- Omar Hammami is living proof that there is no one road to terrorism. U.S. officials believe the journey for Hammami -- one of 14 U.S.-born and naturalized citizens to be indicted last week on charges of conspiring with a Somali terrorist organization affiliated with al Qaeda -- took him from a small town in Alabama to a radical command role in Somalia. Hammami was a late convert to Islam, becoming passionate about his father's faith during high school in Alabama. He was born in Daphne, a small town nestled in the Bible belt where Islam was not only uncommon, but rebuffed. His hijab and public prayer made Hammami a target for insults in the conservative community. He dropped out of the University of South Alabama in 2002, moving to Toronto, Canada, and then to Cairo, Egypt, as he searched in vain for a setting where Islam was practiced as rigidly as he believed it should be . It is possible that Christof Putzel -- a correspondent for Current TV's documentary series, ""Vanguard"" -- once brushed arms with Hammami. Putzel was finishing a story in Somalia in 2006 as Hammami entered the country to seek out al-Shabaab. Putzel later created a documentary that retraces Hammami's steps from young American to ""American Jihadi."" ""American Jihadi"" culminates in Somalia, where Hammami joined the ranks of al-Shabaab, or ""The Youth."" Hammami is a top commander of al-Shabaab and the organization's most successful recruiter, Putzel says. Since he appeared on the Al-Jazeera TV network and the YouTube website in 2007, more than 30 young Muslims have disappeared from Hammami's old stomping grounds in the U.S and Canada, only to reappear fighting with al-Shabaab. ""Omar Hammami is making jihad look like a camping trip with weapons. You don't see the brutality of war. You see guys who look really cool, and they look like they are taking their religion really seriously,"" Putzel says. Although he alone is effective, Hammami is not the only American jihadi on the Internet. Born in New Mexico and wanted by the FBI, Anwar al-Awlaki has been using social media sites to spread his lectures to larger audiences. According to Putzel, these videos address Western youths in terms they understand, using both English and modern slang. ""What is pretty clear is that groups like al-Shabaab or al Qaeda are in a war for the hearts and minds of young Muslims in the U.S. They are telling them that they're not wanted here ... and that by living here, they're a traitor,"" Putzel says. To Steve Hassan, this narrative is strikingly familiar. He is a cult counselor, mind-control expert and former follower of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his ""Moonies."" It is Hassan's belief that a terrorist organization is little more than a cult with a strong violent streak. ""There are totalitarian mind-control cults that use deception and manipulation to get people in, and then indoctrinate people with new identities -- which are dependent and obedient on their superiors -- that often cause a divorce from their past identities and refutation of family and friends,"" Hassan says. Drawing upon more than 30 years of personal and professional experience, Hassan says indoctrination is dependent upon timing and social influence, not personal weakness or an intrinsic character flaw. ""People from the outside looking in try to find all kinds of theories and justifications ... but speaking from the inside-out in terms of my own personal experience, I would have flown a plane into the World Trade Center if I had been ordered to. But I did not join a group to blow up people. I wanted to make the world a better place, and I wanted to make the world filled with God,"" Hassan says. It is that ideology in radical Islam that Nasser Weddady sees as the greatest draw for young Westerners. Weddady is the civil rights outreach director for the American Islamic Congress -- and a Muslim. ""This is not just some poor victim who, because he was unable to make it in life, became a terrorist. One of the allures of radical Islamist ideology is it gives a person a purpose for their life, an evil purpose I would say, but nonetheless, they are fighting for something,"" Weddady says. As a child growing up in Syria, Weddady's first brush with terrorism occurred when he witnessed car bombs set off by Islamist extremists. He observed Islamist operatives recruiting in schools and says it wasn't uncommon to walk past someone considered a terrorist by the U.S. Due to their Middle Eastern appearance, Weddady and a friend were falsely held by the FBI following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Racial profiling has compelled many Muslims to hide their roots and suppress their religion. According to Weddady, a lack of identity and leadership within the Muslim community has prompted some youths to combat the temperance that surrounds them. ""These young Muslims in America are looking for answers, are looking for ways to deal with that aspect of their identity,"" Weddady says. ""Some decide to erase it, some decide to explore it and express it. The problem is the message that is most available to them is not one you want them to hear."" Steve Emerson is the founder of the Investigative Project on Terrorism, a research group that studies Islamic terrorism worldwide. He says governments are mistaken in ""reaching out to certain Islamist groups that still push the narrative that the U.S. is at war with Islam and that refuse to condemn Hamas or Hezbollah."" ""The Islamist narrative is that there is a conspiracy against Islam, waged by the West and led by the United States, and this alleged 'conspiracy' is to suppress Islam,"" Emerson says. ""Radical leaders will all say and repeat a litany of crimes against Muslims by the West, going as far back as the crusades in 1095. Therefore, these Islamist terrorist acts are perceived to be defensive reactions to defend Islam."" Emerson's organization works closely with the FBI to share information and prevent future terrorist attacks. Robert Blitzer is the senior fellow at ICF International -- a global consulting firm -- and former chief of the domestic terrorism and counterterrorism planning section in the FBI. His work included investigating terrorists within the United States. ""We conducted investigations into terrorist activities based on what we were authorized to do,"" Blitzer says. ""We would ... determine what sort of group they might be affiliated, who they were in contact with in the United States or abroad and essentially what kind of activities they might be engaged in. That could be as simple as collecting money and sending it back to folks, or as complex as engaging in planning and conducting terrorist attacks."" Blitzer says that since 9/11, intelligence and law enforcement communities have been successful in averting terrorist attacks of that magnitude, but that isn't to say it will never happen again. ""The intelligence has to be right every time, but the terrorists only have to be right once to carry out a significant attack,"" Blitzer says. To carry out attacks, Emerson says, Islamist groups deliberately try to alienate Muslim populations from any loyalty to the host country, and thereby to have leverage over that country. ""If you look at the European continent, there's been a lot of immigration by Indians and Latin Americans,"" Emerson says. ""They are not the ones who are carrying out terrorist attacks. There is something else going on in the Muslim communities."" Ghaffar Hussein, head of the outreach and training unit for the Quilliam Foundation -- which calls itself the world's first counterterrorism think tank -- says there are ways to prevent this alienation of Western Muslim youth. ""Western societies need to strengthen civic identity and make all members of society feel like they belong,"" Hussein says. ""They need to treat Muslims as citizens and not as homogeneous blocs or groups with monolithic interests."" As a cult expert, Hassan suggests offering radicalized youth the same treatment he offers his clients. He says the universal way to free someone from a cult's clutch is to dissipate their phobias that by leaving, they are betraying God or Allah. ""A lot of people get into these groups following a dream or following an ideal. If people can see that the dream is not going to be a part of this group movement, that would help somebody reevaluate,"" Hassan says. Weddady, meanwhile, says that while the support of the West is necessary, ""to a larger extent, this is a Muslim problem that only Muslims can solve."" He says his moral compass ultimately led him down a path very different from some young Muslims in the world today. ""I am an outspoken critic of some of the most extreme and intolerant elements within Islamic society, but at the same time, I am proud of my Islamic heritage and Muslim culture."" Weddady says. ""Those things are not in contradiction in my mind. The supreme irony of this story is that I can't be any more Muslim that I can be in America. If we Muslims were not living in a free society, we could not take a stand against extremism and reclaim our heritage.""","Omar Hammami is one of 14 U.S. citizens indicted last week on terrorism conspiracy charges .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- By now, the entire country has gotten the message that Arizonans are angry and frustrated over illegal immigration. But, oddly enough, the anger and frustration isn't usually aimed at the illegal immigrants themselves. Many Arizonans would probably admit that, if they were unable to feed their families in their home country, they too might venture out in search of employment. And, if they were faced with waits of 10 to 15 years to enter another country legally, you can bet many of them would enter illegally. What really gets Arizonans fired up are three things: the feeling that they're under siege by spillover violence from Mexican drug cartels, the concern that the U.S. government isn't doing enough to protect them, and indignation that people in other states are judging them for responding to a reality most of us can't imagine. That's what you hear on talk radio and what you read in the letters section of local newspapers. And that's also pretty much the view of Jay Heiler, a top-notch political and public affairs consultant and a familiar fixture in Arizona Republican circles. Heiler served as chief of staff to former Gov. Fife Symington in the 1990s and counsels Gov. Jan Brewer today. He's a vocal defender of the state's new immigration law, Senate Bill 1070. What I wanted to know is whether that's because he really believes in the measure or whether he's just being a good soldier for the state GOP, given that just about every prominent Republican official in the state backs the law. As we met for what became a three-hour dinner in a Phoenix restaurant, I soon had my answer. Heiler began the conversation with a piece of advice. ""If you're going to write about this issue with credibility,"" he said, ""you have to acknowledge the reality of the violence caused by the Mexican drug cartels and the inability of the Mexican government to contain it."" Not this again. The new bogeyman of the immigration debate is the Mexican drug cartels. In fact, when you engage a supporter of SB 1070, it's hard to get them to talk about anything else. The cartels are their strong card; why not play it? One of the arguments floating about -- advanced by Brewer -- is that most illegal immigrants act as drug mules for the cartels. Too bad Brewer can't seem to find anyone to back that up. Arizona Sen. John McCain said he doesn't believe that most illegal immigrants are used as drug mules. Neither does T.J. Bonner, head of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union representing nearly 20,000 border patrol agents. Bonner said Brewer's claims are ""clearly not the case"" and ""don't comport with reality."" Heiler is too smart to repeat wild claims. Instead, he stayed focused on public perception. He submits that most of the support for the measure --- polls show that about 55 percent of Arizonans back the law, down from 70 percent when Brewer signed it in April -- is coming from people who are sincerely afraid that Mexico is spinning out of control because of the drug war and that the chaos is spilling into Arizona in the form of kidnappings and other lawlessness. According to law enforcement authorities, in 2008, nearly 400 kidnappings happened in Phoenix. But a prosecutor told me that most people don't understand that many of these ""kidnappings"" aren't for ransom. Rather, they're an extension of the human smuggling industry, in which rival coyotes raid each other's ""drop houses"" and steal the cargo. That's a serious crime, and yet it's probably not what most people think about when they hear the word ""kidnapping."" Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris, a vocal opponent of the immigration law, insists that he has the manpower to investigate each kidnapping. But, he warns, that could change if the portions of SB 1070 struck down by a federal judge come back to life like the mythical bird that shares the city's name. If his officers have to make immigration enforcement their top priority, Harris said, other crimes will probably go unsolved. Then, the crime rate could soar. Right now, the crime rate in Phoenix is down. The Phoenix Police Department confirms it. ""Despite all the hype,"" spokesman Trent Crump told the Wall Street Journal, ""in every single reportable crime category, we're significantly down."" In the first quarter of 2010, violent crime was down 17 percent in the city, while homicides were down 38 percent and robberies 27 percent, compared with the same time period in 2009. The  Federal Bureau of Investigation also confirms it. The number of violent crimes has fallen every year in Phoenix since 2006, the FBI reports. It's part of an overall trend in which, according to the bureau, crime rates are actually going down in cities that have large immigrant populations . It's pretty obvious that cynical politicians -- all of whom happen to be Republicans -- are exaggerating the fear factor to cover up what they recognize as some of the more unseemly motives of SB 1070 supporters. Although Heiler doesn't deny that some of the folks who have rallied around the law are motivated by anxiety over changing demographics, he wouldn't admit that this has anything to do with race and ethnicity. But isn't that obvious? For the past two decades, there has been a loud chorus of worry about how Latino immigrants are changing Phoenix -- and, according to some, not for the better. Those feelings didn't just go away. And the people who hold them are almost certainly part of the pro-1070 brigade. Not everyone who wants to get rid of illegal immigrants does so because he or she sees a connection to the drug cartels. In fact, most people just want to preserve the America they grew up with. Besides, if they really want to put drug dealers out of business, the best way is to support Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who has declared war on these criminal syndicates and yet vehemently opposes the Arizona law. Instead, Republican candidates for office are running TV ads in Arizona criticizing Calderon for criticizing the law. That makes absolutely no sense, just as it makes no sense for Arizona to crack down on illegal immigrants in the hopes that it will somehow get rid of drug dealers. Unless, of course, the real objective all along has been something much sneakier: to use the fear of drug dealers to get rid of illegal immigrants. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Arizonans upset about drug violence, government's inaction .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The phrase ""normal is an allusion"" is written upside down on the front door. Colorful Harajuku Tutu skirts, a Japanese fashion staple, and salvaged denim fills the funky space inside the store called Fearless Weirdos. Mickey and Minnie Mouse cardigans hang from recycled hangers and umbrellas in the shapes of butterflies, kittens and pups. A loose-fitting minidress, designed like an apron that ties around the waist, is a Fearless Weirdos original. Owner Alva Glass says she chooses pieces that have great function and are diverse and interchangeable. She then complements them with edgy pieces. She describes her customers, who are usually in the 18-to- 35 age range, as ""youthful creatives"" who are looking for something different. ""I think that's what drives people to come to the store. They see the outside -- the Japanese writing on the doors, the big, white eyeglass frames that represent having a clear vision of who you are, and the quotes that represent individuality like 'Why not?' and 'Because I am,' "" Glass says. ""They want to know what's inside, and when they do come in, they come back because they know we carry only a limited selection of original pieces."" The shop carries mostly new pieces that Alva gets from wholesale retailers in Japan and showrooms throughout the U.S. The store also has a small section of vintage blazers and accessories, along with a mixture of fabrics with solids and vibrant prints, organic pieces and simple tanks. Japanese street fashion has slowly gained popularity in the U.S. with the slimmer fit of clothing, fabrics with artistic sketches and the layering of pieces. Danika Goings walked into Fearless Weirdos with a smile as she headed towards the women's collection. When asked what her favorite piece in the store was, she pointed to a two-toned, slim-fitting, cotton frock. ""I think I've fallen in love with this dress!"" she said. The outfit in the window is what caught her eye. ""It's very original. You don't see that everywhere,"" she said. The friendly people are what brought her back. Friendly is an understatement. Jessica Dascomb is tiny with short, black, stringy hair, and big, square, leopard-print eyeglasses. She sports a fedora hat, faded T-shirt and black skinny jeans. She displays an energy that's bigger than her, despite the heat makes the small shop feel like a sauna. She exudes excitement about every piece in the store. ""There was a guy that came in today that bought a pink, short-sleeve button up, and I love that shirt so much! I was sad to see it leave, but happy that he liked it and appreciated it. I really get attached to some things,"" Dascomb said. She's a full-time employee and keeps shop while Glass is away. A mini-refrigerator stocks Japanese sodas and Japanese papers and magazines coat the countertops. ""We do have Japanese customers, and when they come, they really appreciate the store and they always buy,"" Glass says. One Japanese woman who purchased a bag was so delighted she asked to take a photograph with Glass. Other customers to come through include Atlanta's own breakthrough artist B.o.B, who purchased a Varsity's letterman jacket, and Stic.man of hip-hop duo Dead Prez. Glass first traveled to Japan as a stylist with a group of musicians. She visited Tokyo and Osaka -- cities where Japanese street fashion has a strong presence. Glass says she was captivated by the city's energy and vibe. ""The people, the fashion, the street life, buildings and subways. The creative details they put into everything and the way they all flow together was so innovative,"" Glass says. For a girl, a typical Japanese outfit would consist of a fedora hat, layers, a handkerchief tank with a cardigan over it, plenty of accessories, distressed shorts and tights, flats or kitten heels, along with a big, colorful bag that is accessorized as much as she is, Glass says. It is a style that pairs pieces together that are not made to match. Glass' mom gave her freedom as a child to wear what she liked and express herself creatively. ""My thing was nonmatching. I would take something off another garment to add detail, and if it came one way, I would make it into something else. I'd add on bows, beads or any little applique,"" she says. Glass started working in retail at 15. She studied for a degree in Fashion Design and Marketing at American University Intercontinental, spending the first half of her time in Atlanta, and the second half in London. She worked as a production assistant at Citron Clothing, a Los Angeles-based fashion retailer with locations across the United States and abroad, including South Africa. Glass also worked in design and merchandising at BCBG Max Azria.","Japanese street fashion can be found in a boutique in Atlanta, Georgia .

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Marine Cesar Laurean was convicted in North Carolina on Monday of first degree murder in the 2007 death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, who was eight months pregnant when she died. An autopsy showed that Lauterbach, 20, died of blunt force trauma to the head. Police unearthed her charred body from beneath a barbecue pit in Laurean's backyard in January 2008. She had disappeared the month before. Laurean, who was dressed in black slacks and wore a white shirt and black tie, did not show any emotion as the judge read his sentence of life in prison without parole. He either said or mouthed something to someone in the audience of the courtroom before he was led out in handcuffs, video showed. Laurean and Lauterbach were stationed together at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. ""I truly believe that Maria was the perfect victim. Because of her credibility problems, our pleas for help [after her disappearance] were rejected or discounted by everyone,"" Mary Lauterbach, the victim's mother, said after the verdict was read, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. North Carolina prosecutors alleged Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico. Laurean was arrested there in April 2008. He holds dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico. Before her death, Lauterbach told the Marines that Laurean had raped her. Laurean denied it, and disappeared just a few weeks before a scheduled rape hearing at Camp LeJeune. WRAL reported Lauterbach later recanted the allegation of rape. The DNA of Lauterbach's unborn child did not match that of Laurean, according to law enforcement personnel. Onslow County Chief Assistant District Attorney Ernie Lee said in his closing argument that Laurean needed to kill Lauterbach to salvage his military career, WRAL reported. ""I can get rid of my problem,"" Lee said to explain what Laurean might have been thinking, reported WRAL. Authorities found Lauterbach's body after Laurean's wife, Christina, produced a note her husband had written claiming the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument, according to officials. Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach's neck, autopsy results indicated that the wound itself would not have been fatal and may have occurred after death. ""It is a just result, but still a tragedy with no winners,"" Merle Wilberding, a lawyer who represented the Lauterbach family, wrote in an e-mail to CNN after the verdict. Laurean's lawyer said his client would appeal the decision. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: Victim's mother says her daughter was the ""perfect victim""

"(CNN) -- ""It's like building a Japanese garden at Pearl Harbor or a big swastika in Auschwitz."" ""Eyeris"" is livid. He's voiced his opinion, no holds barred, on several YouTube videos concerning the proposed construction of an Islamic cultural center a few blocks from ground zero in New York. His comments are blatantly anti-Islamic in nature and express a deep resentment toward the Muslim faith. In a comment posted on an online video advertisement in opposition to the Islamic center, Eyeris -- an online pseudonym -- calls for the bombing of all mosques in the Western world. In a comment on a different video, he calls for the annihilation of all Muslims. But he'd only say this online. The 39-year-old relies on his cloak of anonymity to shield him from what he believes is the certain scorn he'd face if he uttered these words in public. In fact, Eyeris is a pseudonym for his YouTube alias. He wears two layers of armor. ""I don't think I would say this in open due to restrictions. I have a business and cannot afford to speak freely in our days of freedom of speech. Haha, what a big joke actually, if you think about it,"" says Eyeris, in an e-mail from Belgium, where he currently resides. ""Political correctness is killing everything freedom stands for."" As sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter become increasingly popular, they are rapidly becoming havens for people who want to speak openly about race, politics and religion without damage to reputation. Anyone can fake a name and voice an opinion -- no matter how controversial -- without any threat to their reputation. That ability is one of the driving forces behind the prevalence of hate speech on the web, says Yaman Akdeniz, director of Istanbul, Turkey-based Cyber-Rights.org, a website that advocates online civil liberties. The controversy surrounding plans to build an Islamic center just a few blocks from the World Trade Center site has spawned aggressive and candid outpourings of online sentiment. Those outpourings are collectively making a case-in-point study of how the internet has spawned a wide-open, frequently anonymous forum for declarations that can easily be considered offensive or hateful by some. ""This is what has occurred in the case of the Islamic center -- a shift in society's acceptability of openly expressing ethnic prejudice,"" says Dr. Osman Ali, a psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City. One Facebook group in opposition to the Islamic center has about 90,000 members. Even though the 13-story center is planned to include a pool, auditorium and prayer area, the group, like many of its counterparts, refers to the building simply as a mosque. The Facebook group, called ""No to the Mosque at Ground Zero"", has become one of the largest opposition groups on the site. Charlotte Thompson (the only social mediate who let CNN use her name) joined because she is against the proposed cultural center. She points out that the group has ""shifted its focus from 'stop the Mosque being built' to 'all Muslims are evil terrorists.' "" Andrew Noyes, Facebook's manager of public policy communications says the site does not knowingly allow anonymity and tries to respond to hate speech as quickly as possible. ""Facebook has always been based on a real-name culture. This leads to greater accountability and a safer and more trusted environment for our users. It's a violation of our policies to use a fake name or operate under a false identity,"" he says. But where there are rules, there are rule benders and breakers, and some accounts that use pseudonyms. ""Regarding the broader issue of controversial content that may appear on the site, I wonder how the phone company would answer a question about preventing threatening phone calls? And webmail providers about threatening e-mails?"" adds Noyes. ""Just as none of those communications platforms can guarantee their tools won't be misused, neither can we."" In an e-mail response, a YouTube spokesperson also references the site's size when explaining the prevalence of hateful comments on uploaded videos. ""With 24 hours of video uploaded every minute to YouTube, it is not possible to prescreen content and operate at the scale we do. It would be like the telephone company prescreening every call before allowing it to be connected."" Even though some choose to use their real identities, there are still a great number of anonymous comments on YouTube and Twitter, even on Facebook where some create alternate profiles from which they comment in controversial groups. These sites have become forums that cater to specific parts of the population -- those with strong opinions who want to maintain reputation. However, the thinking behind some of these anonymous comments could be more complex. Dr. Adam Brenner, director of adult psychiatry residency training at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, believes the idea of ""reciprocal altruism"" may contribute to the prevalence of negative comments in this situation. ""We really are evolved for treating people well, but with the idea that we'll get something in return. Everyone has had some experience of being hurt and that hurt leads to hostility. That triggers the response of wanting to protect one's self, and making the other hurt in return is one way,"" says Brenner. For groups that monitor social media websites for hate speech, one of the main concerns is how accessible prejudiced comments are to kids. According to 2010 data gathered by Quantcast, a popular web analytics company, about 22 per cent of American YouTube and Facebook users are ages 3 to 17. On YouTube, inappropriate and discriminatory comments are common. There are videos in which users ask others to stop spreading the hateful speech, and even Urban Dictionary, the popular, editable, pseudo-dictionary frequented by high school and college students, has a definition for the term ""YouTube Racist."" On Facebook, many groups against the Islamic center are public, which means anyone can access them, even without a Facebook account. Ali says negative and unfounded comments posted about Islam and its followers can confuse children who are growing up in Muslim households. ""When [kids] see videos with blatant misinformation on the internet, they may not have the cognitive ability to determine the representative nature of those statements [and] they are not trained to challenge it,"" says Ali. Bill Nigut, the Anti-Defamation League's Southeast regional director, says the same goes for any religion. ""These messages are directed at young people whose religious values have not yet taken root. It can cause them a lot of anxiety and ... it worries us,"" he says. Nigut says the ADL routinely sends messages to Facebook regarding anti-Semitic remarks. He references one instance where he received a complaint that a 12-year-old girl was called a ""dirty Jew"" on her Facebook page. Meanwhile Eyeris -- the YouTube user whose diatribes against the proposed Islamic center near ground zero now live online -- has a 13-year-old child. And despite the no-holds-barred comments that he's made, he says he has just one wish. ""Peace to you and the whole world, man! Because in the end, that's all I want.""","Online anonymity allows internet users to express opinions without reservation .
Experts say it's also leading to more hateful sentiments expressed online .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A frenzy of diplomatic activity was underway around the tense Korean peninsula Thursday, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il reportedly traveling through China, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visiting Pyongyang, and the Chinese envoy to six-party denuclearization talks landing in Seoul. ""We detected Kim Jong-il's train heading towards China, over the border, at midnight Wednesday,"" a source at South Korea's presidential office said. ""We assume that Kim is aboard the train, and are trying to find out his destination and the purpose of his visit."" As is common with the secretive state, the visit was unannounced and no agenda has been released. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions regarding Kim Jong-il's visit. The North Korean Embassy in Beijing said it had no information regarding the visit. The alleged movement is taking place amid speculation that the ailing Kim, 68, who is believed to have suffered a stroke two years ago, is preparing to officially announce his son, Kim Jong-eun, as his successor. Meanwhile, Carter arrived in Pyongyang Wednesday on a humanitarian mission to negotiate the release of U.S. citizen Aijilon Gomes, believed to be a Christian activist, who is currently imprisoned in the country after entering it illegally in January. Carter was greeted by Kim Gye-gwan, North Korea's chief negotiator at the six-party nuclear talks, and has also met the country's titular head of state, Kim Jong-nam, according to Seoul's Yonhap News agency, quoting North Korean media. There have been hopes of some breakthrough in tense Pyongyang-Washington relations with Carter's visit. Carter's 1994 talks with the late Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il's father, paved the way for the ""Agreed Framework"" the same year, an agreement designed to reign in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Also on Thursday in Seoul, Wu Dawei, vice foreign minister and special representative on Korean Peninsular affairs of China, was in Seoul for talks with Wi Sung-lac. The two men are their country's respective envoys in the currently stalled six-party talks that aim to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. These events come amid intense speculation surrounding North Korea's leadership, given that the state will be holding only its third-ever Workers Party Congress in September. ""The last Congress was in 1966, an enormously important year in North Korean ideology, as that was when their cultural revolution started, when the personality cult went up a huge notch,"" said Brian Myers, a North Korea propaganda expert and author of The Cleanest Race. ""If that is anything to go by, this congress has to be something big."" Experts do not, however, expect Kim to place his son before the Beijing leadership, and suggested that a China trip is more likely to be economically motivated. North Korea is facing sanctions pressure following a string of nuclear tests, missile launches and, most recently, the sinking of a South Korean warship in March -- which Seoul accuses Pyongyang of carrying out -- meaning Kim could be going cap-in-hand. ""Kim Jong-il, I think, would be looking primarily for expressions of economic support and political support,"" added Mike Chinoy, author of Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis. ""He needs Chinese help to keep his economy afloat and the Chinese remain North Korea's best friend"" But if Kim is, indeed, in China, hopes of an easing in Washington-Pyongyang tensions are lowered. ""Carter is in to get Gomes out, not to try and restart something,"" said Kim Byung-ki, a security expert at Seoul's Korea University. ""If Kim Jong-iI is not there, Carter will not be able to meet the top leader, ask questions, interact and get the atmospherics; he can meet Kim Gye-gwan and Kim Jong-nam, but they are not the center of power."" With Carter being greeted by Kim Gye-gwan in Pyongyang, and with Wu visiting Seoul, there may be a desire by Pyongyang and/or Beijing to restart stalled denuclearization talks. ""As we understand, Ambassador Wu visited North Korea recently, so I think he will explain what he heard in North Korea and deliver the Chinese view on the resumption of the six-party talks,"" said a Seoul Foreign Ministry official. While the 1994 ""Agreed Framework"" fell apart soon after the George W. Bush administration accused Pyongyang of a secret atomic arms program in 2002, Beijing has invested considerable credibility in sponsoring the six-party talks, designed to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. But the talks, which started in 2003, have made little progress: North Korea has undertaken two nuclear tests and talks themselves have been in abeyance since 2007. China has railed against U.S. and South Korean naval exercises held in the eastern Pacific following the sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan in March, perhaps explaining why Beijing wishes for a resumption of dialogue at this time. ""I think Beijing would like to contain any further escalation of military exercises generated as a result of the Cheonan incident,"" said Korea University's Kim. ""It is not in their interest to have a further tightening of the U.S.-Korea-Japan alliance."" South Korea, however, may be less willing to resume talks, given the talks' history, and given current public anger over the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. ""People I speak to in South Korea say they are not in the mood to return to the table unless there is some kind of apology for the sinking of the Cheonan and some clear signs of a serious implementation of denuclearization commitments,"" said Dan Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group's Seoul office. ""If you are Beijing, how can you demonstrate that North Korea is going to return to the table to bargain in good faith?""

"(CNN) -- Senate Democrats claimed a major victory this weekend after voting to end debate on their version of the health care bill. The Senate is on track to hold a final vote on Christmas eve, but there's still a long way to go before a bill is on President Obama's desk. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about what's in the House and Senate health care bills and what's next. Where does the health care debate stand? The House passed its version of health care reform last month. The Senate, which follows different procedures than the House, is slated to vote on its version of the health care bill before Christmas. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid needs a simple majority of 51 votes for final passage. Assuming the bill makes it through the Senate, a conference committee will then need to iron out the differences between the House and Senate versions and merge them into one bill. Both chambers will then need to pass the revised bill before it is sent to the president's desk. Read Dr. Sanjay Gupta's take on the health care bill . Why does Obama want health care reform? The president made health care reform his top domestic priority. He says overhauling the health care system is key to getting the economy back on track. The president says he wants to reform health care in order to slow the growth of costs for families, businesses and the government. He also wants to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health care, regardless of their income or medical history. Who will be covered and how much will it cost? The House plan is projected to guarantee coverage for 96 percent of Americans at a cost of more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Senate plan is projected to cover 94 percent of Americans with an $871 billion price over the next 10 years, according to the CBO. How will this be paid for? The House plan imposes a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals with annual incomes over $500,000, as well as families earning more than $1 million. The Senate plan increases the Medicare payroll tax on individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000 from the current 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent. The Senate bill also imposes a new tax on insurers that provide so-called ""Cadillac"" health plans valued at more than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. The 40 percent tax would be on the value of the plan. In addition, it imposes a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning salon treatments. Both bills call for cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans say that those cuts will impair Medicare coverage, but Democrats say the savings will come from eliminating waste and fraud. The House and Senate bills also call for fees on medical device manufacturers. Do I have to buy health insurance? The House and Senate bills both require individuals to buy health insurance. The House bill imposes a fine of up to 2.5 percent of a person's income for noncompliance. The Senate plan imposes a noncompliance fine that starts at $95 in 2010 and escalates to $750 in 2016. It also requires parents to provide health coverage for children up to age 18. What if I can't afford coverage? The House and Senate plans both include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. Both bills subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $88,000 annually, or 400 percent of the federal poverty level. With subsidies, premiums for a family of four at 133 percent of poverty ($29,326.50) would be a maximum of $440 under the House plan, while premiums for a family of four making the highest amount eligible would be a maximum of $10,584. Under the Senate plan, with subsidies, premiums for a family of four at 133 percent of poverty would be a maximum of $821.14, while premiums for a family making the highest amount eligible would be a maximum of $8,643.60. I own a business. Do I have to provide coverage for my employees? The House plan requires companies with a payroll of more than $500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll. Under the Senate plan, starting in 2013, companies with more than 50 employees would be required to pay a fee per worker if its employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage. What if I have a pre-existing condition? Both the House plan and the Senate bill would eventually limit total out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Both plans also bar insurers from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history. Insurers can only vary rates based on three things: age, geography and family make-up/size. What is a health insurance exchange? ""Health insurance exchange"" refers to the marketplace of the health insurance options. Obama has defined the exchange as a ""one-stop shopping marketplace where you can compare the benefits, cost and track records of a variety of plans -- including a public option to increase competition and keep insurance companies honest -- and choose what's best for your family."" The House bill creates a national health insurance exchange designed to make it easier for small businesses, self-employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage. The Senate bill creates state health insurance exchanges in all 50 states. What is a health care co-op? Nonprofit health cooperatives, or ""co-ops,"" are being proposed as an option to compete with the private sector and as an alternative to a government-sponsored public health insurance option. Co-ops are owned and governed by the same people they insure. The House and Senate plans both establish ""co-ops"" and strip insurance companies of an antitrust exemption that has been in place since the end of World War II. What happened to the public option? The House bill creates a public option, which is a government-funded, government-run health care option, similar to Medicare. The public option would be a part of an insurance exchange available to people without coverage or unable to afford private coverage. The Senate bill does not create a public option. Instead, it allows nonprofit private insurers to offer coverage with approval of Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the federal employees' health plan. What will happen to Medicaid? The House and Senate bills would both significantly expand Medicaid, the government-run health care plan for the poor. The House plan extends coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $33,000 for a family of four. The Senate plan extends coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level, or just over $29,000 for a family of four. Will abortion treatments be funded with federal dollars? The House bill prohibits any health plan receiving federal subsidies from offering coverage for abortion. The Senate plan allows states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in health plans offered in the insurance exchanges. Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds. Will illegal immigrants be covered? The House bill mandates insurance coverage for illegal immigrants and allows illegal immigrants to enroll in the public option and to buy private coverage in the national insurance exchange, but prohibits government subsidies for such private coverage. The Senate plan exempts illegal immigrants from the health coverage mandate, and prohibits illegal immigrants from participating in the insurance exchanges. CNN's Tom Cohen, Kristi Keck and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Senate and House bills will need to be merged .

"(CNN) -- The Cumberland River in Nashville, Tennessee, is predicted to be at flood stage overnight Friday, and flood levels should begin to fall after daylight, according to the National Weather Service. Flood warnings have been issued along the river . Flash flood warnings were in effect Thursday for parts of middle Tennessee after heavy rain battered the state overnight. The rain has subsided in and around Nashville, but more is in the forecast for the end of the week, the National Weather Service said. Heavy rain in parts of the state this week caused rivers and creeks to crest, and sent flood waters into the streets.  Dozens of roads were closed and some schools in middle Tennessee were closed or starting late Thursday, the Macon County (Tennessee) Times reported. Some areas, like the town of Red Boiling Springs, were pounded with as much as eight inches of rain in a 12-hour stretch Wednesday. Flood waters rushed into the town causing officials to close the entire downtown, police told CNN-affiliate WKRN. ""There were so many places that were dangerous to attempt to cross,"" said Jacob Jordan, an officer with the Red Boiling Springs Police Department. ""I have no idea where the road was. This was all one big body of water."" The rain comes as some Tennessee residents were still recovering from the devastating floods that hit the area in May.  Dozens of people died in those floods. The federal government declared 42 counties disaster areas and the flooding was blamed for more than $1.5 billion in property damage in the Nashville area.","Heavy rain pounded middle Tennessee overnight .

"(CNN) -- Thirty-three miners trapped 2,300 feet (701 meters) below ground in Chile are depending on food, medicine and supplies being dropped to them through a 4-inch-wide tube. What comes out of that tube will have to sustain the men both physically and mentally for a long time -- perhaps four months, experts say -- while a shaft wide enough to pull a man through is drilled. The miners already have been trapped for 18 days, since a rockslide inside the San Esteban gold and copper mine cut off their exit route. A probe retrieved a note from the miners Sunday saying all were alive and well in a cramped, 530-square-foot (50-square-meter) shelter. They survived by sharing tiny portions of canned fish stored in the shelter room. ""Medics now are beginning to put down glucose water through a tube, first starting off with liquids and rehydrating salts, then in the coming days will put more solid food down,"" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported Tuesday morning from the scene near the town of Copiapo in northern Chile. ""But psychologists say really it is the mental health that's the real thing,"" Penhaul added. Forced confinement for months in a small, dark, hot space with many other people will pose intense psychological and emotional challenges. The men will have to help one another, Penhaul said. ""They have to make sure on a day when somebody is feeling down, depressed, that the others keep him there to cheer him up,"" he said. Davitt McAteer, former director of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the situation is challenging on a number of levels, but the Chilean government seems to be doing everything right. ""It's difficult. It's the size of a studio apartment, and it's dark. Well, now there will be some lights put in, but the conditions were very, very difficult,"" he said Tuesday morning. ""You have to deal with bodily functions, and you've got to deal with that kind of question. Then you've got to deal with the psychological impact. ""Now, I think the fact that they've made it these 18 days is very, very positive. But the euphoria of making contact with the surface is going to last a couple days, and then it's going to be a long slog."" McAteer noted that with current technology, there's no reason the trapped miners have to be isolated from their families and society during their confinement. ""These miners are resilient people, but I think also it's a new era,"" he said. ""And I see no reason why you couldn't pass cell phones down to them, or computers, tethered down to them. So, we're in a new day. And something will need to be done to divert their attention. ... How do you come up with things for them to do and arrange things so that they can get their attention diverted from just sitting there waiting?"" Added Penhaul: ""The families on the surface will also play a role as well, establishing communication with their family members to tell them to keep strong, but above all, to stay patient. They could be down there until Christmas."" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Jim Kavanagh and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.","33 Chilean miners have been stuck inside mine for 18 days .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Investigators were trying to determine Wednesday what caused China's first fatal passenger plane crash in almost six years. A Henan Airlines flight with 96 people on board overshot a runway and crashed Tuesday night in the Yichun area of northern China, state media said. The plane broke into two pieces and burst into flames. On Wednesday, the government downgraded the death toll from the crash from 43 to 42 after a body that was torn apart was discovered to have been counted twice, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Fifty-four people survived. Five children injured in the crash were in critical condition, said Xinhua, citing doctors in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, where they had been transferred. Another 10 people were severely injured, it said. ""The coming 48 hours are the dangerous period,"" said Wang Yongchen, deputy head of the No. 1 Hospital affiliated with Harbin Medical University. Four of the children suffered heavy respiratory tract burns, said Wang. The investigators' initial focus was to find the flight data recorder  -- commonly known as the ""black box"" -- that might yield clues as to what caused the Brazilian-made Embraer 190 jet to crash land in heavy fog on a patch of grass about 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) from the runway. The black box was found on the ground Wednesday morning, Xinhua said. Some passengers were thrown from the plane upon impact, according Xinhua, which cited the head of the publicity department of the Yichun city committee of the Communist Party of China. Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang led a team of transportation, health, work safety and security officials to Yichun after the crash, state media said. Two survivors told local television that the plane shook violently before it crashed and that thick smoke entered the cabin soon after impact. They said passengers were unable to open emergency exits after the wreck; survivors escaped through cracks in the fuselage. The plane was carrying 91 passengers, including five children, and five crew members when it crashed at 9:36 p.m. (9:36 a.m. ET), according to Xinhua, which cited a source with the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The Henan Airlines flight had taken off from Harbin on the 360-kilometer (225-mile) flight to Lindu Airport, about 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) from downtown Yichun, a city of about 1 million residents near the Russian border, Xinhua said. A Yichun vice-mayor told Xinhua that most of those taken to hospitals did not have life-threatening injuries. China's last fatal passenger airline accident occurred in November 2004, when a China Eastern commuter jet took off in frigid Inner Mongolia without de-icing and crashed shortly afterward into a nearby park, killing 55 people.

"(CNN)  -- With only 71,000 private sector jobs created in July, the latest employment report tells the story of a slow and agonizing recovery. But if you look beneath the surface of recent government data, you can see the developing outline of the next powerful expansion. The leader? The broad digital communications sector -- everything from telecom infrastructure to content providers to applications developers. Communications is one of the few areas where people are consuming more since the recession started, and key communications industries have continued to add jobs despite the downturn. All of which suggests that Washington policymakers should do everything they can to hitch a ride on the communications sector and find ways to stoke the jobs and spending engine a little bit. But proposals to regulate internet activity now before the Federal Communications Commission would do the opposite. What's needed from regulators now is some creativity and humility --  in the form of ""countercyclical regulatory policy."" This gives innovators a bit of breathing space at the start of an economic recovery, but sets the stage to tighten regulations later on if excesses develop. This approach does not mean regulators can go to sleep nor does it mean they can raise the flag of laissez-faire. What's needed is the nuanced judgment of sentries posted at a tense border spot. With watchful eyes, regulators must practice thoughtful restraint that allows space for job leaders to innovate and hire, while remaining ready to aggressively confront violations of law or abuses of consumer rights if they take place. The communications sector is one of the few bright lights in an otherwise dismal economic picture. Facebook just reported its 500 millionth member; Droids are flying out of stores; and the iPad is the latest ""must have"" in technology. To enjoy the new toys, Americans are paying for more powerful mobile connections, too. The powerful pull of the new technology shows up in statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since the recession began in the fourth quarter of 2007, real personal consumption has dropped in big categories of spending, such as motor vehicles, furniture, clothing, eating out and recreation services. There are only two major exceptions to this pattern of big cutbacks. For one, real consumption has risen in some health, education and social services -- all areas that receive a lot of government funding. But operating without big government subsidies, the communications sector has shown equally impressive gains. Real consumption of cell phone services, adjusted for price changes, is up 12.6 percent since the end of 2007. Purchases of internet service, adjusted for price changes, have risen by 5.1 percent, and personal purchases of telephone equipment, adjusted for price changes, are up more than 25 percent. At the same time, key communications-related industries have managed to keep adding jobs. Jobs at internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals -- think Google and Yahoo -- are up 16 percent since the recession started in December 2007. Employment in the ""custom computer programming"" industry -- think website and apps development -- took a hit in the first half of 2009, but since then has bounced back strong. The same is true for jobs in wireless telecom, which bottomed out in July 2009 and have been on a slow upward trend since then. This strength signals that the broad communications sector can help drive recovery, because businesses that hire during a recession usually carry that strength into the subsequent upswing. If history is any guide, these job leaders may grow at least twice as fast as the rest of the economy during the next expansion. That brings us to regulators and government policy. Policymakers should follow the principle of ""do no harm"" when dealing with communications, one of the few sectors showing vibrant growth. That means the FCC should avoid the temptation to add rules, even with good intentions. In particular, the FCC is considering bringing broadband under the same common carrier rules that govern older phone networks. This tightening of the regulatory regime would be part of a move toward net neutrality, a policy that would impose rules on broadband providers and govern the services and products they could offer. The debate over net neutrality is heated, and there are strong arguments on both sides. But whether or not you think that such a move is a good idea, such regulations are unlikely to boost investment or employment in the telecom industry, at a time when we need all the capital spending and jobs that we can get. For that reason, I suggest a two-year pause in new broadband regulation, keeping the current balance among the different players, which seems to be generating growth. At the same time, the knowledge that the regulator remains on duty, ready to intervene, would provide an essential check. Such a countercyclical approach requires regulatory discipline and wisdom. Yes, we know from recent experience that regulators can be too lax. But there's an important difference between deliberate restraint by a regulator who remains alert for the right moment to step back in and a regulator who has gone to sleep. For now, getting more Americans working is more important than imposing too much regulation on growing sectors. Let's help the job leaders soar. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Michael Mandel.","Michael Mandel: Even in recession, people spending more on digital communications .
Policy should stoke jobs and spending engine of communications, Mandel writes .

"(CNN) -- Suspected killer Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean is most likely in Mexico, authorities said, and the prosecutor said he has agreed not to seek the death penalty if Laurean is arrested in that country. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, wanted for murder, may have fled to his native Mexico. Onslow County, North Carolina, District Attorney Dewey Hudson told CNN that he was shown ""strongly compelling evidence"" compiled by federal authorities that shows Laurean is in Mexico. Hudson said he has asked through the State Department that Laurean be arrested if he is found in Mexico. But, he said, he had ""no other option"" but to take the death penalty off the table if Laurean is found there. Mexico has a longstanding record of refusing to extradite suspects to the United States if they face a possible death sentence if convicted. ""I had to agree not to seek the death penalty,"" Hudson told CNN. ""My hands were tied if I wanted to bring him here to face murder charges."" ""It was very frustrating and disappointing,"" Hudson added. Laurean has been charged with murder in the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach. Her charred remains were found January 11 in a fire pit in Laurean's backyard. Investigators found the body after Laurean's wife came forward with a note her husband had written saying he had buried Lauterbach, who was eight months pregnant, after she slit her own throat during an argument. Hudson said Laurean apparently entered his native Mexico only days after leaving behind that note. Hudson would not elaborate on the evidence suggesting Laurean is in Mexico, which he said he viewed Friday. The FBI would not comment on what evidence it might have that Laurean is across the border. ""We strongly suspect, but have not confirmed, he is in Mexico,"" FBI spokesman Newsom Summerlin. Summerlin said the FBI plans to circulate in Mexico either matchbooks or business cards with Laurean's photo. The Marine's wanted poster is on the FBI's Most Wanted List with a $25,000 reward. Police believe Lauterbach was killed December 14, the same day she bought a bus ticket for travel for the following day. But in the note provided to police by Laurean's wife, the corporal claimed Lauterbach killed herself December 15. Police said an autopsy revealed the pregnant Marine was killed by a blow to the head. Police said they are analyzing a possible murder weapon provided by an undisclosed witness. A spokesman told CNN it could several weeks to determine whether it was used to kill Lauterbach. Laurean's wife told police about the note January 11, a day after she said Laurean told her what allegedly happened and following a meeting with a lawyer. Police describe her as a cooperating witness. Lauterbach was scheduled to testify last month at a military hearing after accusing Laurean of raping her last spring. On Monday, the Onslow County sheriff's office released new photographs of the fire pit in Lauren's backyard taken just before Lauterbach's body was discovered January 11. Police said some neighbors reported seeing a group of Marines having a Christmas Day barbecue in Laurean's backyard. Police also released photographs that show Laurean's living room and garage with paint cans. Investigators said they found blood in more than one room of Laurean's home, some of which was covered by fresh paint. The sheriff's office said it has documented evidence Laurean bought paint, concrete blocks and a wheelbarrow at a home improvement store December 16. In a store surveillance video, Laurean is seen walking into the store with another man, who has not been identified. Investigators are also awaiting the results of DNA paternity tests, which they said could take weeks, to tell whether Laurean was the father of Lauterbach's unborn child.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Defense Minister Ehud Barak testified Tuesday that he bears full responsibility for the actions of Israeli soldiers in the mid-sea interception of a humanitarian aid flotilla that left nine people dead in May. He defended the action and said Israel went to great diplomatic lengths to stop the flotilla heading to the Palestinian territory of Gaza, and when that didn't work, it considered the implications of the use of force and weighed the possibility of simply letting the flotilla through. In the end, Israel made the right decision,  Barak said in his two-hour testimony before an Israeli commission looking into the incident. Israeli navy commandos intercepted the flotilla at sea and stormed the largest vessel, the Turkish-flagged Mavi Marmara. ""We regret any loss of life, but without the courage and skill of the commandos we would have lost more lives,"" Barak said. The Israeli navy commando fought with activists on the ship, leaving one Turkish-American and eight Turkish activists dead and sparking an international outcry. The incident left a wide-ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the Jewish state and Turkey, its powerful regional ally, badly shaken. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed hope that a separate U.N. inquiry, launched Tuesday, would help mend the strained relations. Ban met with members of the U.N. panel, which is chaired by New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer and includes representatives from Israel and Turkey. But Israel has already said that it will not participate in the U.N. inquiry if the panel asks to question soldiers. ""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarifies that Israel will not cooperate and will not participate in any panel that will demand to interrogate IDF soldiers,"" said government spokesman Nir Hefetz. Netanyahu said Israel operated within international law when it stopped the flotilla and raided the Mavi Marmara on May 31. ""I'm convinced that at the end of your investigation, it will be clear that the state of Israel ... operated in accordance with international law and that ... soldiers on the Marmara showed great courage in fulfilling their mission and acting in self-defense against real-life dangers,"" Netanyahu said Monday, the opening day of the Israeli probe. Israel has maintained its troops used force on the activists only after they were attacked by those on board.  Soldiers were attacked with knives, metal poles and other objects, Israeli officials have said. But passengers on board the boat insist they were fired upon without provocation. The ships were carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, organizers said. The Palestinian territory has been blockaded by Israel since its takeover by the Islamic movement Hamas in 2007. ""For the past two months, I have engaged in intensive consultation with the leaders of Israel and Turkey on the setting-up of a panel of inquiry on the flotilla incident,"" Ban said in a statement. ""This is an unprecedented development. I thank the leaders of the two countries with whom I have engaged in last-minute consultations over the weekend, for their spirit of compromise and forward-looking cooperation."" CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Ehud Barak: Many options were discussed, including letting the flotilla through .

Lohan entered a court-ordered substance abuse rehabilitation program at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on August 2, following a 13-day stint in a Los Angeles county jail for a probation violation. Judge Marsha Revel, who ordered Lohan to spend 90 days in rehab, was replaced by Judge Eldon Fox earlier this month. Judge Fox, who has met behind closed doors with Lohan's lawyer and the prosecutor, will hold a hearing in his Beverly Hills courtroom Wednesday morning, a court spokesman said. Fox is expected to issue a new order concerning Lohan during the hearing, the spokesman said. Revel ordered the jail time and rehab after she ruled that Lohan violated her probation from a 2007 drunk driving case.","Judge Fox will hold a hearing for Lohan Wednesday morning .

"JACKSONVILLE, North Carolina (CNN) -- It's possible that a pregnant Marine missing since December 14 may have left willingly, perhaps after being upset by a phone call, documents released Thursday by Onslow County authorities show. Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach last spoke to family members in the Dayton, Ohio, area on December 14. Those records were bolstered by comments made by the county sheriff who pleaded for 20-year-old Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, who is eight months pregnant, to come home. The young woman's mother, Mary Lauterbach, told authorities that her daughter has a history of being a ""compulsive liar,"" a police report states. Mary Lauterbach described having a ""firm conversation"" with Maria Lauterbach about her unborn baby, telling her she should give the baby up for adoption because she is unable to care for it.  Watch police face unanswered questions » . ""Ms. Maria Lauterbach was telling Mary Lauterbach everything was fine, but Mary Lauterbach had a sense that the statements were not accurate,"" the report said. Lauterbach last spoke to family members in the Dayton, Ohio, area on December 14. They reported her missing on December 19 after being unable to contact her. Documents attached to a search warrant in the case cite the Marine's mother as saying Lauterbach had been the victim of a sexual assault by a superior officer. Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown said Thursday his office had not talked to the person accused in that case and referred any other comment to the Marine Corps. Officials at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where Lauterbach is based, have not commented on the assault allegations. Earlier Thursday, Brown pleaded with Lauterbach to come forward and get help. ""Regardless of the circumstances, this has got to stop,"" Brown told reporters. ""You can't run from those things in life."" While he would not say definitively that authorities believe Lauterbach is alive, Brown said he is leaning toward a positive outcome. ""You pray that she's alive,"" he said. Mary Lauterbach said her daughter claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a senior officer, but the military investigation had ""gone sour,"" according to the Onslow County reports. When police consulted with the military on the allegations, the military reported that the case was open, but ""it was difficult, due to inconsistencies provided by Maria Lauterbach, the reported victim."" Military investigators also ""confirmed the history of compulsive lying,"" the report said, and added that Lauterbach was facing a possible discharge from the Marine Corps and was under personal and professional stress. A Marine Corps Times story Thursday, citing unnamed sources, said Lauterbach may have fled her post after she withdrew the sexual assault allegations because she feared being charged with making a false statement. The newspaper said the allegations were lodged with Marine Corps officials last year and later withdrawn. The Marine Corps is bringing Lauterbach's roommate, Sgt. Daniel Robert Durham, back to North Carolina from a training deployment in California to answer questions.  Watch sheriff say why he'll talk with roommate » . The Onslow County report said that Durham told police that he had made his home available to Lauterbach ""out of sympathy for her situation"" and that the two had shared the home for only a short period of time. Durham said he noticed nothing unusual in Lauterbach's behavior before she disappeared, but said ""she had been upset by a phone call from her stepmother."" A few items of Lauterbach's were missing, he said -- her car, some cosmetics and clothing -- that led him to believe she may have left willingly. However, Durham told police that Lauterbach was confined to bed most of the time because of her pregnancy and that she ""was in no shape for extended outings,"" according to the reports. Brown told reporters Thursday that Durham is a close friend who may be the last person known to have talked with Lauterbach before her disappearance. Mary Lauterbach told the Dayton Daily News on Wednesday that she last spoke to her daughter on December 14 in what she called ""a very normal conversation."" The mother told CNN affiliate WDTN that later that day, she got a phone call from her daughter's roommate saying Maria had left their house. After that, calls she made to her daughter's cell phone went unanswered, Mary Lauterbach told the Dayton newspaper. Brown said Maria Lauterbach may have been due to give birth January 8. The police reports, however, said she was due on February 14, and did not show up for a prenatal medical appointment on December 28. Lauterbach's cell phone was found on a roadside near Camp Lejeune on December 20. Her car was found Monday in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, Brown said, and had apparently been there since December 15. The car was processed, he said, but nothing of value was found. Investigators have said that a withdrawal from Lauterbach's bank account was made on December 14 and there was ""suspicious activity"" on the account 10 days later. Police reports said Lauterbach's ATM card was used at a Marine Federal Credit Union by a man who attempted to cover the surveillance camera with a rag while he withdrew money from her account. A search warrant released with the other documents Thursday seeks Western Union records, saying authorities have reason to believe Lauterbach may be receiving financial support through money transfers. ""Call mom!!! You know the number,"" says a Facebook page established to help find Lauterbach. ""All of us love you and we miss you. Please come home!"" Lauterbach is a personnel clerk assigned to Combat Logistics Regiment 27, 2nd Marine Logistics Group, II Marine Expeditionary Force, the Marine Corps said. She joined the service on June 6, 2006.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge sentenced children's author K.P. Bath to six years in prison Thursday for possessing child pornography. Investigators found a large collection of pornographic photographs and video clips in the Portland, Oregon, home of the author of ""The Secret of Castle Cant"" and ""Escape from Castle Cant,"" according to a statement federal prosecutors released Thursday. ""Many of the videos graphically depicted the sexual abuse of very young children,"" the statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon said. Bath, 51, pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing child pornography. ""It is shocking that a children's author would contribute to the trauma these kids endure -- both physical and emotional trauma from the sexual abuse itself, and psychological trauma from knowing that images of that abuse are circulating on the Internet,"" U.S. Attorney Dwight Holton said in a statement. Bath's collection included images depicting sadistic conduct, rape, sodomy and bestiality, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also allege that an investigation revealed that Bath had traded images of child pornography with at least two different collectors in Washington and Ohio. Those collectors were prosecuted, but charges against Bath for allegedly transporting, distributing and receiving child pornography were dropped as part of a plea agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Bath volunteered at the Beverly Cleary Children's Library in Portland and worked at The Asian Reporter newspaper, according to a 2004 University of Alabama news release describing an alumni reading series. Bath had a master's degree from the university and had worked as a field hand, factory laborer, musician, editor and teacher, the news release said. CNN's Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- Patriarch Bartholomew is the living embodiment of one of the world's oldest institutions -- the Greek Orthodox Church in Constantinople. But he could be the last to hold the title in what is modern-day Istanbul, in secular but Muslim majority Turkey. CNN's ""World's Untold Stories"" examines the dwindling Greek Orthodox community in Turkey and how they are faring. There has been a patriarch in Constantinople for 14 centuries, ever since it was the capital of Byzantium and the Eastern Roman Empire, ruling over the Eastern Mediterranean and much of the Middle East. To this day, Orthodox Christians around the world recite prayers to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the ""first among equals."" Some describe him as the equivalent of the ""pope"" for the world's Orthodox Christians. But Bartholomew, who is now 70, may become the last in a line of some 270 bishops in Constantinople. The Turkish government refuses to recognize Bartholomew's title as ""Ecumenical Patriarch."" Twenty-five years ago, the Turkish government shut the seminary where Greek Orthodox clergy traditionally trained. Greeks who do not hold Turkish passports are barred from becoming clerics. Instead of being the spiritual leader of his faith, Bartholomew has become a symbol of the dwindling community of ethnic Greeks still living in modern-day Istanbul. There are only around 2,000 ethnic Greeks left in Istanbul. The last members of this community are gradually dying out, but they cling tenaciously to the churches and schools their ancestors built in what was once the capital of a Greek empire. ""World's Untold Stories"" showcases the best of CNN journalism covering powerful tales that are always captivating with compelling characters at the center. Recent episodes have covered the ""Train of Death"" ride through Mexico to the U.S., tracking down key figures from Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime, anti-Roma discrimination in Europe and extreme Christians in the United States.","Patriarch Bartholomew is head of the Greek Orthodox Church in Constantinople .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- The debate over distracted drivers ramped up a notch on Thursday as Ford Motor Co. announced technology to let computers read their Twitter feeds to them while behind the wheel. The company has not formally announced technology to let drivers post tweets verbally from behind the wheel, but such an announcement likely will come in the next 12 to 18 months, Doug VanDagens, Ford's global director of connected services, told CNN in an interview after the company's keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show here. VanDagens said people read Twitter feeds and send text messages while they're driving anyway, and that the automaker is trying to make those activities safer for drivers. ""We take what people do -- they talk on the phone, they fumble with mp3 players, they look at maps. We take these activities and make them safer,"" he said. Safety groups have criticized car companies and technology makers for putting touch-screen devices that surf the Internet in cars. The U.S. is in a distracted driving crisis, and, in general, the more technology electronics makers put into cars, the less drivers are able to pay attention to the road, said Christie Hype, a spokeswoman for AAA, the motor safety group. ""The more things that are going on in a vehicle, the more things can distract a driver,"" she said. ""You only have so much attention to give, and we really want everyone to keep their attention on the roadway for safety reasons."" More study of the tweeting by voice while driving would need to take place to make an absolute determination as to what effect Ford's announcement will have on distracted driving, she said. Ford's system, which will be installed in some cars later this year, does not let drivers surf the Internet visually while driving. A Wi-Fi hot spot in the new cars generate will let drivers browse the Web when their cars are parked, VanDagens said. The technologies will first show up in Edge and Focus model cars. Not all models will be upgraded in 2010, but new lines of these cars will be equipped with the media-center technology, which features an 8-inch screen in the center of the dash and a media hookup under the armrest. A company representative would not comment on whether the technology will increase the price of Ford cars. Ford's announcement also highlights the growing popularity and importance of mobile phone applications. Instead of downloading Twitter feeds through the car, Ford works with drivers' mobile phones, pulling data from a number of apps, which are produced by other companies. The Twitter-reading function works with a Twitter mobile app called Open Beak. The car company also announced partnership with Pandora's mobile app, which streams music, and Stitcher, an application for online news.","Ford says new technology will first show up in Edge and Focus model cars .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- One of two American service members who were abducted in Afghanistan on Friday has been killed, provincial government officials said Sunday. Den Mohammad Darwish, the spokesman for the governor of Logar province, said he learned from locals that the American was killed. He said the body was found in the Patanak Mountains of Charkh district. He also said the vehicle the men were driving was located Sunday. A Taliban spokesman confirmed that the killed American died in a firefight and the other is being held by the group. Another official, Samar Gul Rashid -- who is the governor of the Charkh district in Logar province -- also confirmed the killing, saying he learned about it through Afghan intelligence officials. In releasing a statement Sunday, the Navy confirmed that the two missing service members are sailors. ""The thoughts and prayers of our entire Navy go out to the missing sailors serving in Afghanistan and their families,"" said Adm. Gary Roughead, chief of U.S. naval operations, in the statement. ""We have been closely following the situation from the outset. These sailors represent two of several thousand sailors serving on the ground in Afghanistan in support of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the International Security Assistance Force Afghanistan. ""Forces on the ground in Afghanistan are doing everything they can to locate and safely return our missing shipmates,"" Roughead said. Rashid said the second sailor, who was also abducted, is wounded and still missing. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the two Americans were driving in a civilian vehicle in the village of Dasht, in Charkh district. The Taliban wanted to take both men alive, but the firefight broke out, killing one of the Americans, Mujahid said. The other is alive and being held in a safe location, he said . There were no immediate demands from the Taliban for the return of the Americans because the group was still deliberating what its demands would be, Mujahid said. A U.S. military official confirmed that a $20,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the return of the two sailors. Posters were being distributed in the region. Adm. Mike Mullen told reporters earlier Sunday that he could not give out any information. But he did call it an ""unusual circumstance"" to have two individuals leave the base and drive over an hour away in a non-military vehicle. The two went missing after leaving their compound in the Afghan capital of Kabul, NATO said. An Afghan intelligence source told CNN that the two were abducted in Logar province, south of Kabul. The development comes as five U.S. soldiers were killed in bombings in southern Afghanistan on Saturday.

"New York (CNN) -- A man in his 60s attempted an armed robbery in New York City and fled to Maryland, where he allegedly robbed two hotels at gunpoint, led police on a short chase and died when his car left the road and crashed, authorities said Friday. The man was identified as a 63-year-old career criminal named Arthur Williams, CNN affiliate WABC reported. New York police said Williams tried to rob Sarar, an upscale clothing store on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, Saturday evening while carrying a cane and wearing a nasal tube connected to an oxygen tank. The suspect fired three shots before fleeing the scene, police said. Early Sunday morning, Maryland State Police were alerted to an armed robbery in Hancock, Maryland, and a second about an hour later in Clear Spring, Maryland. A state trooper on DUI patrol was following a suspected drunken driver when dispatchers broadcast a description of the vehicle driven by the suspected robber. The description matched the vehicle he was following, so he attempted to pull the driver over. The chase lasted about 2 1/2 miles and reached a top speed of 120 mph, police said, ending when Williams's car went off the road and hit several fixed objects and a parked car. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The New York incident was recorded by a store surveillance camera, according to an advisory issued earlier Friday by the New York Police Department, which was seeking the public's assistance in the hunt for the would-be robber. Williams initially appeared to be shopping for clothing after entering the store, according to police. Sol Tezcan, the store manager said the man did not rouse suspicion and calmly asked for a pair of pants to match his jacket. Tezcan said that when he turned around looking for pants, the man pulled a gun from his waistband and demanded money from a nearby customer. The gunman fired one shot, missing the customer, who was fleeing the store. Tezcan said Williams then turned the gun on him, asking, ""You want one?"" He fired two shots in Tezcan's direction as he ran toward the back of the store, the manager said. ""I was not nervous,"" Tezcan said. ""It happened in three seconds."" Williams fled the scene in a black Cadillac CTS with Alabama license plates, the same car Maryland state police later encountered, according to police.

"(CNN) -- A fully functional submarine built for the primary purpose of transporting massive amounts of cocaine has been seized by Ecuadorean authorities with the help of U.S. drug enforcement agents. A drug-trafficking organization built the sea-worthy vessel that is now being held near the border of Ecuador and Colombia, and one individual has been taken into custody, authorities said. The investigation into the group and the submarine, which was seized Friday, is ongoing. ""This is the first seizure of a clandestinely constructed fully operational submarine built to facilitate trans-oceanic drug trafficking,"" the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a statement. The vessel utilized twin screws and was diesel electric-powered, the agency said. It was about 30 meters (98 feet) long and nearly 3 meters (nine feet) high from the deck plates to the ceiling. It has a periscope and an air-conditioning system. ""Traffickers historically employed slow-moving fishing boats, sail boats, pleasure craft go-fasts,"" said Jay Bergman, Andean regional director for the agency. ""The advent of the narco-submarine presents new detection challenges for maritime interdiction forces. The submarine's nautical range, payload capacity and quantum leap in stealth have raised the stakes for the counter-drug forces and the national security community alike."" The submarine was constructed in a ""remote jungle environment in an effort to elude law enforcement or military interdiction,"" the agency said. Acting on intelligence, Ecuadorean authorities were able to seize the vessel for before its maiden voyage, the statement said.

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- On a blistering hot July morning, Debbie Higgins arrived at Arlington National Cemetery to honor the memory of her son, Marine Lance Cpl. James Higgins Jr., who was killed in Iraq on July 27, 2006. ""Mama Higgins,"" as she is known to members of her son's unit, was not alone. Hundreds of Gold Star families -- whose loved ones were killed while serving their country -- on Saturday joined members of the support organization Families United at the cemetery's Tomb of the Unknowns to pay tribute. The service was part of a weekend of remembrance for relatives of U.S. military personnel killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. More than 2,000 families were expected to attend the events. With hands over their hearts or raised to their foreheads in salute, family members watched and listened as a wreath was laid on the tomb and a single trumpet played ""Taps."" After the ceremony, a motorcade made its way through the cemetery grounds to Section 60, the part of Arlington where many of the fallen soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. Family members placed small painted stones, flags and flowers on the gravesites. Some left photos or notes; others simply sat quietly at their loved ones' headstones. ""To lose a child changes your entire life,"" Higgins said. ""It's my son's wish that keeps me going."" That wish was for a memorial to those killed in ongoing conflicts, something the Marine mentioned to his mother during one of their final phone conversations. ""It will be the National Fallen Heroes Memorial, and it will be from first killed after Vietnam until the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom,"" Higgins said. ""We're going to remember them all."" The memorial is privately funded and will be located on Route 15, just north of Frederick, Maryland. But Higgins has also made her own personal tribute to her son: a motorcycle, painted with his image, which carries the symbol and motto of the U.S. Marine Corps: Semper Fidelis -- Always Faithful. The seat of the motorcycle is made from the door of the Hummer in which Higgins' son was fatally wounded during his last tour in Iraq just a week before he was scheduled to come home. On Saturday, Higgins' motorcycle led the motorcade of families through the cemetery, from the Tomb of the Unknowns to the graves of their own fallen soldiers. She said she is proud that her motorcycle is an inspiration to others and that she can continue to honor the life of her son. ""He was so proud, and he loved his country,"" Higgins said. ""He loved the United States and the American flag and everything that it represents.""","Families who lost loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan gather to pay tribute .

"(CNN) -- At least 200 structures have been destroyed and 1,100 damaged after a dam on an eastern Iowa lake failed, unleashing a torrent of floodwaters, a spokesman for the governor said Sunday. The Lake Delhi dam, about 45 miles north of Cedar Rapids, failed Saturday as a result of ""massive rain -- a very unusually high amount this season,"" according to Jim Flansburg, communications director for Gov. Chet Culver. It was unclear how many of the structures impacted by the ensuing floodwaters were residential homes, Flansburg said. Culver planned to tour the affected areas Sunday afternoon, helping set sandbags out to stave off the rising Maquoketa River. Culver told CNN Saturday that nearly 10 inches of rain had recently fallen in a 12-hour period in the area and was ""too much water for the dam to hold."" The roads on either side of the dam -- which were part of the cement dam's containment measures -- apparently gave out as a result of the rainfall, Flansburg said. Video on Saturday showed massive amounts of water violently gushing from the pool behind the dam into the Maquoketa below. Nearby homes and buildings were under water up to their eaves. No injuries were reported.","It's unclear how many of the affected structures are residential homes .

"(CNN) -- The former Agriculture Department employee at the center of a political firestorm said Friday that President Barack Obama didn't literally say he was ""sorry"" when they spoke Thursday, but ""by simply calling me,"" she believed he was apologizing. Shirley Sherrod -- forced to resign from her job based on incomplete and misleading reports about a speech she gave in March -- also told CNN's ""American Morning"" that the department official who asked for her resignation was only a ""messenger."" And later Friday, she had a ""very emotional"" reunion with the white Georgia couple she referenced about in her now-famous speech. As for the White House, Sherrod told CNN that it had had been trying to reach her since Wednesday night. ""My phone was full, couldn't take any more messages. Finally, I was on the way to the airport in an attempt to get home when I checked my messages and had received one from the White House saying the president was trying to get in touch with me and give them a call,"" she said. ""I did that, and I had the conversation with him, and, you know, I feel good about that."" Asked whether she was able to enlighten him about her work, she said they didn't have time to get into that. ""But toward the end of the conversation, I told him I'd love to have him come to South Georgia,"" she said, adding that she would ""take him around and show him some things."" ""I could definitely bring the point home,"" said Sherrod, who lives in Georgia. She said he didn't precisely say he was sorry. ""I really didn't want to hear the president of the United States say 'I'm sorry' to Shirley Sherrod,"" she said. ""I felt he was saying that in his talk just by simply calling me. I felt it was, in a way, saying 'I'm sorry' because he didn't have to do it."" The Sherrod controversy began after conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart posted a portion of the speech in which Sherrod spoke of not offering her full help to a white farmer. The original post indicated that the incident Sherrod mentioned occurred when she worked for the Agriculture Department, and news outlets quickly picked up on the story. However, the incident took place decades before she joined the department, and her speech in its unedited form made the point that people should move beyond race. In addition, the white farmer whom Sherrod mentioned has told reporters that Sherrod helped him save his farm. Nevertheless, Sherrod was swiftly fired after government officials heard only the portion of the speech. When the full version of the speech was heard, she received apologies from the White House, the agriculture secretary and the NAACP, which criticized the edited remarks. On ""American Morning"" on Friday, Sherrod was asked about the ""ability"" of Obama, American's first black president, to discuss and deal with racial issues. ""I guess because he's a black president, for some reason, they felt you can't talk about issues that affect just black people,"" she said. She said she believes that ""the administration feels too that if they highlight issues of black people ... the country would perceive (it) as something negative. I know they probably have to struggle with that. But I think they're wrong. I think they could do more to advance unity if they could promote a discussion from that level."" Sherrod was also asked about Cheryl Cook, the Agriculture Department official who phoned Sherrod and asked for her resignation. ""I know Cheryl Cook, and I know, had she been given the opportunity to make a decision her on her own, we wouldn't be sitting here talking about this. So she was the messenger. I really truly do believe it was not her message,"" she said. ""Cheryl is a great person. I definitely want to see her be able to continue the work she was doing at USDA. So I would hope that this attention on her would not cause them to do the same thing they did to me: boot her out."" Sherrod has received an apology for her firing from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Although she hasn't received an apology from Breitbart, Sherrod said she is not sure she's ready for that kind of a chat just yet. ""He would really need to come and sit down with me and look me in the eye so that we could see if we could find a place -- I'm not saying I wouldn't forgive him, but we would need to see if we could find a place for that to happen. ""I don't see it at this point. He hasn't been willing. He hasn't tried to apologize to me for anything he's caused me to go through,"" she said. Breitbart's website included corrections Wednesday on two blog entries that included the video footage from Sherrod's speech. ""Correction: While Ms. Sherrod made the remarks captured in the first video featured in this post while she held a federally appointed position, the story she tells refers to actions she took before she held that federal position,"" said a notice added to one of the postings on Breitbart's biggovernment.com site. A shorter version appeared on another posting of the Sherrod video footage. The corrections did not mention the edited nature of the video he posted Monday or the full context. Breitbart told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper: 360"" on Thursday that he saw no reason to apologize: ""What would warrant an apology? ... I'm not the one who threw her under the bus."" Sherrod had said that she was offered some type of civil rights position in the department's Office of Outreach and that she was expecting to receive something official in an e-mail from the department. On Friday, she did not address that issue or say she would accept the position. The edited Sherrod video initially brought condemnation from the NAACP, which later retracted its statement and apologized to Sherrod after the context became clear. Also, the farmer and his wife Sherrod was discussing, Roger and Eloise Spooner, came forward Tuesday, saying that they credited Sherrod with helping them save their farm and that she did not discriminate against them. On Friday, Sherrod and the Spooners held a reunion at a restaurant in the Colquitt, Georgia, area. A CNN Special Investigations Unit witnessed the get-together. CNN's Don Lemon, who saw the reunion, said it was ""very emotional."" ""The interesting thing is watching them look at each other in the eye and talk to each other. There were no tears but only big smiles. It seemed very authentic,"" he said. Lemon asked the couple whether they'd ever have to help save her as she saved them. ""Never in a million years,"" Roger Spooner said. The NAACP, which initially called Sherrod's statements ""shameful,"" said in a statement Tuesday that it was ""snookered by Fox News"" and Breitbart. Breitbart's post was picked up by the Fox News website. On Monday, Fox News hosts Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity played the edited clip on their programs. O'Reilly, who had called for Sherrod's immediate resignation, apologized for his statements Wednesday. Also Wednesday, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith sharply criticized Breitbart's website as well as his network's own coverage of the story.","NEW: Sherrod, white family at center of drama are reunited in Georgia .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Launching a show at San Diego Comic-Con can be a risky business, but sometimes it pays off. ""Lost,"" ""Heroes"" and ""Glee"" all went on to spectacular first seasons after panels at Comic-Con. AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" seems like it might benefit the most from Comic-Con, with an audience that already knows the show's title from the comic book on which it's based. An extremely creepy display promoting the series, with two bloody bodies and words scrawled on a wall in blood, greeted many Con-goers on the floor. This is the network's way of letting fans know that they don't intend to hold back on the violence and gore. It's just one example of how this year, more than ever, the networks are hoping to build buzz around their new shows, as well as keep or grow the audience for established ones. To do that, they try to give the fans what they want. ""I think fans want to meet the cast and creators, and they want a bit of inside information,"" said Lisa Gregorian, chief marketing officer of Warner Bros. Television (which is owned by Time Warner, owner of CNN). ""All fans are looking for a unique, fun experience with the shows they love."" Warner certainly made its presence known, with free bags promoting many of their shows handed out to fans as they registered. USA Network, SyFy and Showtime were also ubiquitous. Shows such as ""Eureka"" and ""Burn Notice"" were being promoted in a variety of ways outside the convention, including a takeover of a nearby restaurant. Showtime plastered ads all over buses in San Diego. Inside, it held a panel for four of its shows, including ""Dexter,"" which is extremely popular at Comic-Con. One thing that can't miss at Comic-Con is free food, and Fox served up free burgers and soda on behalf of the upcoming animated series ""Bob's Burgers."" Then there's the low-key approach; of course, low-key at Comic-Con means driving through town with a bullhorn. HBO did this to promote the return of ""Eastbound and Down."" ""No Ordinary Family,"" about a family given superhero powers, gave attendees the chance to ""lift"" a car themselves. Stars Julie Benz and Michael Chiklis showed the pilot as well, and Benz talked to the media about this change in tone after the extremely dark ""Dexter."" ""For me, it's just the perfect marriage of genres, and I'm ready to explore more of the lighter side,"" she said. Chiklis, with his background as The Thing in the ""Fantastic Four"" movies, was asked about playing another superhero. ""I just think it's a huge genre, there's so much room to grow. Just look at Comic-Con, it's like Vegas,"" he said. ""I'm happy to do a show that blends genres."" Of course, there are shows that are already perennial favorites at the convention, such as ""True Blood,""  which had ads plastered all over the convention center. And there's ""Chuck,"" which once again wowed the fans with the fictional band from the show, Jeffster, doing a music video of Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance."" The crowd also cheered at the announcement that Linda Hamilton would be playing Chuck's mother. Stars Zachary Levi and Joshua Gomez were in rare form talking to the media. They riffed on the power of the internet to keep ""Chuck"" on the air and the upcoming season. Levi said that much of what was said at the panel was a surprise to him. "" 'Old Spice Guy' as a guest star? News to me,"" he said. Nicole Richie who guest-starred in season one, will also reprise her character. Now that Chuck's best friend, sister and brother-in-law are in on his spy secrets, what about Jeffster? ""I kind of like that we kind of operate around the spy world, inadvertent,"" said Vik Sahay, who plays the Lester half of the duo. ""I'd like to see more of us accidentally helping out."" One show with something to prove was NBC's ""The Event,"" which showed the pilot to an audience that came away seeming fairly impressed. Of course, even the meaning of the show's title still remains a mystery. The producers and cast weren't able to provide many more clues, aside from what was presented in the pilot, which involves (spoiler alert!) some mysterious detainees trying to win their freedom and a shocking ending. ""That moment at the end, I was like, 'what the heck was going on?' "" said actor Ian Anthony Dale. ""I just wanted the chance to read for it, and it was a dream come true."" The mystery continues to build around the show, but the biggest mystery of all may be whether this show, like the other new offerings for the season, will catch on. If so, they can look forward to a triumphant return like ""Chuck"" and ""True Blood.""","""Lost,"" ""Heroes,"" ""Glee"" all went on to spectacular first seasons after panels at Comic-Con .
