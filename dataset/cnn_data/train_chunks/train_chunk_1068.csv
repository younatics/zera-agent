"Bill and Hillary Clinton are making the most of their new-found time as grandparents, ditching political events to spend as much time as possible with the latest member of family. The former President and his potential candidate wife were seen today making another visit to the Lenox Hill hospital in Manhattan, where Chelsea Clinton gave birth to her first daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, Friday evening. The beaming couple, who arrived separately, both waved for cameras again as they made their way inside to see their daughter in her plush maternity suite - which reportedly costs thousands of dollars a night.

New Hampshire state senator Lou D'Allesandro today confirmed to CNN that Hillary had pulled out of a fundraiser tomorrow, telling the network: 'Baby came, family first'. Bill has already bowed out of a scheduled appearance to help Senator Mark Udall at a fundraising  event in Colorado. Stoked: Hillary has already expressed her willingness to volunteer for baby-sitting duty . New priority: Bill canceled an appearance at a fundraiser in Colorado when Chelsea gave birth . Both Democrats are locked in tight re-election battles with their Republican challengers. He has been travelling around the country to help the party this year. Chelsea gave birth at 7.03pm Friday night, and announced the news a few hours later. Bill and Hillary met their granddaughter for the first time the following day, and shared photographs of them cooing over the baby, declaring themselves 'over the moon'. Moments before, Chelsea had shared the first picture of her daughter, which showing her cradling the baby next to her husband, investment banker Marc Mezvinsky.

The couple, who married in July 2010, announced in April that they were expecting their first child. Bill and Hillary had been publicly gushing for months at the prospect of becoming grandparents, though Chelsea's exact due date had been kept quiet. In a recent TV interview, former President Bill said :'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.' He has since been proved right. 'We are in love': Chelsea Clinton posted this picture of her holding Charlotte with new father Marc Mezvinsky standing behind her . Luxurious: The Lenox Hill hospital offers huge, well-appointed rooms such as this for celebrity moms . Surprise! Chelsea and Marc elected not to find out the gender of their first child advance .

So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage. 'I want to babysit any chance I get,' she added. When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year. 'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added. 'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' Lenox Hill hospital, two blocks from Central Park in Manhattan's Upper East Side, is no stranger to celebrity patients. The center has hosted high-profile politicians and entertainers, and reportedly offers lavish birth suits at prices of $1,700 per night.

"Three teenage girls from suburban Denver may have been trying to join Islamic State militants in Syria after stealing their parents' money and flying to Germany, authorities said Tuesday. The girls — two sisters, ages 17 and 15, and their 16-year-old friend — were reported missing after they skipped school Friday, but the families had no indication of where they might have gone, said Glenn Thompson, bureau chief of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department . Suspicion arose when the sisters' father realized his daughters were gone, along with $2,000 and their passports. They were stopped at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport over the weekend by FBI agents and returned to Colorado where they were reunited with their families, FBI spokeswoman Suzie Payne said. Three American teenage girls from Colorado have been detained in Germany while reportedly on their way to Syria to join ISIS. Pictured: Frankfurt airport . A U.S. official said the girls were headed toward Turkey en route to Syria and that investigators were now reviewing evidence, including the girls' computers. Another U.S. official called the case ""concerning"" both to the community and to the country in general. The official said the evidence gathered so far made it clear that the girls were headed to Syria, though the official said investigators were still determining what sort of contacts they had in that country. The official said investigators would be trying to figure out whether there were ""like-minded"" friends and acquaintances in the girls' social circle. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name. The Arapahoe County missing person's report contains details of the girls' movements. They said they stayed in the Frankfurt airport for an entire day before being detained, questioned and returned to Denver, where they were further questioned by the FBI and sent home. They told authorities they had gone to Germany for ""family"" but wouldn't elaborate. The 16-year-old girl's father became concerned when he got a call from her high school saying she hadn't reported to class, according to the police reports. The families reported no prior problems with the girls. Deputies closed the missing person's case Monday after they learned the girls had been returned. A man who answered the door at the sisters' home in the Denver suburb of Aurora identified himself as a family member but said he had no comment. An ISIS fighter waving their flag from inside a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa . The announcement comes one month after 19-year-old Shannon Conley of Arvada, Colorado, pleaded guilty to charges that she conspired to help militants in Syria. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver declined to comment on the latest cases. It's unclear whether the girls will face charges. Crimes committed by juveniles are treated as acts of ""delinquency"" in the federal system and are not handled the same way as crimes committed by adults. Authorities have not said how they think the girls became interested in helping the Islamic State militants. In Conley's case, she told agents she wanted to marry a suitor she met online who said he was a Tunisian man fighting with the Islamic State in Syria. Earlier this month, 19-year-old Shannon Conley (pictured) of Denver, who authorities say intended to wage jihad, pleaded guilty to trying to help the Islamic State militant group in Syria . Conley said she wanted to use her American military training with the U.S. Army Explorers to fight a holy war overseas, authorities said. If she could not fight with the extremists, she told agents, she would use her training as a nurse's aide. Agents, who had been overtly trying to stop Conley, arrested her in April as she boarded a flight she hoped would ultimately get her to Syria. She could face up to five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine when she is sentenced in January. Foreign fighters from dozens of nations are pouring into the Middle East to join the Islamic State group and other terrorist organizations. U.S. officials are putting new energy into trying to understand what radicalizes people far removed from the fight, and into trying to prod countries to do a better job of keeping them from joining up.","The three teenage girls went missing from Denver, Colorado last Friday .

"This is the dramatic moment a ferocious lion killed a wildebeest in less than a minute after a brutal battle on an African plain. The whole clash was captured on camera and shows the lion waiting patiently for the injured wildebeest before pouncing on its hapless victim. The two animals can then be seen tussling with each other before the big cat grabs the wildebeest by the neck and pulls it to the ground, where it is unable to recover. Scroll down for video . Crouching down on the African plain, a lion waits patiently for a group of wildebeest to pass by as he eyes up his prey . The lion, who has been waiting patiently, sees the injured wildebeest and prepares to launch an attack on its unsuspecting victim . The two animals begin to face-off before the lion makes his move and jumps on top of the wildebeest, who struggles to get away from the big cat . The wildebeest is struck by a massive blow to the head by the lion's powerful front paw as he attempts to take down his prey . And just 60 seconds after the fight began the wildebeest is left for dead after it struggles to break free from the lion's grip and gives up its fight. The action was shot in the Maasai Mara in Kenya by photographer, Aditya Singh, who lives in Rajasthan, India. The 48-year-old said: 'One morning, soon after we left our camp, we spotted two young male lions, brothers, at a distance. Just seconds later, the lion uses his powerful front paw to deliver the first blow to the wildebeest's head and knocking the creature to the ground . The battle between the animals was caught on camera by Indian photographer Aditya Singh, who was visiting the Masai Mara in Kenya . Photographer Mr Singh said: 'Before the wildebeest could recover, the lion grabbed the wildebeest by the neck and it was all over' The lion then wraps his front legs around the wildebeest's neck in a headlock, pulling the animal to the ground by its neck . 'While we were waiting by the lions we saw an injured wildebeest limping towards the lions, unaware of their presence. 'Both the lions crouched down, ready to charge, while the wildebeest kept coming towards them. 'When the wildebeest was within striking distance, one of the lions pounced on the hapless wildebeest. The lion wraps his sharp claws around the wildebeest's horns and neck, with the victim trying to escape from his clutches . The lion continues to grip the wildebeest's neck, who is unable to break free and 60 seconds after the battle begins, the wildebeest is killed . Mr Singh says that for 20 seconds the wildebeest tried to break free from the lion but as he was unable to escape from his grip, he gave up . The battle lasts just 60 seconds with the injured wildebeest eventually giving up trying to break free and becoming a victim of the lion . 'The lion delivered one blow from his powerful front paw and before the wildebeest could recover, the lion grabbed the wildebeest by the neck and it was all over. 'In less than two seconds the lion had a death grip on the wildebeests neck and was pulling the prey to the ground.

"The former Chicago family home of gangster Al Capone where he was living when became one of the richest gangsters in history has been put on sale for $225,000. The six-bedroom house was where the crime boss lived when he moved from New York and established himself in Chicago in 1923. The criminal was sent to Illinois to run the infamous Four Deuces club which offered gambling, alcohol and prostitution in prohibition era America. Scroll down for video . The six-bedroom home in Chicago was once the home of Al Capone and is on sale for $225,000 . This double sink could have been in the house when it was owned by Al Capone in the 1920s . This front room is where the wake of Capone's brother Frank was held after his murder in 1924 . According to the real estate listing: 'This was Al Capone's Chicago home. Wow, there are three bedrooms on each floor.' The listing states that the first floor was reconditioned in 2008 and a new kitchen was installed. There is even a Jacuzzi in one of the two bathrooms. The second floor comes equipped with hardwood floors and there is a garage which will fit two cars. However, any crime fans looking to visit the house 'must show proof of funds before showing'. The Chicago Tribune reports Capone purchased the Chicago home for $5,500 as he worked as a bouncer in a brothel before he became Prohibition-era America's most infamous gangster . Capone buys 7244 Prairie Avenue in 1923 and moves in his wife, son, mother as well as his brother and sisters. The house is located in the Greater Grand Crossing area in south Chicago. His brother Frank is waked in the front room of the house after he was shot and killed by the Chicago Police Department in April 1924 while trying to intimidate people trying to vote. A  car sits outside Al Capone's house on 7244 Prairie Avenue which he bought for $5,500 . Capone purchased the Chicago home for $5,500 as he worked as a bouncer in a brothel before he became Prohibition-era America's most infamous gangster who was eventually prosecuted for tax evasion . When he moved to Chicago, Capone took over the running of the Four Deuces club where it is believed that people were tortured in basement. In the late 1920s Capone moved to Florida after a failed attempt on his life, although members of his family continued to live in the house. His career as a gangster ended when he was jailed for 11 years on October 24, 1931 for tax evasion. Authorities were unable to convict him for any of the numerous gangland murders, racketeering and prostitution offences he was suspected of. He was released from Alcatraz prison in 1939 and died in 1947. At the height of his powers, Capone's criminal enterprises were earning an estimated $100 million a year. According to recent estimates, in today's money the man who was the son of penniless Italian immigrants would have been a billionaire at the time of his death. According to the real estate agents the kitchen was refurbished in in 2008 . The property in the Greater Grand Crossing area in south Chicago features six bedrooms . As befitting the former home of a gangster, there is plenty of security at the front door of the house . The home has a rather large basement area although it is believed Capone only tortured people at his club . The property features a stand-alone garage which was used by Capone to make a quick getaway . According to the real estate agents, anyone looking to view the house must provide proof of funds .

"Britain is refusing to screen for Ebola victims at its borders – despite the U.S. saying it will introduce the safeguards this weekend. The UK receives more air passengers from the affected West African countries than any other nation, but health officials here say the screening – a simple temperature test and questionnaire – is unnecessary. As Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the Ebola outbreak a 'serious global health emergency', Barack Obama ordered his officials to screen travellers at five major airports. People across the world are now testing positive for the deadly virus and yesterday Thomas Eric Duncan died in a Texas hospital from the disease. A nurse in Spain who treated two Ebola patients at a Madrid hospital is in quarantine and this morning it was revealed that a 57-year-old Australian woman is being tested after showing symptoms. She had recently returned to Queensland from Sierra Leone and fell ill after a week of being back in her native country. The Dallas County sheriff's deputy, Sgt Michael Monnig, has also been hospitalised over fears he may have contracted the virus after attending the home of Mr Duncan a week ago. Scroll down for video . Fears: Missouri doctor Gil Mobley checks in to board a plane in full protection gear last week at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport in Georgia, protesting what he called mismanagement of the crisis by authorities . As Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) called the Ebola outbreak a 'serious global health emergency', U.S. President Barack Obama (right, both yesterday) ordered his officials to screen travellers at five major airports . It is feared Spanish nurse Teresa Romero, who became the first person to contract Ebola outside West Africa, may have caught the deadly virus after touching her face with an infected glove. Her husband has also been placed in quarantine, while her dog Excalibur was put down overnight amid fears the animal could spread the disease. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said Britain should follow in the footsteps of the U.S and start airport screening. 'We need to put in screening at our borders,' he said. 'We don't want to deal with this after the event.' But defence secretary Michael Fallon told  BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: 'We take advice from the WHO that screening is best done on exit from these countries. 'We are taking all the precautions and GPs are ready to deal with symptoms and deal with it directly.’ The row erupted as: . People outside Roberts International Airport as they leave Liberia, with fear of the virus spreading in   Monrovia . Screening at border points, which was first used during the Chinese SARS outbreak in 2002, involves a simple temperature test, sometimes accompanied by a health questionnaire. A thermal scanner is pointed at the passenger's forehead to detect an elevated fever. 'We don't want to deal with this after the event': Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said Britain must 'put in screening at our borders' If the temperature is above normal, the passenger would be questioned about their movements and medical history, and taken for further tests. Last night a No 10 source said Downing Street believed other actions were more effective than screening, but added that it had not been completely ruled out. 'The US are doing this, and we will want to look at how it is implemented and how effective it is,' the source said. 'We are not convinced it is effective, but we are staying flexible.' US officials said screening ebola would start at five major airports – New York's John F Kennedy, Newark in New Jersey, Washington Dulles in the US capital, O'Hare in Chicago and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta – as early as this weekend. Passengers arriving from affected countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be given questionnaires and have their temperatures taken. Professor Peter Piot, who was part of the team that identified Ebola in 1976, said he was not concerned about a mass outbreak of the killer disease here, but we should be ready for isolated cases amongst those who have travelled to west Africa to help in the outbreak. Prof Piot, a director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he never believed an Ebola outbreak could have become so deadly. He told BBC Breakfast: 'Let's not forget that in the 38 years since 1976 there have only been about 1,500 people who died from Ebola, less than 40 a year. 'So it wasn't really a big issue, a big public health problem, but here it got completely out of control in the first place because we never knew and imagined it could pop up in west Africa. The response was very slow so it got out of control before the current measures were put in place. It makes it much more difficult.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The disease is an unprecedented threat that knows no borders. We now need the wider international community to step up to the plate. 'We all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe.' Britain has the busiest air hubs in the world, receiving more passengers than any other nation from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Previous case: Screening at border points was first used during the Chinese SARS outbreak in 2002. Here, flight attendants from Qatar Airways wear masks at Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta Airport in Indonesia in April 2003 . Although all direct flights between London and the three countries have been suspended, more than 6,000 people make the journey each week, changing in Brussels, Paris or Nigeria en route to Heathrow or Gatwick. The US, in comparison, sees between 3,000 and 6,000 passengers a week from the region. Mr Hunt last night admitted the scale of the crisis was almost unprecedented. 'This is clearly one of the most serious global health emergencies of recent years – we are taking it incredibly seriously,' he said. 'Our first priority as the Government is to make sure the British people are safe. It is now entirely possible that someone with ebola will come to the UK either by one route or another.' But Public Health England reiterated its reluctance to put screening measures into place. A spokesman said: 'There are no plans to introduce entry screening for ebola in the UK. 'This would require the UK to screen every returning traveller, as people could return to the UK from an affected country through any port of entry. This would be huge numbers of low-risk people.' Single location: The UK has only one high-level isolation ward equipped to deal with ebola – at the Royal Free Hospital in North London (pictured in August) Mr Vaz said more urgent action was needed. 'The best way to be safe is to make sure we put in preventative measures now,' he said. 'To hang on and not do this does not help the public feel there is confidence in the system. 'We don't want to deal with this after the event just because we have the best health service in the world. We don't want to test it to see if it can cope with ebola.' It emerged last night that every major hospital in England has been put on high alert over the crisis. City hospitals, specialist centres and intensive care units have been told to prepare for an influx of patients infected with the disease. 'Any hospital that has an infectious diseases unit or is able to isolate a patient is gearing up for this,' an NHS England source told the Daily Mail. The UK has only one high-level isolation ward equipped to deal with ebola – at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. Three other hospitals, in Sheffield, Newcastle and Liverpool, have been identified as possible ebola 'surge' centres if there was a large outbreak.","UK gets more air passengers from affected countries than anywhere else .

"French president Francois Hollande has opened-up about his troubled love life, speaking of his 'ordeals and pain', following the publication of a book by his former girlfriend that has further dented his sinking reputation. At a press conference yesterday, Mr Hollande reluctantly, and briefly, responded to questions about the bestselling book by journalist Valérie Trierweiler. The book portrayed the president as a power-crazy hypocrite, who pretends to dislike the rich, but in fact loathes the poor. It was published after Mr Hollande and Ms Trierweiler broke-up following revelations he had a liaison with actress Julie Gavet. French President Francois Hollande, seen here earlier this month, has finally addressed 'my ordeals and pain' over accusations made against him by his spurned lover Valérie Trierweiler in a book . When asked about the book, The Telegraph reports that Mr Hollande said: 'I have already expressed myself on this . subject and I have already said what I felt about my ordeals and pain. I . will give you no further response.' The book's accusations, hugely damaging to a socialist, came as Mr Hollande's approval ratings sat at a record low 13 per cent and as employment rates continue to rise, and the economy remained stagnant. While vowing to see out his term in office which ends in 2017, Mr Hollande acknowledged France was 'asking questions about its future in a climate of deep distrust'. He said voters should reserve their judgement about his performance until the end of his term, saying, although his policies hadn't prompted a quick recovery, 'today we have all the conditions to succeed'. Ms Trierweiler wrote a bestselling book about Mr Hollande after they split-up following his liaison with actress Julie Gavet, where she portrayed him as a power crazed hypocrite . He said his government could rise to the challenge of improving France's economy, slashing debts and reducing unemployment. While dismissing further questions about Ms Trierweiler's book, Mr Hollande spoke widely about a wide range of issues including Iraq, the Ebola crisis, Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr Hollande dismissed rumours of a rivalry with pro-business prime minister, Manuel Valls, who he appointed saying: 'I am not a candidate, I am president.

"Rev Nathan Ntege greets the congregation outside St Jude's in Thornton Heath following the collapse of the trial . Only a few days ago, he was in the dock in a Crown Court trial, facing the prospect of years in jail for allegedly overseeing a ‘conveyor belt’ of fake weddings. But yesterday the Rev Nathan Ntege, 54, was back in the pulpit at his Church of England parish and smiling broadly. He was even blessed in front of the congregation by his bishop, despite being accused of running Britain’s biggest bogus marriage racket in a £1million trial that collapsed last week. The Ugandan vicar said little about his legal difficulties yesterday, except to inform the parishioners that after three years of being suspended from work, he and his wife Elizabeth, 49, and four children are to take a month-long holiday – to Uganda. Given that he was granted asylum in Britain after complaining of persecution in his homeland, it is a surprising destination. Yet no more surprising than his triumphant return to his South London church. Mr Ntege was accused of herding almost 500 couples up the aisle in just 15 months in a bid to make money for himself and give numerous Africans the right to stay in the country. But the case was suddenly ‘stayed’ last Wednesday when the judge accused UK Border Agency staff involved in the prosecution of lying and concealing key evidence. Numerous questions still remain over the vicar, however. Weddings at St Jude’s in Thornton Heath rocketed from six a year to up to nine a day after he took over. Brides and grooms were often virtual strangers to each other, with ill-fitting wedding dresses being shared and swapped in the lavatories. He had also been accused of siphoning off £70,000 in wedding fees to himself, and back to Uganda, rather than to his diocese. And the Daily Mail has learnt that he arrived in London in 1996 after ‘abandoning’ his Church of Uganda flock in the capital Kampala, and that his Ugandan bishop did not believe he deserved asylum in Britain. None of these tough questions was answered yesterday. Instead, as 100 parishioners sat in the church, Bishop of Croydon Jonathan Clark delivered a service full of praise for Mr Ntege – as the controversial vicar stood smiling beside him, clad in clerical robes. Jonathan Clark, Bishop of Croydon, (left) welcomed the vicar back to the pulpit following the collapse of the Crown Court trial due to doubts cast over police evidence . The bishop said he wanted to ‘commend Nathan and his family to your prayers and love’, and added: ‘Just as in these last few years of difficult times you have continued to worship God and to serve him, through this next period of transition I ask if you will continue to focus not on whatever happened or didn’t happen in court, not on the UK Border Agency, not on other people in the church or in your community, but to focus on God and God’s love. Look forward, not back, set aside recrimination and blame.’ He then complied with a request from Mr Ntege and his family for a blessing – during which they knelt in front of him. And the bishop clarified that he did not need to formally restore Mr Ntege to his post, saying that it happened automatically when the court case collapsed. Outside the church, Bishop Clark refused to say whether he had any concerns about the explosion in weddings under Mr Ntege, or about the claims that £70,000 of funds due to the diocese had gone missing. The congregation of St Jude's in Thornton Heath, south London (pictured), were pleased to see Rev Ntege return . Speaking in the service, Mr Ntege said: ‘I want to thank you brothers and sisters for praying for us. Thank you for your support. I’m not doing any interviews. God bless you.’ Approached outside and at the huge three-storey Victorian vicarage he shares with his family – where they remained throughout his three-year suspension on full pay – Mr Ntege refused to answer any further questions. But some of the vicar’s parishioners are standing behind him. Social worker Richard Mukasa, 35, originally from Uganda like many of the congregation, said he used to live close to the church – and despite moving to Birmingham had returned for yesterday’s service. Mr Mukasa said: ‘Before the Rev Ntege came here, this church was dead. When they talk about the number of weddings, why don’t they talk about the number of funerals and baptisms? 'They went up as well. What is the point of people coming to church when they are cohabiting, when they are fornicating? The church is there to wed people.’","Rev Nathan Ntege was accused of carrying out hordes of bogus weddings .

"France is preparing laws that will jail people for encouraging binge drinking on the internet or selling products which make drunkenness look fun. Although the French are renowned for their laissez-faire attitude to alcohol, the new laws tabled yesterday will crack down on those who incite people to binge drink on the internet, as well as those selling t-shirts, mobile phone covers and other gimmicky products which portray it as fun. Marisol Touraine, the French Health Minister, said: 'We have to put a stop to drunkenness that does such damage to young people.' Alcohol-related admissions at French hospitals increased sharply last year and health experts have warned binge drinking is a growing problem in the country . Touraine said she wanted to target  'games or objects that glorify the excessive consumption of alcohol', such as t-shirts or mobile phone covers with amusing scenes of drunkenness. She went to add the draft legislation also aimed to prevent 'inciting people to drink on the Internet.' The punishment for 'directly provoking a minor to excessive consumption of alcohol' will be a year in jail and a fine of £12,000 (€15,000). And anyone who incites someone else to 'drink until drunk' will be liable to six months in prison and a fine of £6,000 (€7,500). Last year France saw short term hospital admissions for binge drinking symptoms increase by a staggering 80 per cent. Despite being one of the world's key producers of wine and spirits, the French are often perceived to have a healthy attitude towards alcohol with most drinking done at mealtimes and rarely to excess. Last year Professor Michel Reynaud, an addiction specialist in Paris, co-authored a report into alcohol-related hospital admissions in France. The laws will crack down on encouragement of binge drinking, and in particular the encouragement of minors. Pictured is a vineyard in the wine producing region of Champagne . He said young French women were turning more and more to binge drinking in order to show off to their friends. ‘It is particularly worrying that large numbers of young girls see getting drunk as a form of glory. ‘This is a health emergency. We have no longer government money to cope with this problem. When one considers the rising scale of it it is hard to see how it can be stopped.’ According to the French Society for Alcohol abuse, hospital admissions for drink related diseases , particularly among young people, are now twice as numerous as those for common complains like diabetes or cardio vascular disease.","French laws which will jail those encouraging binge drinking on the internet .

"A man allegedly hurled an innocent Chihuahua at a glass Starbucks window in Texas on Tuesday night. Larry McHale was arrested outside of a Starbucks on animal cruelty charges after customers say they saw him nearly kill the Chihuahua at 9:30 p.m. It's unknown as to whether the poor dog belonged to him or not but animal rescue workers have promised to find the dog, now named Starbucks, a loving home. Animal Cruelty: Larry McHale was arrested for animal cruelty after he allegedly threw an innocent dog against a window of the Starbucks in Texas where he's been banned for three months . Nearly died: The dog suffers from a broken back and legs and will need plates and pins to heal the wounds . 'It was so loud, the window sounded like it was going to break,' said Starbucks manager Jasmine Hyder to WTSP. 'He's like, you don't care about humans. You only care about a dog,'she recounted. Hyder said that McHale has been banned from that Starbucks location for three months. It's not specified as to why Hyder threw the innocent pup at the window but Hyder says she thinks McHale has anger issues. 'He harasses customers every time. He comes in and starts chaos,' said Hyder. Loving home: Animal rescue workers have made it their goal to find the Chihuahua, now named Starbucks, a loving new home free of abusive people . Banned: Larry McHale was barred from this Houston Starbucks for three months before the incident occurred . 'It's an innocent dog, and you sabotaged the dog's life for no reason,' added Hyder.

"A pregnant woman sentenced to jail time for a DUI conviction involving the death of her friend will be allowed to stay out of prison until the birth of her baby. Sarah Courtney, 34, from Orrington, Maine, was sentenced to ten years in prison after pleading no contest to manslaughter and aggravated criminal operating under the influence of intoxicants. She was driving her SUV in Hampden last year when she missed a curve and crashed the vehicle. Her friend Sarah Eason, 28, was sitting in the passenger seat and died as a result of the crash. Sarah Courtney, 34, from Orrington, Maine, was sentenced to ten years in prison after pleading no contest to manslaughter and aggravated criminal operating under the influence of intoxicants . According to prosecutors, Courtney, who is now eight months pregnant, was nearly twice over the legal alcohol limit at the time, Bangor Daily News reported. She also was driving at 57mph in a 45mph zone. The women had been visiting bars in Bangor and Brewer just before the crash. Courtney was sentenced to ten years in prison, with all but two and a half suspended, followed by four years probation for manslaughter. But she will not have to enter prison until March 1 on account of the fact she is expected to give birth to a baby girl next month. Courtney's due date is November 22 but her daughter is expected to be delivered earlier due to gestational diabetes. She remains free on $2,000 bail. The prosecution said that although they thought the plea agreement was fair, he opposed a stay longer than 42 days, the maternity leave granted to female members of the military. Mary-Lynne Eason of Brewer, the victim's mother, told the judge that 'since the crash, my life has become a nightmare from which I will never wake up'. According to prosecutors, Courtney, who is now eight months pregnant, was nearly twice over the legal alcohol limit at the time of the crash. She is expected to give birth next month and will enter prison in March . She said that because of her daughter's death she could no longer work and was struggling emotionally and economically. The mother added that Courtney's 'continued refusal to accept responsibility reveals a lot about her character' and urged the judge to impose 'a longer sentence to send a stronger message to the community so no other mother has to stand here'. Just before being sentenced, Courtney apologized to her friend's family. 'My sorrow and remorse is overwhelming,' she said. In her obituary, published in April 2013 in the Bangor Daily News, Sarah Eason was described as loved and as someone who accepted people without judgment.

"The maker of hipster-favorite PBR beer is being sold to a Russian beverage company. Pabst Blue Ribbon — famous for its blue-collar appeal and cheap price — will soon be owned Oasis Beverages, a beer and soda company based in Moscow and operating in Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine. The company also brews Colt 45, Old Milwaukee and Schlitz. 'Pabst Blue Ribbon is the quintessential American brand — it represents individualism, egalitarianism, and freedom of expression — all the things that make this country great,' said Eugene Kashper, of Oasis Beverages, who will serve as the new CEO of Pabst. Pabst Blue Ribbon, famous for its hipster-favorite PBR beer, is being sold to Russian brewer Oasis Beverages . 'We intend to invest meaningfully in the organization, to continue strong marketing support for PBC's unique brands, and to drive new product innovations and renovations, such as the recent launch of Ballantine IPA.' Pabst sold a whopping 90 millions gallons of PBR in 2013, nearly 200 percent more than just 10 years earlier, the Huffington Post reported. Ex-Pabst owner C. Dean Metropoulous had been seeking a new owner for his iconic brand since March, when it was rumored that he was considering taking the company public. Back then, the brewery was expected to raise between $500 million and $1 billion, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Although a final price tag was not disclosed, insiders say the sale values Pabst between  $700 million and $750 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. Pabst Brewing, now based in Los Angeles, traces its roots back to 1844 in Milwaukee. Since purchasing it in 2010, Metropoulos has enlisted comedian Will Ferrell to market the company's beers. Oasis is buying Pabst with TSG, an investment firm known for its work with consumer products companies. TSG Consumer Partners will take a minority stake in Pabst. Pabst Blue Ribbon's historic brewery in Milwaukee is now a tourist destination.

"Planning a weekend break? If so, the chances are you have already wildly underestimated how much your trip will cost. In fact, a new survey has revealed that British tourists overspend on European city breaks by more than double what they had initially planned. According to travel search site Skyscanner, Britons typically budget 65 per cent less than the total spend they are likely to need for a weekend break in Europe. But in some cases such as travelling to Paris or Amsterdam, they blow their budgets by more than double what they had planned. The study looked at the total cost for a two night break for two people, staying in a four-star hotel in ten of Europe's top holiday cities. The survey found that total costs, including flights, ranged from £500 for a trip to Prague to over £900 for a weekend in Paris. The average cost of a city break was found to be around £700 per couple. Alarmingly Brits perceived the cost of a trip to Prague to be around £380, and the price of a trip to Paris £460. Brits are also confused as to which cities offer the best value for money, believing Amsterdam to be the cheapest, when in fact the study found it was the third most expensive option. The survey revealed that the total cost was around £400 more than Brits expected. The study also found that Milan and Rome were perceived to be the most expensive, when in reality they are the third and fourth cheapest cities in the study. The new guide from Skyscanner has now calculated the total cost for two people staying in each of the top ten cities, Amsterdam, Prague, Istanbul, London, Munich, Barcelona, Vienna, Paris, Milan, and Rome. It also breaks down the cost for each element of the trip including flights, accommodation in a four-star city centre hotel with breakfast, entrance to a top tourist attraction, sightseeing bus tour, dinner and beer. The breakdown costs for each city highlights that a cheap flight does not necessarily equal a cheap break. In some cases, such as Istanbul, taking a slightly more expensive flight is still worth it as the other costs when you get there are so much cheaper. While Prague offers the cheapest beer, with an average cost of £1.14 a bottle, Paris was the most expensive, costing on average £6.03 a bottle. Skyscanner's Mary Porter said: 'As our guide shows, a cheap flight does not necessarily guarantee a great value city break – two return flights can be under 30 percent of the total cost, as is the case with Paris. 'It's therefore important to consider all your city break costs and we hope that this guide provides clarity for travellers so that planning and budgeting for a weekend is as easy as possible.'","Brits typically budget 65% less for two-night weekend break in Europe .

The NRL superstar is set to make the switch to the American football, although he has not signed a contract yet . The legendary fullback choked up and dabbed his face with a handkerchief as he said his aim had only ever been to buy his mother a house, something he has since achieved. Despite rumours otherwise, Hayne has not signed a contract with an NFL side. 'I’m always telling people to chase their dreams and follow their hearts, if I don’t live by that I’m not being honest with myself,' said Hayne, who has played for the Eels since he was 13.

For the past 24 months I’ve been thinking about having a crack in the NFL, and over the last 12 months I’ve been seriously considering it. Today I can officially announce that I will be heading to the United States to pursue an opportunity to play American Football. I will be withdrawing from the Kangaroos Four Nations side immediately, and accepting a conditional release from the Eels to make the move overseas. The reason I didn’t make this decision any earlier was because of the part I played in getting Brad to the club and the way we finished the season. I felt I owed the Club one more year and I gave it everything I could. It’s always been a dream of mine to play in the NFL, and at my age, this is my one and only chance at having a crack at playing there. I’m excited about the potential opportunities that lie ahead. I’ve known the deadline has been looming for me to make this call, and I believe the right time is now. I’m so passionate about the challenge that lies ahead for me, not only as an athlete but more so as a person. It’s the hardest decision I have ever had to make in my life. I’m leaving my teammates, friends, and most importantly my family; but for me to grow as an athlete and a person I feel this is the right step to take. It hasn’t been an easy decision for me to leave the Eels, the club’s been my home and family since I was 13, and I’ve always been proud to pull on the Blue and Gold jersey with my teammates. The hardest thing about leaving the club is there’s stability for the first time in a long time, but I know where my heart lies and I’m following that. I’m always telling people to chase their dreams and follow their hearts, if I don’t live by that I’m not being honest with myself. I'm leaving knowing that I have signed a ‘lifetime agreement’ with the Eels, so if I return to the NRL, it will be to Parramatta. I'm grateful to all of you for the support you've shown me at this club, thank you. Source: Parramatta Eels . One of many tweets Hayne has written about American football recently .

"For large chunks of a Champions League game that Manchester City pretty much had to win, this place was a ghost town. These should be special times, watching the champions at the Etihad and getting behind their team in the elite level of European football. At times against CSKA Moscow, the atmosphere here was seriously eerie. It is not just City because other stadiums are affected, too. The loudest noise at the Etihad on Wednesday came in the form of pre-match fireworks on Bonfire Night . Last weekend Jose Mourinho had a pop at Chelsea fans because he felt that complacency had set in after their impressive start to the season on all fronts. Here, in a Champions League group game, it felt like the the energy is being sucked out of one of the best stadiums in football. City need to revisit the past, to bring back the days when the fans in the Kippax Stand or Platt Lane End were some of the most passionate in the country. For large chunks of this Group E fixture - a game City really needed to win - this place was felt deserted. Without any away supporters, banned because CSKA Moscow were found guilty of racial abuse last season, the Etihad barely got above a murmur. To their credit, a band of City supporters in the lower their of the East Stand did their bit, but this club needs more. Much more. You would have thought that the two-for-the-price-of-one offer on tickets would caused a bit more of a stir, but it didn’t make the blind bit of difference. In the end, sadly, it wasn’t even a sell-out. The atmosphere at Maine Road was special, one of the best in the country... but the Etihad feels sterile . Some CSKA Moscow fans made their way into the ground despite being banned for the match . The team needs to play their part because they pass for the sake of passing at times. Bayern Munich, when they were coached by Louis van Gaal, got rid of him for that reason. Supporters want to see drive, passion and enthusiasm, to be on the edge of their seats when Yaya Toure, Jesus Navas or Sergio Aguero are on the ball . Instead Manuel Pellegrini’s team is patient for the sake of being patient. Perhaps Jose Mourinho, who criticised Chelsea supporters for their failure to get behind the team against QPR at Stamford Bridge last week, went too far. The fans react to the football in front of them and it is hard to get going when City are so patient in possession. These are some of the biggest games in City’s history and the club must learn to savour them and create those crackling atmospheres that we associate English football with. It was sterile here, but it isn’t just City. The game has changed so much that supporters are being made to wait for what feels like hours on end at times before their teams gets the ball in the box. Man City conceded an early goal against CSKA Moscow, which didn't help the atmosphere on the night . The performance from the City team affects the way the fans behave, and there was nothing to cheer about . That is the modern a game, a disturbing trend that is affecting football fans who grew up with terrace anthems. Even before kick-off, when they traditionally belt out Blue Moon, it was forced and without feeling. They need to believe a bit more here. The Champions League trophy is on City’s radar after all the expenditure over the past few years under Sheikh Mansour and they have to learn to love it. These group games, the six-match slog before Christmas, still throw up some brilliant matches before the draw for the last 16. By the end of Tuesday night's game against Arsenal, it felt like Anderlecht fans owned the Emirates . At the Emirates on Tuesday evening, Anderlecht’s 3,000 travelling fans crackled into life the moment they pulled a goal back against Arsene Wenger’s team. By the end it felt like they owned the place. Perhaps it is time to investigate a ‘singing section’, where the fanatics can congregate on matchday to get behind their team from the stands. In a few months’ time this stadium will have another tier attached to the lower tier of the South Stand. Maybe it is time to make this the City end. Without it, this place will soon lose its soul.","At times during the 2-1 defeat, the atmosphere at the Etihad was eerie .
Watching your team play in the Champions League should be special .
It feels like the energy is being sucked out... they couldn't even sell out .
It isn't a problem exclusive to Manchester City, it is the same everywhere ."
"Bust enhancers, bust reducers, corsets, and waist control garments - it appears that women have tried every trick in the book, a sometimes very painful book, in their quest for the 'glorious figure of youth.' A set of rare historical documents reveal the ever changing tactics and technology used by British women to disguise or shift their bumps and curves over the past 80 years. They tell the story, often in painful detail, of how underclothing was deployed across the decades to help women appear trimmer. Vintage: An old catalogue from 1950 released by JD Williams reveals exactly what lengths women went to in their quest for the 'glorious figure of youth' Corsets, girdles, and semi-rigid underwear, which relied upon sturdy straps rather than more comfortable elastic are all described in the archive, just released by JD Williams, one Britain’s oldest retailers. The archive goes on to show all of the most popular shapewear garments sold by  for the next fourteen decades. Tricks of the trade: As these catalogues reveal, women used bust enhancers, bust reducers, corsets, and waist control garments to trim their figures . Sucked in: Women were seemingly big fans of girdles - these firm controls from a 1970s catalogue promised to flatten tummies for a sleeker, slimmer silhouette . The archive shows how the lingerie industry was in the forefront of using cutting edge, newly discovered, man-made materials, deploying them in designs long before the rest of the market realised their potential. It shows that subtle but incremental changes show the transformation to today’s shapewear, which is now developed using highly technical, computer designed architecture. Components are now engineered to combat specific stresses and stretches, spreading the load across the entire garment for an 'incredible smooth often seamless result,' according to JD Williams. Modern technology is now geared towards strength and comfort focussing on fabric advances such as powermesh and stretch lace, as well as ranges such as a ‘No VPL’ knicker that uses bonded silicone at the leg seam to ensure underwear is not visible through clothing. New technology: The archive catalogue from 1937 shows how the lingerie industry was in the forefront of using cutting edge, newly discovered, man-made materials . Promises: JD Williams say they deployed all sorts of high-tech fabrics in their designs long before the rest of the market realised their potential (catalogue from 1950) JD Williams has released the rare archive, complete with illustrations, to coincide with Body Confidence Week. The retailer said it wants emphasise the fact that even apparently slender celebrities such as Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow use shape wear to boost their confidence at important events. It added that over 60 per cent of British women are dealing with body image issues, and sales of shapewear at JD Williams up 40 per cent in 2014. A spokesperson said: 'We often take the smooth, comfortable, sophistication of today’s modern shapewear for granted. 'However this archive shows the sacrifices that women have made in the past so that today’s generation can put their most natural looking, smoothest silhouette forward.'

"LeBron James returned to the Cleveland hardwood, playing the first half of a preseason game against the Maccabi Tel Aviv that the Cavaliers went on to win handily. James sunk his first shot back in a Cavaliers jersey, stepping up for a long-range three pointer to open the scoring for Cleveland. The four-time MVP scored 12 in the first half, then watched from the bench icing his knees and back while the Cavaliers went on to beat the visiting team from Tel Aviv. Battle: Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James pulls a loose ball from Maccabi Tel Aviv's Jeremy Pargo, himself a former Cavalier . James has been nursing an 'iffy' back in the run-up to the season, sitting out practice Friday and looking to avoid unnecessarily aggravating his back problems. The Cavaliers showed they had more firepower in their arsenal, going 28-16 against Maccabi with LeBron out of the game. New York Times reporting on the game suggested though fans were happy their star was back, the realism of LeBron needing Cleveland less than Cleveland needed him had set in. Instead, Cleveland sports fans seemed more excited that night to watch the Cleveland Browns pull off a come-from-behind victory against the Titans in Tennessee. The post-game attention on James took a negative turn, as all Twitter wanted to talk about was his hair, which unlike LeBron has not returned. 'Lebron's hairline ebbs and rises like the tides,' said user Tweetgood Mac, referencing photos of James in the off-season with a fuller head of hair. Scalped: James's stock took a beating on Twitter, where users called out how the four-time MVP's headband has been inching back recently to cover his hairline . Gone curl: Twitter users called out James, who had shot a sneaker commercial where it looked like his hair had returned . Dealt: Some users joked about LeBron's hairline while others made genuine pleas for James to finally give up the ghost and go bald . Untouchable: James takes a shot over Yogev Ohanyon of Maccabi Tel Aviv as the Cavaliers went on to rout what is considered to be Europe's top team . Sitting out: James watches from the bench in the first quarter, later sitting out the second half with ice on his back and knees . Reporters who had traveled from Israel to see how well Maccabi stacked up against American talent, swarmed the recently returned Cavalier, pressing him about playing under his new coach. 'You guys know the new coach more than I do,' James said. 'I've only been with him for a couple weeks.' The night was also memorable for Cavaliers head coach David Blatt, who was playing against the team he had coached for six seasons back in the Euroleague. 'Personally this is a bit of an emotional game for me,' said Blatt. 'I'm playing against the team from which I came and the place from whence I came. Obviously there's some mixed emotions there.' James now has until Saturday to rest up before confronting his former Miami Heat in a preseason game that's being held in Rio de Janeiro as part of the NBA's Global Games series. Cleveland plays their season opener at home against the New York Knicks October 30.","The four-time MVP scored 12 in the first half of an exhibition game against Maccabi Tel Aviv, then rested his 'iffy' back in the second half .

"David Christian was teaching at a local Australian university when he came up with a revolutionary new way to teach history that has spread like wildfire through classrooms across the world. The ambitious Russian and Soviet history teacher, from Macquarie University in Sydney's north-west, began teaching a non-linear history of humanity, titled the Big History Project, that was soon in such high demand that it took him overseas and won over the curiosity of former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. 'I always had this feeling that in a world with nuclear weapons, and in which many of the problems are global rather than local, we need to not be teaching the history of Russians or Australians or Americans, but the history of humanity - and we seem not to do that,' Mr Christian told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . David Christian (left) began teaching the Big History course at Macquarie University in Sydney's north-west before it caught the attention of former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates (right) 'I realised that to do that you would have to go back to the Paleolithic verse, and then I thought to do that you really have to look at how humans evolved and to do that you have to talk about biology and to do that properly you'd have to talk about geology – how was this planet formed and why did life form and evolve on this planet. 'So that pushed me back and back and back until eventually I found myself thinking ""I wonder if you could teach a sort of history course that did the whole damn thing"".' Mr Christian proposed the idea to his colleagues at Macquarie University and found a number of enthusiastic lecturers who were interested in helping him roll-out the class. After years of practice they have developed a coherent course that Mr Christian describes as teaching 'the history of everything'. The course teaches 'the history of humanity' in a non-linear format by exploring elements of biology, geology and history. It discusses the universe, the big bang, the origins of life, how humanity was influenced by religion and agriculture, and even the current climate . From the Big Bang, our solar system and the science behind how life developed, right through to how aspects of human life were influenced by religion and agriculture, and then of course the current climate and  human consumption – The Big History Project is a lesson on how everything came to be and where it could possibly take us. 'Eventually I realised that this is something that all educational traditions in the past have attempted,' Mr Christian said. 'If you think of the Christian tradition or you think of Indigenous traditions – all of them contain origin stories which try to give students a complete sense of how everything fits together and I realised we don't do that in modern education and I think that's a real mistake. 'So Big History tries to do that – it tries to do what origin stories do but by using the information of modern science.' The revolutionary idea soon caught the attention of former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. Mr Christian was invited to record a series of 48 half hour lectures on the Big History for the Teaching Company while he was working at San Diego State University. 'I always had this feeling that in a world with nuclear weapons, and in which many of the problems are global rather than local, we need to not be teaching the history of Russians or Australians or Americans, but the history of humanity - and we seem not to do that,' Mr Christian said . Gates, who was working his way through the Teaching Company's catalogue, soon reached Mr Christian's lectures and was instantly won over. 'I got a phone call when I was at San Diego State University from his office and they basically said ""Mr Gates is a great fan of your work, he likes the idea of Big History"" and they said he's coming down to San Diego and he'd like to talk to you,' Mr Christian said. Bill Gates was won over by the course and spontaneously arranged a meeting with Mr Christian, saying that  he wanted to support the building of a free online website which contained a syllabus of Big History for high schools . 'What's the protocol for talking to the richest man in the world? I had no idea. But He was absolutely charming. 'I was ushered into a room and it was just him and me talking for about two hours and he's a real enthusiast. He was really enthusiastic about this and so it was just an enjoyable conversation. 'He said he would like to support the building of a free online website which contained a syllabus of Big History for high schools, so that's what we are doing.' Since their initial meeting, Gates has poured over $10 million into the Big History Project, the majority of which has been used to build the website, which is free to access by anyone, and all of its components. Some of the money has also been offered to schools to 'help buy out the teacher's time' in order to enable them to learn and prepare for the course. 'He [Gates] had some very good ideas about how we should begin the project. For example, he argued that it was best to work through individual schools rather than educational bureaucracies – let schools experiment with it so that we can really develop it before we work through the educational bureaucracies,' Mr Christian explained. In the three and a half years since the project was launched, it has grown from eight pilot classes in the US and Australia into a globally adopted method of teaching. The website and all its resources is free to access by anyone online. It educates its audience through eight different chapters that include videos, cartoons and a platform for teachers to access resources and share ideas about how to teach the course . 'There are about 100 schools in Australia which are formally doing it, but I've been told there could be as many as 500 that are using some of the material informally,' Mr Christian said. 'There are about 300 schools in the US at the moment but there are also smaller numbers of schools in the Netherlands, Scotland, Canada, about five in South Korea and one in England - maybe more. 'Eventually, our hope is that this will go international and I'd like to see it be translated into other languages.' Big History has gone global in the last three and half years. Over 100 schools in Australia and 300 in the US have taken on the course as well as a numbers of schools in the Netherlands, Scotland, Canada, South Korea and England . The only difficulties with the course, Mr Christian said, is the unfamiliarity and the fact that it doesn't easily slot into existing school curriculums. But after teaching it for 25 years, travelling the world to share his idea and even hosting a TED Talk on Big History - as well as making it a priority to receive feedback from schools, teachers and students - Mr Christian is confident that the course is not only coherent, but enjoyable for both teachers and students. 'Each year we have a lot of feedback from schools and we have revised it, so we are very confident that it actually works in the schools,' he said. 'The feedback: most of it has been very good indeed. Students I think are just very excited to be doing a course that allows them to ask very big questions and to see the connections between different disciplines.'","David Christian began teaching his experimental Big History course at Macquarie University in Sydney's north-west 25 years ago .

"American workers are taking just half of their holiday leave every year - despite only being entitled to 10 days, according to a study. And when they do finally go on holiday, 61 per cent of them continue to work while they are out of the office. With US workers failing to take advantage of their hard-earned time off, a staggering 429 million days of accrued holiday entitlement went unclaimed last year. And America's children are clearly not impressed that their parents are lagging behind those from other nations. Stupid: A young boy says the unused 429 million days of accrued holiday is the 'stupidest thing I've ever heard' MasterCard, which commissioned the study, has unveiled a new television ad featuring child actors who admonish their parents for not booking a family getaway. When informed that adults allowed 429 million days of accrued holiday to expire, a little boy says bluntly: 'That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.' The study found that the average American worker receives just 10 days of holiday per year and last year only used half of their allocated time. It doesn't appear the trend has changed in 2014 as only half of Americans have taken a holiday or are planning one this year. According to the study, the US is the only developed country in the world where it is not mandatory for employers to reward their employees with holiday pay, meaning over 28 million Americans do not receive any payment during their holidays. And most American workers are not even aware that guaranteed holiday time is common practice in other developed countries. Plea: A young girl in the advertisement reminds parents why they should take more vacation time . Travel broadens the mid: A girl urges her parents to take holidays to experience different cultures . A report by the Council Economic and Policy Research last year found that the average 16-day paid holiday given to workers by private companies in the US was below the minimum lawful holiday time required in 19 developed economies. In MasterCard's 'One More Day' advert, children present a compelling list of reasons why their parents should take more time off, citing the importance of family time and experiencing different cultures. One boy tries to bribe his parents, telling the camera: 'If you agree to travel more we'll do better in school.'","American workers are taking just half of their holiday entitlement in 2013 .

"A university is under fire for building a cage to stop homeless people sleeping on its campus. Cardiff University put metal grilles around a set of hot air vents in an alleyway to prevent down-and-outs using them to stay warm on cold winter nights. The move prompted complaints from students - but the university insists the cages are a health and safety measure to stop the homeless breathing in harmful boiler fumes including carbon monoxide. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Cardiff University, the largest in Wales with 55,000 students, sparked outrage when it installed a metal cage over heating flues which had been used by the homeless - but insisted it was a safety issue . Unhappy: A member of the security team told a student there had been complaints from staff and the public . Students complained after spotting the measure as they returned for the new academic year. One said rough sleepers had used the hot air vents last winter without causing any trouble, and a former student told MailOnline they have been used by homeless people since at least 2007. The issue was first raised in a blog by journalism student Lewis Hopkins - who said he was told by security guards there had been complaints about the rough sleepers from University staff and the public. Mr Hopkins, 20, wrote: 'They never caused any trouble, never littered nor gathered in groups. They were just content with finding a warm place to sleep at night. 'As a Cardiff University student the sight of this cage every morning makes me feel disgusted and ashamed of my own university, something I never thought I would feel. 'Surely allowing a homeless person to occasionally have a warm night’s sleep is more beneficial for their health than having them out in the bitter cold.' History: A student who blogged about the issue said homeless people were there last year with no problems . Student Lewis Hopkins wrote: 'The sight of this cage every morning makes me feel disgusted and ashamed' Fellow student Morgan Towler added: 'Surely sleeping in freezing cold and soaking wet conditions during the winter will cause more harm than the steam from the vent ever could.' Another student, who did not want to be named, said: 'It is not just a matter of caring for homeless people - we should be see to be caring for them. 'These ugly cages send out the message that we don’t give a damn about people who are less fortunate than ourselves. 'The homeless people who use them to keep warm are not doing any harm, all this stuff about dangerous fumes in nonsense.' One former student who began his degree in 2007 told MailOnline homeless people were a regular sight next to the vents throughout most of the time he studied in Cardiff. The student, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was never any more than a couple of people and I never saw them being moved on. 'Usually you'd just see someone sleeping in the corner at night or maybe the early morning. 'It did take me by surprise the first time and I think I did tend to avoid walking through there at night sometimes. Maybe that was prejudiced of me of course.' The university, whose motto is Truth, Unity and Harmony, defended the 'safety cages' and insisted they were to tackle safety concerns as part of an 'ongoing issue' involving 'two or three' homeless people. Campus: The alleyway runs alongside the university's main building (pictured) in Cardiff city centre . 'The decision to erect grilles was taken in the interests of health and safety,' a spokesman said. 'The area covered by the safety grilles are not hot air vents but boiler flue vents that can potentially produce products of combustion - diluted amounts of carbon monoxide being one of these - as part of the diluted boiler flue gases. 'These vents are considered safe in normal use due to the type of flue dilution system being used but there could potentially be an increased risk if people are sleeping right next to the grilles for very long periods.' The university could not confirm how many complaints there had been. A university spokesman said the vents could emit carbon monoxide which would be harmful over time . A spokesman for Shelter Cymru said: 'We want assurances from Cardiff University that they are in touch with agencies in the area to ensure rough sleepers are not just being moved on. 'We want to know that they are not just washing their hands of the problem. 'We need to be reassured that the university is in touch with local agencies to ensure that people sleeping rough in the area are helped. 'You can't just turn your back on people sleeping rough even if there is a genuine health and safety reason.' Richard Edwards, chief executive of the Cardiff homelessness charity Huggard, said: 'Whether it's a health and safety measure or a mechanism to move on homeless people I don't think that is the issue. 'The reality is people's parents and children and brothers and sisters will be sleeping on the streets tonight and we need more measures to stop that. 'Moving someone on just puts them on someone else's doorstep.' However, he added: 'Although I can't comment on the validity of what the university is saying, we obviously don't want to put homeless people's health at risk'. A senior figure at homelessness charity St Mungo’s Broadway, which runs schemes across the south of England, said the measure appeared to be 'outrageous' but distracted from the real issue. Outreach director Petra Salva said: 'Whilst the ""cage"" appears outrageous, the real outrage is that each year thousands of people are forced to sleep rough in the UK through lack of housing and services.' Cardiff's student union president Elliot Howells agreed with the university's judgement. 'If the relevant parties have said there's an issue over health and safety I can see that would be a relevant reason,' he said. 'I can't imagine the university would want to be held responsible for any damage caused to people. Anger: The row comes four months after metal 'spikes' were installed at a luxury block of flats to deter the homeless from sleeping there. The blunt 1.5in studs caused outrage after a photo of them was put on Twitter . 'Spikes': Critics described the studs as 'inhumane' and said rough sleepers were being treated like pigeons . 'There's probably also an issue if homeless people are sleeping there around cardboard boxes and quilts being put against these vents. 'As a students' union we don't have a position on this as it's not an issue we've ever come across, but I investigated and spoke to security when this came about yesterday and I believe them.' Cardiff University, established in 1883, is the largest in Wales with around 55,000 students. The row comes four months after outrage over a luxury housing development which installed anti-homeless 'spikes'. Hundreds of people signed an internet petition urging the 19 studs to be removed from an alcove next to the entrance of the privately-owned building in Southwark, south London. The clamour for their removal was joined by the London Mayor Boris Johnson. He said the 'spikes outside [the] Southwark housing development to deter rough sleeping are ugly, self-defeating and stupid. [The] developer should remove them as soon as possible'. Studs and railings to discourage rough sleepers have been an increasingly common sight in the doorways and ledges of buildings in Britain for more than a decade.","Metal grille installed next to heating flues in an alleyway at Cardiff University .

"A friend of notorious gangster Curtis Warren has reportedly claimed MI5 spies have planted secret microphones in his house and have trained birds to tap on his windows in an attempt to frighten him. Businessman Philip Kerr is seeking to win a High Court injunction against the intelligence agents, who he says have targeted him because he refused to co-operate with the security service. The 53-year-old says he has been subjected to a 'campaign of harassment' over the past 11 years, claiming agents have filled his houses in Wirral, Merseyside, and Thailand with hidden cameras and microphones. Scroll down for video . Claims: Philip Kerr, a friend of notorious gangster Curtis Warren (pictured) has reportedly claimed MI5 spies  planted secret microphones in his house and trained birds to tap on his windows in an attempt to frighten him . He also claims rooks were trained to fly into his window. According to the Mirror he also says in legal papers that spies have interfered with his phone, TV and radio, and is prepared to pay £500,000 to fund his legal battle. 'My case simply is that I am being unlawfully harassed by the security services and I wish this harassment to stop,' he told the newspaper. Headquarters: Mr Kerr says MI5, which has his headquarters in Millbank, London, (pictured) bugged his homes in Wirral, Merseyside and Thailand . Mr Kerr says he was approached by MI5 in 2003 when officers were investigating drugs baron Warren, who made more than £200million through his criminal empire and is the only drug trafficker to make it onto the Sunday Times Rich List. However, he refused to provide any information on Warren and other criminals, including Colin 'Smigger' Smith, Britain's so-called Cocaine King, who was shot dead in Liverpool in 2007. According to Mr Kerr, this prompted MI5 to start tracking him. Support: Mr Kerr has been given advice by former MI5 intelligence officer and whistleblower Annie Machon (pictured) His legal papers were lodged at the High Court last month, and he has hired lawyer and protection from harassment specialist Tim Lawson-Cruttenden, as well as seeking advice from ex-MI5 intelligence officer and whistleblower Annie Machon. 'Annie confirmed to me that the things I am being subjected to are exactly the kinds of things MI5 do to get into your head. It is psychological warfare,' he said. Kerr’s barrister Anthony Barraclough, said: 'A lot of it is hard to believe but when you sit down with Phil, it is incredible to hear what he has to say. This has taken his life away and had a major effect on his health.' Warren, 50, is due to be released from Belmarsh Prison in 2015 after he was jailed for 13 years in 2009 over a £1million cannabis smuggling plot in Jersey. He was previously jailed in 1997 in the Netherlands when Dutch police seized a haul of drugs and banknotes worth £125m. However, he claims to have little cash left after his bank account was frozen in 2011. His sentence was extended in 1999 after he killed a fellow prisoner in a fight and was convicted of manslaughter. Five weeks after being released he was arrested by Jersey police and accused of being the ringleader of a six-man gang who were trying to import 180kg of cannabis into the island from the Netherlands via a boat from France. MI5 said it would neither confirm nor deny the allegations in the High Court Claim.","Philip Kerr is seeking a High Court injunction against MI5 intelligence agents .

"A mother-of-two lost nine stone after being told she was too fat to have surgery on her varicose veins. Tracy Cairns, 43, had the bulging veins all over her legs and was desperate to get them removed as they were so painful and unsightly. At over 19 stone, she also suffered several other health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Scroll down for video . Tracy Cairns, 43, lost nine stone after doctors warned she was too fat to have surgery on her varicose veins. She is pictured three months after finally having the operation . Before the diet, she was over 19st and suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol . Her love of burgers, curry and huge pizzas loaded with cheese had left her with a BMI of 47 and a size 22. However it wasn't until she was told by doctors that varicose vein surgery would be too risky that she decided to lose the weight. Mrs Cairns, a full-time mother, said: 'At the time, I was probably oblivious to how big I was. 'I hid behind baggy clothes and didn't make much of an effort with myself. 'The doctor said I needed an operation as the valves in my veins didn't work properly. 'But he said I would have to lose at least two stone before they could perform the operation. 'I was shocked. How could I let myself get so big that it was too risky for me to have an operation? 'I felt a deep sense of shame.' Surgery is more risky for overweight and obese people. Research has shown that obese patients have a significantly higher risk of complications after surgery, such as heart attack, wound infection, nerve injury, and urinary tract infections. Being overweight also makes varicose veins worse as the extra weight puts more pressure on them. This means they have to work harder to send the blood back to the heart. Mrs Cairns was also suffering from severe varicose veins all over her legs and was desperate to get them removed as they were so painful and unsightly . She says it was being told she was too overweight to have surgery that finally gave her a reason to lose weight . This can put increased pressure on the valves, making them more prone to leaking. After being told the embarrassing news in July 2011, Mrs Cairns joined her local Slimming World group in Killingworth, North Tyneside. In two years she lost 9st, dropping from a size 22 to a size 10. She said: 'I realised I needed to do something to improve my health, so I joined Slimming World and started to going swimming and Zumba. 'Having the operation and getting my legs sorted was my goal. 'Instead of snacking on crisps and chocolates, I switched to fruit and yoghurts.' She also learned to cook all her favourite meals by replacing some of the ingredients with low-fat alternatives. By the time she had reached the top of the NHS waiting list, she had lost an impressive 6st. Looking back, Mrs Cairns said she felt a 'deep sense of shame' over her size. She said: 'How could I let myself get so big that it was too risky for me to have an operation?' Three months after her operation, she beared her legs for the first time while on the beach in Lanzarote on holiday. And three years on, she is now a size 10. Mrs Cairns, who is married to Ali, 41, an IT consultant, said: 'Before I would have been hiding under my tent sized clothes, but now I feel slimmer and much happier. 'I am full of energy and play with my children all the time. I cycle with the kids and even jump on their scooter and walk to the park with them. 'It's also nice being able to go shopping and being able to pick anything off the rail.

"Doomed invitation: Jaylen Fryberg allegedly invited a group of friends to lunch where he pulled out a gun and shot five of them before committing suicide . A popular student responsible for a shooting at a Washington state high school on Friday invited his victims to lunch by text message, then shot them at their table, investigators said Monday. Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said at a news conference that the five students were at a lunch table when they were shot by 15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg. Fryberg then committed suicide. Detectives are digging through reams of text messages, phone and social media records as part of an investigation that could take months, Trenary said. 'The question everybody wants is, ""Why?""'Trenary said. 'I don't know that the ""why"" is something we can provide.' Fryberg, a football player who was named a prince on the school's Homecoming court one week before the killings, was a member of a prominent Tulalip Indian Tribes family. He seemed happy although he was also upset about a girl, friends said. It appears that girl was 14-year-old victim Zoe Galasso, who had recently started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg, currently in critical condition at the hospital. The shooter's Twitter feed was recently full of vague, anguished postings, like 'It won't last ... It'll never last,' and 'I should have listened. ... You were right ... The whole time you were right.' On Friday, after texting five friends to invite them to lunch, he pulled out a handgun in the cafeteria and started shooting. Zoe died at the scene while friend Gia Soiano, 14, died at the hospital from her injuries on Sunday. Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, remains in critical condition at the hospital, along with Fryberg's two cousins, Nate Hatch, 14, and Andrew, 15. Hatch, who was shot in the jaw, is the only victim who has shown improvement. He was upgraded to satisfactory condition Monday in intensive care at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, while Andrew  remained in critical condition there. Scroll down for video . Love triangle? Fryberg's crush Zoe Galasso (right) died at the scene. He had allegedly become heartbroken when she started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg (left). Andrew  is still in critical condition at the hospital . Victim: Gia Soriano (pictured) died on Sunday from her injuries in the shooting at Marysville-Pilchuck High School . Hospitalized: Shaylee Chuculnaskit (left) and Nate Hatch (right) remain hospitalized from their injuries. Hatch is the only victim whose condition has improved in the hospital. On Monday, his condition was upgraded to satisfactory . It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew. Zoe was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire. She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack. Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead. In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students. Lukas Thorington, 14, a freshman at Marysville's other public high school who grew up with Zoe and Shaylee said they were outgoing, popular kids. He told the Seattle Times: 'Zoe was very outgoing. She was into sports. She was nice and awesome. She was fun to hang out with.' Corey Williams, 37, is friends with Zoe's mother and wanted to help, so he set up a fundraising page to raise money for the Galasso family. Donations have already exceeded $14,000. He told the paper: 'I'm pretty surprised. I put $10,000 as the goal as a pie-in-the-sky thing. I'm shocked.' A picture uploaded to Facebook shows Shaylee posing alongside the Jaylen Fryberg. The popular schoolboy who was a member of the football and wrestling team shot five people with his father's gun, before turning the gun on himself. A friend on Twitter said Jaylen was 'heartbroken' over a girl and didn't know what to do. She added that he 'wasn't a bad kid'. He had also written messages on his own Twitter page suggesting he may have been facing some troubles, such as: 'It breaks me... It actually does.'

The cups cover candles and bear the names of  Zoe Galasso, right, and Gia Soriano, left, both 14, who were killed when Jaylen R. Fryberg, 15, named on the center candle, opened fire on Friday, October 24 . After her passing on Sunday, Gia's family said her organs would be donated. 'We are devastated by this senseless tragedy,' her family said in a statement, read at a news conference by Providence Regional Medical Center's Dr. Joanne Roberts. 'Gia is our beautiful daughter, and words cannot express how much we will miss her.' Meanwhile, Nate Hatch has taken to Twitter to forgive his 'brother' Jaylen for the shooting which has left him seriously injured. On Monday he wrote: 'I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace' while in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he is being treated for a gunshot wound to his jaw. Nate also took to Facebook to update his friends saying he was 'grateful to be alive' after his condition was upgraded from serious to satisfactory. Forgiveness: Nate (pictured with gunman Jaylen Fryberg left) was his cousin and best friend. They called each other brother . Spokeswoman Susan Gregg says he's awake and breathing on his own and still in the intensive care unit. Nate and Jaylen grew up together in the Native American Tulalip tribe along with Andrew Fryberg, 15, another brother-like cousin who is in a critical condition in Harborview Medical Center following the attack. Nate's grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate started communicating with his family by writing notes as he is unable to speak. Mr Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends. He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'. Mr Hatch added: I think Nate's either getting his memory back or somebody mentioned what had happened. 'And it kind of broke his heart to hear, ""why would my brother do that to me,"" even though they're cousins. 'Why would my brother do that to me?"" Last week Nate's mother, Denise Hatch-Anderson wrote on Facebook, thanking the community for their support in the aftermath of the shooting. She wrote: 'Thank you so much from the mother of Nate Hatch... i cant [sic] thank everyone from our community for the outpouring love that has been shown [sic] to me since this tragic happened... i love everyone!!! No time for hate just love.' Mourners gather at a memorial set up outside Marysville Pilchuck high School on Monday, October 27 .

Trenary also confirmed that the .40-caliber handgun used in the shooting had been legally purchased by one of Fryberg's relatives. It remains unclear how Fryberg obtained the weapon. The Snohomish County Medical Examiner on Monday ruled Fryberg's death a suicide. There had been some question over whether he might have shot himself accidentally as a teacher tried to intervene, but Trenary said Monday that investigators confirmed there was no physical contact between the teacher and the gunman. At the memorial outside the school Monday, a group of mourners hugged each other tightly at 10:39am — the minute the shooting was reported Friday. Flowers and signs were zip-tied to a chain-link fence lined with red and white balloons reflecting the school's colors. Many referenced the victims and said they'd be missed.

"Andrew Hyams said he got off the British Airways plane because he feared for the safety of his six-year-old daughter Mollie . A father whose six-year-old daughter has a life-threatening nut allergy says his family was ‘humiliated’ and ‘bullied’ into leaving a British Airways flight after asking staff not to serve nuts. Andrew Hyams, 42, claims cabin crew refused his request  and were arrogant, snobbish and showed no empathy as he and Mollie  and his girlfriend Suzy attempted to fly from Heathrow Airport to Larnaca, Cyprus, for a holiday in August. Vowing to never fly with the airline again, Mr Hyams said he attempted to reason with staff but a customer relations manager told him their luggage was being unloaded and ‘we are BA and we do not change our service for anyone’. Mr Hyams, an account manager from London, said they had no choice but to leave the plane and book with a different airline that has previously accommodated his requests for nuts not to be served during a flight. When he arrived at Heathrow, Mr Hyams said he spoke to British Airways staff who were not familiar with the company’s policy on passengers with severe nut allergies, but told him an announcement on board the plane would be OK. He admitted he was not aware the airline serves cashews – which he described as ‘my daughter’s killer’ – with its drink service. But after boarding the flight, Mr Hyams said his family was approached by the head cabin steward, who informed him ‘there was nothing they could do’ to help. British Airways said on-board announcements cannot be provided as they are not part of its peanut policy. However, the airline has posted on Twitter in the past indicating that cabin crew can make an announcement about a nut allergy. Mr Hyams carries an EpiPen at all times in case his daughter, Mollie, who was five years old at the time of the incident, goes into anaphylactic shock. Scroll down for video . Six-year-old Mollie Hyams has a life-threatening nut allergy . BA has been criticised for refusing to make an on-board announcement about a child's allergy (file photo) BA's response to a question on Twitter from Alicia Kennedy - member of the House of Lords and Labour Councillor for Brockley - in which the airline said it would make an announcement on board a flight . He said he begged staff to change their mind but after speaking to ‘rude’ and ‘arrogant’ employees he decided to disembark and delay the holiday for his daughter’s own safety. He said one of the employees ‘berated’ them and upset his daughter and  girlfriend while discussing Mollie's ‘chances of death’ and the use of an EpiPen while flying 35,000ft in the air. His daughter, who also has a dairy allergy, still talks about the incident. ‘She still asks questions about it. She was scared after that, asking if everything contains nuts.’ As the discussion continued at the back of the plane, he said he was surrounded by four cabin crew and ‘it felt like I was being bulled and ganged up on’. Andrew Hyams was 'forced to leave' a flight along with his daughter Mollie - pictured . In an email to British Airways, he wrote: ‘Eventually I was allowed to talk and said that I understood that they could not guarantee a 100 per cent nut-free environment (no one can) but asked if they would reduce the risks by not serving the bag of nuts. I even said I would buy those passengers that minded another snack instead.’ That’s when he said he was informed that the request would not be accommodated and his bags were being removed from the plane. He said staff gave the family the option of remaining on the flight despite having no understanding of allergies, but he refused to take the risk and was further embarrassed after the family disembarked. Mr Hyams said a staff member marched him back onto the flight to collect his bags but he was ordered to sit down while staff ‘checked the area for any illegals’ and was then marched off the plane. He wrote in the letter to the airline: ‘I felt like a criminal at best and a terrorist at worst and all this in front of over 200 people, humiliating. We were then walked to arrivals to collect our bags and left with no one telling us where our bags would come out and how long it would be. 'Luckily we were sat by the belt they came out of.’ He added: ‘What we experienced once we had walked on the plane and informed the cabin crew about the nut allergy was not only unprofessional but a complete disgrace and embarrassment for British Airways.’ Mr Hyams said he was attempting to fly with BA for the first time in more than 15 years after ‘a number of bad experiences’ with staff and delays. When they flew to Cyprus with easyJet four days later, the family said staff did not serve any nuts and they made an announcement asking passengers not to open any packages containing nuts. Mr Hyams said the incident cost him around £2,500 and shortened his holiday by three days. In a statement, British Airways told MailOnline: ‘We are sorry that Mr Hyams and his family felt our crew were not sympathetic to their needs. ‘We do our best to accommodate the needs of all our customers, and our crew explained our policy and the reason for it. ‘We don’t use peanuts in our meals but we are never able to guarantee a nut-free environment on any of our flights, as allergens could remain in the air from previous flights or customers could bring their own food on board. ‘We advise customers who suffer from allergies and need to carry emergency medication to inform cabin crew and those travelling with them, or sitting next to them, but we are not able to make announcements as we can never guarantee a nut-free environment.’ Mr Hyams carries an EpiPen at all times in case his daughter, Mollie, goes into anaphylactic shock . Mr Hyams said he and his partner complained to BA but did not receive a response until three weeks later. He provided MailOnline with copies of two emails – one from a BA customer service representative and a follow-up from the office of executive chairman Keith Williams. The customer service rep informed Mr Hyams that the airline received reports from the employees involved and would not offer a full refund because it was satisfied that staff had followed existing policy. Mr Hyams said he never requested a refund. The customer service rep wrote that British Airways cannot guarantee a nut-free environment, even with an announcement, because it has no control over what other passengers bring on board, adding that requests for nut-free flights are ‘politely but firmly rejected’. Mr Hyams said he booked with a travel agent and informed British Airways by telephone that his daughter is allergic to nuts, but the customer service rep told him the computer system had no record of the conversation. Four-year-old Fae Platten (left and right with her family) suffered a severe allergic reaction after a fellow passenger ignored warnings from cabin crew and opened a bag of nuts on a Ryanair flight in August . The email from the executive chairman’s office apologised for how Mr Hyams was ‘made to feel’ and indicated that the employees involved have been offered further coaching. But the email informed him that the matter had been dealt with in an appropriate manner by the customer service department and he should no longer 'dwell further on these issues'. Mr Hyams called the email, which encouraged him to fly with BA again, a 'disgrace'. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘I understand that BA obviously have a policy for peanuts but what still winds me up is how we were treated by the staff and the total disregard for the safety of their passengers.’ Less than a week before the incident in August, a girl aged four suffered a life-threatening allergy attack on a Ryanair flight after a passenger ignored staff’s repeated warnings not to eat peanuts. The girl stopped breathing after the man opened a packet of mixed nuts despite three warnings that there was a child on board with a severe allergy. The girl, who went into anaphylactic shock, had to be revived with an anti-allergy adrenaline injection form an EpiPen and was taken to hospital for treatment after the plane landed. Ryanair accommodated the girl’s family’s request to not serve nuts and banned the passenger from flying with it for two years.","Andrew Hyams said he was 'disgusted' with the way his family was treated .

"Rogue kitchen fitter Michael Tolliday promised a couple their dream £15,000 kitchen - only to turn their home into a bomb site . A couple suffered ten months of misery after a cowboy builder promised them a dream £15,000 kitchen - only to turn their home into a bomb site. Michelle and John Lavelle employed Michael Tolliday to knock through two rooms into an open-plan kitchen at their house in Hartburn, Stockton. The 44-year-old told the pair that the job would take him four weeks starting in May last year. But by October little had been done and the couple had been without a kitchen, flooring or running water for nearly 15 weeks. Tolliday was jailed for three-and-a-half years this week after conning customers out of tens of thousands of pounds. The businessman who ran Kitchen Logic in Stockton, left victims without kitchens, water and electricity as he failed to deliver on his work promises. Mrs Lavelle, 59, revealed that by the second week of October last year she had become so exasperated by the lack of progress that she confronted Tolliday, calling him 'a liar, a cheat, and a thief', and threatened to take legal action. Roofing works that had been done were found by a building inspector to be wrong. At the end of the month, and after another failure to deliver their new kitchen, the couple confronted Tolliday again in the car park of his business. Mrs Lavelle said the businessman's reaction was to throw a 'hissy fit' and tell them 'he couldn't believe people were getting on his back'. Following a total breakdown in communications with Tolliday the fed-up couple had to start from scratch and buy a whole new kitchen with a different firm. Mrs Lavelle welcomed the kitchen fitter's jail term but said she and her husband did not expect to be reimbursed after the court case. Michelle and John Lavelle employed Michael Tolliday to knock through two rooms into an open-plan kitchen at their house in Hartburn, Stockton - but after five months the room (pictured) looked like a bomb site . The 44-year-old told the pair that the job would take him four weeks starting in May last year - but by October little had been done . In light of his jail term he was not ordered to pay any of the £39,194 compensation applied for by the prosecution. Mrs Lavelle said: 'I'm glad he's been sent down but we knew he didn't have any money. 'We stupidly gave ours to him, nearly £15,000 in total and with nothing to show for it. 'We've got over that now and have a lovely new kitchen. 'But at the time it was awful, horrendous. We had no kitchen for about ten months and that was how we had to live.' Roofing works (pictured) that had been done by Tolliday were found by a building inspector to be wrong . The damage to their home was so bad that Mr and Mrs Lavelle had to start the project from scratch and buy a whole new kitchen with a different firm . The businessman, who ran Kitchen Logic in Stockton, left victims without kitchens, water and electricity as he failed to deliver on his work promises . A total of 16 people were named as victims of the offences between October 2012 and November last year. Teesside Crown Court heard that customers lost a total of £42,197. Tolliday, of Peterlee, was jailed for 42 months after admitting 11 counts of fraud relating to jobs carried out in Stockton. He also pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in an unfair commercial practice, but denied that he intentionally ripped people off. The case was brought by Stockton Council after investigations by its trading standards department. Tolliday is facing civil court action through trading standards.","Michelle and John Lavelle employed Michael Tolliday to build new kitchen .

"A pair of Islamic converts joined a ‘Muslim Patrol’ in east London to impose Sharia Law, threatening to stab people they believed to be anti-islamic and confiscating their alcohol. Ricardo McFarlane, 26, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons, joined convert Jordan Horner, 19, of Walthamstow, east London, roaming the streets in the early hours of the morning last December and this January. The group confronted members of the public whom they suspected were non-Muslims berating them for their alleged anti-Islamic behaviour. Jordan Horner (left), 19 and Ricardo McFarlane, 26, roamed the streets in the early hours of the morning and confronted members of the public, berating them for their alleged anti-Islamic behaviour . They threatened to ‘kill non believers’ and ‘shank’ - stab - them and uploaded videos to Youtube criticising non-Muslims for being inappropriately dressed. The campaign against Western culture culminated when Horner assaulted two men in Tower Hamlets when the 'patrol' confronted them. Around 4am on January 6 of this year Horner, McFarlane and the 23-year-old approached a group of five men walking along the street, snatched cans of beer out of their hands before emptying them into the gutter. Horner demanded: 'Why are you poisoning your body? It is against Islam. This is Muslim Patrol. Kill the non-believers.' One then told another to 'go get the shank' in reference to a knife but as the group of men started walking away Horner threw punches hitting at least two of the men. Radical: Horner, 19, is close to jihadist hate preacher Anjem Choudary, pictured during a demonstration . He and a 23-year-old also threatened a man and two doctors Claire Coyle and Robert Gray around the Bethnal Green Road and Great Eastern Street areas of east London on December 19 last year and January 13 this year. At an earlier hearing at Thames Magistrates Court in July prosecutor Kehinde Adesina said during the January 6 incident Horner and his extremist pals took to the streets to enforce Sharia Law in what they call being on 'Muslim Patrol'. The prosecutor said: 'Prior to the incident there were some videos uploaded to Youtube about people being inappropriately dressed in east London. 'Between 4am and 5am a group of five male friends were out drinking enjoying a night out. They had cans of beer in their hands. 'The group were approached by Mr Horner and some other men in Muslim dress. They took the beer can out of one of the men’s hands and poured it out. 'Then they said the words ""why are you poisoning your body? It is against Islam. This is Muslim Patrol. Kill the non believers"".' - Prosecutor Kehinde Adesina . She said: 'The victims describe the main aggressor as being ginger with a ginger beard. 'And one victim said the white ginger male punched him in the jaw. 'It was a group attack and a religiously aggravated assault.' Today at the Old Bailey McFarlane, 26, who overslept and was two hours late, refused to stand up. At an earlier hearing McFarlane denied ABH on January 6 and the counts were ordered to lie on file. The 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons, also refused to stand and denied affray on December 19 of last year and January 13 when he confronted the two doctors. But he admitted using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour under section four of the public order acts on both occasions. He had denied ABH and affray on January 6 and the counts were ordered to lie on file. At the same hearing Horner, who uses the Islamic name Jamaal Uddin, pleaded not guilty to causing ABH to Sam Cox on January 6 of this year when his jaw was broken. However he admitted causing ABH to James Forward and Patrick Kavanagh. He also denied affray on December 19 of last year and January 13 of this year but admitted section four of the public order acts offences. McFarlane of Camberwell, south east London, was warned he faces a custodial sentence but had his conditional bail renewed. Judge Rebecca Poulet QC addressing his barrister Susan Meek said: 'He must understand the court does consider this passes the custody threshold. 'Whether I or another judge uses that option will be open to them. I want him to understand that. 'It’s noted he was late today but you were frank and told me he has not been late in the past. I will allow him bail. If there are conditions, one of the conditions is he must not be late.' He has six previous convictions for criminal damage in March 2012 when he painted over women on advertising hoardings around London’s east end. The 23-year-old of Finsbury Park, north London, who has convictions for section 4 offences in April of last year, handling stolen goods and dishonesty, was remanded back into custody. Today prosecutor Alexander Chalk said: 'The significant change is the Crown is not seeking a trial against the 23-year-old in respect to the allegations involved on January 6. 'Otherwise everyone has admitted offences reflected on this indictment.' Horner, the 23-year-old and McFarlane are all due to be sentenced on December 6.

Winter Vinecki, from Michigan but lives in Utah, nabbed the title after completing her seventh marathon, this time in Athens, Greece. She finished the race in four hours, three minutes and 53 seconds and said: 'This is for you, Dad', as she finished, the Statesman Journal reported. Winter Vinecki broke the record for completing a marathon on every continent by finishing up in Athens, Greece (pictured before the race) Winter began running at five-years-old and when her father died from prostate cancer in 2009, she decided to complete a marathon on every continent before her 15th birthday, in a tribute to him . The teenage turns 15 in December, and said after finishing her goal: 'It hasn't quite set in yet, I know that I've done something amazing here, but I can't really put into words how it feels yet, I guess the word is magical.' She's now got her heart set on competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics as an aerial skier. Winter will share the title of completing seven marathons around the globe with her mother though, who shared each moment with her.

Winter Vinecki accepts the Annika Inspiration award during the 32nd Annual Salute To Women In Sports Gala at Cipriani Wall Street on October 19, 2011 in New York City . The teen's mother, Dawn Estelle, said: 'It's been such a long and emotional journey, it's hard to comprehend the impact we've had on the world right now.' The mother, daughter, duo have ticked off marathons in the United States (North America), Kenya (Africa), Antarctica, Mongolia (Asia), Peru (South America), New Zealand (Australia/Oceania) and Greece (Europe). Winter said her favorite two locations were New Zealand and Antarctica, but her favorite two races were in Kenya and Peru. In March this year, Winter became the youngest person ever to complete a marathon in Antarctica. She braved temperatures of -25Cs (22 degrees Fahrenheit) during the race and finished 11th overall in the Antarctica Marathon and was the third female to finish with an impressive time of 4 hours 49 minutes.

Bracing: Winter endured temperatures of 22 degrees Fahrenheit on the run and achieved an impressive time of under five hours . Grit: Winter finished 11th overall in the Antarctica Marathon and was the third female to finish . After losing her dad, Winter set up Team Winter, a nonprofit organization to raise money for research into prostate cancer and awareness. Winter began her charitable work in . the six weeks after her father was diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma . of the prostate. He died after fighting the illness for ten months. She has since raised around $400,000 using her skills as a triathlete. She said: 'I'll do everything I can to put an end to prostate cancer and help find a cure, so other families don't have to endure the hardships that I faced.' She previously ran the Eugene Marathon in North America and Amazing Measal Marathon in Africa. Winter has signed up for some of the hardest races in the world including the Inca Trail in Machu Picchu, Peru, and the original Pheidippides run from Marathon to Athens, Greece. In New Zealand she completed the Great Barrier Island Wharf to Wharf Marathon. The young athlete is training four to five days a week for two or three hours per day to compete int he 2018 Winter Olympics as a qualified aerial skier.

'In Kenya I learned the true value of helping girls get an educate and in Antarctica I was given was the opportunity to learn and explore. 'The race ended up being maybe only ten per cent of this voyage, learning how we can preserve this continent was the remaining ninety per cent.'

"A contest to turn 'nuisance' grey squirrels into burgers had a cold reception from animal activists - who accused it of being a smear campaign against the so-called 'chicken of the trees'. The cook-off in the Forest of Dean, where the animals are accused of damaging trees, attracted wide publicity in its search for the tastiest squirrel snack. Volunteers cooked up quarter-pounders using three minced carcasses each, and one triumphed with a 'cajun melt' surprise - complete with a mozzarella and chutney topping. But they were criticised by vegetarian groups who said grey squirrels were being unfairly maligned, while the RSPCA issued a warning over how the animals were caught. Tasty: It took at least three grey squirrels to make each quarter-pounder at a contest yesterday in the Forest of Dean, prompting complaints by animal rights activists who said it unfairly maligned the little-loved species . Popular: The contest was hosted as part of the Forest Showcase Food and Drink Festival (pictured) The contest was held at the Forest Showcase Food and Drink Festival yesterday near Coleford, Gloucestershire, in a bid to get the animal on British menus. Dozens of would-be chefs submitted a recipe to the Extraordinary Squirrel Burger Challenge, and four finalists served up their version of the dish. Each contestant was handed three 'locally-sourced' squirrel carcasses and added their own flavours to make a quarter pounder. Introduced to Britain in the 19th century, there are now around 100,000 grey squirrels in the Forest of Dean - a population the Forestry Commission claims is 'huge' and 'extremely destructive'. Although the agency does not cull the animals, a spokesman said: 'Grey squirrels do cause considerable damage to the trees through extensive bark stripping.' Trio of carcasses: At least 12 squirrels were killed, skinned and gutted for the family event (file photo) Hotly-tipped: A poster for the event yesterday promised prizes including a £55 cookery school voucher . Rachel Thomas, one of the event's organisers, said: 'It is here in the Forest and we should be using it - they are a nuisance at the end of the day.' But the Bristol-based charity Vegetarians’ International Voice for Animals said the ‘victimisation of grey squirrels’ was ‘totally misguided’. Juicy: This image was one of those used to advertise the squirrel burger cooking contest last week . Spokesman Justin Kerswell added: 'This smear campaign against the grey squirrel reeks of both cruelty and irony. Red squirrels themselves have previously been tarred as pests and killed in huge numbers. 'Favouring and massacring different species of wildlife continues to be a brutal fashion which cannot carry on.' And People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals attacked the 'desperate-for-attention festival organisers' who were 'swimming against the tide'. 'Our shops are brimming with healthy and delicious grains, pasta, beans, rice, nuts, fruits, almond milks and soya puddings,' a spokesman added. 'More and more Brits are realising that these are not only far kinder choices but also far more nourishing than the dead bodies of squirrels, ponies or any other animal for that matter.' The RSPCA also raised concerns over how the animals were found. A spokesman said: 'We would hope that these particular squirrels had been killed humanely. 'We would also be concerned about ordinary members of the public possibly trying to capture and/or kill grey squirrels and would not advocate this.' Festival organisers defended the event, insisting it was fair to eat animals that roam in the woods. The Forestry Commission said the grey squirrel population in the area is 'huge' and 'destructive' (file photo) Ready for lunch? Nicknamed the 'chicken of the trees', squirrel also tastes a little like rabbit (file photo) Ms Thomas said: 'It is no different to going out and having rabbit. It is also kind of an educational thing. It shows that it is a good food source here in the Forest. By Pascal Aussignac, of the Michelin-starred Club Gascon in the City of London . 'I think people seeing it [at the competition] were fascinated and curious. We had a lot of positive reaction. We haven't come across any [negative comments] as it happens.' Nicknamed the 'chicken of the trees', squirrel meat is gamey and mostly tastes like a cross between chicken and rabbit. The first prize in yesterday's contest was won by Holly Hayes, who won a £55 cookery school voucher for her 'cajun melt' burger seasoned with jerk spices and topped with melted mozzarella and chutney. The runner-up was Sophie Drinkwater who called her creation 'chicken of the tree surprise' - a garlic and herb burger with melted Gloucester cheese in the centre. The Forest of Dean is already at the centre of animal rights campaigns because it is the focus of Britain's largest wild boar cull. The cull - which is taking place all winter and could claim as many as 500 animals, say activists - is set to be sabotaged by up to 30 locals who will inform each other whenever government-approved marksmen appear. The ancient forest is also the focus of the government's highly controversial badger cull, which campaigners have accused of doing more harm than good. Lawrence Jefferies, a catering lecturer at Gloucestershire College and one of the judges, said the grey squirrel was 'obviously a nuisance within the Forest of Dean and it does a lot of damage and there’s nothing wrong with eating it.' He added: 'It is a creature with a fluffy tail and some people would take offence at its use for food but to my mind it’s just the same as a wild rabbit, which is perfectly acceptable. 'They are a pest, they are in abundance and there is a food source to be had there. And I think it might make a nice cheeseburger.'","Squirrel Burger Challenge held yesterday in Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire .

"Ashley Dupre, the call girl most famous for her bedding former New York governor, Eliot Spitzer, is engaged to be married and expecting a baby in just two months. The New Jersey native revealed to the New York Post that she is set to wed long time love, Thomas 'TJ' Earle now that he is divorced from the wife he cheated on with Ms Dupre only months after the 'Love Guv' scandal broke. Much has changed for the one-time prostitute, 27, who, aside from her romantic news, opened a lingerie and swimwear store in Redbank in May. The high life: Ashley Dupre, the former call girl who became world famous for her tryst with Eliot Spitzer, announced she was engaged and pregnant in August . Rumours have been circulating since Femme by Ashley customers started noticing the large 'rock' on Ms Dupre's finger and her obviously swollen stomach, but details of the wedding plans and sex of the baby are being kept a secret. Asked about her pregnancy, Ms Dupre told the Post, 'So far so good!' She and Mr Earle began an illicit affair shortly after news of her dealings with Mr Spitzer hit the headlines but the asphalt heir was still married to wife Alisa with whom he has two children. Scandal number two: Ms Dupre set the rumour mill spinning again in 2008 when she was spotted getting out of a car in New York City with then married Thomas Earle (pictured above) to whom she is now engaged . After meeting at a Jersey Shore restaurant, Mr Earle had reportedly boasted to a friend, 'I could have had her for free.' When their steamy affair was exposed later, the Earle Companies executive publicly apologised to his wife calling his actions a 'grave mistake'. Fame: Ms Dupre at a Russell Simmons' hosted bash in 2010 . Ms Dupre meanwhile, went on to make a . name for herself, this time as a New York Post agony aunt, fielding . questions from readers on sex and relationships and being commended by . many for her bravery in speaking out about her experience. In a final piece for the column, to which she contributed for two and half years, she said: 'I'm proud to say that Ask Ashley has been a greater success then I ever thought. 'Not a financial one, but rather a success in letting people see that I'm more than just the girl in the headlines from 2008.' When Mr Spitzer was accused of paying Ms Dupre $2000 for sex at a Washington hotel the night before Valentine's Day in 2008, a can of worms was opened that revealed the governor's long time penchant for expensive call girls and culminated in his resignation. Now making headlines for all the right reasons, Ms Dupre says she's 'matured' and has 'moved on' from the scandal. According to Mr Earle's lawyer, Mitchell Ansell, his client and ex-wife Alisa have been divorced for over a year and are on good terms. He confirmed: 'They divorced amicably. She has moved on, and he has moved on. There’s nothing scandalous. No one's running around. [Ashley] is pregnant, and [TJ and Ashley] are planning on getting married.' 'Everyone is looking forward to the future,' Ms Dupre told the Post.","Dupre made famous by Spitzer scandal in 2008 .

"A man who beat his mother to death after an epileptic seizure was allowed on Monday to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease and be committed for treatment. Prosecutors have enough evidence to prove Henry Wachtel killed his mother in 2012, said Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Stuart Silberg. But medical experts have concluded he was 'not criminally responsible for his conduct,' Silberg said. Pleading insanity: Seen here in 2012, Henry Wachtel, now 21, is accused of beating his mother to death in Manhattan after suffering a serious seizure. He says he remembers none of it . Tragic: Wachtel on Monday told the judge 'I have no memory of the events immediately surrounding the death of my mother' Wachtel, 21, told a judge, 'I have no memory of the events immediately surrounding the death of my mother.' At the same time, based on the evidence and conversations with his lawyer, 'I am convinced that I physically caused my mother's death,' he added. Prosecutors had alleged that before Karyn Kay was killed she called 911 to say her son was having a seizure and needed help. Prosecutors said Wachtel suddenly attacked her while she was still on the phone and an emergency operator overheard wails from her and screams from her son. Police arrived at the Manhattan apartment to find a wild-eyed Wachtel covered in blood, prosecutors said. His mother was unconscious, in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor. Horrific: Wachtel's mother Karyn Kay suffered a fractured skull, broken ribs and internal bleeding. The 63-year-old high school teacher was later pronounced dead at a hospital . She suffered a fractured skull, broken ribs and internal bleeding. The 63-year-old LaGuardia high school teacher was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Since then, a battery of medical exams found that 'the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect such that he did not appreciate the nature and consequences of his actions at the time he attacked his mother,' prosecutors said. Under such pleas, defendants can be held in mental hospitals until a judge approves a release, if ever. For now, Wachtel is going instead to a residential therapeutic program. He's due back in court in May. Kay taught English-writing at LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan. She also wrote a 1988 movie that starred Steve Buscemi .","Henry Wachtel was allowed on Monday to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease in the 2012 murder of his mother Karyn Kay in Manhattan .

"Cut down: Draft guidelines suggest limiting the amount of sugar eaten daily . Children should not be given fizzy drinks because they contain dangerous amounts of sugar, UN health chiefs said yesterday. They also warned adults should halve their average intake to six teaspoons a day to avoid obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses. The guideline amount has been slashed dramatically amid fears that sugar poses the same threat to health as tobacco. Experts blame it for millions of premature deaths across the world every year. Graham MacGregor, a London cardiologist and health campaigner, said: ‘Added sugar is a completely unnecessary part of our diets, contributing to obesity, type II diabetes and tooth decay. ‘We have known about the health risks of sugar for years and yet nothing substantial has been done. ‘The new recommendations will be a wakeup call to the Department of Health and the Government to take action by forcing the food industry to slowly reduce the huge amount of sugar added across the board.’ Chief medical officer Sally Davies has already said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring  levels of obesity. Labour suggested last night it would impose a maximum limit on sugar, fat and salt in products marketed at children. The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year. The UN’s World Health Organisation said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yoghurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies. Last night it published the draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six. And it said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven spoons. Francesco Branca, director for nutrition for health and development at WHO, said: ‘Obesity affects half a billion people in the world and it is on the rise. ‘Sugar along with other risk factors might certainly become the new tobacco in terms of public health action. The consumption of a single serving of sugar sweetened soda might actually already exceed the limit for a child. So certainly the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should be done with great care. ‘It actually is one of the elements that has been more constantly associated to increase weight gain particularly in children.’ The guidelines will now be discussed by academics and medical experts before a final version is published. But Dr Branca said food and drinks manufacturers should drastically alter their products. A bowl of muesli contains two and a half teaspoons of sugar, a latte has five, a chocolate bar six or seven while some ready-meals have more than eight. Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said his party was considering setting a legal maximum on the amount of sugar, fat and salt in foods aimed at children. ‘We have a big ambitious health policy coming out,’ he added. ‘We feel the Government has lost its way completely on public health, there’s no leadership at all now.’ It is understood the policy would cover products such as Kellogg’s Frosties, which is 37 per cent sugar. On Monday, Dame Sally told MPs that being overweight had become ‘normalised’. But David Cameron’s official spokesman yesterday played down the need for a sugar tax and said ministers would rather encourage food and drinks firms to voluntarily make products healthier. Chief medical officer Sally Davies (left) said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity, while Andy Burnham (right) said Labour was considering setting a legal maximum on the amount of sugar, fat and salt in foods aimed at children . Sweet tooth: Health experts are concerned about the 'hidden sugar' in sweets and sodas . He . added: ‘What we are doing is working with the industry. You have . already seen commitments from retailers and food manufacturers to reduce . levels of salt, to remove some artificial fats, to reduce calorie . content and improve labelling, as well as public health campaigns by . local authorities and the NHS.’ The draft guidelines do not address the health effects of sugar substitutes or chemical sweeteners. Andrew Percy, a Tory MP on the Commons health select committee, raised fears of ‘nanny state’ meddling. He . said: ‘What we need to do is educate people about food, and proper . labelling of food is important in that. But, in the end, people must . have the discretion to make their own choices.’ Professor MacGregor is a cardiologist at Barts and chairman of the group Action on Sugar.","The WHO recommends sugar makes up less than 10% of energy intake .

"A 60-year-old suspected sexual predator was arrested wearing a Star Wars costume after meeting with Michigan police officers who pretended to be a child online. Daniel Fritz, of Wayne County's Canton Township, has been charged with child sexually abusive activity and using a computer to communicate with another to commit a crime. Officials say the investigation started after an ad ‘highly indicative of child sexual exploitation’ was posted on a social media website. The force was not with him: Daniel Fritz, 60, pictured left in his booking photo, was arrested wearing a Star Wars costume (right) after meeting with police officers who posed online as a child . Detectives set up a fictitious sexual encounter in Roseville and arrested Fritz. The elderly suspect was sporting a costume like that of the Star Wars bounty hunter character Boba Fett. Fritz was arraigned last Wednesday. He is being held on $$50,000 bond pending a November 12 preliminary hearing in Roseville District Court. The Macomb County Sheriff's Office has released a selfie taken by Fritz depicting the suspect posing in front of a bathroom mirror in a Boba Fett Helmet. Investigators say Fritz made plans to meet the bogus child last Wednesday in Roseville for the  purpose of having sex with the minor. According to sheriff's officials, when Fritz showed up for the meeting, he was already wearing the Boba Fett getup, which he completed upon arrival by putting on a helmet, The Smoking Gun reported.

"To prepare for the release of two female giant pandas into the wilderness later this month, Chinese caretakers are dressing in panda suits to help draw the animals out of their enclosure. And while it might seem like an extreme length to go to, researchers believe that using such costumes are vital for teaching the animals to survive in the outside. According to scientists, the outfits are crucial to ensure that the bears do not become used to seeing humans. This video shows the first (unsuccessful) attempt to release a captive giant panda and her mother into the wild . Caregivers dressed as pandas in hopes of coaxing two-year-old bear, Xin Yuan, out of her enclosure . This will be the second attempt to release the pandas into the wild, following a failed try in October, according to the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda (CCRCGP) in China's Sichuan Province. Two-year-old Xin Yuan and her mother will soon be released again, in hopes that she will learn to fend for herself. Caretakers, in fancy dress, have been helping her learn habitat selection, foraging, and enemy evasion skills. Scientists hope to repopulate the species by breeding them artificially and then introducing them into the wild . Unfortunately, the endangered animal was reluctant to leave and climbed a tree to escape release . Researchers are attempting to try again later this month after socialisation attempts in their fancy dress suits . During the first unsuccessful release, chronicled in the video, keepers in panda suits approached Xin Yuan, but found that she was reluctant to leave and quickly climbed a tree to get away. China first began sending captive-bred pandas into the wilderness in 2006 with the release of five-year-old male Xiang Xiang. Unfortunately, he was killed by wild pandas a year later. Scientists believe that the other bears sensed something different about the human-reared Xiang Xiang. In October 2012, male panda Tao Tao was successfully released into the Liziping Nature Reserve and in November 2013, female panda Zhang Xiang also successfully transitioned to the wild. A 2007 report estimates that there are only 1,590 giant pandas living free in China, and conservationists are desperate to find ways to repopulate the species.","China to release two female pandas into the wilderness later this month .

"A businessman accused of raping a drunken woman at a five-star hotel today has been acquitted after his lawyer claimed the woman got herself 'into a silly position'. Mohammed Aneizi had sex with the woman at his suite at the luxurious Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, west London, after swigging champagne with her at a West End nightclub. The 26-year-old was cleared of two counts of rape following a trial at Isleworth Crown Court in which his lawyer referred to the 'recipe for disaster' party lifestyle of some young women. Mohammed Aneizi, 26 (left) was acquitted of rape following a trial at Isleworth Crown Court.  Gurkhan Suleyman (right) was convicted of attempted rape after assaulting the same woman on the same evening . Aneizi was accused of raping the woman after taking her back to the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington following a night out. He denied the charges throughout, and was today acquitted of one count of rape. Speaking before the jury returned its verdict, his lawyer referred to the party lifestyle of some young women. 'You have to wonder about club culture - it's a recipe for disaster,' said Davis Osbourne. 'These girls are able to go out week after week, night after night, and not spend a penny. 'Promoters are able to get them into the clubs by handing out free drinks and entry. This was 0-60mph drunkenness. 'Mr Aneizi and this lady got themselves into silly positions that night, and would have made very different choices if they were both sober.' The court heard how the businessman kissed the woman at the nightclub, and that she insisted on coming home with him. 'She was very drunk, and when drunk made a decision to have sex with my client. Bathroom: The woman was allegedly attacked in a suite at Kensington's Royal Garden Hotel, pictured. She remained in the bathroom for an hour and was found in the foetal position by Aneizi, the court heard . Celebrity haunt: The pair met at Movida nightclub, where guests have included Kate Moss and Chris Martin . 'She walked into the hotel of her own steam,' Mr Osbourne added. The pair had sex in his hotel room after the woman fell during the journey from the nightclub, the court heard. Following the encounter she fell asleep in the bathroom, with Mr Aneizi continuing his evening with guests in the lounge of his suite. Gurkhan Suleyman then attempted to rape the woman in the bathroom, throwing £20 notes over her body as she lay in the foetal position, the court heard. The gold-toothed 28-year-old, whom Mr Aneizi said he only met that evening, was convicted of attempted rape.

"Three teenager soccer players and two girls were killed when the car they were being driven back from a theme park veered off the freeway and caught fire. Alex Sotelo, Matthew Melo and Brandon Moreno, who were all aged 14-15, died when their white BMW crashed on the I-5 freeway in Irvine, California at 2am Saturday. Two teenage girls, who have not been named, were also killed when the car hit a guardrail, rolled off an embankment then caught fire. Firefighters in California found six dead teenagers inside this car after it drove off the road. A sixth passenger, a 16-year-old boy, was transported to a nearby hospital in serious condition . Firefighters arrived at the scene in irvine, California, to find five badly-burned bodies inside the charred BMW . A 16-year-old male, who was driving the car back from Knott's Scary Farm, a theme park event in nearby Buena Park, was found with severe head injuries 50 yards from the embankment where the car came to a rest. The vehicle caught fire as it crashed, burning the bodies inside so badly that they will only be identifiable from dental records, NBC Los Angeles reported. Wreckage: The burned remains of the car were lifted off the I-5 freeway where the car veered off the road . Before: Pictured above is the embankment onto which the car crashed early Saturday morning . It also started a small brush fire, which emergency services extinguished. The injured boy has been taken to hospital and is in a critical condition. The three male victims, from Mission Viejo, were identified by their soccer coach, who realized something had gone wrong when they failed to turn up for Saturday morning's game. Billy McNicoll told how Alex, his team's top goal-scorer, and Matt were well-established players, while Brandon was a newer addition. Their loss hit the team hard.

"Fiona Bruce has described how she lived in a ‘constant state of guilt’ as she struggled to juggle caring for her ailing parents with looking after her children. The BBC newsreader’s mother Rosemary died of cancer in 2011 and her father John died just 18 months later. But because she lives in London with her husband Nigel Sharrocks and their children Sam, 16, and Mia, 12, she was unable to spend as much time as she wanted with them at their home in Dalwood, Devon. Miss Bruce, 50, said: ‘When both my parents were unwell I was in that situation that will be very familiar to many women. I had young children in one part of the country, and elderly unwell parents in another. ‘I was in a constant state of guilt. Was I there enough for my mother? Was I there enough for my children? I was trying to do my job at the same time and also I had a husband to think of. Trying to manage all that was difficult. ‘These two people had done everything for me, and would do anything for me. I could never really have done enough back.’ Miss Bruce – who also presents the Antiques Roadshow – revealed she also feels she is not always up to scratch as a parent. She told Woman & Home magazine: ‘What kind of mother am I? One that falls short – every day. Speaking to Woman & Home, Ms Bruce said she prefers to spend time with her family than go out . ‘And now that my kids are 12 and 16 I’m terminally uncool, which is faintly depressing. Even being on the telly is just not remotely cool to them. ‘The other day we did the Antiques Roadshow in London and I said to my husband, “do you want to come with the kids?” He said yes, but he rang at about 2pm and said “I can’t persuade the kids to come”.’ Miss Bruce said she prefers to spend time with her family than go out in the evening. ‘When I started presenting I’d get invited to red carpet events and I went to a few premieres. But pretty soon I thought, “Life’s too short”. If you work and you want to see your children, something’s got to give and for me, it’s my social life.’ She also spoke about her 20-year marriage with Mr Sharrocks, whom she met when she worked for an advertisement agency and he was the director. ‘I didn’t necessarily think he was The One immediately, but I did pretty soon after,’ she said. ‘By the time I turned 29 ... I was pretty sure we were heading towards marriage and so – it sounds so terrible when I tell this story – I said to him, “I’d like to be married by the time I’m 30 but I’d rather like you to ask me; I don’t want to ask you”.’ She added: ‘Don’t ask me the secret to a good long-term relationship – I have no idea! Honestly, I think it’s just luck.’ For the full interview see the November issue of Woman & Home, on sale today.","BBC newsreader's mother Rosemary died of cancer in 2011 .

"A four-year-old boy who went to bed with only pink eye died in his sleep hours later from enterovirus 68. Eli Waller of Hamilton Township, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Atlantic City, is the first fatality linked directly to a strain of enterovirus that has infected more than 500 people. Waller was asymptomatic before his death and the onset of his illness was rapid, according to Hamilton Township Health Officer Jeff Plunkett said. Eli Waller of Hamilton Township, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Atlantic City, is the first fatality linked directly to a strain of enterovirus that has infected more than 500 people . He had stayed home from preschool on September 24 with a case pink eye that the medical examiner found to be unrelated to the virus. Today his father  spoke out for the first time telling of his son's loving character and a new foundation in his honor. On Sunday Andy Waller released a statement and photos of his four-year-old son describing him  as a 'shy little puppy who wants only to make people proud and happy.' 'He was a beautiful mix of eagerness and hesitancy,' need and striving, caution and surprise,' Waller wrote, 'all of which were grounded in a pure, unconditional love.' Happy: Andy Waller released a statement and photos of his four-year-old son Sunday describing him as a 'shy little puppy who wants only to make people proud and happy' Waller wrote that he and Eli's mother are proud of their son who is the youngest of triplets and was born 'smaller and lighter than his sisters.' 'Eli nevertheless persevered through all the difficulties that came his way,' Waller wrote. 'Eli was not the type to give up, and even though things never really came easily to him, he would just plug away, day after day, practicing sounds, or movements, or skills, until he would eventually get them.' Honor: Eli attended Pre-K at Yardville Elementary School, school officials have tied a blue and gold ribbon around a tree in front of the school in honor of the four-year-old . Waller told NBC New York that the family is in the process of establishing a fund in Eli's honor to provide support for students involved in Special Education called The First Day of School Foundation. '...it is our sincere hope that this Foundation can work to help kids in a way that will make Eli proud of us all, in the same way that we were all so proud of him,' Waller wrote. On Saturday, local officials announced at a press conference that a Mercer County medical examiner ruled the cause of death as Enterovirus-D68,NJ.com reports. CNN reports that though the virus was found in four other patients who died in September, Waller's is the first case in which the virus was determined as the cause of death. CNN reports that more than 500 cases of the enterovirus have been reported nationwide in 43 states and the District of Columbia as of Friday. Enterovirus-D68 was identified in 1962 and those who catch the virus usually only experience a runny nose or low-grade fever, NBC New York reports. Recently, the virus has become more problematic due to its link to more severe illnesses.","A medical examiner has determined that Enterovirus-D68 is the cause of the death of Eli Waller, 4 .

"Everyone has a cheeky grin when they find a crumpled up fiver wedged in the sofa but just imagine the utter thrill of stumbling upon a cash machine that dispenses free cash. That's what a large number of lucky people experienced in Tooting High Street on Wednesday when a cash machine mysteriously started giving out £10,000 in notes. The unsuspecting customers were not asked for a PIN number and no details were taken from their cards but, apart from that, the on-screen process was identical to genuine ATM. Super rich? Hugo Ellis and his girlfriend Celeste Powell scooped £500 by using the Betfair machine . A video of the money transactions from the ATM - known as the super rich cash machine - shows the hilarious reactions, surprise and elation as multitudes of people withdraw free money. One man shrieks in delight and says, 'This is giving out money,' while another man cannot believe his eyes as he stares at a crisp £50 note which he has just received for free. One beaming woman tries to persuade a disbelieving passer-by what is happening and says: 'Trust me, I just done it and I got £80.' That's unusual: One man looks surprised as he makes a transaction from the super rich ATM machine . Two men hug as they celebrate their extra cash while another man grabs his cash adoringly and kisses the screen in gratitude. Hugo Ellis and his girlfriend Celeste Powell, students at Goldsmiths University who have just moved to London from Devon, were handed £500 by the machine. Hugo said: 'We were just in MacDonald’s having a cup of tea, and then on the walk home we stopped at the Super Rich ATM machine to get some cash. Overjoyed: Two men hug after they receive free cash from the mysterious machine . 'I put my card in and took out £40, we were about to leave when the machine beeped again and more money came out! I put the money straight in my pocket and waited until we got home to count it, that was when we realised it was £500! 'We’ve just moved to London as students and we definitely weren’t expecting anything like this to happen, my girlfriend nearly cried!’ News of the generous cash machine spread on social media and long queues of people started forming outside the Super Rich cash machine as people looked to get in on the free cash. Twitter user Kate Lennon tweeted: 'Cash machine giving out free cash in  #tooting! "" #getherenow #ABBA Money money money!' The ATM provider super rich cash machine was later claimed on Twitter by Betfair. New addition: The super rich cash machines were a welcome addition on Tooting High Street . You won't believe this: A happy customer takes a photo of his money after a visit to the ATM . Betfair confirmed they set up the  machine to promote its Price Rush product, where a Sportsbook bet is boosted to a better price on the exchange. Andy Holmes, Betfair Brand Product Manager, said: 'The odds on getting more money than you expected at a cash machine are pretty slim but yesterday our Super Rich Cash Machines Price Rushed transactions, gave some users much more money than they requested. 'For anyone visiting the Super Rich Cash Machines Tooting branch today, they may be in for the same experience.'","People hug and embrace each other in disbelief while others kiss ATM .

"China may ban Facebook, but not its co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who stunned an audience of students in Beijing by speaking in fluent Mandarin. He did not explicitly discuss the social media site ban during his Q&A at prestigious Tsinghua University, but an indirect reference drew laughter from the audience. Zuckerberg, whose company has long sought to enter the Chinese market, highlighted that Facebook already helps some Chinese companies in foreign markets. Scroll down for video . Fluent: Mark Zuckerberg speaks Mandarin during a dialogue with students as a newly-appointed member to the advisory board for Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management in Beijing, China . Zuckerberg married Priscilla Chan in 2012, and set himself the goal of learning Mandarin in 2010 . 'Speaking of China, I have a more difficult question for Mark, which I hope will not get me fired. What are Facebook's plans in China?' asked the forum facilitator and Facebook employee Wei Xiaoliang. 'We are already in China,' Zuckerberg said in Chinese, to more laughter. 'We help Chinese companies gain customers abroad.' 'We want to help the rest of the world connect to China.' Zuckerberg married Chinese-American Priscilla Chan in 2012, and set himself the goal of learning Mandarin in 2010. He said  that he wanted to learn the language partly because his wife's grandmother only speaks Chinese. 'Priscilla and I decided to get married, so I told her grandmother in Chinese, and she was very surprised,' Zuckerberg said. He said China is a great country and hopes that learning the language will help him learn its culture. 'The Chinese language is difficult, and I speak English, but I like challenges,' Zuckerberg said. Applause: The audience cheered when Zuckerberg spoke Mandarin during his 30-minute chat . He said that he wanted to learn the language partly because his wife's grandmother only speaks Chinese . Beijing promotes Internet use for business and education but bans material deemed subversive or obscene and blocks access to foreign websites run by human rights and Tibet activists and some overseas news and social media sites. On China's social media, many microbloggers noted the irony that Zuckerberg's famous creation is blocked in China. Designer David Wang, in an interview in downtown Beijing, said he would be happy if Facebook was allowed across the so-called Great Firewall of China. 'Because now we have to use software to jump the Wall if we want to access Facebook,' he said. Zuckerberg visited Beijing this week as a newly-appointed member to the advisory board for Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management. Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company is planning to open 25 retail stores in China within the next two years, according to Sina.com. The technology giant currently has 15 outlets in the country and earns around 15 per cent of its revenue in Greater China, Cook said. He said: 'We're investing like crazy in the market,"" Cook said on the call. ""When I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on Earth in history.' Coming soon? Facebook is currently banned in China but Zuckerberg's performance has been seen as a sign by some that that may change . He met Tuesday with Tsinghua President Chen Jining to discuss cooperation in education, according to a statement by Tsinghua. Zuckerberg's Chinese pronunciation was far from fluent and some native speakers said it was a 'challenge' to understand him. But he was able to maintain intelligible conversation for a half-hour and the students responded with warm cheers for his effort and laughter at his humor. Li Qin, a computer programmer from the eastern city of Hangzhou, said in an online chat that she could barely understand Zuckerberg's Chinese. 'It was a challenge for Chinese listening comprehension. But even though Facebook cannot enter the Chinese market, Mark is still making a fighting effort to learn,' she said. 'It was quite a funny scenario.'","Mark Zuckerberg said he wants to help the world connect to China .

"Bayern Munich progressed to the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday night as Roma 'did a Liverpool' and rested several first-team stars. With Bayern cruising at the top of Group E Roma manager Rudi Garcia left captain Francesco Totti on the bench along with first-team regulars Ashley Cole, Gervinho, Miralem Pjanic and goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. The move by Roma - who face Torino in Serie A on Sunday - drew similarities with that of Brendan Rodgers decision to field a weakened Liverpool side for their trip to Real Madrid on Tuesday night. French midfielder Ribery (right) wheels away after giving Bayern Munich the lead shortly before half-time at the Allianz Arena . Bayern Munich's midfielder Mario Gotze scores his side's second goal in the 64th minute at the Allianz . Roma captain Francesco Totti was among those left on the bench by manager Rudi Garcia at the Etihad Stadium . Bayern Munich: Neuer; Benatia, Boateng, Alaba (Rode 80); Rafinha, Lahm (Hojbjerg 88), Alonso (Shaqiri 72), Bernat; Gotze, Ribery; Lewandowski. Subs Not Used: Zingerle, Dante, Muller. Booked: Alonso. Goals: Ribery 38, Gotze 64. Roma: Skorupski; Torosidis, Manolas, Yanga-Mbiwa, Holebas (Cole 46); Nainggolan, De Rossi, Keita; Florenzi (Pjanic 58), Destro, Iturbe (Gervinho 74). Subs Not Used: De Sanctis, Ljajic, Totti, Somma. Attendance: 68,000 . Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey). German champions Bayern never looked troubled by their weakened opposition as Franck Ribery and Mario Gotze scored either side of half time to register their fourth win from four European games. The result gives Bayern an unassailable eight-point lead at the top of the group while Roma remain second following Manchester City's surprise defeat by CSKA Moscow. Bayern went ahead in the 38th minute, when Ribery sent David Alaba racing down the left flank. The Austria international played the ball back to Ribery and the winger slotted home, with the ball bouncing off the inside of the post into the net. Gotze secured Bayern's victory in the 64th minute after a cross from Robert Lewandowski. Gotze displayed outstanding control to lift the ball softly past Roma goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski. 'No, not yet,' Guardiola, in his second season at Bayern, told reporters when asked if this team was now matching his expectations. 'We are playing better than last year but we have to improve,' said Guardiola, who won the domestic double with Bayern in his first season in charge. 'Obviously we are playing better. We talk a lot, we have a lot of meetings, but we can always improve, always, always.' Bayern captain Philipp Lahm said: 'We knew it wouldn't be that easy as in Rome. They defended well, often with six men, and it wasn't easy to create chances.' Ribery, starting only his second match after a knee injury, said Roma defended well in the first half, when Bayern had few chances apart from the goal.

Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola watches on from the touchline as his side cruise to their fourth European win of the season . 'But we played better in the second half and it's been a nice week for us,' Ribery said. Lahm narrowly missed the target and a chance to make it a three-goal lead and Alaba's free kick sailed wide. Gervinho came on late in the game and created Roma's only decent opportunity, setting up Radja Nainggolan, but Manuel Neuer produced an outstanding save to deny the former Arsenal man. Bayern were never forced to switch into a higher gear and Roma rarely managed to hold the ball long enough to threaten the German champion.

However, Luxury Action say that the country's striking scenery will provide the perfect location for customers who want to create scenes involving car chases and action scenes, Western-style narratives and fantasy storylines similar to The Hobbit and Alice in Wonderland. Called 'The Hollywood Experience', the concept was created by Janne Honkanen, owner of Luxury Action. Mr Honkanen joined forces with award-winning production manager Bruton Jones, whose previous work includes blockbusters such as The Rock, Armageddon and Wesley Snipes thriller, Blade.

'In case a client does not have the own story of dreams, on request we will write the script and story. 'We deliver everything in a book beforehand and after we agree everything, a client will live the narrative. 'Travel through Norwegian Fjors, meet the elves with Santa Claus in the Arctic Circle, experience the ultimate Scandinavia package where everything is custom designed only for you. 'Usually it takes minimum of one week to make proposal, but if it is a luxury wedding, or other similar high-end occasion, it can take from one week up to few months writing script and creating the unique story. 'Based on my current experience, I think that our Arab clients are a very curious and interested of this service, but also Asian and American clients. 'Depending on budget and if a client wishes to have a reality style documentation, 3- 4 film crew is enough.

"A group of firefighters are being investigated after they allegedly took a 'straw poll' on Facebook about the the female colleagues they would most like to sleep with. The controversy at the Queensland Fire Service is believed to have originated earlier in 2014 when the male officers used the social media platform as a means of rating female officers' potential sexual prowess, with one being likened to supermodel Elle McPherson. Several female officers are understood to have been transferred as a result of the harassment, after a complaint was lodged with the commissioner. The controversy is believed to have originated earlier in 2014 when male officers in the department used the social media platform as a means of rating female officers' potential sexual prowess. Further allegations have plagued the department, with one officer allegedly being portrayed as Adolf Hitler, and another female officer being portrayed as Elle McPherson, reported The Courier Mail. Assistant Commissioner Peter Beauchamp initiated an investigation into the claims, and an independent workplace investigation firm has been employed to question the officers involved in the incident. The allegations in question relate to “sexual harassment, workplace bullying, harassment and intimidation”. Three officers may potentially face dismissal or disciplinary charges over the scandal, though none have been stood down as of yet. A spokesperson for the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said that it would be inappropriate to comment upon the matter as the incident was still under investigation. However, one officer saw fit to comment. 'You could say it’s a real hotbed of scandal in the fire service at the moment,' they said.

"A podiatric surgeon has been found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct after patients have been left with complications from foot surgery to remedy bunions. Dr Paul Bours, a Sydney based foot surgeon, has defended the claims and has called the case brought against him by the Health Complaints Commission a 'witch hunt'. The complaints come from former patients who are allegedly suffering from issues stemming from surgery performed by Dr Bours to fix their foot ailments. Dr Paul Bours, a Sydney based foot surgeon, has defended claims brought forward by patients and has called the case brought against him by the Health Complaints Commission a 'witch hunt'. Dr Bours recovers while on holidays after damaging his foot skiing in Japan . One woman had three toes amputated as a result of surgery for bunions by Dr Bours, and two other patients now have different size feet, reported The Daily Telegraph. While Dr Bours is now operating under conditions imposed by the Podiatry Council, he has 'vigorously defended' the charges, stating that the case had been brought against him because the Commission was wary of new surgical methods used by the podiatric surgeon. Dr Bours said that the Commission preferred traditional orthopedic methods while he operated using surgery that was minimally invasive. The podiatric surgeon was found that he had failed to obtain informed consent, and have failed to warn his patients of potential risks and complications that could arise from the surgery he was performing on them. The Civil and Administrative Tribunal said that Dr Bours was an experienced practitioner, but noted that the matters brought before them were not related to complexity of medical practice. 'They are fundamental matters that are basic to safe, ethical, wise and professional practice,' it said. The tribunal heard that a 24-year-old female patient of Dr Bours was treated for a bunion on her left toe, after going in for treatment for toenail fungus in 2011. The complaints come from four former patients who were told by Dr Bours that he could fix their foot ailments, and are now suffering from resulting issues, the Commission claims. The patient claimed Dr Bours told her 'the surgery is a walk in the park and there is a two-week recovery'. The tribunal said the podiatric surgeon had employed scare tactics to encourage her to undergo the surgery, and showed her images of infected feet which he told her she would develop if she chose not to have the procedure. The patient claimed Dr Bours told her 'the surgery is a walk in the park and there is a two-week recovery'. At the Darlinghurst Day Surgery, the woman had all of her toes fused and the bunion removed from her big left toe, but after recurring pain and restriction of movement in her digits, was forced to undergo a second surgery where the bone was shaved. After being informed by Dr Bours that she required a third surgery, she sought a different medical opinion and was told she had developed osteoarthritis after her second surgery. The patient's toe joint was damaged, and that she required more surgery to remove bone fragments from her foot. The woman is now looking at the possibility of ongoing pain, is no longer able to wear high heels and has difficulty walking, the Tribunal heard. Another patient was heard to have had his feet operated on, and found the pins which were holding his joints together protruding from his bone by a centimeter. Dr Bours denied these claims, and abused a colleague, calling him a 'gutless ***t', believing him to have written a report for the Commission. Dr Bours had recently been in the media for performing 'vanity surgeries' on women who wanted their feet to fit into fashionable high heels.","Dr Paul Bours allegedly used 'fear tactics' to convince a woman to undergo surgery to fix bunion and now she cannot walk properly .

"A brick tycoon is suing a top QC who pulled out of buying his £3.6million country manor after claiming it was riddled with damp and dry rot. Leading barrister William Griffiths QC and his wife Angela thought they had found their dream home when they viewed Laughton Manor in Lewes, East Sussex in 2010. The 30-room mansion is set in 12 acres of countryside and its architecture has been compared to that of Queen Victoria's much-loved summer home, Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. William Griffiths QC and his wife Angela, left, who are being sued by Alan Hardy after they pulled out of buying Laughton Manor in East Sussex . Laughton Manor, in East Sussex, which Mr and Mrs Griffiths had originally agreed to buy for £3.6million, before pulling out saying it was 'riddled with damp and dry rot' Mr Griffiths, 66, a planning and property lawyer and a committee member of the MCC agreed to exchange contracts on the property with then owners Alan Hardy and his wife Juliet in April 2011. However the QC and his wife did not see a surveyor's report on the mansion until after the contracts has been exchanged. After receiving the survey in May 2012, Mr and Mrs Griffiths 'rescinded' the contract and refused to complete the purchase. They insisted they had been the victims of 'reckless misrepresentation' by the then owners. The main reception room at Laughton Manor, which is at the centre of a court battle between William Griffiths QC and brick tycoon Alan Hardy . Mr and Mrs Griffiths claim that a survey revealed the 150-year-old property was badly affected by rising damp and wet and dry rot. Pictured is the dining room . They claimed that, rather than being the 'pristine' dream home they expected, the survey revealed that the 150-year-old Victorian manor was badly affected by 'rising damp and wet and dry rot', which would cost up to £600,000 to remedy. Mr Hardy, who flies a helicopter, and his wife are now suing Mr and Mrs Griffiths at London's High Court for a six-figure sum over their refusal to go through with the sale, alleging breach of contract. Jonathan Seitler QC, for Mr and Mrs Hardy, told Judge Amanda Tipples QC, that Laughton Manor is a magnificent property, built in 1853, with 30 rooms on four storeys. It has an Italianate tower similar to that of Osborne house, and boasts a helicopter pad, gym, cinema and staff quarters. It was on the market for £4.5million and Mr and Mrs Griffiths had agreed to buy it for £3.6million, before reading the surveyor's report. The master bedroom in the £3.6million country manor, which was once owned by Sir James Duke, a close friend of Queen Victoria . The spacious kitchen of Laughton Manor, left. The floor as you enter the building, right, still has the crest of Sir James Duke Bart in tiles . Mr Seitler told the judge that the contract contained a 'common' clause used in conveyancing, whereby the QC and his wife promised to accept and pay for the property based on its state of repair at the time of signing. He added that having agreed to the contract, with the clause in place, the couple were legally bound to go ahead with the purchase, and must now pay damages for failing to do so. Mr Seitler said: 'Merely describing the size of the property and the age of the property, it was obvious that there was always going to be some damp in this property somewhere. 'The question is how obvious that would have been to a lay person. 'The vendor is obliged to inform the purchaser of latent structural defects of which he is aware, (but) the buyer accepts the physical condition of the property at the date of the contract. 'The purchasers were entitled to opt in or out of the conditions as they chose. In this case the contract is binding. The house was on the market for £4.5million and Mr and Mrs Griffiths had agreed to buy it for £3.6million before reading a surveyor's report . 'These clauses are very common. The vendor is a lay person in matters of law...the purchaser is an eminent QC with property expertise. 'There is no suggestion that the vendor had to sell or the purchaser had to buy. 'The property was accepted in the physical state it was in at the time of contract and you can't go back on that now. 'If it is damp, it is accepted with damp. It cannot be rejected post-exchange on grounds like this,' he concluded. The manor also boasts a helicopter pad, pictured as well as gym, cinema and staff quarters . But Stephen Brown, for Mr and Mrs Griffiths, disputed the meaning of the controversial clause in the contract, and accused the sellers of 'reckless misrepresentation' in relation to the state of the house before contracts were exchanged. He said: 'It was assumed by Mr and Mrs Griffiths that they were buying a pristine property. Laughton Manor was originally built between 1760 and 1780 although it is unknown how much of the original building remains. It was bought by Sir James Duke Bart, a Lord Mayor and Sheriff of London in the 1840s. He was a close friend of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and admired their summer residence of Osborne House, which also has a similar Italian style tower to Laughton Manor. The Duke's family lived in the property for more than 70 years and it was sold in 1911 to a private buyer. In 1930 it was bought by the Ministry of Health, who used it as an office until the 1990s. It was then bought over and restored to its former glory by a private owner. 'They didn't want to have to spend a lot of money on the inside of the house, (but) our survey suggests a reduction of £600,000 to take account of the problems with the property. 'Part of the misrepresentations was that they had fully refurbished the house and that it didn't suffer from damp or rot.' The barrister added: 'The place had substantial rising damp and wet and dry rot. The property has been materially misrepresented to them in light of the surveyor's report.' Mr Brown said that the report indicated there was 'extensive rising damp, dry rot and timber decay which may affect the structural integrity of the house,' mainly focused in the lower ground floor of the building. Mr and Mrs Griffiths had also objected to the sale of a plot of land adjacent to the property to another buyer, the court heard. Welshman Mr Griffiths attended Haverfordwest Grammar School, before graduating from Oxford. He was called to the bar in 1974 and made a silk in 1993. His areas of expertise include planning and property law, and he has been called 'one of the sharpest barristers in the land' by The Times. A surveyor's report indicated that there was 'extensive rising damp, dry rot and timber decay' which may affect the structure of the house . He also plays a leading role in the MCC and was a trustee of the Lords Taverners. Mr Seitler said outside court that Laughton Manor has now been sold to another purchaser for the same £3.6m price. Mr Hardy now lives in Lewes with his wife, manages a church, and has business interests valued at £17m. The High Court hearing continues.","William Griffiths QC and wife Angela exchanged contracts on Laughton Manor .

"Actress and former Miss America Vanessa Williams has spoken out about being molested by an 18-year-old girl when she was only ten-years-old and how it's had a negative impact on her psychologically. Vanessa Williams opened up on Oprah's Master Class and spoke about a traumatic summer before she entered the fifth grade when a much older 'cool girl' performed oral sex on her when she was staying with her friend's family's friends in California. Even though Williams thought that her friend's family friend's daughter was 'cool' at first she knew that what happened between them 'wasn't supposed to be happening.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

'She made you want to feel like you were a grown-up.' One night when Williams and her friend were sleeping, the older girl sneaked into their room and woke Williams with a strange request. 'She told me to lie down on the floor. She took my bottoms off and she said, 'Be quiet,' Williams says. 'She went down on me.'

'Had that not happened in my life and had I had an opportunity to have a normal courtship with a boyfriend at 16 or whatever... there wouldn't have been that shame that was always haunting me.

It was another fun night at The Silver Dollar Bar here in Jackson.' Another local at the bar, David Henneberry, said: 'I happened to be there.

Pippa first piqued NBC's interest in June when her interview, where she chatted over tea about her sister and Prince George, brought in high ratings for the network. It is expected that Ms Middleton, a former party planner and cookbook author who has been writing occasional columns about sports and lifestyle, will continue to focus on these subjects in her new role. NBC has declined to comment when approached by MailOnline. It is highly unlikely that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits.

"Ashoka Mukpo's battle against Ebola officially ended Tuesday as the NBC cameraman tested negative for the deadly virus for the third consecutive day. 'Just got my results. 3 consecutive days negative. Ebola free and feeling so blessed,' the 33-year-old tweeted from his Nebraska hospital bed. The Rhode Island native announced his good news along with a tweet of support to infected Dallas nurses Amber Vinson and Nina Pham as Pham's condition was officially upgraded to 'good.' Ebola free: Ashoka Mukpo's battle against Ebola officially ended Tuesday as the NBC cameraman tested negative for the deadly virus for the third consecutive day . Soon to go home: Mukpo tweeted the good news Tuesday as he prepared to leave a biocontainment unit on Wednesday . The Nebraska Medical Center said Tuesday afternoon that Ashoka Mukpo's blood tested negative for the virus. He will be allowed to leave a biocontainment unit Wednesday. Mukpo said in a statement that recovering from Ebola 'is a truly humbling feeling.' For the second day in a row, Mukpo heaped on the praise, thanks and answers to questions so many have had since he was admitted to the specially-equipped ward October 6 after contracting Ebola in Liberia. 'I fought and won, with lots of help. Amazing feeling,' he gushed. The knowledge that there's no more virus in my blood is a profound relief. I'm so lucky. Wish everyone who got sick could feel this.' Mukpo made sure to acknowledge his fellow Americans still fighting their battles against Ebola. Gushed: Mukpo gushed as the realization dawned on him that he's been given a second chance at life after coming face-to-face with the deadly illness . Scarier times: Here, Mukpo is seen being wheeled into the Nebraska hospital after flying back to the U.S. from Liberia October 6 . Where the struggle began: The freelance journalist from Rhode Island, was working as a cameraman for NBC in Liberia. His jet landed on Monday in Maine for refueling before continuing to Nebraska where he will be treated in a specialized bio-containment unit . Someone to go home to: Mr Mukpo and his girlfriend Helen have been together for four years and spent two living in Liberia . 'Still thinking about those nurses. Look forward to the day you two get news like this too...,' he wrote before signing off Tuesday evening. Not long before, the NIH announced that Pham's condition had been updated to good from fair. The 26-year-old's condition had evidently briefly worsened to fair as she arrived at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, late Thursday. Pham is one of two nurses in Dallas who became infected with Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the disease October 8. The other nurse, Amber Vinson, is being treated at Emory University in Atlanta. Still fighting: Before signing off Tuesday, Mukpo made sure to acknowledge his fellow Americans still fighting their battles against Ebola . Doing better: Hours before Ashoka's tweets, infected Dallas nurse Nina Pham's condition was upgraded from fair to good . When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama. Mr Mukpo later traveled to Tibet, where he was enthroned and honored as the ninth reincarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, 'the Mad Yogi of Kham.' A further twist in the cameraman's life: Trungpa, who is considered his father, is not his biological dad. His biological father is actually Mitchell Levy - a Jewish doctor from New York who was Trungpa's personal physician - whom his mother Lady Diana Mukpo was sleeping with at the time. When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama . The 33-year-old Mr Mukpo remains a Buddhist. But, despite his wild family history and divine lineage, he has rejected the path of a monk. Instead, he chose a life working for nonprofits and has said his calling is to help alleviate suffering in the world. After his father Trungpa died in 1987, his mother married his biological father, Dr Levy and moved to quiet suburban Providence, Rhode Island. Mr Mukpo's father was a hard-drinking, womanizing Buddhist luminary who founded the first Buddhist monastery in the West and taught the likes of Davie Bowie, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Joni Mitchell in the 1960s and 70s. Chögyam Trungpa was known for his wild, hedonistic Tantric parties that were fueled by drugs, booze and sex. He frequently seduced and slept with his students - claiming that it would help them on their path to enlightenment. Mukpo's girlfriend Helen Finlay had traveled to Nebraska Medical Center, where Ashoka is being treated, along with his parents Dr Mitchell Levy and Lady Diana Mukpo (left) He died at age 48 in 1987 from complications from extreme alcoholism after founding the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery in Galloway, Scotland, and the Shambhala Mountain Center outside Boulder, Colorado. His mother is Lady Diana Judith Mukpo, born Diana Pybus, the daughter of a wealthy London lawyer. She attended Benenden School, an all-girl's boarding school in Kent, England, where she is thought to have been a contemporary of Princess Anne and Baroness Manningham-Buller, former Director General of MI5. In December 1968, aged 15 and on her Christmas break from Benenden, Diana met 28-year-old Chögyam Mukpo, or Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche as he was known as a lama, at the Buddhist Society in London’s Eccleston Square. In the documentary Tulku, she recalled the first time she laid eyes on the monk, saying: 'I felt like I'd known him for lifetimes. Just immediate, instantaneous lifetime connection. and the rest is history.' She later sneaked out of her boarding school stole into his hotel room that night. She later recalled that she had been hoping that she would end up in bed with him when she introduced herself. Trungpa, who had been having sex since age 13, obliged. Trungpa had traveled to Britain in 1963 on a scholarship to study at Oxford University after fleeing the Chinese occupation of Tibet, and shortly before meeting Diana, he had been teaching David Bowie about Buddhism. In 1970, Diana, just 16 and the Tibetan guru, aged 30, ran away to Scotland to marry. The sensational story of the lawyer's teenage daughter who ran away to marry a monk nearly twice her age became front page news.","Mukpo, of Providence, Rhode Island, contracted Ebola while working in Liberia as a freelance cameraman .

"Former Lehman Brothers CFO Erin Callan now says she regrets letting her Wall Street career consume all her time, keeping her from having a personal life . The former finance boss of Lehman Brothers has revealed she deeply regrets the sacrifices she made for her job and told working women: 'It's not worth it'. Erin Callan, who was Chief Financial Officer at the bank and one of the most powerful women in finance,  says the price she paid to rise to the top of the male-dominated Wall Street world was too high - and that she regrets not having children. Callan, 47, revealed that the lack of balance in her life led to her divorce from her first husband, because she would never do anything on the weekends except sleep to 'recharge' or get an early start on Monday's meetings. 'Sometimes young women tell me they . admire what I’ve done. As they see it, I worked hard for 20 years and . can now spend the next 20 focused on other things. 'But that is not balance. I do not wish that for anyone,' she says. Her confession comes amid . increased debate over women in top positions, triggered by Facebook exec Sheryl Sandberg . and Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer. They have called on women to be more vocal . in their attempts to break through a male-dominated culture but have still committed to work huge hours. Sandberg, 43, has urged women to 'lean in' to their careers before having children, rather than step back in order to prioritise family. The mother-of-two has sparked uproar by claiming women 'self impose' limits on their careers - but she has been accused of failing to recognise that most people cannot afford nannies that allow them to pursue a big career. Now Callan has entered the debate with a moving op-ed in Sunday's New York Times where she discusses trying for in vitro . fertilization with her new husband and the 'devastation' she felt after . losing her job in 2008. Callan says she's spent a lot of time reflecting on the choices she made since resigning just months before the storied investment bank declared bankruptcy, triggering the Great Recession. Callan said she used to spend every waking second thinking about work or glued to her Blackberry, something she now believes was unnecessary . Having fun: Erin Callan says that since she lost her job in 2008 she has been able to focus on her personal life and her new marriage . 'I couldn’t just rally and move on. I did not know how to value who I was versus what I did. What I did was who I was,' she says. She has now re-married and is a stepmother. She said she and and her second husband are 'hoping' to conceive her first child through artificial means. 'I have spent several years now living a different version of my life, where I try to apply my energy to my new husband, Anthony, and the people whom I love and care about. 'But I can’t make up for lost time,' she concedes, now acknowledging that 'most importantly' she does not have children of her own, a far cry from a woman who admits she spent every waking second glued to her BlackBerry. 'I have often wondered whether I would have been asked to be C.F.O. if I had not worked the way that I did. Callan believes she still could have reached an important position in her career even if she had put more of an effort into her personal life . Lean in: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, left, has made news with her book encouraging women to make more of an effort to get ahead in their . professional lives while Marissa Meyer, CEO of Yahoo! has banned employees from working from home . As in her book's title, Sandberg says women must 'lean in' to their work as they consider starting a family rather than leaning out, as they usually do . 'Until recently, I thought my singular focus on my career was the most powerful ingredient in my success. But I am beginning to realize that I sold myself short. 'I was talented, intelligent and energetic. It didn’t have to be so extreme. Besides, there were diminishing returns to that kind of labor,' she now realizes. 'I didn’t have to be on my BlackBerry from my first moment in the morning to my last moment at night. I didn’t have to eat the majority of my meals at my desk. 'I didn’t have to fly overnight to a . meeting in Europe on my birthday. I now believe that I could have made . it to a similar place with at least some better version of a personal . life. Not without sacrifice — I don’t think I could have “had it all” — . but with somewhat more harmony.' Facebook Chief Operating Officer . Sandberg has made headlines with her book 'Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead', . which she says is a call to push feminism forward. The business exec, who has a personal wealth of $500 million, urges women not to 'lean back' when it . comes to their lives, but to 'lean in' - give it 100% in all areas of . their life - so they can 'have it all.' One of her core beliefs is that the reason why the percentage of women in senior government and business roles in the U.S. has not risen above 14 per cent is not just down to institutional sexism, but due to women’s unconscious self-sabotage. She warns of the dangers of female self-effacement, hesitancy and over-thinking. She identifies priorities for women who want to break through the glass ceiling and join her in the corporate stratosphere. First, they must ‘sit at the table’ at work, literally and metaphorically. Don’t hang around in the background but push forward in the self-confident way men do. Second, they must ensure their husband or partner does an equal share of the domestic duties. Finally, and this is the big one, in typical management-speak jargon she says they mustn’t ‘leave before they leave’ — i.e. if a woman plans to have children, she must keep working and striving for promotion to the bitter end. ‘Keep your foot on the pedal until the very day you need to leave to take care of a child,’ she says.","Erin Callan's devotion to her career triggered collapse of her first marriage .

"The holodeck was a refuge for countless stressed crew members on the USS Enterprise, allowing them to escape the isolation of space. Now researchers in the US are hoping to bring Star Trek-style technology to future long-duration space missions in an effort help astronaut's keep their sanity. The 'Virtual Space Station' will act as a source of refuge for astronauts, as well as a computerised therapist that will check on their mental health through a series of programs. Escape plan: The system will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that Oculus VR is developing, with the addition sounds and smells that could help change an astronaut's mood . Dartmouth College's Digital Arts Leadership and Innovation lab, or Dali, is currently creating the technology for the system with funding from Nasa. The system will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that Oculus VR is developing, with the addition of sounds and smells that could help change an astronaut's mood. It will 'trick the brain and make people feel as if they are in a variety of beautiful and calm settings, such as with their family at home or strolling on the beach,' Darmouth Professor Lorie Loeb said. For instance, an astronaut's virtual reality program could include photos and video of their spouse and children, images of a beach, sounds of waves crashing, odours of saltwater and suntan lotion and a fan to simulate ocean breezes. The holodeck was a refuge for countless stressed crew members on the USS Enterprise, allowing them to escape the isolation of space. Now researchers in the US are hoping to bring this Star Trek-style technology to future long-duration space missions in an effort help astronaut's keep their sanity . Houston, we have a problem: The system is designed to take care of an astronaut's mental health and prevent arguments on board long duration missions to the outer solar system . 'We will use state-of-the-art virtual reality technology to help with the effects of isolation,' added Nook Harquail, the lead Dali designer and project manager on the project. Imagine a miniature robo-surgeon sliding into your body through an incision in your stomach. Once inside, the robot can expertly manoeuvre its way around the abdominal cavity, which has been filled with gas to make more room for work. It can then perform procedures such as an emergency appendectomy or perforate a gastric ulcer. This is the scenario being explored by Nasa in the hope that risky surgical operations in space will someday become a routine matter. Working in collaboration with Virtual Incision in Lincoln, Nebraska, the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely-operated fist-sized robot doctor. The 0.9lb (0.4kg) has two arms fitted with tools to hold, cauterise and suture tissue, while its head is a small video camera.The camera feed is sent to a control station, where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks. 'While this work is in an early phase, the minimal invasiveness of this approach could enable its use in remote locations such as on a moon or Mars colony,' researchers wrote in a technical paper on the prototype. 'We're building all the new technology for this project and doing the interface and interaction design work from scratch. 'Dali lab is porting the existing content to a JavaScript game and creating both the content and framework for the virtual reality component. 'People have long thought that virtual reality can be therapeutic in addition to being used in gaming and entertainment.' To upgrade the existing content, the Virtual Space Station system has been delivered for testing at the Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) Mission 3 which is starting today in Hawaii. A team of six members will spend eight months in simulated Mars habitat – double the length of the previous longest Hi-Seas mission. The Dartmouth team also plans to test the system in Antarctica, which is used as an analogue to long-duration spaceflights due to its isolation, length of stay and team composition. The current Virtual Space Station system includes a suite of multimedia programs, including self-guided training on conflict and stress management. The program also offers a six-session, self-administered depression treatment program guided by psychologist Mark Hegel, a professor at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and a co-investigator on the project. Astronauts currently have audio and video access to psychologists only when communication links are available. On longer missions like those to Mars, transmission delays will make real-time therapy problematic. Computer-based treatment offers an autonomous way to address these important problems. The latest system allows astronauts to seek help confidentially on their laptops and monitors their mental health and conducts therapeutic sessions. The program is designed for astronauts, but it could also be adapted to treat people on Earth. For instance, it could be used in rural areas where clinical help is limited or non-existent. The program is designed for astronauts on missions to places such as Mars (artist's impression pictured), but it could also be adapted to treat people on Earth .","The  'Virtual Space Station' will act as a source of refuge for astronauts .

"North Korea's presumptive No. 2 and other members of Pyongyang's inner circle met with South Korean officials today in the rivals' highest level face-to-face talks in five years. There appeared to be no major breakthrough from the meeting that came as the North's delegation visited the closing of the Asian Games in the South Korean city of Incheon. But the countries agreed to hold another round of talks between the end of October and the beginning of November, according to a South Korean statement. The specific topics discussed today weren't immediately known. Scroll down for video . North Korea's National Defence Commission Vice Chairman, Hwang Pyong So, left, North Korea's ruling Workers Party secretaries, Choe Ryong-Hae, a secretary of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, Kim Yang-Gon, and  South Korean unification minister Ryoo Kihl-Jae attend the 2014 Asian Games at Incheon Asiad Stadium; this was the first high-level meeting of representatives from both sides in five years .

South Korea's national security advisor Kim Kwan-Jin, left, shakes hands with Pyong So . The meeting allowed valuable contact between North Korea's authoritarian leader and senior South Korean officials after a year that has seen a steady stream of insults between the divided neighbors and an unusual number of North Korean missile and rocket test firings. One analyst called it a 'golden opportunity' for South Korean President Park Geun-hye to test North Korea's willingness to improve shaky ties. The South Korean statement said Park had been willing to meet with the Pyongyang officials, but the North Koreans were running out of time because they had to attend the Asian Games' closing ceremonies. South Korea said its prime minister, largely a figurehead but technically the No. 2 position, met with the delegation later Saturday. From left, Kim Yang Gon, a secretary of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party,  Pyong So, and Choe Ryong Hae, a secretary of  North Koreaís ruling Workers' Party, prepare to speak with South Korean officials . Pyong So shakes hands with South Korea's Unification Minister Ryoo-Kohl Jae during the meeting . The North Korean delegation to the games was led by Hwang Pyong So, the top political officer for the Korean People's Army and considered by outside analysts to be the country's second most important official after North Korea's supreme leader, Kim Jong Un. Hwang is also a vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission and a vice marshal of the army. Hwang and his delegation earlier had a closed-door lunch meeting with South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae and national security director Kim Kwan-jin. The visit comes amid rumours in Seoul about the health of Kim Jong Un, who has made no public appearances since September 3, and skipped a high-profile recent event he usually attends. A recent official documentary showed footage from August of him limping and looking overweight and mentioned he had been feeling 'discomfort'. John Delury, an Asia specialist at Seoul's Yonsei University said this visit of 'a very high-octane group' offers Park a unique chance 'to test the North Korean leadership's will and intentions'. One analyst called the meeting a 'golden opportunity' for South Korean President Park Geun-hye to test North Korea's willingness to improve their shaky ties . He added: 'Historically, North-South breakthroughs start from the top down, and if Park is serious that she wants to improve relations and jump-start the reunification process, this is a golden opportunity.' Both sides expressed hope for better relations in comments to the media ahead of the private meeting. It was a source of pride for all Koreans that the Asian Games were successful for both countries, which were in the top 10 for gold medals, said one of the North Korean officials, Kim Yang Gon, a secretary in the ruling Workers' Party. High-level North Korean visits to South Korea have been scarce since inter-Korean relations became strained after Park's conservative predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, took office in early 2008 with a tough line on the North. Attacks blamed on North Korea in 2010 killed 50 South Koreans. Pyong So walks into the meeting which took place after the North Korean officials attending the closing of the Asian Games in the South Korean city of Incheon . The last such senior visit south was in 2009, when high-ranking Workers' Party official Kim Ki Nam and spy chief Kim Yang Gon, the same official who visited Saturday, came to pay their respects to the late liberal South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. If no progress follows today's meeting, the rivals' strained relations will likely continue until Park, who took office in early 2013, finishes her single five-year term, said Cheong Seong-chang at the private Sejong Institute. The visit could also be part of an effort to show that Kim has no problem making high-profile political decisions and has no serious health issues, he said. North Korea boycotted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Summer Olympics, both in Seoul, but attended the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, the 2003 University Games in Daegu and the 2005 Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon.","Meeting took place after North Korean officials attended the Asian Games .

"Working-class people are much less likely to be openly gay than middle-class professionals, new research has revealed. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows large differences in the percentage of people identifying themselves as gay in different economic classes. Those in managerial or professional roles are 60 per cent more likely to describe themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual compared to those in traditionally working-class jobs, a study found. An Office for National Statistics survey shows people in professional roles are more likely to be openly gay (file picture) The ONS's Integrated Household Survey found that, overall, 1.6 per cent of people in the UK said they were gay, but pollsters believe the figure is likely to be higher as many people refused to reveal their sexuality. More than two per cent of those in middle class positions said they were gay, lesbian or bisexual, compared to 1.4 per cent in manual labour jobs. The survey also showed large differences between Britain's regions, with just 1.1 per cent of people in the North East describing themselves as gay, compared to 3.2 per cent in London. After the capital, the North West had the second highest rate of people describing themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, followed by the South West. Older people were less likely to be openly gay, while nearly three per cent of 16 to 24 year olds identified themselves as lesbian, gay or bisexual, the study showed. The percentage of men who described themselves as gay was double that of women who said they are lesbian. James Taylor, from gay rights charity Stonewall, said: 'While these statistics should be taken with a pinch of salt, as the ONS survey still fails to represent the full picture of modern Britain, it clearly demonstrates that there are many workplaces where lesbian, gay and bisexual people don’t feel able to be themselves.' He said the regional differences could be explained by people feeling less confident being open about their sexuality in rural areas with smaller gay communities. Stonewall say the figures may be unreliable due to those answering the survey being unwilling to reveal their or their housemates sexuality to those asking the questions.","Survey shows 2.2% of people in professional jobs say they're gay or lesbian .

"A woman police officer committed suicide after accidentally sending her husband a text message meant for her lover, an inquest heard. WPC Gail Crocker, 46, met  up with a man while her husband Peter, 49, was away on a business trip. She later wrote a message thanking the unnamed fellow officer, but sent it to Mr Crocker by mistake. Gail Crocker, 46, committed suicide after sending a text meant for a man she had dated to her husband . The mother of two wrote: ‘Thank you for a wonderful evening. Only wish we could do this more often.’  When her husband returned  home, she admitted to having a ‘one-off’ meeting with the male colleague but insisted it had never happened before. The couple, who had been together for 30 years, had an argument, and the next day Mrs Crocker took sleeping tablets and climbed into the boot of her car where she was found dead. Friends spotted her white Audi TT and Mr Crocker opened  the boot to find his wife’s body beside an empty pill bottle and  suicide notes. Mr Crocker said his wife had begged him for forgiveness when he got back from his trip. He told the inquest: ‘I got out [of the car] and she was in floods of tears saying she was sorry. ‘She told me it was a one-off and she had never done it before.’ Paying tribute to his wife, he continued: ‘She was my life. We had plans. Nothing was worth her taking her life. I’m lost without her.’ Mr Crocker found his wife's body in the boot of her white Audi TT in this car park at Hornick Hill, near St Austell . The inquest heard that Mrs Crocker sent the text on June 12 and the couple argued on Mr Crocker’s return to the family home in St Stephen, Cornwall, the next day, as well as the following morning. Mrs Crocker then called her husband at work and he became so angry that he threw his phone to the floor, breaking it. He arrived home later that day to find his wife had vanished and had called in sick to work. Mr Crocker told the hearing: ‘I got home and Gail was not there and neither was her car. I didn’t sleep at all. I didn’t hear from Gail during the night.’ The following morning a couple who were close friends with the Crockers spotted the missing officer’s Audi in a local car park. They called Mr Crocker, who discovered his wife’s body in the boot next to an empty sleeping tablets bottle and suicide notes written to him and the couple’s daughters Chloe, 22, and Gemma, 25. Consultant pathologist Ilona Hopkins recorded the cause of death as an overdose of sleeping pills and painkillers. Mrs Crocker's husband, Paul, told the inquest in Truro, pictured, that he was 'lost' without his wife of 30 years . Returning a verdict of suicide, Emma Carlyon, coroner for Cornwall, told the hearing in Truro that Mrs Crocker’s death resulted from a deliberate act to take her own life. In a tribute to Mrs Crocker, her colleague Robin Hogg said: ‘I will always remember her as an excellent officer with a bright, happy and positive disposition. ‘Her work and work ethics were of the highest standard and I am particularly proud of the way she performed her duty.’ He added: ‘Gail leaves a husband and two daughters who miss  her deeply and are very proud  of the role she carried out in  the community. ‘Her loss leaves a huge hole in the police family and this will be felt by all who knew her. ‘She was more than just a colleague; she was a good friend to us all.

"As the world's richest man, you might think Bill Gates would part with some loose change to pay someone to do his dishes. But the billionaire won't have any of that. He likes to do them himself - to his own exacting standards every night. The 58-year-old Microsoft founder shed light on his domestic habits and other personal insights during an online question-and-answer session on Reddit.com. Alongside more high-brow topics of philanthropy and government spying, Gates shared the eyebrow-raising revelation that his wife would likely want Samuel L Jackson to play her husband in a biopic. Unlikely casting: Billionaire Bill Gates (left) has revealed in an online chat session that his wife, Melinda, would be pleased if Samuel L Jackson (right) were to play her husband in a biopic . When asked who he'd want to portray him in a biopic, a reader interjected with Jackson. Gates responded, 'Melinda would probably watch that version.' He confided that his most expensive guilty pleasure purchase was his private plane which he uses for travel in connection with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And he admitted that he would still pick up a $100 bill if he found it on the street. When asked to reveal a secret about himself which no-one would expect, Gates said: 'Playing Bridge is a pretty old-fashioned thing in a way that I really like. 'I do the dishes every night - other people volunteer but I like the way I do it.' Life of luxury: The Microsoft founder confided that his most expensive guilty pleasure purchase was his private plane which he uses for travel in connection with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . When asked which actor he would like to play him in a movie, another user answered 'Samuel L Jackson' for him. To which, Gates retorted: 'Melinda would probably watch that version.' Of his jet, he said: 'Owning a plane is a guilty pleasure. Warren Buffett called his the Indefensible. 'I do get to a lot of places for Foundation work I wouldn't be able to go to without it.' Gates also gave his views on philanthropy, government snooping and his return to a hands-on role at Microsoft to assist newly-appointed chief executive Satya Nadella. 'Satya is taking a fresh view of where Microsoft is - strengths and weaknesses,' Gates said . 'A new person gets to step back and change the focus in some ways. He is off to a great start.'

Gates noted that he doesn't plan to stay at the office for days at a time as he did in his younger days when he had 'energy and naivete' on his side. He expected to give about a third of his work time to Microsoft and the remaining two-thirds to the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife. He dismissed the notion of being the biggest philanthropist, contending that while he gives a lot of money to charitable causes, aid workers living in difficult conditions sacrifice more than he does. When asked his thoughts on US spy agencies snooping on computer use, Gates described it as a 'complex' issue that will grow in importance as cameras and sensors in devices collect more information about users. 'We need to have trust in the way information is protected and gathered,' Gates said. 'There is a role for the government to try and stop crime and terrorism but it will have to be more open.'","Microsoft founder fielded personal questions during online chat session .

"The handsome Brazilian accused of being one of the world's worst serial killers has spoken for the first time about his murder spree, chillingly claiming that 'when the thing comes... you have to do it.' Tiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha, 26, is accused of killing at least 39 people, mostly young women, homeless people and transvestites, during seven terrifying months in Goiania, southeast Brazil. Most of his victims were allegedly gunned down from a motorbike as the loner, who worked nights as a security guard, cruised the streets of his home city. The youngest was a 14-year-old schoolgirl who was shot dead as she walked along a road in January, and at least 16 of his victims were women. Tiago Rocha, 26, breaks his silence about his murder spree in Goiania, southeast Brazil . The confessed killer chillingly says he was filled with anger, and  'when the thing comes... you have to do it' Speaking Friday to Brazil's Jornal Nacional news programme on TV Globo, Rocha said he was motivated by 'a great anger' and that killing was the only way to 'get it out of his system.' He said: 'I tried to do other things to get it out, but they didn't work.' And he indicated that the number of people he has murdered could be much higher than police investigating the crimes had originally believed. Claiming he started killing at the age of 22 — three years earlier than detectives had known — he said: 'There could be 41 or so, I can't really remember.' Rocha said he would choose a victim entirely at random after pondering over murder for 'some days.' He said: 'The first time I did it I got frightened. But there's no other way is there? When the thing comes and you have to do it.' Asked what the 'thing' was, he said: 'There's no way of explaining it. It's a really great anger. I would think over it for some days. 'There was no type. Man or woman, that had nothing to do with it. But they had to be people I didn't know.' Rocha claims he started killing at the age of 22, three years earlier than detectives had known, and added: 'There could be 41 or so (victims), I can't really remember' Rocha said he had been bullied at school: 'I was quieter than the other kids. I suffered mental and physical aggression. 'I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but these things accumulate inside you.' He also said he had been sexually abused by a neighbour when he was eleven years old. He said: 'It was for about a month. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone. I've never told anyone.' Asked what he felt the morning after a murder, he replied: 'I wasn't happy, no. There was the feeling of regret for what I'd done.' He added: 'If I have a disease, I'd like to know what it is, and also if there is a cure. I'd like to ask for forgiveness, but I think it's too difficult to ask for forgiveness right now.' This is the moment confessed killer Tiago Rocha, 26, described his 20th murder to police . Meanwhile, members of Rocha's family have spoken of their shock at his arrest and televised confession. His aunt, who didn't want to be named, said she still didn't believe her 'humble and polite' nephew was guilty of the shocking series of murders. She said: 'He was brought up without a father and as his mother needed to work, his grandparents looked after him. All he did was go out to work and look after his mother. He doesn't have a girlfriend, he's not the type to go out to parties, he doesn't have friends. 'He is a humble and polite person. He finished his schooling, did a course to work as a security guard and got a job. 'I don't think he's guilty. The police are trying to put this on anyone because there is so much pressure from the press and the families of the victims.' His aunt added that Rocha's 72-year-old grandfather has been rushed to hospital twice in the last few days after suffering anxiety attacks. 'We are all on sedatives. There have been fainting and crying, and no one in the family can face going to work. It's too difficult for us to believe. 'He's a laid back guy, he was working in a good job and sorting his life out. Why would he be killing people for nothing?' Pictured here two of the victims, 24-year-old Janaina Souza (left ) and Barbara Costa, 14 . Victim Ana Maria Duarte, 26 . Victim Wanessa Felipe, 22 . But others who knew him said they were shocked but not surprised. A married woman who claimed to have had an affair with  Rocha, her neighbour in the Vera Cruz 2 district of Goiania, said that he turned aggressive after she called off the relationship when her husband became suspicious. She said: 'At the start we had a lot of fun. He even looked after my children at times. While I was with him he didn't show himself to be this monster they're talking about.' After she put an end to their affair in November 2013, he continued to live for a time in a dwelling at the back of the couple's home. The woman, who didn't want to give her name, said: 'He would shout and swear, slam the door, and keep looking over at us with a face contorted with rage. 'Some times he would just walk in to our house without being invited. 'There was occasions when I would be looking at myself in the mirror and suddenly I'd see his reflection looking at me.' A hammer, knives and handcuffs were some of the items seized by the special police task force . Cops walk Rocha into the Goias Civil Police station after his arrest . One childhood friend who grew up with Rocha and was in the same class as him in school said he was always a quiet and introspective young boy. The man, who didn't want to be named, said: 'I grew up with him, I'm absolutely horrified. 'He was bullied at school, because he was tall and gangly. Kids on the street called him names because he was lanky and strange. 'We never saw him with a girlfriend. I think all of this was an outlet of everything he was keeping inside.' On Friday, Rocha's mother also spoke for the first time, telling Brazil's Globo G1 website: 'I'm certain that he is innocent. I and my whole family are devastated. 'It is impossible for us to believe that he could kill even one person. Imagine all of these things they are saying he did.'

"A government solicitor allegedly thought it a quantum leap for a 14 year old girl whose breasts were fondled by a licensed carer to allege 'sexual interference'. A child sex abuse inquiry has been told the NSW social services department, DoCs, was informed by a welfare officer in 1983 of the abuse of Leonie Knight by the man running the Bethcar home for Aboriginal children in Brewarrina, in the state's northwest. A government solicitor allegedly thought it a quantum leap for a 14 year old girl whose breasts were fondled by a licensed carer to allege 'sexual interference' Ms Knight has told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse she was frequently molested and then raped by Burt Gordon who ran Bethcar with his wife Edith and their son-in-law Colin Gibson from 1969 to 1989. Gibson was jailed in 2007 on two sentences of 12 years and 18 years but Gordon died before the case against him reached court. The commission is examining how the State of NSW handled civil litigation commenced in 2008 by 15 former residents of Bethcar who were beaten and raped at the home, some when they were as young as five. The NSW Crown Solicitors Office (CSO) employed solicitor Evangelos Manollaras and briefed barrister Patrick Saidi to defend the claim. Senior solicitor at the CSO Helen Allison supervised the case until 2010. On Friday, Ms Allison who is on day-two of her evidence, defended her advice to reject settlement and defend the case. She said there were question marks over the state's duty of care to the residents even though Gordon had a licence from the NSW government. The commission has heard DoCs officers working at Brewarrina reported abuse at the home from 1980. A letter from Mr Manollaras to Mr Saidi commenting on a statement from one of those officers was read on Friday. Mr Manollaras commented that Ms Knight had exaggerated her account of abuse by Gordon. She had complained Gordon comforted her by hugging her and fondling her breasts. The commission is examining how the State of NSW handled civil litigation commenced in 2008 by 15 former residents of Bethcar home for Aboriginal children in Brewarrina, in New South Wale's northwest . The solicitor wrote, '... a distressed child could be comforted in a normal manner by a hug and a kiss. Granted I am having a problem with the fondling of breasts, but I still think it is a quantum leap, even if there was some fondling of breasts, to conclude sexual interference.' Ms Allison agreed on Friday that it did reflect a serious misunderstanding of what sexual abuse of a minor might involve. 'Look I don't accept what was said there at all', Ms Allison said. On Thursday, Ms Allison said she had a hands-off approach to supervision of the case. Evidence has been given that each of 15 plaintiffs was asked to prove they had been abused, even though the state had already jailed one of the abusers, and that the state rejected mediation even after a district court judge suggested it. The case was finally settled at mediation earlier this year. The hearing continues in Sydney.","Leonie Knight told Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that she was frequently molested and raped by Burt Gordon .

"A baffled couple have been ordered by the council to pull down their garage, driveway and wall - 30 years after planning permission was given. When Janet and Barry Ashdown bought their home in Holderness, East Yorkshire in 1986 one of the main attractions was the large extended double garage, which had been recently been built. But now East Riding Council claims the extension – built with a previous council's planning permission – is encroaching on a public footpath, even though there is a 4ft wide tarmac strip running past their house. Janet Ashdown standing next to the garage and wall that the council are insisting is pulled down . The problem became apparent when the retired couple, who are looking to rebuild their garage, noticed that the previous owners hadn't registered the extension with  Land Registry and decided to apply for 'possessory title' or squatters’ rights. Their research revealed that planning permission had been given for a change of use for the land from an amenity area to a private garden in 1983, and plans for a garage extension and driveway were granted the following year. The Ashdowns even have a letter from the former Holderness Borough Council in 1985, confirming that a boundary wall put up the following year conformed to official specifications. Mrs Ashdown, a retired milliner, said: 'There's never been an objection in 30 years and we can’t see what they will achieve apart from a bit of extra grass they will have to maintain. 'I don’t know why they want to make an issue of this other than that they can and they have the financial backing to do it. But it will cost us thousands of pounds – savings we hoped to put to better use in our retirement.' The Ashdowns even have a letter from the former Holderness Borough Council in 1985, confirming that a boundary wall put up the following year conformed to official specifications . On April Fool's Day 1996, the new unitary East Riding of Yorkshire was established. The Ashdowns live in Holderness in the East Riding . Villager Harry Buck, 85, who has been a councillor for 40 years, said: 'In my mind this is total silliness, stupidity and lack of common sense on the part of the East Riding. 'The original land the footpath was on is untouched and nothing is encroaching on the path that's there now.' On April 1, 1996, Humberside and the borough were abolished, and it became part of the new East Riding of Yorkshire council.","Janet and Barry Ashdown bought house in Holderness, East Yorks, in 1986 .

"One of the ‘ordinary’ people referred to in Ed Miliband’s keynote speech this week is a 27-year-old PhD student who attended a £14,000-a-year school, it was revealed today. Beatrice Bazell - who is currently studying at Birkbeck, University of London - was brought up in a £900,000 home and attended St Helen and St Katherine girls’ school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Her father, chartered accountant Barnaby Bazell, 61, said she had gone to Mr Miliband with a story about how she and her peers had no opportunities and saw themselves as being in a ‘black hole’. Scroll down for video . 'Ordinary': Beatrice Bazel is a 27-year-old PhD student who attended a £14,000-a-year school . Gave her a mention: Throughout his speech, Labour leader Ed Miliband (picturedd) referred to the ordinary people he was concerned about and wanted to fight for in Number 10 . Mr Bazell told The Sun reporters Daniel Sanderson and Katie Hodge: ‘Beatrice has had every opportunity we could give her. And she’s done very well. She had a good education. 'She went to an all-girls private school. Her studies have cost me a great deal of money. She might be feeling a bit gloomy about the job prospects of people her age, but she can have no complaints.’ The father, who is married to Felicity, 57, added that Miss Bazell obtained straight As at A-level and a first-class degree. And The Sun claimed he has spent £250,000 on his two daughters’ educations. Some of St Helen and St Katherine’s alumni include the Prime Minister’s wife Samantha Cameron, her sister Emily Sheffield, Radio 1 presenter Natalie Jamieson and Blue Peter host Lindsey Russell. While Miss Bazell was at the school her headmistress was Cynthia Hall - the wife of BBC director general Tony Hall, who is now in charge of Wycombe Abbey girls' school in Buckinghamshire. Oxfordshire home: Her father said 'she has had every opportunity we could give her' and has 'done very well' Privileged: Miss Bazell was brought up in a beautiful £900,000 home on this private road in rural Oxfordshire . Miss Bazell - whose sister Clemency, 24, is a Labour Party member - studied at the University of Sussex for a BA in English from 2006 to 2009, then did an MA in literature and culture there in 2010. She met Mr Miliband while walking with her friend Helen Goodman - also 27 and a PhD student, at Royal Holloway, University of London - to the ponds in Hampstead Heath, north-west London. Miss Goodman insisted they spoke to him, and they discussed jobs and finances. The Labour leader told in his speech how they ran up to him - but had been hoping for actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Miss Bazell is currently studying Victorian women's bodies in art, photography and literature. She said on Twitter last night: 'Thanks for the interest, but I'm not talking to journalists.' £14,000-a-year education: She attended St Helen and St Katherine girls' school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire .

He told Labour activists that he had offered ‘Gareth’ a 'route map' to turning Britain around. Mr Miliband referred to the software developer called Gareth Edwards, 36, so often that his first name started to trend on Twitter. And he turned out to be a former Liberal Democrat supporter. Worse still, the young apprentice given a seat in the front row for Mr Miliband’s speech  - Elizabeth Shepherd, 20, from Bolton - said she had been left unconvinced about whether to vote for him. He also mentioned Xiomara who 'works in a pub near where I live', told a story about ‘Josephine’, a struggling cleaner, ‘Rosie’ - a doctor from Devon - and ‘Colin’, who he met in hospital but later died.

Acid has been thrown on the chairman of the allotments' car, which has also had its windows smashed, as the violence continues to escalate. Scroll down for video . Two intruders were caught on CCTV entering Nuns Moor allotments, Newcastle upon Tyne, before they smashed greenhouse windows and tore vegetables out of the ground . Caught in the act: The thugs, who are also thought to be responsible for cutting waterpipes and slashing polytunnels, have not been caught . Attack: One of the thugs appears to be wearing a beekeeper's mask as they vandalise the allotment plots . The attackers, who are yet to be caught, were seen on camera entering the greenhouses with their faces hidden. They are believed to be the same people who attacked Nuns Moor allotments' chairman Karen Brown's car, as well as putting up posters of her around Fenham, Tyneside. Ms Brown, a 51-year-old manager at the Care Quality Commission, said: 'I was at home watching TV in my living room when I heard windows smash outside my front door. 'I ran to the window and saw glass all over the drive. It's terrible, I'm really shaken up. 'I don't feel safe in my own home and I'm scared to walk down the street in fear of being attacked. I've lost trust in my community.' Repairs to the car cost more than £200, and she has also had to pay for her greenhouse to be fixed after 11 windows were broken and the door was kicked in. Karen Brown, chairman of the allotments, has had to pay hundreds of pounds for repairs to the greenhouses and her car, which has also been attacked . The masked intruders wreaked havoc in the greenhouses, tipping over plants and smashing windows . Acid attack: Ms Brown's Mini Cooper has been scratched and even had acid thrown on it by the vandals . The posters outside Ms Brown's home, some of which say 'Get Karen Brown out', were the final straw, with the harassment forcing her to quit. Signs attacking Ms Brown have been put up around the Fenham area of Newcastle, forcing her to quit from the allotments' committee . 'It's inconceivable what they've done, they've undermined me and I will step down as chairman in January,' Ms Brown, who has worked with disadvantaged children for 20 years, said. 'A lot of gardeners want me to resist it but now that they've come to my home, it's a very different matter. 'These attacks are all about causing gardeners pain, people are scared to go back to the site and are leaving their gardens messy. 'This has resulted in our landlord wanting to shut some of the site down.' Fellow committee member Paul Florentine had his show crop of leeks slashed and polytunnels destroyed. The vandalism, which took place throughout the growing season, also saw retired Robert Robson's car scratched with keys outside his allotment. A meeting was held over how to keep the site open and it was decided to close off some of the plots. Inspector Alan Davison, from Northumbria Police, said: 'Police are aware of ongoing issues at Nuns Moor allotments and we are working with the allotments working group to tackle these issues. 'Measures have been put in place and officers are carrying out regular patrols.'","CCTV shows hooded thugs sneaking into allotments to smash greenhouses .

"Richard Rodwell, the man who was tricked into believing his wife's two children were his for years appearing on This Morning . A man who discovered that the son and daughter he raised into their teenage years were not his was last week awarded £25,000 in damages after suing his ex-wife for deceit. Today Richard Rodwell appeared on This Morning to talk about the landmark case and insisted he has 'no regrets' about ordering the DNA tests that ultimately destroyed his relationship with his children Adam and Laura. Mr Rodwell was a devoted father and family man until his marriage broke down. After the divorce he paid regular child maintenance for more than four years to his ex-wife Alison, from his salary as a factory manager. But in 2008 Mr Rodwell ordered DNA . tests after hearing rumours about his daughter’s paternity – and the . results showed that each child was fathered by a different man. Following the results, the children cut off all contact with him. He claims his ex-wife turned them against him. Today . on This Morning Mr Rodwell spoke of his devastation at discovering the . children he has raised as his had in fact been fathered by two different . men. He said: 'It was like a bereavement, words can't say how I felt. I wouldn't wish any bloke to go through what I've been through. 'I've been robbed of having my own family ... I can't have children now.' Last week Mr Rodwell’s solicitor, . Roger Terrell, said: ‘The court treated it as akin to bereavement, . awarding a similar sum to the one you would receive if your child died . in an accident, which is £11,800. ‘I think in this case, the county . court judge went further than that because of the level of deceit and . the fact that Mr  Rodwell’s new wife is too old to give him children, so . he has lost his chance of fatherhood.’ This Morning host Eamonn Holmes asked Mr Rodwell if he has since doubted his decision to pursue the DNA tests. Mr Rodwell replied: ''I think the children need to know who their real father is. 'I have always said i will always be there for them as their step-dad and I wish that they will contact me in the future. 'I wanted justice ... money doesn't mean anything ... I just wanted justice ... to see the deceit laid bare. 'I have no regrets.' Mr Rodwell told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that he has no regrets about ordering the paternity tests . Happy family: Adam and Laura are all smiles during a swimming session with loving 'father' Richard. Both children were fathered by different men . Speaking last week Mr Rodwell, 46, from Peterborough, said: ‘It’s like a bereavement because I have lost the children I believed were mine. ‘I treated them both as if they were my own. I was there at their births, went to their Nativity plays and helped them with school homework. ‘I can’t stop thinking about the children as they were my life.  I always wanted children and grandchildren and now it’s too late in life for me. ‘The children were the most important people in my life, and now they have gone. Wedding day: Richard with Helen at King's Lynn Register Office in June 1990. After the couple divorced in 2004, Helen was granted custody of the children and Mr Rodwell paid a total of £15,600 in maintenance . ‘But I had to do the DNA tests. There was a whispering campaign going on that the children weren’t mine and I needed to know. I couldn’t live with the uncertainty any longer.’ Mr Rodwell started dating Helen, now 44, in 1989 when they were both fruit-packers at a factory near King’s Lynn, Norfolk. They moved into a caravan together and in 1990 married at King’s Lynn Register Office. They had 60 guests at the reception at a village hall. 'She has never even said sorry' Laura was born in 1992, with Mr Rodwell present at the birth and signing the birth certificate. Two years later Adam was born, with Mr Rodwell still  having no reason to suspect that Helen had been unfaithful. Mr Rodwell said: ‘My life seemed complete. We had moved into a house, I was happily married, had a good job and two healthy children – what more could I want?’ But by 2004 the marriage  was struggling. Mr Rodwell explained: ‘Helen was disappearing for several days without telling me where she was going.  I only found out from used train and coach tickets I discovered. ‘I would collect the children from school as usual and walk into the house and it would be empty with no note or anything. Helen would go to places such as Newcastle or Manchester, and if I asked why she had gone there she would say, “Nothing to do with you.” ’ So sad: Richard and his second wife Trudi. His relationship with Laura and Adam has 'all gone' When the couple divorced in 2004, Helen was granted custody of the children and for the next four years Mr Rodwell paid £300 a month maintenance for both children. His total bill was £15,600. Four years after the divorce he began hearing rumours that Laura, now 20, was not his daughter. Mr Rodwell said: ‘People said Laura didn’t look like me and that Helen had been seeing a teacher who lived next door on the caravan park. ‘I confronted Helen on the phone but she insisted I was Laura’s father. Finally I said  I wanted DNA testing.’ The DNA test was done by mouth swab and when the result came back  Mr Rodwell was stunned. He said: ‘When I saw the letter stating that  I wasn’t Laura’s father I just broke down. ‘When I phoned Helen we had an argument and she just said, “What did you expect.” She didn’t even say sorry.’ Mr Rodwell didn’t tell Laura but he described in court documents how her attitude changed towards him. He said: ‘She didn’t come to see me and if I saw her in the street she would make obscene gestures with her  fingers and on one occasion even kicked my car.’ Laura also posted a cruel message on Facebook that read: ‘I hate you so much, I reali [sic] loved you so when you called me your little angel I take it you was just saying it and you start all that after 16 years you have ruined mine and adams life I hope your happy for what you have put us through!!’ Mr Rodwell also decided to have a DNA test done to check Adam’s paternity. ‘I still have no idea who is Adam’s father,’ he said. ‘For nearly 17 years I cared for Laura as my daughter and for Adam for over 14 years and now it’s all gone. It’s so sad. ‘I would have been happy to have a close relationship with them as a stepfather but Helen wouldn’t allow this and told them to keep away from me.’ Mr Rodwell was awarded compensation in 2011 of £12,500 for each child, and costs of £25,000. He also won a court order forcing his ex-wife to move out of the marital home, which is now up for sale for £119,995. Mrs Rodwell yesterday declined to comment.","Richard Rodwell was a loving father until his marriage broke down .

Both of them angelic blondes when these photos were taken, they’ve now evolved very distinctive styles. Scroll down for video . Stars in the making:  A young Tess Daly pictured on a family holiday (left) and Claudia Winkleman sitting in her garden .

Now married to TV presenter Vernon Kay, 40, she has two daughters of her own. Miss Winkleman, 42, who is the daughter of former newspaper editor Eve Pollard and publisher Barry Winkleman, has changed her appearance dramatically as she has grown up. The curly blonde hair she had as a toddler in this garden picture have been replaced by straight, dark brown locks. But as the photo makes clear, she has sported her trademark fringe since childhood. After she appeared without a fringe on last Friday’s first live Strictly episode, viewers called for her to revert to her customary look and she promised to bring it back in future shows. In an interview with Tatler magazine, the mother-of-three said: ‘The fringe is here to stay. I will never wake up and think, “I’ll tell you what I need – some curls.” Or, “I think it might be time to buy a crimper.” Or, “What I’m craving is a new look”.’ Miss Winkleman, 42, (left) who is the daughter of former newspaper editor Eve Pollard and publisher Barry Winkleman, has changed her appearance dramatically as she has grown up .

"The first culottes I ever saw were in Jackie magazine. Though I was a 15-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent and only just waking up to the idea of fashion, I remember thinking how ludicrous they looked. But Agnetha and Frida from Abba wore culottes, so I ventured to Chelsea Girl to try on a billowing blue pair. I left empty-handed because they looked far too grown-up and dwarfed me. Culottes, a strange skirt/shorts hybrid, are said to have the practicality and comfort of trousers, but the feminine look of a skirt. Not seen much since the Eighties, this season they’ve staged a comeback and are everywhere on the High Street, spurred on by designers such as Chloe, Marni, Joseph and Valentino. I’ve never owned a pair. Working as a TV presenter for more than 20 years on Blue Peter and GMTV, I learned the importance of clean lines and shapes, and what suits me. At 5ft 6in, I’m not tiny, but prefer to elongate my legs. And having lost a stone in the past year, I like well-fitting clothes that show off my shape.

"If your snoring is the bane of your partner's life, then you might just have a new excuse. Scientists have discovered that the tongues of some people who snore are extra large. It's already well-known that being overweight or obese increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which leads to snoring because the airway becomes blocked. Until now, it was thought that a large neck was to blame. Obese people with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) - which causes snoring - were found to have larger tongues than those without the condition, due to extra fat deposits in their tongues . Now, however scientists say piling on the pounds can also cause a fat tongue - which may well be the culprit. U.S. researchers found that obese people with OSA had a higher percentage of tongue fat - especially at the base of their tongues - which made their tongues larger overall. This was compared with obese people who didn't suffer from the sleep condition. Increased tongue fat might prevent the tongue's muscles from positioning the tongue away from the airway, causing snoring because the airway becomes blocked, researchers said. They added the study might provide an explanation for the link between obesity and sleep apnoea - and said screening to identify fat tongues may could help diagnose the condition. It's known that obesity is a major cause of obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition where the throat closes repeatedly during the night. Snoring occurs because the airways become narrowed, or even completely blocked, preventing the body from getting enough oxygen. In severe cases, the brain jolts the body awake, causing the airway to reopen. The person may wake up repeatedly without knowing it, increasing their heart rate and blood pressure and preventing deep sleep. OSA is a relatively common condition that affects more men than women. Most cases of OSA develop in people aged 30 to 60 years old, although it can affect people of all ages, including children. In the UK, it is estimated around 4 per cent of middle-aged men and 2 per cent of middle-aged women have OSA. Treatment options for OSA include: . · lifestyle changes – such as losing weight, cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side . · Using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device – these devices prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask . · Wearing a mandibular advancement device (MAD) – this gum shield-like device fits around your teeth, holding your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleep . · Surgery – this is considered as a last resort if OSA is thought to be the caused by a physical problem that can be corrected surgically, such as an unusual inner neck structure . Source: NHS Choices . Long term, sleep apnoea is linked with a number of chronic diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and depression. The new study, carried out at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, involved 90 obese adults with OSA and 31 adults without it. The participants underwent MRI scans to obtain a high-resolution image of their upper airways, and the fat deposits in their tongues were analysed. In addition to making the tongue larger, increased tongue fat might affect the way muscles attach the tongue to bone, preventing these muscles from positioning the tongue away from the airway, the researchers said. Future studies should look at whether removing tongue fat through losing weight, carrying out upper airway exercises or surgery would work as a treatment for OSA, they added. Dr. Richard J. Schwab, of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in the U.S. said: 'This is the first study to show that fat deposits are increased in the tongue of obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea.' Dr Timothy Morgenthaler, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine said doctors should look at tongue size when screening for OSA. He said: 'Tongue size is one of the physical features that should be evaluated by a physician when screening obese patients to determine their risk for obstructive sleep apnoea. 'Effective identification and treatment of sleep apnoea is essential to optimally manage other conditions associated with this chronic disease, including high blood pressure, heart disease, tType 2 diabetes, stroke and depression.' The study was published in the journal Sleep. In September, a Chinese doctor who snored for years due to OSA performed surgery on his own tongue to cure the problem. He claims the procedure, in which he put tunnels on the back of his tongue to stop it from collapsing, has worked and he no longer snores. In the UK, it is estimated around 4 per cent of middle-aged men and 2 per cent of middle-aged women have OSA. Experts say doctors could begin screening tongue size in order to diagnose the condition .","Being overweight or obese causes obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)

"The owner of a racy coffee stand where baristas serve customers while wearing bikinis has angered local residents after she posted cruel comments on the business’ Facebook page about a customer’s size. The war of words between Meghan Calavan, who owns the self-styled ‘sexy sailor coffee shop’ Sips Ahoy, and Jesseka Cladek from Anacortes, Washington, has escalated out of control since just before Christmas. According to Meghan, the trouble started after someone – believed to be a friend or relative of Jesseka - posted a nasty comment on the stand's Facebook page. Meghan Calavan, right, is the owner of the self-styled 'sexy sailor coffee shop' Sips Ahoy, she and her staff have been accused of cyber-bullying Jesseka Cladek, left . Jesseka says that Meghan responded by posting a series of vulgar and hateful comments referencing the women's weight and appearance. Meghan also reportedly criticized Jesseka's appearance, calling her ‘fat,’ advising her to ‘save world hunger by shooting yourself’ and telling another commenter that ‘the world would be a better place if [Cladek] died.’ ‘What if I was unstable and actually did kill myself?’ Jesseka asked King5. ‘Words have an impact on people.’ The Sips Ahoy Facebook page has since been taken down, but another Facebook page, Boycott Sips Ahoy, has launched and quickly amassed 4,700 followers. Jesseka Cladek, right, says that Meghan responded by posting a series of vulgar and hateful comments referencing her weight and appearance . Its stated aim is to put the coffee kiosk out of business and it has posted screen grabs of the original comments made by Meghan. ‘I've never had to be scared for my life or ever thought someone wish I were dead,’ wrote Jesseka on the Boycott Sips Ahoy page. Many posts call for the coffee shop's imminent closure, accusing it of cyberbullying. ‘I made this page to close Sips Ahoy down. We don't want this place of business in our small town,’ the administrator states in the About section of the new Facebook page. As news of the incident has spread in the small town of 16,000 people, Meghan and her family have become the target of threats and even violence. Meghan has admitted that she and her staff are now scared and that she is sorry for getting involved in the dispute . Sips Ahoy is a coffee shop in Anacortes, Washington, where the baristas serve customers while wearing bikinis . She lives with her father, Kelly, and their home was recently egged and his vehicle dented. One poster on the Boycott Sips Ahoy page even suggested that someone should put urine or gasoline in a super soaker and burn the coffee stand down. Meghan told King5 that she and her staff are scared and that she is sorry for getting involved in the dispute. 'I stuck up for myself in an immature manner, I know,' she told King5. Police say the dent in the Calavans' car means the incident could become a felony investigation. They have advised everyone involved to stop and take a deep breath before someone gets hurt. Meghan has said she is sorry for her part and claims she's learned an important lesson, while Jesseka has asked for everyone to stop the negative comments and actions.","Meghan Calavan owns the self-styled 'sexy sailor coffee shop' Sips Ahoy in Anacortes, Washington .

"Charged: Nicolas Holzer has been indicted on felony charges for killing his parents, sons and dogs . A man who told sheriff's deputies he had stabbed his elderly parents, his two sons and the family dog with kitchen knives because it was 'his destiny' has been charged with murder and animal cruelty. When authorities asked Nicolas Holzer, 45, why he had murdered his family in Goleta, California in August, he responded: 'I had to.' On Tuesday, Santa Barbara County prosecutors announced that a grand jury indicted Holzer on felony charges that include special allegations. Prosecutors haven't decided whether to seek the death penalty and Holzer remains jailed without bail. Prosecutors say he grabbed knives from the kitchen on August 11 and killed his father William, a 73-year-old well-respected scientist, in the den. He then stabbed his two sons, 13-year-old Sebastian and 10-year-old Vincent, while they slept in their room, authorities said. Then he attacked his mother, Sheila, 74, in the doorway of the boys' bedroom before finally murdering the family pet, an Australian Shepherd-type dog, in the  hallway. Afterwards, he called 911 to calmly admit to what he had done, police said. 'Holzer subsequently told detectives he had killed his family to fulfill what he believed was his destiny,' Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover said at the time. Murdered: Holzer stabbed his sons, 13-year-old Sebastian and 10-year-old Vincent, multiple times in August . 'I had to,' he told deputies, the Lompoc Record reported. The victims were all dead from multiple stab wounds when deputies arrived at the home about 11pm. They also found two large kitchen knives. Holzer was taken into custody without incident. Before the killings, Nicolas Holzer, who has no criminal history, had repeatedly called and visited the Sheriff's Office to make a series of bizarre claims, a source said, the Santa Barbara Independent reported last month. Loss: He also stabbed his father, prominent scientist Dr Bill Holzer, left, and his mother Sheila in their home . He told officers that he knew the location of the missing Malaysia airliner, that he was responsible for the Deltopia party riots in April and was the ghostwriter of Elliot Rodger's manifesto, the source said. Last month, Holzer's defense attorney Christine Voss entered a plea of 'not guilty' on behalf of her client but said there is a possibility it might change in the future. 'I entered the not guilty plea on his behalf and then we'll address whether or not we're going to enter a not guilty by reason of insanity plea down the road,' Voss told KEYT - but added she was not comfortable addressing his current state of mind. The unemployed dad-of-two had lived in his parents' home for about seven years with his two sons. He had been awarded full custody of the boys after divorcing their mother nine years earlier, the Record reported. Crime scene: A body is removed from the family's home after the grisly killings on August 11 . William Charles Holzer, who had a PhD in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, was a respected scientist who had previously worked with Raytheon, an aerospace defense company. A neighbor described Dr and Mrs Holzer as active members of the community, but said the home never seemed happy - and that Dr Holzer still had to work part-time to provide for his grandsons. The neighbor told the Santa Barbara Independent that the incident was 'not unexpected' and that he had told the doctor to come and get him if there was ever a confrontation in the house. 'It's sad and tragic,' the neighbor said. 'I know [the Holzers] wanted the best for their son and did what they could to help him... You just never know what happens behind closed doors.'","Nicolas Holzer 'grabbed two kitchen knives and stabbed his 73-year-old father William, a well-respected scientist, to death in their den in August'

"First daughter Sasha Obama cut a stylish figure in jeans and shades as the Obama girls visited the Great Wall of China today. Michelle Obama, Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12, were left alone to explore the Mutianyu section of the historical landmark in the northern Beijing suburbs though Chinese police officers looked on protectively. The three walked a stretch of the wall that looks out to a massive rock inscription on a hillside that reads in Chinese: 'Loyal to Chairman Mao.' The country has been fascinated by Mrs Obama's 'elegance' during the weeklong visit to the country to promote educational exchanges between the U.S. and China. Sasha Obama, left, cut a cool figure in shades as she wandered the Great Wall of China with her mom and sister . U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters visited the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall in Beijing on Sunday . Mrs Obama has also been photographed at famous spots including the Forbidden City during her trip, which marks the first time a U.S. president's wife has traveled independently to China. The first lady has won compliments for her elegant clothing and her interactions with ordinary people in a country where it is rare to see leaders' spouses or children in public. 'She is very warm and frank, and when she is talking to people she conscientiously listens to what they have to say,' said Wu Qing, a retired professor of Beijing Foreign Studies University who met Mrs Obama on Sunday. 'In China, we usually use weather to express our mood or state of mind, so the fact that the weather has been so nice these few days means she is very welcome in China,' Wu said. Earlier Sunday, Mrs Obama hosted a discussion about education and told Chinese professors, students and parents that she wouldn't have risen to where she was if her parents hadn't pushed for her to get a good education. 'Education is an important focus for me. It's personal, because I wouldn't be where I am today without my parents investing and pushing me to get a good education,' the first lady said. 'My parents were not educated themselves, but one of the things they understood was that my brother and I needed that foundation.' The White House women were left alone to explore the Mutianyu section of the historical landmark in the northern Beijing suburbs . Michelle Obama arrived in Beijing on March 20 with her mother and daughters to kick off a seven-day, three-city tour to focus on education and cultural exchange . She said she and her husband wanted as many young people as possible in the United States and the world to have access to education. She then hosted a roundtable with a handful of Chinese professors, students and parents at an event at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that was attended by new U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus and closed to the media. On Saturday, Mrs Obama gave a 15-minute speech at China's prestigious Peking University in which she promoted the free flow of information and freedom of speech, the only time during her trip that she has brought up a contentious issue. China routinely filters out information deemed offensive by the government and silences dissenting voices. Those remarks by Mrs Obama were absent from China's state media but were circulating in social media, where they were widely praised. 'I was very impressed by her speech mentioning freedom of speech,' said Zhang Lifan, an independent historian who said he had read about it in overseas Chinese media. 'Although the Chinese constitution guarantees freedom of speech, Chinese citizens don't really enjoy that right. I think she just reminded China in a polite and mild way that not allowing freedom of speech is not conducive to China.'

A Chinese police woman stands guard from the wall as U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, visit the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China in Beijing . The trip, the first time a U.S. president's wife has independently visited China, also has given Mrs Obama an opportunity to engage with President Xi Jinping's wife, Peng Liyuan. On Friday, the two first ladies toured a Beijing high school, where Mrs Obama tried her hand at calligraphy and pingpong and visited with students who had built robots. She also met with Xi that evening. On Tuesday, she will visit a high school in the southwestern city of Chengdu. Students who met Mrs. Obama praised her affability. 'She was so approachable,' said Lu Yuhong, 16, who guided the first lady in writing the Chinese character 'eternal' in calligraphy at the Beijing school. Mu Rongduomijia, 16, said she traveled Saturday from the northeastern city of Dalian to Beijing, hoping to hear Mrs. Obama's speech. Instead, she waited outside for glimpses of the first lady's entourage. 'It was touching to see so many people waiting for her arrival and departure, and that's because of her personal charisma,' Mu said, noting she was impressed with the manners of Malia and Sasha. Mrs Obama, Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12, and her mother, Marian Robinson, who is also traveling with them, will visit the cities of Xi'an and Chengdu before returning to Washington on Wednesday.

"Ed Miliband indulged in a spot of misty-eyed grandstanding in Glasgow yesterday morning. ‘This was a vote for No because we know we are better together,’ he opined. ‘To all the people who voted Yes, this Labour Party is determined to show that we can be the vehicle for your hopes, your dreams, your aspirations, for a better life for you, a better life for Scotland, a better life for the whole of the United Kingdom.’ It was windy stuff, packed with the sort of vacuous platitudes we’ve come to expect from a Labour leader who in recent weeks has looked more out of his depth than the Loch Ness monster. ‘Let us be able to tell our children, to tell our grandchildren, that we did not just keep our country together, we changed our country together . . .’ and so on. Scroll down for video . Misty-eyed grandstanding: Mr Miliband in Glasgow with Alastair Darling and Scottish Labour's Johann Lamont . What he neglected to admit, of course, was that his own role in the No campaign has been shambolic from start to finish, culminating in the cancellation of an appearance in Edinburgh by his nervous minders after he was hijacked by a baying mob of 300 nationalists at a shopping centre. The irony is that Labour, and by extension, its leader, should have been able to take for granted a huge bedrock of support in Scotland, where it has 41 MPs. With David Cameron’s ‘toff Tories’ being so toxic in Scotland (which has never forgiven Margaret Thatcher for the poll tax), it was always clear that Labour voters would decide the outcome of the referendum. But Miliband had long neglected Scottish voters – and the Labour machine north of the border had become too complacent. Three years ago, when Miliband was asked by the BBC to name the three contenders for the leadership of the Scottish Labour Party, he couldn’t. In recent months, he has been a relative stranger to Scotland, visiting only seven times since April. The first occasion was to preside over a shadow cabinet meeting in Glasgow, which was rightly dismissed by the nationalists as a pathetic PR stunt. Significantly, four of the seven visits came in the past two weeks, after panic gripped the Labour hierarchy when a poll put the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time. Far from providing a robust, inspiring leadership for the No campaign, Labour has on the whole been negative, unfocused, riven with personality splits, littered with political mistakes, and undermined by a sharp drop in membership which means the party could not mobilise enough troops. Mutiny: Labour leader Ed Miliband faced a backlash from his own MPs over his take on English devolution . As the campaign progressed, it became clear that Ed Miliband had little to offer disillusioned Labour voters north of the border, other than a risible pledge that by voting ‘No’ they had nothing to worry about because he would be Prime Minister after the next general election. Tellingly, a poll published in the past week revealed that Cameron leads Miliband by 17 points among Scottish voters: a devastating indictment for a Labour leader. One of Miliband’s silliest ideas was the call for English towns to fly the Saltire to ‘show we achieve fairness, equality and social justice better together than we do apart’. The idea was ridiculed north of the border. Miliband also failed to persuade Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, Britain’s largest trade union, to deploy his vast army of members on the streets of Scotland. Desperate gamble: Miliband joined the other party leaders to make an 11th-hour pledge to Scots . But it was the Labour leader’s decision to sign an 11th-hour joint statement with Cameron and Nick Clegg, promising Holyrood more power after a No vote, which was not just a desperate gamble but a major strategic error. It was perceived in Scotland as a gift for Alex Salmond. The SNP leader used the declaration to portray the Labour Party as being in bed with the ‘hated Tories’. Wherever Miliband and his entourage went after the declaration, they were drowned out by well-organised Yes campaigners armed with megaphones and chanting ‘traitors’ and ‘red Tories’. One of the reasons the campaign lacked passion was Miliband’s decision to gift the leadership of the Better Together campaign to Alistair Darling, a likeable man of total integrity – and zero charisma. A better choice would have been John Reid, who held a string of Cabinet posts, but stood down when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister. He was untainted by the economic collapse, and as a tough street fighter would have been more adept at countering Salmond’s unscrupulous wheeling and dealing. Even after Darling’s woeful performance in the second TV debate with Salmond, the Labour leader resisted pressure to call up Brown, who has a huge following in Scotland, where he has been an MP since 1983. But there was a problem: having worked closely alongside Brown for a decade, Miliband knows better than anyone how much the former PM and Darling despise each other. Brown was also barely on speaking terms with Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, and Labour’s international aid spokesman, Jim Murphy – two other key figures in the Better Together team. Thus, for months the bitter personality disputes that tore the last Labour government apart kept the biggest beast in the Scottish Labour jungle off the campaign trail. Only when Darling was visibly shrinking under the weight of responsibility was Brown unleashed, to spectacular effect. Surge: On the eve of the poll, Brown delivered one of his finest speeches, which was steeped in history, and rippling with passion and fervour, all of which were noticeably absent from Darling’s workmanlike offerings . On the eve of the poll, Brown delivered one of his finest speeches, which was steeped in history, and rippling with passion and fervour, all of which were noticeably absent from Darling’s workmanlike offerings. So why didn’t Miliband appeal to Brown sooner? One senior Labour source told us: ‘Gordon has been at his brilliant best, galvanising our supporters and sending bolts of energy through the campaign. He has been making the headlines for all the right reasons. Ed has been made to look very small by comparison in the past seven days. It’s why a lot of Ed’s people didn’t want Gordon to the fore.’ Equally, Miliband’s decision to rush into a joint statement with Cameron and Clegg – which had not been cleared by his own party – infuriated Labour frontbenchers such as Ed Balls. They woke up yesterday to hear Cameron pledging, in return for the increased powers he promised to Scotland, that for the first time English legislation will be the responsibility only of English MPs. A Labour source said: ‘Miliband has castrated our 40-odd Scottish MPs. It could be disastrous and put us out of power for a generation. Serious up-and-coming Scottish politicians won’t want to go near Westminster. Gordon Brown might have had his faults, but if this rule is enforced it means MPs like Gordon would never have set foot in Westminster. No wonder the likes of Ed Balls are cross.’ Labour MPs are left asking themselves: if Ed Miliband couldn’t mobilise mass support in a country where the Tories are a spent force, what chance has he got of winning over doubters in the Conservatives’ southern heartlands?","Labour leader has long neglected Scots voters before the historic poll .

"A new Australian study has warned teenagers who are deemed a 'healthy weight' can still be suffering anorexia nervosa . Teenagers do not need to be severely underweight to be suffering from a life-threatening eating disorder, experts have warned. A dramatic drop in weight should be a cause for serious concern, suggesting an adolescent could be at risk of severe medical problems. A new study carried out at Australia's Murdoch Children's Research Institute noted a fivefold increase in the number of teenagers being admitted to hospital fulfilling all the criteria for anorexia nervosa - apart from being underweight. The researchers examined a six-year period from 2005 to 2010, discovering more adolescents thought to be of 'normal weight' were suffering the illness. Despite not meeting the low weight criteria of the eating disorder, the teenagers were found to be suffering from acute, life-threatening medical complications of weight loss. Professor Susan Sawyer, director of The Royal Children’s Hospital Centre for Adolescent Health, said the research highlights that higher-weight adolescents who have lost a large amount of weight require careful medical assessment. 'Eating disorders can emerge at any weight,' she said. 'Clinicians need to have a high level of suspicion about a possible restrictive eating disorder in all patients who have rapidly lost weight or lost a significant amount of weight—even if the young person is not underweight at the time they present. 'There is poor understanding by health professionals, teachers and families of the risks of rapid, severe weight loss - at all weights. 'Most health professionals think ""underweight"" when they think of anorexia. 'It is therefore not surprising that many of these adolescents were very unwell by the time they were eventually admitted to hospital.' Lead researcher Melissa Whitelaw . said the dramatic increase in the proportion of adolescents admitted to . hospital who were not yet underweight reflects increasing rates of . obesity in adolescents. 'Obesity and eating disorders used to be considered as distinct health . concerns with little overlap in patient populations,' she said. 'This . data suggests that we need to be much more aware of the risks of eating . disorders emerging in adolescents who are overweight.' The research showed that while some of the patients had been advised by . a health professional to lose weight, none were being professionally . supported to lose weight at the time they presented with an eating . disorder. Researchers said this highlights the need for supervision of appropriate weight loss efforts in overweight adolescents. Professor . Sawyer, said: 'Regardless of their actual weight, clinicians consulting . with adolescents who have lost a large amount of weight should, among . other tasks, review the patient’s weight loss strategies to ensure they . are sustainable and safe. 'They should also carefully assess the patient’s cardiovascular health. Researchers noted a fivefold increase in the number of teenagers being admitted to hospital fulfilling all the criteria for anorexia nervosa - apart from being underweight - from 2005 to 2010 . 'For those adolescents who have rapidly lost a large amount of weight, anorexia nervosa should be considered.' Researchers said that due to a combination of factors including the nature of eating disorders, lack of parental awareness, lack of training in health professionals, and delays in accessing specialist services, there are often significant delays in making the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, even in adolescents who are very underweight. Both researchers are part of The Royal Children’s Hospital Specialist Eating Disorder program. The research was carried out by Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, The Royal Children’s Hospital and the University of Melbourne. Eating disorder charity, Beat’s chief executive, Susan Ringwood, told MailOnline: 'Eating disorders are complex mental illnesses that have serious effects on physical health too. It’s very helpful to make people aware that eating disorders are not just about being very underweight. 'We know you can’t tell if someone is ill just from the shape and size of their body. 'We also know that sometimes a strict measure of BMI is used to decide if someone is eligible for specialist treatment. 'This study shows how potentially dangerous that could be.'

"Two families from Wisconsin have accepted a settlement offer from General Motors after two teenagers were killed in their cars in a crash caused by a faulty ignition switch. Amy Rademaker, 15,  and Natasha Weigel, 17, were killed with the Chevy Cobalt they were passenger in crashed. A fault with the car's ignition switch turned off vital systems such as the power steering and airbags moments before the crash. The company knew about the fault, which affected more than two million cars before the accident in 2006 but failed to initiate a recall to fix the problem. Scroll down for video . Amy Rademaker, left and Natasha Weigel, right, both died in October 2006 following the crash in Wisconsin . The girls were both passengers in this Chevy Cobalt which went out of control on a rural road in Wisconsin . The girls' family accepted the offer after they dropped a lawsuit against the Detroit car giant which could have hidden behind bankruptcy protection in the event of a court case. Margie Beskau, mother of Ms Rademaker told CNBC: 'No amount of money can bring my daughter back. But I'm ready to be done with this.' Ms Beskau, from Woodville, Wisconsin said she feared the company would have invoked its bankruptcy protection if the case had been brought to court. 'We just felt we'd come out better financially and emotionally if we went ahead and settled. There was no guarantee we would win, so this seemed like the right decision to make.' Ms Rademaker's mother Amy Beskau, pictured, settled her case against GM dropping a high-risk legal action . Ms Beskau's daughter was sitting in the passenger seat of the 2005 Chevy Cobalt when the vehicle lost all power due to the defective ignition switch in October 2006. The car careered off the road smashing into some trees. Due to the fault, many of the car's safety systems failed. GM only initiated a recall of the 2.6 million cars fitted with the faulty switches earlier this year. The company has admitted it knew about the flawed switches for at least a decade before issuing a recall. The switches can unexpectedly slip into the 'accessory' position, shutting off the engine and disabling key features such as power-assisted steering, and the car's air bags. Congress and the Justice Department are investigating GM's handling of the recall. The car's driver, Megan Phillips, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, survived the crash but suffered permanent brain damage. The data recorder in her 2005 Cobalt showed that the ignition switch was in 'accessory' at the time of the crash. A Wisconsin state trooper investigating the crash made the connection between the defective switch and the air bags not deploying. A report commissioned by GM, and a separate report from a Congressional committee on the role of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said both the company and regulators were aware of the trooper's finding but largely ignored it for years. The automaker has set aside $400 million in its compensation fund and may pay out up to $600 million.","General Motors  admitted 2.6 million cars have the potentially lethal fault .

'I just put on some dance music and I thought she loves to dance so I made a video and sent it to her. It makes her laugh, it keeps her mind off it. 'My sister inspires me to be a better person. She's my wonder-woman.' Jennifer says she does her own dance to the song because she's not very good- but the comments left on the video seem to disagree . Speaking to camera at the end of her dance, Jennifer tells her sister: 'You're going to kick cancer's ass today because you're a badass sister. … I love you with all my heart and my soul' Despite Jennifer starting the video with the disclaimer that she isn't doing the real 'Dougie' dance associated with the song becasue she is 'not very good' at it', many of the comments disagree. 'I just kind of do my own dance selection because I'm not a follower, I am the leader of my own weird band,' Jennifer jokes before beginning her moves dressed in a simple stripy T-shirt and jeans. 'She's actually really good!' one person comments while another agrees saying 'I like her. She knew the words and she was on point.

"Attorney General George Brandis' membership of a men's only club has sparked a rowdy, chest-beating display in the Senate. Labor used question time on Thursday to embarrass Senator Brandis over his invitation to join Melbourne's men's only Savage Club, asking him to sing the club song and demonstrate the initiation ceremony. Senator Brandis unsurprisingly declined. Scroll down for video . Labor members used question time on Thursday to embarrass Attorney General George Brandis over his invitation to join Melbourne's men's only Savage Club . 'As the minister is responsible for anti-discrimination laws, can the Attorney General explain why his new club doesn't accept women as members, or is it because he believes sexists have right too?' Labor's Stephen Conroy asked. His comment was in reference to Mr Brandis controversially saying earlier this year he said people had the right to be bigots. Mr Brandis hit back calling the question 'flippant' and telling Mr Conroy to 'grow up'. Another Labor senator, Doug Cameron, then stepped up to spell out some of the club's initiation details. Labor senator, Doug Cameron, stepped up to deomstrate some of the club's initiation details including making guttural noises and beating their chests . 'He joins a club that has some bizarre rituals, that are unbelievable in a modern country,' he said. 'Bizarre rituals that require members, when they are greeting a new member, or when a new member is being initiated, to make guttural noises and beat their chests. 'This is what the Coalition frontbenchers are engaged in - it's like Tarzan calling on Jane.' Several Labor members started rowdily beating their chests as the Attorney General watched on. The Savage Club in Melbourne says it has no chest-beating ritual, despite Senators acting it out in Parliament . Liberal Bill Heffernan took it upon himself to stroll across the chamber and gently beat Mr Cameron on the chest as he explained the initiation. A bemused Senate deputy president Gavin Marshall later called on Mr Heffernan to explain his antics. 'I thought he was choking on his haggis,' he said, referring to Mr Conroy's Scottish heritage. Senator Brandis unsurprisingly declined when he was asked to sing the club song in the chamber . Labor's Stephen Conroy kicked off the rowdy debate by asking Mr Brandis why the club didn't except women . The Savage Club says it has no chest-beating ritual. Following accusations he was sexist, Mr Brandis revealed he belonged to three clubs, two of which allow both men and women. 'There is nothing against the law of Australia for there to be for example women only golf clubs, nothing against the law for there to be men's clubs, nothing against the law for there to be mixed clubs - nor should there, nor is that sexist,' he told the Senate.","Attorney General George Brandis was asked on Thursday about his invitation to join a Melbourne men's only club .

"Tony Abbott's budgie smugglers are 'confronting' - but we're not calling for them to be banned. That is the common refrain of the Islamic community to fierce calls for the burqa to be outlawed. The joke is told by community leaders such as Mariam Veiszadeh, by Muslims on the streets of  south-west Sydney and is the subject of a meme widely shared by the Islamic community on Facebook. 'It's a light hearted way of making the point.... if you want to dress down or dress up we should all be able to do it,' Ms Veiszadeh told Daily Mail Australia on Friday. Scroll down for video . Budgies: Tony Abbott's choice of swimwear has been labelled 'confronting' by Islamic community leaders, such as Mariam Veiszadeh. Controversial. but rare: For a brief moment, people who wear the niqab, pictured left and right, were to sit in a glass enclosure if they watched parliamentary proceedings. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, centre, has kyboshed the plan. Female leaders: Both Mariam Veiszadeh and Maha Abdo wear the hijab, rather than the niqab.

Burqa: Full body Islamic dress which covers the entire face. The face is covered with by a mesh grill. It is very rare in Australia. Information courtesy of Mariam Veiszadeh . The burqa debate - fuelled by conservative senators' calls and Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comment he finds the face-covering 'confronting' and 'wishes it was not worn' - has frustrated the country's Muslim community, who say only a tiny minority of women wear the full face covering anyway. For a brief moment on Thursday, there was even a plan to keep Muslim visitors who wanted to watch proceedings at Parliament House in a glass enclosure. The plan was quashed late last night by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, following community uproar and backlash from members of his own party. Islamic community leaders told Daily Mail Australia they are sick of the burqa (a form of dress where the face is covered by a mesh grill) being confused with the niqab, a more popular dress where the face is covered but the eyes are not. 'It (the burqa) is not common,' Ms Veiszadeh said. And while there are no reliable statistics, 'only a tiny minority' of Australian Muslim women wear the niqab, she said. A number of Muslim women told Daily Mail Australia that Australians who wear the niqab find it liberating, rather than oppressive, as critics have said. 'It's an amazing feeling of freedom,' said Maha Abdo, the executive officer of the Muslim Women's Association. 'You can see clearly, but no one can see you.' Ms Abdo chose to start wearing a hijab 30 years ago, but she has worn a niqab while spending time overseas. She said her headscarf reminds her of her spirituality. 'For me it's a reminder of my own purpose in this life and how to be the best that I can be,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Mary Succati, who sells Islamic clothing to women at a store in Greenacre, in south-west Sydney, agreed that the handful of people she knows who wear the niqab found the experience rewarding. 'They're not perceived as oppressed - they feel liberated,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The furious debate is occurring at a time of celebration for many Muslims. The Eid Festival, one of the most important dates in the religious calendar, will be held over the long weekend, concurrent with the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Friday was the busiest day of the year at Ms Succati's store for Islamic women. Her small shop was crowded with women buying new clothes for Eid. Ms Succati, who wears a hijab, was planning to keep her store open until midnight. Ms Succati's store in Greenacre has been bustling this week as Eid approaches. All types of clothing: Shop owner Mary Succati, who sells Islamic clothing in Greenacre, in Sydney's south-west. Shopping: Floral prints are the theme of the season at Ms Succati's store in Greenacre. Busy day: With Eid celebrations occurring at the weekend, Ms Succati's Greenacre store was packed with people. She does not sell niqabs in her store, but many women in niqabs come in to buy clothing for their children. The fashion of the season? 'There's a lot of floral at the moment,' Ms Succati said, with customers ditching drab winter clothing for more colourful, but still modest, spring wear. It will be a big weekend in Greenacre for another reason, too. The Bulldogs are facing off with South Sydney in the NRL Grand Final at ANZ Stadium on Sunday. Ms Succati's staff, avid Bulldogs supporters who insisted her store be decked out in blue and white, will be watching.","Muslim community leaders respond to burqa debate with quip about Tony Abbott's Speedos .

"Florida jurors for a second time have convicted the founder of the International Polo Club in a fatal drunken-driving crash. Jurors took four hours to convict 51-year-old John Goodman Tuesday of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide after a three-week trial. His 2012 conviction was overturned because of a juror's misconduct. Mogul John Goodman appears in court during his second trial, during which he was once again convicted of killing 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson in 2010 . Victim: Scott Patrick Wilson, left, drowned after the accident because he was strapped into the driver's seat. On the right, his mother Lili Wilson sobs during testimony . The Florida tycoon ran a stop sign in February 2010 and rammed his black Bentley into 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson's car, causing it to roll into a canal. Authorities say Goodman left the scene in Palm Beach County and waited nearly an hour to call 911. The defense argued that an inaccurate test elevated his blood-alcohol level that prosecutors said was 0.177, twice the legal limit to drive . They also argued they no longer had access to the Bentley to prove it may have malfunctioned. Florida tycoon John Goodman, who founded The Palm Beach International Polo Club, was granted in 2013 a retrial after a juror at his first trail was adjudged to have lied to get on the jury. Goodman was convicted of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in May 2012 and sentenced to 16 years in prison and a fine of $10,000. He was living under house arrest pending the decision of his appeal. Goodman's Bentley rammed into  Wilson's Hyundai and sent it into a canal in Wellington, in February 2010. Wilson, an engineering graduate, was strapped into the driver's seat and drowned. Juror Dennis DeMartin, 69, was accused by Goodman’s defense of juror misconduct after not disclosing his ex-wife's DUI during jury selection. 'A juror who deceives to get on a jury in a high profile case for his own profit is a trial lawyer's worst nightmare,' Goodman's attorney Roy Black wrote in a statement. Impact: The crumpled car driven by Wilson (left) and Goodman's back Bentley . DeMartin had also been the subject of an April 2012 motion for a new trial based on a 32-page book he had self-published about the trial. In the book, DeMartin wrote about a trial-related drinking experiment in the midst of jury deliberations, where he downed three vodkas one night to determine if Goodman was drunk on the night of the crash. The court decided that the book and drinking experiment were inappropriate, but didn’t deprive Goodman of a fair trial. The lying, however, changed the court's stance. Florida Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Colbath said DeMartin's antics had transformed an imperfect but fair trial into a ‘constitutionally impermissible proceeding.’ In his book, DeMartin wrote about his wife drinking, getting into an accident and being arrested for DUI. He said he had a stroke soon after and divorced his wife after she met someone else at a DUI program. ‘The Defendant contends, and this Court finds, that DeMartin concealed highly relevant information, namely, that his ex-wife had been convicted of a DUI,’ Colbath wrote. Deadly: Wilson family members look at the Bentley Goodman was driving when he ran a stop sign in 2010 . Goodman, the multimillionaire founder of one of world's largest polo clubs, claimed in court that his $200,000 car malfunctioned and lurched forward, slamming into Wilson's vehicle. He also denied being drunk at the time of the crash, although other testimony contradicted him and his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit three hours after the crash, according to prosecutors. Goodman fled the scene of the accident, authorities said. During his first trial, Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.' Goodman reached a settlement with the Wilson family and will pay out $46 million in compensation to them. Goodman also made headlines when he adopted his girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, in an attempt to preserve part of his fortune for her while negotiating a civil suit settlement. A Miami appeals court eventually reversed the ruling that allowed the adoption. During the original trial the judge said: 'These are horrible, horrible cases from a criminal justice standpoint. Scott Wilson's death was senseless. He was on the eve of fullness of life.' He added that the tragic case should serve as a warning to others as he said: 'Find a cab, find a friend. Don't drink and drive. 'This was a senseless, senseless accident because Mr Goodman chose to drive when he was too drunk.' According to Colbath, the severity of the original sentence had reflected the fact that Goodman knew what he was doing when the fled the scene of the accident without calling 911. 'To avoid the liability, the criminal responsibility, that he knew was going to visit him from the time of the crash, he willfully left the scene of the crash,' the judge said. 'It was because he wanted to figure out a way to save himself.' Bill: Jurors were shown Goodman's receipt for drinks, bought for himself and others before the crash . Wilson's mother Lili addressed the court, giving emotional testimony about her son. 'Sunday is going to be Mother's Day and Scott will not be coming home,' she said. 'By dying at such a young age, he will never get the opportunity to work as a professional after graduating from engineering school. 'He will never have the opportunity to marry and have a family of his own.' Goodman also took the stand, saying: 'I just wanted to say that from the day after the accident, all I've wanted to do is reach out to the Wilsons and be with them and cry with them. 'And I can't imagine or even pretend to imagine what it would be like to lose a son.' Prosecutors successfully claimed that Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into Mr Wilson's car two years ago, causing it to roll into a canal. The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes. Goodman left the scene and waited an hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts A-list celebrities . After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit. At trial Goodman said he was sure of one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to alleviate his pain. After leaving a bar, he said his car suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,' he said. Unable to control the vehicle, it slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not aware he had hit another driver so left the scene. If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed. Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported. 'I ... drank it to alleviate, thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the reason his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving level when his blood was taken three hours after the crash.","John Goodman, who founded the International Polo Club, was first convicted in 2012 but got a re-trial because a juror lied to sit in the jury .

"Father-of-three Stephen Fossey, 45, used his fruit and veg stall at Bacup market in Lancashire to illicitly lend money to up to 180 customers over four years . A market trader loan shark who boasted of interest rates  lower than Wonga and other legal payday loans firms has been ordered to pay back more than £100,000. Stephen Fossey, 45, used his fruit and veg stall  at Bacup market in Lancashire to illicitly lend money to up to 180 customers over a four year period. He typically charged between 25 and 30 per cent, which gives an annual rate of 1,355 per cent in comparison to legal online credit firms who have been known to charge up to 4,000 per cent annual interest on repayments. Fossey, from Rossendale, Lancashire, was caught after investigators from the England Illegal Money Lending Team were tipped off by trading standards officers who were investigating a black market tobacco racket he was running. It emerged the father of three had made a total of £325,473 over a period of four and a half years through the illegal money lending business so he could save up for pension. His assets included three properties in the Lancashire area, bank balances and cash seized at the time of his arrest. He has since been expelled from Bacup market. Last year, Fossey admitted engaging in a money lending operation, without a licence under the Consumer Credit Act, and two allegations of possessing criminal property. He was given a 12 month suspended prison term after a judge said customers 'spoke highly' of Fossey and revealed they were not frightened of him. However, yesterday he was hauled before Preston Crown Court and under Proceeds of Crime laws was ordered to back £103,000 within six months or face 21 months in prison. Earlier, the court heard Fossey - who has also operated a mobile greengrocer's shop for 25 years - had run his loan sharking enterprise between 2008 and 2012. He agreed to lend money to customers while conducting his fruit and veg rounds in Burnley and Rossendale and nearby Todmorden. During the investigation, 40 victims of the illegal business were traced who were able to verify that he had been offering loans, charging interest and offering no paperwork. Many of the victims confirmed that he had continued to lend even after he had been warned. Interest was added sporadically, but tended to vary between 25 and 30 per cent on top of the original loan. Some victims paid up to £200 on top of a £500 loan, and more than £1000 was added on to a loan of £3500. One victim spoke of how he had been repaying the loan for more than 10 years and believed he had paid back thousands of pounds. When he was struggling to repay, he was forced to take out further loans to pay off existing ones. At the point of Fossey's arrest, he was paying up to £130 a week and was told he still owed £2,500. The father of three was caught after officers were tipped off about his fruit and veg stall at Bacup market . Fossey, of Rossendale, Lancashire, arrived at Preston Crown Court with friends and family for the hearing in which he was ordered to pay back £103,000 within the next six months or face a prison sentence of 21 months . During a raid of Fossey’s home, Trading Standards officers found a carrier bag under his bed containing two bags of money, totalling £7,164, and documentation, in particular two notebooks, an address book and a black pad. Also seized was a hand- written letter addressed to 'Steve' and 'Phil' from one of those who had borrowed money. The notebooks were effectively records of loans Fossey had provided over the previous 13 months. Over that period alone there had been 196 loan accounts between the defendant and borrowers. Over 100 people had an account, some had more than one and 449 loans had been issued, including top-ups. The outstanding balance owed to Fossey was £93,918. At an earlier hearing, Fossey's defence lawyer Mark Stuart said: 'There is no suggestion any sort of pressure was put upon people to repay. 'He was charging far less a rate of interest than those of licensed money lenders. This was going to be a pot for him, having had no pension for his retirement. He has now lost £100,000 that was owed to him.' But Janice Hanson, Lancashire County Council cabinet member for public protection services, said: 'Illegal money lenders cause misery for some of our most vulnerable people and this case sends a clear warning that they will be pursued and prosecuted, and their assets seized. 'We will continue to work closely with the Illegal Money Lending Team and the police to protect people from loan sharks. 'If you or someone you know is in difficulty with a loan shark the best way to get help is to let us know what's happening by calling the confidential hotline.'","Stephen Fossey, 45, used fruit and veg market stall to illicitly lend money .

"Most people know lengthy, pretentious restaurant menus will hit you in the pocket - and now a major study has set the price at 11p per letter. Linguistics professor Dan Jurafsky came up with his claim after spending months analysing 6,500 menus, from Michelin-starred enclaves to cheap roadside diners. He said restaurants with longer, more complicated words in their descriptions would cost punters more, while cheap eateries tended to choose generic words such as 'tasty' and 'hearty'. Scroll down for video . Tough to digest: Long words on menus are a provable sign of high prices, says a study. Raymond Blanc's (left) Oxfordshire restaurant has lengthy words, as does the flasghip Chelsea diner by Gordon Ramsay (right) His research is published in a book called The Language of Food: A Linguist Reads the Menu and includes his observations on a wide range of culinary language. Only cheap diners feel the need to tell their customers the food is 'real', he writes, while expensive ones are more likely to tell their customers where it comes from. It was not so much the length of the menu description that was important, but the words within it. Cheap restaurants had rambling descriptions but which used easy-to-understand words, while expensive ones tended to be more to-the-point but with more obscure and lengthy culinary terms. By analysing 650,000 dishes in the 6,500 menus he found online, Prof Jurafsky, of California's Stanford University, calculated a menu with longer words would cost 18 cents (11p) more for every extra letter within them on average. Costly: A study claims longer words in restaurant menus add 11p per letter to the price. Pictured is Raymond Blanc's restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, where dishes like assiette (plate) of piglet cost £54 . Wordy: Customers at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, where three courses cost £95, can expect 'Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, cauliflower couscous, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth' He told The Sunday Times high-paying customers liked to be reminded that they were highly educated with lengthy or obscure menu descriptions. 'You're flattering your customers, but it's also a bit of showing off,' he told the newspaper. 'Cheap places can't do it because the diners want to know what they're getting.' Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxfordshire, touted as Britain's priciest restaurant, certainly lives up to the theory - up to a point. Exception: Heston Blumenthal's elaborate dishes have names such as 'meat fruit' and 'snail porridge' Its menu has words which would make many diners furrow their brows, including agnolotti (filled pasta similar to ravioli) of goat’s cheese for £42, assiette (plate) of piglet for £54 and Manjari (Madagascan) chocolate and raspberry chocolate for £28. Those without such deep pockets can head to the Oxford branch of Harvester, for the more humble 'juicy' bangers and mash (£4.99) or 'Tasty, flame-grilled chicken breast, served with a fluffy jacket potato and buttered peas' (£5.99). Compare that to Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, London, where three courses cost £95 - plus a 12.5 per cent service charge. Meals there include 'Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, cauliflower couscous, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth', 'Fillet of sea bass with shellfish and sea vegetable minestrone, coco de paimpol, fennel and lovage', and 'Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with oscietra caviar and sorrel velouté'. Marco Pierre White's restaurant Belvedere in Holland Park, west London, also uses exotic words - though its mostly resists telling its diners where there food has come from. Dish names there stick resolutely to describing the ingredients, which are expensive enough by themselves. The names range wildly from 'ballotine of guineafowl, petits pois a la Franciase and tarragon jus' (£18.50) to 'fillet of sea bass, spiced peppers, aubergine caviar, basil oil' (£19.50). There are some notable exceptions to Prof Jurafsky's rules, however. Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck in Bray, Bershire - where the tasting menu costs £220 per person - has famously pithy names for its dishes including simply 'snail porridge'. And at the TV chef's Dinner by Heston Blumenthal in Kensington, west London, names include 'meat fruit', 'rice & flesh' and 'savoury porridge'. That could explain why they're all around the 'cheap' price tag of £17 - by a celebrity chef's standards, at least. Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, Oxfordshire . 1. AGNOLOTTI (A type of pasta) 2.

"A two-year-old boy dressed as Captain America was hit by a bus on his first ever trick-or-treat outing and died by his grandmother's side. Dohntae Vasquez was thrilled about Halloween and had already been out with neighbors for several hours when the tragic accident happened. He was being pushed in a buggy across State Road 27, in Lake Wales, Florida, by a neighbor when the man suddenly realized he had dropped his cellphone. Tragic: Dohntae Vasquez was dressed as Captain America when he was fatally hit by a bus in Lake Wales, Florida on Friday night . He went back to get it, telling the toddler to stay put - but Dohntae jumped out of the buggy and ran towards his grandmother who was yet to cross the road. After fatally hitting the toddler, the bus driver immediately stopped. Adults present then tried to resuscitate the boy but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The bus driver was not speeding and told police she did not see the boy running into the street. She has not been charged. A passer-by, called Carole, had stopped to buy drinks at a store by the highway and witnessed the accident. Distraught: His grandmother was heard sobbing 'my baby, my baby' as Dohntae died by her side . The retired nurse told My Fox Tampa Bay: 'I came back out and I heard somebody screaming. My baby, my baby. 'There was nothing I could do. There was no saving the child I promised her I wouldn't leave her and I didn't until they took her by ambulance. She poignantly added: 'They will never have him for any of the holidays. It's something no-one will ever forget.' Ran across road: The toddler jumped out of his buggy and tried to cross State Road 27, in Lake Wales, Florida (above) when he was struck by the bus . One neighbor, Mary Brady, said the toddler's neighborhood are in grieving, adding 'I can't get it out of my head'. There was also tragedy in Vancouver on Halloween as a group were ploughed into by a drunk driver. Three were critically injured, while a seven-year-old girl has since died after falling into a coma. Cadence Boyer and her mother, 32-year-old Annie Arnold, were among a group of trick-or-treaters hit on Northeast 112th Avenue at 8:15 p.m. Friday, KPTV reports. Also killed: Cadence Boyer, seven, died yesterday. She was in a coma after being hit by a drunk driver on Halloween in Vancouver . On Saturday, Vancouver police said Duane C. Abbott, 47, of Vancouver, was speeding and intoxicated when his Ford Mustang shit the group. Police said Abbott was headed north on 112th when he hit the women and children, who were in Halloween costumes on a sidewalk near 39th. A 6-year-old girl, who is yet to be identified, also suffered critical injures, as did 30-year-old Chelina Alsteen. Arnold has been treated and released from the hospital. Jacob Holland, Alsteen's ex-husband, said she has made some improvements, but remains hospitalized with a shattered bone in her leg and a severe neck injury. Drink-driver Abbott is hospitalized and, pending discharge, will be booked into the Clark County Jail on four counts of vehicular assault, according to Vancouver police. Those charges may change depending on the conditions of the victims.","Dohntae Vasquez was struck by a bus on a street in Polk County, Florida .

"The five-year-old brother of a girl who was beaten and starved to death by their mother brought food to her funeral so she would have enough to eat in heaven, it was revealed. 'Monster mom' Carlotta Brett-Pierce was found guilty of murder last month and sentenced to 32 years to life in prison yesterday. Her four-year-old daughter Marchella died covered in bruises and open wounds and weighing only 19 pounds in September 2010. She was found drugged and beaten, tied to her SpongeBob SquarePants bed at the Brooklyn home. Tragic: Marchella Brett-Pierce, four, was found dead in September 2010, tied to her bed with jump ropes in her Brooklyn home . The little girl, who was force-fed allergy pills, was often beaten in front of her brother Tymel. Prosecutor Jacqueline Kagan revealed that Tymel, now seven, was deeply traumatized by the events he witnessed at home and still grieves for his sister. When he attended her funeral, he had brought food with him so that he could help his sister. Ms Kagan said: 'He brought with him food because he knew . she didn’t get enough. And he told his foster mother, ''I . hope that she gets enough food and water in heaven,''' according to the New York Post. The month-long trial of Brett-Pierce, 32, in a Brooklyn court room finished quickly on May 9 with the jury requiring only one hour to deliberate over her guilt. Defiant: Carlotta Brett-Pierce (center) as she was sentenced on Wednesday to 32 years to life in prison for the death of her daughter Marchella in 2010. Her mother Loretta was given up to 15 years for manslaughter . Self-pity: The mother has refused to take responsibility for the death of her daughter who was beaten and starved to death. Grandmother Loretta Brett (right) will also serve up to 15 years . When Marchella Brett-Pierce was found, she was tied to her bed with jump ropes, had been beaten, starved and drugged. Prosecutors say she had dozens of marks and open wounds on her tiny body which was so emaciated, every rib could be seen. Carlotta Brett-Pierce was emotionless . when the jury proclaimed her guilty of her daughter Marchella’s death. Her punishment did not even stop her from giving the judge some attitude . when asked if she understood. ‘I heard what you said,’ the 32-year-old said. Abused: Marchella was born prematurely with breathing problems and died when she was four years old . Accomplice: The girl's grandmother, Loretta Pierce, will serve up to 15 years for manslaughter . She has refused to accept blame for the death of her daughter, blaming the jurors, lawyers and the press for her murder conviction, calling it a 'tragedy'. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Patricia DiMango said yesterday: 'This child, at her tender age, was subjected to a hell that no one should have to endure. 'What kind of person could do this to a child, let alone their own child?' she said, according to DNAinfo.com . During the trial, Brett-Pierce’s answers painted a ghastly picture of their home life. She said of her daughter near the time of her September 2010 death: 'To me, at the time, it didn’t look bad.' Brett-Pierce . said that her daughter lost weight by running around in the heat and . sustained the bruises from falling in the stairway. Judge DiMango also sentenced grandmother Loretta Brett to five to 15 years in prison for manslaughter in the death. Throughout . the trial, her lawyers switched between disproving the prosecutions . tales of horrific beatings and arguing that Brett-Pierce was an . overwhelmed mother with a sick daughter that she didn’t know how to care . for. Marchella spent the . first three-and-a-half years of her life in hospital after she was born . prematurely with severe breathing difficulties. Her . mother admitted on the stand that in the seven months she was in her . care, she never took the four-year-old to a pediatrician. Gruesome: The tiny bed which the four-year-girl was tied to and starved in removed from the home in Brooklyn . A prosecutor showed the mother a . doctor’s note indicating that her youngest boy weighed 18 pounds at nine . months - roughly the same weight as four-year-old Marchella when she . died. She . told the court she fed her daughter 'potato chips, fried chicken and . cheese doodles', but an autopsy recorded that only a single corn kernel . was found in her body, along with a high level of antihistamines. Marchella should have been on a specialized diet and fed through a tube, which prosecutors say the mother totally ignored, instead feeding her junk food. Unrepentant: Brett-Pierce will serve 32 years to life in prison for the murder of her daughter . During questioning she denied certain things she had already told police and called Marchella 'my baby' as opposed to 'that b***h' - which she was heard calling her in a recorded jail conversation played for the jury saying: 'That b***h wasn't that f***ing light.’ When she was released from hospital seven months before her death, she weighed 26lbs- a stark contrast from her final weight of 18.9 pounds. The Administration for Children's Services became involved with the family after Brett Pierce gave birth to a boy who tested positive for drugs. Two social workers from ACS who had involvement in Marchella’s case were charged separately with criminally negligent homicide for failing to prevent the tragic death. Damon Adams and Chereece Bell were both charged with criminally negligent homicide, official misconduct and endangering the welfare of a child. Their case is due to begin.","Marchella, 4, was beaten and starved in front of her elder brother Tymel by their mother .

"Love triangle: Katie Gilmore, pictured, has admitted she played her two lovers off against each other . A cheating woman has declared her love for the man who killed her TV actor boyfriend. Katie Gilmore, 27, was in a relationship with Gary Suller – who had appeared in Doctor Who and Casualty – but said she had ‘more feelings’ for her second lover, Barry Bowyer. Heroin addict Bowyer, a jury has heard, was so envious of Mr Suller, 45, that he battered him to death, in a ‘prolonged, unrelenting and brutal attack’. He has continued to receive letters from Miss Gilmore, while in custody awaiting trial. At the trial this week she said: ‘I had more feelings for Barry than for Gary. I’ve fallen in love with him. 'I used to go to Gary when I had arguments with Barry but I always went back to him. 'He was the one I wanted to be with.’ A court has heard that Mr Suller, a divorced father-of-two, was ‘besotted’ with Miss Gilmore, even though friends warned him to stay away from her. She told a jury: ‘Gary kept on sending me flowers, letters and text messages, so I started going on dates with him. ‘I was never in love with him, I loved him as a person but he was more like a father figure to me. He was kind and a gentleman, I met his daughters, they were lovely and he was a brilliant dad.

She added: ‘Barry was jealous about the amount of flowers and letters he sent to me and I can’t say I blame him.’ Bowyer, 38, wanted to kill the actor so he could have Miss Gilmore all to himself, Cardiff Crown Court has been told. He is said to have broken into Mr . Suller’s three-bedroom terraced house in Cwmbran, South Wales in . September last year and punched and kicked him to death. The court heard from other witnesses that Mr Suller had been petrified of Bowyer. Prosecutor Peter Davies told the . trial: ‘Barry Bowyer and Gary Suller were not strangers to each other. They were both in love with the same woman. ‘Bowyer laid in wait for Gary to come . home before commencing a savage and bloody attack. It was a prolonged, . unrelenting and brutal attack where he inflicted gross and fatal . injuries.’ ‘Friends say it appeared Katie was flitting between Gary and Barry. 'But Bowyer started to become more possessive. He started to say he hated Gary. 'He told Katie that if she didn’t get rid of Gary then he would.’ On the day of his death, Mr Suller . had discovered he had won a part in The Indian Doctor, a BBC comedy . drama starring Sanjeev Bhaskar. Bowyer, of Cwmbran, denies murder, claiming he killed Mr Suller in a ‘momentary lapse’. He admits burglary and manslaughter. The trial continues.

"'In love': Prison governor Florent Goncalves, 42, faces a three-year sentence if found guilty of presenting an inmate with love letters and gifts . A former prison governor has appeared in a French court accused of giving special treatment to a notorious femme fatale criminal he had 'fallen in love' with. Florent Goncalves, 42, faces a three-year sentence for presenting the strikingly beautiful Emma Arbabzadeh, 23, with love letters and gifts. He regularly had sex with her in prison, but is solely being charged with illicit correspondence, and giving an inmate presents. Arbabzadeh became infamous in 2008 when she was found guilty of luring Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish salesman, to his death at the hands of a gang of racist killers called 'The Barbarians'. Arbabzadeh, who has since been released, has since featured in a book written by Goncalves, in which she is portrayed as a 'honey-trap' femme fatale who makes men 'lose their heads'. When Arbabzadeh began a nine-year sentence at Versailles women's prison near Paris, Goncalves is said to have selected her for 'special treatment'. But Goncalves's defence barrister, Pascal Garbarini, today told Versailles Correctional Court that his client had 'simply fallen in love and did not know how to control his passion'. He added: 'If there had been no Barbarians gang, then this would never have got to court. 'The truth is, this is simply a love story - an unlikely one, but still a love story.' Arbabzadeh is herself facing a charge of receiving stolen goods, but her barrister told the court that she had solely received two mobile phone chips. Dominique Attias said: 'There are thousands of mobile phones in prisons. But these cases don't all land up in court.' Mr Attias said the sensational Barbarians case had turned Arbabzadeh into a criminal celebrity. Inmate: In 2008, Arbabzadeh was found guilty of luring a Jewish salesman to his death at the hands of a gang of racist killers called 'The Barbarians' When other prisoners learned that she was having regular sex in the prison computer room, and in Goncalves's office, they complained. This led to a police investigation, after which Goncalves, who is married with children, was forced to resign. He was able to rekindle his relationship with Arbabzadeh when she was released in 2010. She had been let out for good behaviour after having been on remand since 2006. Goncalves then wrote a book in which he discussed the affair, saying 'I did not regret it for a moment', although he admitted that it had ruined his reputation as a happy family man and 'humanitarian' prison governor. Goncalves, who had been France's youngest ever prison governor, said Iranian-born Arbabzadeh had genuinely been in love with him. In a case which shocked France, Arbabzadeh was still a teenager when, in January 2006, she used her good looks to lure Mr Halimi to a flat on the outskirts of Paris. There he was tortured for three weeks before he died. A total of 27 people were convicted for playing a part in the murder, with anti-Semitism and profiting from a failed ransom plot cited as the motive. Goncalves denies the charges. The case continues.","Florent Goncalves accused of having sex with inmate - and giving her love letters and gifts .

"In his characteristically blasé fashion, designer Tom Ford, 52, has announced his marriage to long time partner Richard Buckley, 66. 'We are married now, which is nice,' he simply said. The news came yesterday during a conversation with British journalist, Lady Kinvara Balfour, at London's Regent Street Apple store, during which he flashed a gold wedding ring to the audience. Scroll down for video . Wedding Bells: Tom Ford, 52, has announced his secret nuptials to former Vogue Hommes editor Richard Buckley, 66 . 'I know that was just made legal in the UK, which is great. We were married in the States,' he explained, giving no further details as to the where and when. Mr Ford went on to explain: 'I lost so many friends in college - I would say more than half of my closest friends. Richard, my partner of 27 years, had also gone through something also quite tough in his life.' The couple, who welcomed son Alexander, their first . child together, into the world in September 2012, met at a fashion show in 1986 and Tom . Ford has spoken openly of his instant attraction to the former Vogue . Hommes editor. Power couple: Out magazine was amongst the first to congratulate the newlyweds with a tweet earlier today . 'I went to a fashion show and this silver-haired guy was staring at me with these piercing water-blue eyes,' he told WWD. 'It scared me because I absolutely saw and knew my entire future.' The Texan-born designer, who was only 25 at the time, told Out magazine in 2011 that it was 'love at first sight' and that he decided he would marry Mr Buckley, then 38, 'in the length of an elevator ride,' following their whirlwind first few encounters. 'You can look at someone and feel . like you've known them forever,' he gushed. 'The first night I ever had . drinks with Richard, I felt I knew everything about him.' All these years: The couple, pictured in London last month at the premiere of Kick Ass, met in 1986 at a fashion show when Mr Ford was only 25 and Mr Buckley was 38 . For his part, Mr Buckley said: 'I couldn't imagine being without Tom now. I couldn't imagine what I'd be like if something happened to him. There's only one Tom for me.' Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Ford also admitted that when the power couple first met, he was 'pathologically shy' and his new husband, who was the editor in chief of Vogue Hommes International at the time, was 'very, very social and very talkative.' 'Richard is an extrovert, and I'm an introvert, but meeting us today you would think the opposite,' Mr Ford explained. Doting: Mr Buckley, pictured here with Mr Ford last month at LAX airport, has previously spoken of his devotion, saying he 'couldn't imagine' being without his partner of 27 years now . The couple started dating during the late Eighties, a time when AIDS was prevalent, particularly in the gay community, and tragically, both lost an estimated half on their friends to the disease. Mr Ford, who says the pair enjoyed three dates before having sex, has admitted that this 'enormous fear' affected their 'early sexual relationship.' Further tragedy hit when, just three . years after they moved in together (Mr Ford surprised his boyfriend with . a small Tiffany box containing a key to his apartment) Mr Buckley was . diagnosed with throat cancer. Despite being told it could be fatal, he pulled through and their luck changed for the better. The couple were overjoyed to announce the birth of their son in 2012 - believed to have been born via a surrogate. Speaking candidly to British GQ last year about their new found parenthood, Mr Ford said: 'I used to spend most of my time at home naked, but now we have a child it means we have a nanny and so I can't come downstairs naked and have a bowl of cereal in the morning.' And while we can only imagine how stylish and touching the nuptials must have been, Mr Ford has so far remained tight-lipped on any details of their big day.","Revealed the news yesterday in candid interview at London's Apple store .

"Bread and water: Inmates in Maricopa County (AZ) are down to bare bones rations after desecrating American flags in their jail cells . Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio has found a new object of scorn – misbehaving convicts. The normally immigration-focused Maricopa County top cop has put several dozen inmates on a twice-a-day bread and water diet after they vandalized American flags hanging in their cells. The bare-bones rations have been meted out to 36 inmates across six jails in the metropolitan Phoenix county, Arpaio announced in a statement. ‘These inmates have destroyed the American flag that was placed in their cells. Tearing them, writing on them, stepping on them, throwing them in the toilet, trash or wherever they feel,’ he said. ‘It's a disgrace to those who have fought for our country,’ he continued. ‘This is government property that they are destroying, and we will take action against those who act this way.” The punishment will last a total of seven days until January 30, according to Reuters. A second offense will result in a 10 day reprimand. Maricopa County jails have also recently begun blasting patriotic songs over the public address system and put inmate-veterans together so ‘they could get the help associated with their needs,’ said the statement. Dan Pachoda, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the move is a publicity stunt, but not against the law. ‘It's certainly not illegal, but what he is doing is bad policy,’ Pochoda said. ‘It's just another vindictive policy that has nothing to do with running a good jail system.’ Arpaio is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department accusing him of civil rights abuses, over allegations he and his officers profile Latinos. The Arizona immigration law that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court allows police in the state to ask people they stop about their immigration status.","The punishment affects 38 inmates across six jails in Maricopa County .

"Arizona’s infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now defending one of his famous friends after controversy caused by comments made at a roast in his honor. State Senator John Kavanagh made racially charged jokes at Arpaio’s expense during the recent roast since the sheriff is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration. A recording of the roast made public has caused outrage after the state lawmaker was heard insulting Hispanics to draw laughs from guests. On the hot seat: Maricopa County (AZ) Sheriff Joe Arpaio is no stranger to controversy . ‘Sheriff Joe is the kind of guy that you gotta love, as long as you have papers,’ Kavanaugh can be heard saying on the recording made public by the Southern Poverty Law Center. ‘Going out with Joe is always an adventure,’ he adds as the audience laughs, ‘because usually when we walk into a restaurant, most of the waitstaff and cooks dive out the back window, and when they don't, I never know what the hell's in my food.’ Those jokes and several similar quips have put Arpaio in the uneasy position of defending a man he calls a friend. Controversial: State Sen John Kavanaugh's remarks may have drawn chuckles from his audience, but not everyone is laughing . ‘How many Hispanics did you pull over on the way over here, Arpaio, huh?’ Kavanuagh jokes. Kavanaugh also joked about the federal monitor appointed to oversee the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office by a judge to limit racial profiling. ‘Just to show you how unreasonable the federal monitor is.. when Sheriff Joe sends his new deputies to the academy, he will no longer just train them to do the Miranda warning in Spanish, he will have to teach it in English too’ Kavanaugh wisecracks. ‘The sign over the booking intake door in the jail will have to have ‘welcome’ and just not ‘bienvenido,’ he continues. Arpaio can be heard around this point saying ‘that’s enough,’ but the state senator continued a bit longer before bidding the roaring crowd ‘adios.’ ‘It was a roast. John Kavanagh's my friend. I support him. He's not a racist. He's very funny,’ Arpaio told CNN. ‘So, he made these comments, I can't speak whether he went too far.’ But others, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, say Kavanaugh did push things too far, accusing the sheriff and his cohorts of continuing to ‘dehumanize immigrants and treat Latinos like second-class citizens.’ Kavanaugh declined to comment, but released a statement to the network calling the jokes 'satirical' and 'not directed at minority group members but at the target of the roast - Sheriff Arpaio.' He accused the SPLC of editing out non-racially-tinged portions of the roast and said that the jokes were 'typical of roasts and had I made the same jokes against Sheriff Arpaio at their annual dinner.' He did not offer any apology for those who may have been offended by the comments. Arpaio tried changing the tables on his detractors during the CNN interview, asking where the outrage was when he was being called ‘Nazi and Hitler.’ ‘Why isn't there an uproar about going after me, calling me every name in the book? Why are they worried about just some roast?’ He asked. Disallowed from racially profiling suspects to ask for immigration papers, Arpaio has come up with other ways to keep himself occupied including issuing pink underwear to county inmates and taking salt and pepper from their food, according to his office. Last month, he put several inmates on a bread and water diet for defacing American flags in their cells while at the same time piping patriotic music into county detention centers.","Arizona State Senator John Kavanaugh made the remarks at a recent roast of Sheriff Joe Arpaio .

"Joe Arpaio (pictured here in 2004) has asked US Attorney General Eric Holder for £38million dollars after his department was found guilty of singling out Latinos for traffic and immigration stops . America's self-proclaimed toughest sheriff has asked the federal government for $38million claiming they gave his officers faulty immigration training.Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who became famous for his zero tolerance policy on immigration, was found guilty in May of singling out Latinos in traffic stops and detaining them for unreasonably long times.But he has now claimed Washington owes him $38million after it provided faulty training, teaching his deputies it was acceptable to use race as grounds for a traffic stop or immigration check. In an open letter to Eric Holder, the Attorney General, Arpaio asked for $30 million in compliance costs - including fitting cameras to officer's cars, retraining deputies, and hiring a court monitor to track the department's activities - $1.2 million in legal fees for his defence, and more than $7 million in legal fees being sought by the lawyers who won the case.In May, U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled Arpaio's office systematically singled out Latinos in its regular traffic and immigration patrols. Arpaio disputes the finding and has appealed the decision.Cecillia Wang, a lawyer who brought the case on behalf of the Latino community, told Fox News: 'It's a complete whitewash for the sheriff to claim that the federal government is the one to blame.' Arpaio is claiming that Washington has . backed out of a pledge to pay the legal costs of 100 deputies who were . once given the authority to make federal immigration stops and were . trained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Arpaio, who began the first female chain gang (pictured), claims his officers were given faulty federal immigration training and that Washington should now pay for the cost of complying with new regulations, his defence lawyers, and costs sought by the prosecution . However, after the power to make federal immigration stops was withdrawn, Arpaio continued to make stops under state law, and announced he would be training all 881 officer to made the checks.Judge Murray Snow's ruling doesn't altogether bar Arpaio from enforcing the state's immigration laws, but it does impose a long list of restrictions on the sheriff's patrols, some of which focused heavily on Latino areas in the county.The ruling prohibited the selection of ‘particular communities, locations or geographic areas for targeted traffic enforcement based to any degree on the racial or ethnic composition of the community.’The order also prohibits using race as a factor in deciding whether to stop a vehicle with a Latino occupant or detaining Latino passengers only on the suspicion that they're in the country illegally.","In May Sheriff Joe Arpaio's department was found guilty of singling out Latinos for traffic stops and immigration checks .

"The self-proclaimed America’s toughest sheriff was struck a humbling blow Wednesday when a judge ruled his Maricopa County, Arizona office will get a court appointed monitor after they lost a racial profiling suit in May. Joe Arpaio’s ultra-tough stance on immigration was at the heart of the lawsuit that alleged his office detained Latinos for unreasonably long periods. The federal judge also ordered the creation of a community advisory board to ensure the Phoenix area sheriff is respecting his Latino constituents’ constitutional rights. While Arpaio’s enemies have cheered the ruling, the 81-year-old responded with characteristic defiance. ‘We are identifying areas that are ripe for appeal,’ he said. ‘To be clear, the appointed monitor will have no veto authority over my duties or operations.’ 'America's toughest sheriff': Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio will get a court order as part of the fall out from a May ruling that his office engaged in the racial profiling of Latinos . U.S. District Judge Murray Snow found in May that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and Sheriff Joe Arpaio singled out Latinos and deputies unreasonably prolonged detentions. It was the first finding by a court that the agency covering Arizona's most populous county engages in racial profiling after a small group of Latinos sued the sheriff's office for violating their constitutional rights, saying they were being detained simply because of their race. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is working on behalf of the plaintiffs, hailed the ruling as a victory. ‘Today's order is really going to put some sunlight into the corners of the MCSO that have been such a problem in terms of people's civil rights. It's a great day,’ said ACLU lawyer Cecillia Wang.Arpaio’s lawyers were less thrilled. Arpaio has become nationally known for his unapologetic rejection of Obama era immigration policy and self-proclaimed status as America's toughest sheriff . 'Can't tell us what to do': Arpaio critics won a big prize when the sheriff's office lost a May racial profiling case. The defiant sheriff her responded to appointment of a court babysitter with characteristic gall . Wacky: Arpaio has a penchant for grabbing headlines. In the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut school shootings he enlisted action star Steven Seagal for a program to train children in self defense . Lawyer Tim Casey said he was still reviewing the order, but noted he was ‘pleased with its very moderate sensible tone.’ ‘The sheriff is still in exclusive charge of the MCSO,’ Casey said, adding their concern all along was that the monitor would have too much authority. ‘The monitor cannot tell us what to do or not to do,’ Casey said, referring to the monitor's role in the ruling as overseeing training and procedures, among other things. ‘The court will make the ultimate decision on whether or not the MCSO is in compliance with its order, and we're very pleased with that.’ The judge's order also mandates that the sheriff's office install audio and video recording devices in patrol vehicles and requires deputies to notify dispatch of the reason they are making a traffic stop prior to contacting the vehicle's driver ‘unless exigent circumstances make it unsafe or impracticable. Arpaio's attorneys had resisted the latter, telling the judge such an added measure would be burdensome and risky for deputies. 'I am in the process of discussing it with our attorneys,' Arpaio said. 'We are identifying areas that are ripe for appeal. To be clear, the appointed monitor will have no veto authority over my duties or operations. ' Stats don't lie: Immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 'crime suppression' sweeps conducted by Arpaio's office since January 2008 . ‘That's an area that we remain concerned about,’ Casey said Wednesday. Snow's ruling doesn't altogether bar Arpaio from enforcing the state's immigration laws, but it does impose a long list of restrictions on the sheriff's patrols, some of which focused heavily on Latino areas in the county. The ruling prohibited the selection of ‘particular communities, locations or geographic areas for targeted traffic enforcement based to any degree on the racial or ethnic composition of the community.’ The order also prohibits using race as a factor in deciding whether to stop a vehicle with a Latino occupant or detaining Latino passengers only on the suspicion that they're in the country illegally. The U.S. Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit last year that also alleges racial profiling by Arpaio's office. Its suit, however, claims broader civil rights violations, such as allegations that Arpaio's agency retaliates against its critics and punishes Latino jail inmates with limited English skills for speaking Spanish. Arpaio has denied the claims.","81-year-old Joe Arpaio will have a monitor as his staff are retrained to be better attuned to the constitutional rights of Latino residents of Arizona's Maricopa County .

"Even after three decades, the triple-dog dare doesn't get old. The film A Christmas Story opened 30 years ago to mixed reviews but has shown its staying power as a holiday family favorite. Cleveland, where parts of the movie were filmed and hard-luck Ralphie dreamed big, is celebrating the anniversary with iconic leg lamps, holiday store windows like the ones that drew Ralphie's wide-eyed stares, and stage and musical versions of A Christmas Story. 'It becomes part of your fabric for your whole life,' said Kevin Moore, managing director of the Cleveland Play House, where the stage version of the story has become a holiday staple. Movie classic: 1983 film A Christmas Story celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. It starred Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin, Ian Petrella and Peter Billingsley . In the film, starring Darren McGavin as the father, 9-year-old Ralphie was transfixed by the brightly decorated storefront windows. And he dreamed of getting an air rifle as a Christmas gift, despite warnings that he might shoot his eye out. The plot follows his determined gift-begging, his encounters with bullies and his family's daily hopes and dreams - including a lamp in the form of a shapely leg. The Cleveland house where Ralphie's film family lived will highlight the anniversary Friday and Saturday with appearances by original cast members and a BB gun range in the backyard. The movie wasn't widely acclaimed when it debuted, with favorable reviews barely outnumbering bad mentions like the one that grumped, 'Bah, humbug' in the headline. But its quirky humor and love-in-family message struck a chord with audiences. Holiday hopes: The film featured 9-year-old Ralphie, who dreamed of getting an air rifle as a Christmas gift, despite warnings that he might shoot his eye out . Famous moment: A leg lamp is framed in the window of the house in Cleveland where much of the A Christmas Story movie was filmed (left). The scene in which the lamp featured (right) Like any holiday favorite, a sense of wonder is needed for A Christmas Story and 8-year-old Colin Wheeler thinks he has one to match Ralphie's. 'We both have really big imaginations,' boasted Colin, who plays Ralphie in A Christmas Story musical at Cleveland's Near West Theater. 'It's just a really quirky and yet incredibly sweet story and that resonates with Cleveland' It's not easy playing Ralphie in that ill-fitting pink bunny suit, Colin said. 'I'll tell you one thing that's hard: it's really hard not to laugh' while wearing that suit, Colin said. Across town, the Cleveland Play House production of A Christmas Story attracts multigenerational audiences of children, parents and grandparents, Moore said. The appeal in Ralphie's blue-collar hometown is simple, Moore said. 'It's just a really quirky and yet incredibly sweet story and that resonates with Cleveland,' he said. House guests: Visitors wait to tour the house in Cleveland where much of A Christmas Story was filmed . Retro decor: The kitchen of the house in Cleveland where much of the 1983 movie was filmed is restored to the 1940s look of the film . The Horseshoe Casino Cleveland has been decorated for the season to highlight the film's roots in the department store now housing the casino, with leg lamps atop some of the slot machines. Sheryl Peet, emerging from the casino, said she appreciates the movie and its humor, without regard to its Cleveland connections. 'I like it. It's got comedy, fun, Ralphie,' she said. 'I like it. It's got comedy, fun, Ralphie' At A Christmas Story house overlooking humming steel mills, visitors can re-enact movie scenes including ducking under the 1940s-style kitchen sink or looking out the back door where Ralphie trudged through the faux snow. The movie 'snow' was actually mostly firefighting foam, pressed into service amid a cold but rare snowless stretch during filming in winter-hardy Cleveland. Jim Moralevitz, now 73, lives down the street from A Christmas Story house and landed a cameo role in the film helping deliver the crate carrying the leg lamp. Worth traveling for: Judy and Michael Paulson, from Plano, Texas, view Ralphie's room in the Cleveland house where the 1983 movie A Christmas Story was filmed . The entrepreneur who developed the house as a tourist attraction, Brian Jones, gave Moralevitz a leg lamp seven years ago and it's mounted in a 6-foot outdoor Plexiglas box near the peak of the front roof. People sometimes mistake it for A Christmas Story house and stop to visit. In the neighborhood, 'I'm known for the most drive-by shootings (filming),' said Moralevitz, a retired tour guide stepping back into his old role for comic effect. Like many of the best holiday classics, the risky business turns cheerful at the end. Now families get together at holiday gatherings to watch the movie or crowd theater performances. 'It fills up the seats because it's a family experience' 'It fills up the seats because it's a family experience,' Moore said. The anniversary of the movie will be marked beyond Cleveland, with versions on stage from Boston to California. The musical has returned to Broadway for another run. A new bronze statue of the 'triple-dog dare' tongue-grabbing flagpole scene is on display in time for the holidays in Hammond, Ind., hometown of Jean Shepherd, whose stories inspired the 1983 movie. One of the boys in the movie takes the dare and gets his tongue stuck on the icy pole. The Hammond reproduction has become a big hit since it was dedicated in October, with families stopping by to take their Christmas card photos. But mimicking Hollywood might be risky, according to Nicki Mackowski with the tourist agency in Hammond. 'We're working on putting up signs as the cold weather gets here. You know: ""Lick at your own risk"" kind of thing,' she said.","The film 'A Christmas Story' opened 30 years ago to mixed reviews but has shown its staying power as a holiday family favorite .

"A charity endorsed by celebrities including Jerry Hall and Jerome Flynn was last night accused of promoting a Vitamin C therapy which falsely claims to ‘kill cancer’. Doctors listed on the Yes To Life (YTL) website charge patients – many of whom are dying – up to £3,000 to administer high doses of intravenous Vitamin C, despite it being clinically unproven against any form of cancer. Yet a description on the website makes it sound like a virtual panacea, suggesting it can be used against all kinds of conditions. Medical experts last night described the claims as ‘quackery’ and called for the Charity Commission to investigate. One has already reported YTL to the Advertising Standards Authority. Until last week, YTL’s website carried a glowing endorsement from actress Maureen Lipman, but when it was drawn to her attention by The Mail on Sunday she said she had no memory of the words ascribed to her. ‘I looked at their website and I got the idea they were saying, “This cures cancer”,’ she said, ‘so I asked them to remove it, which they did.’ Last night, leading cancer consultant Agamemnon Epenetos described the YTL claims as ‘inaccurate’ and ‘false’. He said: ‘There is no evidence at all. Major studies have been done and have shown that there is no evidence that it works in cancer.’ YTL describes itself as a charity which supports people with cancer by ‘combining the best of complementary and alternative medicine with standard treatments’. On the website, model Hall says: ‘I wish Yes To Life great success in its wonderful work’, while Game of Thrones star Flynn declares: ‘It was an easy decision to get involved and spearhead the initial campaign for Yes To Life.’ Elsewhere on the site, claims are made for Vitamin C therapy, saying it can ‘destroy cancer cells in a non-toxic way when used in very large doses’, that ‘Vitamin C acts in the following manner to kill cancer’ and that it ‘enhances the production of collagen, which will encircle the cancer and prevent its expansion’. It also claims Vitamin C therapy ‘can be used in any stage of cancer’. Experts say the claims – accompanied by a list of doctors offering the therapy at more than £3,000 – could be in breach of The Cancer Act, which outlaws the promotion of false claims to cure cancer. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor of Complementary Medicine at Exeter University, said: ‘Few things in health care are more despicable than the exploitation of vulnerable and often desperate cancer patients. 'There is no good evidence that Vitamin C injections are effective for any type of cancer.’ There is no good evidence to suggest Vitamin C injections are effective for any type of cancer (file image) Among those on YTL’s website offering the therapy is Dr Michael Wetzler, of Hill Medical Centre in North London. He appeared before the General Medical Council (GMC) in 2004 for giving a baby the wrong vaccine. When approached by The Mail on Sunday, he told us: ‘I shall give your email my attention next week.’ Another doctor offering the procedure appeared before the GMC only last month. Dr Julian Kenyon, medical director of the Dove Clinic in Hampshire, still faces a fitness to practise hearing in December after he misled patients over cancer treatment involving soundwave and light beds. He did not comment when The Mail on Sunday contacted him. In 2011, The Charity Commission found it acceptable for YTL to provide links to treatments after receiving a complaint they were medically unproven. YTL founder Robin Daly said: ‘The only thing we do is to provide interested people with information.’ The Mail on Sunday contacted agents for Ms Hall and Mr Flynn, but neither replied.","Doctors listed by Yes To Life charge up to £3,000 for doses of intravenous Vitamin C .

"College co-eds sick of ramen noodles descended on the Yotel in Manhattan Friday night to find their definition of Prince Charming - an older man with cash to burn. 'The Sugar Affair' masquerade ball was organized by website Seeking Arrangement, which matches rich older men with much-younger women for 'mutually beneficial relationships'. Seeking Arrangement CEO Brandon Wade was at the event Friday and told the New York Post that it was organized right around graduation time, since a lot of the female attendants would now face repaying their student loans. A certain kind of romance: Dating website Seeking Arrangement held a masquerade ball for sugar daddies to meet younger women in Manhattan last Friday. Above, a picture from the event posted to the site's Facebook page . 'Job fair': Seeking Arrangement CEO Brandon Wade (right) compare the event to a job fair since sugar daddies provide for their so-called 'sugar babies'. Pictured above at an event in 2010 . 'This is almost like a job fair, because a sugar daddy is a mentor, provider and gentleman,' Wade said. 'Why not date someone who can help you?' Wade added that most so-called 'sugar babies' get $3,000 a month from their sugar daddy, allowing them to live a luxury lifestyle. One sugar baby from Nashville traveled to the ball with her 59-year-old sugar daddy who is battling terminal cancer. She says he pays $4,000 a month for her and her sister's living expenses. A 22-year-old Pace University student says she gets paid $400 to $800 every time she sees one 40-something man and that she's only ever kissed him. A junior at NYU hooked up with a widower from Chicago at the event. Fete: Friday night's masquerade ball took place at the Yotel in Midtown Manhattan . 'I have a fancier lifestyle,' the undergrad said. 'I'm not going to downgrade to some NYU boy who buys dollar beers.' Into the night, the sugar daddies began openly fondling the women, the Post reported. Since Seeking Arrangement was started in 2006, it has grown to a community of 2.7million members. At the start, one in four of the site's female members were in college but now that statistic has changed to one in two. Sugar babies had to pay $75 to get into the event on Friday, compared to the $150 admission for men. Sugar daddies had the option of paying more for access to the VIP room filled with 'hand-picked college beauties' who are both 'smart and seductive'.","The 'Sugar Affair' masquerade ball was held on Friday in New York City .

"Under-pressure Brighton boss Sami Hyypia is desperate for his side to turn their season around against fellow strugglers Millwall on Friday night. The Seagulls, who reached the play-offs in the previous two campaigns, have dropped into the relegation zone following a wretched run of just one win from their last 16 matches. But facing them will be a Millwall side in similarly rotten form, having won once in 15 outings to lie just two places and two points above their opponents. Brighton boss Sami Hyypia is hoping his struggling side can turn things around against Millwall on Friday . The former Liverpool defender Hyypia said: 'Everyone knows it is an important game and everyone knows we need to turn the corner quickly. We can start to do that on Friday night. 'The atmosphere has been very positive. It's an important game but I don't expect anything less from the players than in any other game. Everyone has to go onto the field to do everything to help win the game.' Hyypia is expecting a battle against a side very much in the mould of his opposite number, Ian Holloway. 'They are a team about which the manager tells you everything. The team has the same character as the manager,"" he added. 'He is giving everything he can and they will come here to fight and try to get something from the game. We need to win the fight and then hope our quality will win the game.' Derby striker Chris Martin (right) holds off Brighton's Lewis Dunk during the Seagulls' 3-0 loss last Saturday . While Brighton slipped to a 3-0 defeat at Derby last weekend, Millwall were having an even more miserable afternoon as they crashed 5-1 at home to Middlesbrough. Goalkeeper David Forde is hoping that humiliation will be a watershed in a disappointing season so far. 'We were all bitterly disappointed after that game and maybe one or two harsh words were said because that wasn't a Millwall performance in the first half,' said Forde. 'But I've experienced that sort of thing before, when we suffered heavy home defeats to Watford and Birmingham under Kenny (Jackett). On those occasions we knuckled down and bounced back, and with the character in this squad I fully expect us to do the same again. 'We have the opportunity to put the memories of Middlesbrough firmly behind us by going to Brighton in front of the Sky cameras and showing what we're really capable of.

"Former fan favourite Luis Garcia has backed under-fire Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard to bring the good times back to Anfield, while warning the Kop faithful that Rafael Benitez is not the answer. It has been more than seven years since the diminutive Spaniard bid an emotional farewell to his adoring Liverpool fans to rejoin Atletico Madrid. It was a successful three-year stint on Merseyside for the La Masia graduate, with Champions League glory in dramatic circumstances on that memorable night in Istanbul in 2005 being the pinnacle. Luis Garcia (right) played alongside Steven Gerrard for three seasons in the red of Liverpool . Gerrard sits dejected after the 1-1 draw with Basle consigned his side to an early Champions League exit . Rafael Benitez guided Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005 (above) but he not the answer to Liverpool's current problems, says Garcia who played under the Spanish coach at Anfield . Garcia, now 36, has recently come out of retirement to ply his trade in India’s inaugural Super League for Atletico de Kolkata, with the tournament heading into a title play-off in the coming weeks. Despite his current intentions to keep his weary legs in shape to compete amongst much younger opposition in the Land of Prayers, Garcia admits to keeping a watchful eye on events back in England. And Garcia is especially disheartened by a mounting media maelstrom over whether an aging Gerrard still has what it takes to compete at the highest level. 'Stevie is the captain, the leader, he has to play,' said Garcia. The Spaniard left Liverpool to join Atletico Madrid in 2007 after three years on Merseyside . 'So many of the players look up to him because of what he does on the pitch and what the club means to him. 'Even though when I was there he was much younger, he still had a presence on the pitch, and he has not lost that. 'Lose him you lose the soul of the team. He will make the other players up their game, and that is what you need from your captain. The Reds season went from bad to worse on Tuesday night as Gerrard’s late equaliser at home to Swiss outfit Basel was not enough to spur his side on to the victory they needed to progress to the knockout stages of Europe’s premier competition. Garcia wheels away to celebrate after his scored 'that goal' against Chelsea in the Champions League . Such a disappointment has increased the already intense pressure on boss Brendan Rodgers, despite last season’s exploits. Talk around Anfield of former boss Rafael Benitez making a sensational return to the club, who he guided to that fifth European Cup crown in Turkey, has surfaced as a result of the Reds’ predicament. The Spaniard's family still reside on Merseyside, and with his contract running down at Napoli, and fans yearning for the glory days to return, Benitez could prove to be a popular choice. However, Garcia is not convinced the move would suit either party, insisting that age-old decree when considering returning to the scene of such success should be adhered to. Garcia is overjoyed at the final whistle after the Reds' remarkable comeback victory over AC Milan in Istanbul . 'Never go back,' adds Garcia, who will skipper his new side in the upcoming Indian Super League play-offs. 'I don’t think Benitez will ever go back as a manager. Maybe something else, director of football or something. 'To go back after winning the Champions League and many other trophies and struggle to turn things around would be a bad move. 'He is like a God in Liverpool.' Garcia (left) celebrates after scoring against Tottenham with Sami Hyypia (centre) and Xabi Alonso . The question on everyone’s lips when in the company of the ubiquitous midfielder is whether he believes his infamous 'ghost goal' in the Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield was over the line. 'Yes, yes it was a goal,' Garcia states. 'It does not annoy me when I get asked, I like it. 'I had the same thing here in India in our opening match, but it was disallowed. I knew it had gone in, as I did against Chelsea.' You can follow Pete on Twitter @PeteHall86 .","Luis Garcia spent three seasons on Merseyside .

"The NYPD's highest-ranking black official abruptly quit Friday instead of taking a new post, a surprising move that caught city officials off guard at a time when the department is trying to mend relationships with minority communities. Chief Philip Banks III was to have been named first deputy commissioner, second in command at the nation's largest police force. Commissioner William Bratton already had announced the change and Banks was to have been promoted Monday. Instead, he will retire. Stepping out: Chief of Department Philip Banks, stunned the NYPD by abruptly retiring rather than become the department's second-in-command — with a reduced crime-fighting role. He had served 28 years on force . It wasn't clear why Banks changed his mind, and Bratton cited only 'personal and professional factors.' The position was seen under the previous commissioner as largely ceremonial and stripped of power. Bratton said the job had been highly important during his previous stint as commissioner in the 1990s and remains so. 'That is the most significant position in the New York Police Department outside of commissioner,' he said, adding the position would have had expanded duties. Those would have included drawing on Banks' experience as chief of community affairs to help rebuild trust with minority communities following the department's controversy over the practice known as stop and frisk. He also said Banks would have helped in personal development and training. 'I think the world of Chief Banks. He's been a very able and capable partner,' Bratton said. Retiring: The NYPD's highest-ranking black official abruptly quit instead of taking a new post, a surprising move that caught city officials off guard at a time when the department is trying to mend relationships with minority communities . Banks, 51, took over as chief of department in March 2013 under former Commissioner Raymond Kelly. He's been with the department since 1986 and has worked as the commanding officer of a Manhattan patrol borough, and several precincts.  He had been mentioned as a possible successor to Ray Kelly before Bratton was selected. Banks did not immediately return a call for comment. His decision also comes at a time when the Mayor Bill de Blasio's relationship with the department is strained over accusations he sided with frequent NYPD critic Al Sharpton following the chokehold death of an unarmed suspect, and his refusal to fire a top aide living with a convicted killer who has often mocked officers as 'pigs.' Police politics: There was a power struggle at the top of the department. Cheif Bratton (right)  dithered, and the power struggle came to a head during Friday’s morning meeting at Police Plaza as Banks demanded a firm answer. He then quit. Mayor De Blasio was said to be furious at the sudden resignation . De Blasio said in statement that he was disappointed to hear of his decision. 'He has served New York City admirably during his nearly 30 years on the force, and we were enthusiastic about the leadership and energy he would have brought to the position of First Deputy Commissioner,' he said in a statement. The New York Police Department has about 35,000 officers. Chicago is the second-largest with about 13,000. Bratton said he would fill the position quickly.","The 28-year veteran abruptly retired four days after agreeing to become first deputy commissioner .

"In 12 months’ time, maybe less, Ally McCoist will no longer be the manager of Rangers. How supporters remember him as a man matters greatly. ‘The most important thing for me and how I handle this situation is that I can look myself in the mirror,’ said McCoist yesterday. ‘I think of the great people that used to be here; the Greigs, the Jardines, the Smiths and the Wallaces. And I’ve got a job to do not to let them down. Rangers manager Ally McCoist says he intends to run out his notice after announcing his decision to resign . It was business as usual as McCoist was all smiles as he lead a Rangers' training session at Murray Park . McCoist intends to speak with new chief executive Derek Llambias about the future of the club . ‘Everyone will have a different opinion but the only thing that matters is that the Rangers supporters felt that I did everything I did for them and for the club. That will be the only thing that matters to me. ‘How people remember means more to me as a person than anything else. That is the important thing for me.’ Until a few months ago his legacy was secure. Copper-bottomed. With 355 goals to his credit, Ally McCoist was and remains a Rangers icon. A popular, gregarious character who showed a steely, resolute side to his personality during the bleak winter days of February 2012. Yet the events of recent weeks have begun to alter perceptions. Supporters – one or two directors as well - see the results and ask why, if he cares for Rangers this much, McCoist doggedly clings to office? There is no joy in the criticism. It pains Rangers supporters to question the man most still regard as Super Ally. Legally, many accept he is entitled to every penny he receives. Morally, however, some openly ask now if McCoist shouldn’t recognise the plight the club are in and ‘do the decent thing.’ If he shouldn’t walk away and let someone else deliver value for money – and promotion - on the football pitch. Rangers captain Lee McCulloch in hysterics as he didn't seem to be too affected by his manager's decision . ‘I’ve been trying to do my best for the club and hope people realise that,’ he countered. ‘That means more than anything to me. ‘People will have different opinions on my management skills and techniques, but I would hope that even the people who are justified in criticising me would appreciate that the mistakes I have made have been honest ones. ‘As a player, assistant manager and then manager I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with the supporters. That’s something I value as much as anything. There will be ones who thought I was hopeless as a centre forward or as a manager but the most important thing is that they know that all I’ve tried to do is do my best for them and for the club.’ Time is always the healer with these things. The closest parallel to McCoist is John Greig, the greatest living Ranger who endured a dismal spell as manager before resigning in 1983. Yet in the years since they have built a statue to his memory, even if Greig – like McCoist - has been sickened by the events of the last three years. Inevitably, legends are remembered for what they did on the pitch. In time, the travails of McCoist over the last two years will be forgotten and his relationship with supporters repaired. Distancing himself from the mayhem of recent times was essential for that to happen. ‘I have to be truthful and say that once I made the decision there was a sense of relief there,’ he said. ‘I think probably just the last three years or so probably has certainly been taxing and difficult at times. So there is probably relief that I will definitely be able to spend time with my family and things like that. Do things that I want to do myself.’ McCoist (left) shares a joke with former player Nacho Novo during the training session at Murray park . Nevertheless, the magnitude of the decision can hardly be overestimated. He spoke with trusted allies, Walter Smith amongst them, before making it. The departure of long-term, low-earning club employees was also a factor in the tendering of his resignation. ‘It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, without doubt. But it is the right decision,’ he said. When it’s over, he won’t turn his back on football. He couldn’t. Few doubt a long-running dispute with the BBC will be put to one side because he is a television natural. Another crack at management is not out of the question, but there is a caveat. ‘Not in Scotland,’ said McCoist. ‘I don’t know where. I would hate to say something and then it comes back to haunt me. But I don’t think I could manage or coach any other team in Scotland. ‘I love the game. Whether it is coaching somewhere else, or managing somewhere else or being involved in some other capacity, I couldn’t see myself not being involved in football.’ His curriculum vitae features successive promotions from Scotland’s lower leagues. At any other club, sitting second in the promotion race would be grounds for celebration rather than dismissal or resignation, but McCoist knows better than most how unique the demands of Rangers can be. ‘I probably think top of the CV would be “can handle management under stressful situations,”’ he grinned. ‘That would be top of the list. That would be up there in bold print. That would be all I could say really. ‘As I have said before, I think it has been very difficult. Everybody will have their own opinions, which everyone is entitled to, but it is not just as clear cut as that because there has been a lot of differing and varying factors that have affected my management and would affect anybody else’s management.’ Some of the opinions expressed have come from unexpected quarters. Rangers messageboards buzzed this week with claims that the relationship between McCoist and his old strike partner Mark Hateley had cooled after the Englishman allegedly began briefing against him behind his back. Hateley denies the allegations furiously, but has been unable – so far – to explain himself personally. David Templeton (centre) looks to close down the ball during the team's training session on Friday . ‘I’ve not had a chance to speak to Mark,’ said McCoist, ‘but I will. It’s another thing but I’ve got to tell you lads I’m not annoyed and I’m not bothered. Big Mark and I have been through a lot together and we’ll sit down and have a chat. It’s simple. ‘We’re both big boys and, as I say, we’ve been through an awful lot together.’ Hateley – and John Greig – were able to put their status as Rangers favourites to use when they stopped playing. McCoist owns a million shares, but is unable to say how his own relationship with the club will develop when the ill feeling of recent weeks abates and he is gone. ‘I haven’t thought about that. But I would imagine I will be taking a seat in the stand with my sons and watching the games.’ The plan is to be watching a Rangers team back in the SPFL Premiership. Whether that happens on his watch as manager depends to a huge extent on how the players respond to his resignation in the coming weeks. Possibly months. The early signs in Dumfries were unpromising. ‘I can understand people thinking standards might drop among players when they know a manager is leaving,’ said McCoist. ‘But I can assure the supporters we won’t allow that to happen. ‘The standards did drop for the first time last Friday night. There is absolutely no excuse for the level of performance we put in last Friday. So we need to reassure people that standards at our club will be as high as possible.’ At Rangers, an ongoing football circus, it’s been some time since anyone was able to say that.","News of Ally McCoist's resignation from Rangers came last Friday night .

"Perhaps Ibrox was simply saving itself for Monday’s annual general meeting. At the close of another tumultuous week in the club’s recent, crazed history there was scarcely a supporters’ stir by way of a reaction as they watched another low-grade home victory. There was no show of support for Ally McCoist, in spite of their manager going through another week of emotional torment in which he moved closer to breaking ties with his club and learned of ex-colleague Mark Hateley working behind his back.

Subs not used: Sives, Ogleby, Beaumont, Grant. Referee: William Collum . Attendance: 28,053 . There was barely a ripple of a retort to the boardroom that has been undermining their Rangers hero. And there, of course, was very little to shout about as a strike from Fraser Aird and a Simon Mensing own goal contributed to a routine Championship success. Sadly, it is apathy and acceptance that has greeted the realisation that McCoist’s time is ticking down at Rangers. Even anger seems thin on the ground where once match days could be an ideal avenue for protest. A quiet acquiescence now says that McCoist won’t be the man to lead the team much further and the stance from the fans as to who they really want removed from positions of power at Ibrox came only from a vocal pocket at the foot of the Broomloan Road Stand. They warmed up the first-half action with some anti-boardroom chants, specifically aimed at Sandy and James Easdale. And ‘You greedy b*******, get out of our club’ came the cry in a muted flurry of fury towards the directors’ box. It was claimed that 28,053 were present yet chairman David Somers, as he did a fortnight ago, may be required to offer an adjusted total to accurately reflect the dwindling nature of the Ibrox audience. McCoist, who continued to invite his players to raise their game against the unobtrusive backdrop by being a visible presence in his technical area throughout, suggested it could be a while before the disaffected fans flock back to the stadium in old numbers after taking too many slaps in the face from Rangers regimes. McCoist said: ‘I am not sure attendances are a worry. Obviously, when we are playing at home, I would far rather the team was being supported by 50,000 rather than 15,000, 20,000 or 25,000. That goes without saying. ‘However, I do understand, 100 per cent, the vast majority of fans’ feelings over the last three years. I have felt unbelievably sorry for the fans. I think the club will get the fans back. But in the short term? I don’t know about that.’ Livingston captain Simon Mensing (left) then scored a late own goal to make it 2-0 . Rangers boss Ally McCoist looked in high spirits despite recent difficulties at Ibrox . On what may turn out to be his Ibrox dugout farewell, McCoist went for a selection first against a Livingston side that parted with their manager John McGlynn last week. Nicky Clark and Kenny Miller were paired in attack as Jon Daly joined Kris Boyd on the bench. The players, perhaps still shellshocked by the leaking of McCoist’s resignation news, were dreadfully slow starters in their last outing at Queen of the South. And they survived an early scare here before . seizing a 10th-minute advantage. For Mark Burchill’s caretaker reign would have started in spectacular fashion were it not for the excellence of Steve Simonsen. The keeper produced a brilliant lefthanded block, smartly getting down to push away Danny Mullen’s drive. Rangers were far from fluent in their efforts to build up a lead on the Championship’s bottom club and had to settle for one goal before the break. From a Stevie Smith corner not adequately cleared, the ball dropped to the right foot of Aird and he drilled a fine finish back across goal and into the bottom right-hand corner of Darren Jamieson’s net. Ian Black ruffled the side netting but Livingston’s defence could hardly have been described as under siege. It took a superb overhead kick from Lewis Macleod to split the sides in the season’s earlier meeting but, with the midfield ace out injured, there was no hint of such quality invention here. With the home side mustering their own motivation without a well of support from the stands, Livingston dug in to stay in the contest. Had Jordan White fared better with a header from eight yards, the focus of Ibrox upset would have swivel led back on to the performance of McCoist’s players. Rangers fans hold up a banner saying 'Enough is enough' at Ibrox on Saturday . Rangers' Lee Wallace (right) vies for possession with Livingston's Keaghan Jacobs . He was locked in conversation with assistant Kenny McDowall for long spells of the second half in a bid to figure out a lock-breaking move. Those chats couldn’t help Nicky Law conjure a second goal to warm the blood of the loyal souls suffering at the struggles of their side. The midfielder was under pressure from Callum Fordyce but should have produced better than a failure to hit the target from 12 yards after Aird’s cutback. All those dugout discussions did add up to a call for flair and a finisher from the bench, so McCoist introduced David Templeton and Kris Boyd with 17 minutes left. However, it was a malfunction rather than magic that held the key to breaking down Livingston for a second time. Aird’s delivery from the right was a teaser but it came down to a communication disconnect between Mensing and his keeper aiding Rangers to confirm victory. The visiting skipper intervened as Jamieson flew out to collect and nodded the ball into an empty net. Substitute Dean Shiels was the unlikely last line of defence to stop Keaghan Jacobs dragging the visitors back into the game and Rangers’ relief was soon complete. Not that it was obvious to feel on a numb afternoon in Govan. Half-time advertising had boasted of a second-half season tickets being available for £125. It’s going to take more than a few discount labels on that figure — preferably without Sports Direct branding — to tempt the bravest Rangers souls into taking up that offer.","Fraser Aird opens the scoring for Rangers after 10 minutes .

"The Rangers dressing-room knows Ally McCoist is leaving. It might be next week, next month, or in just under a year’s time. But they know he is going. This piece of information first entered the public domain just hours before a pitiful performance in last Friday night’s 2-0 defeat from Queen of the South. And it continues to sit there like a tailor-made get-out clause if this mostly experienced group of players continues to under-perform. Captain Lee McCulloch insists, however, that they will not reach for it. He is adamant there can be no further recourse to blaming bad results on the whirlwind of uncertainty which continues to engulf the club. Captain Lee McCulloch looked in good spirits during Rangers training on Friday . Instead, the defender has urged his team-mates to look within for reasons why Rangers have suffered three losses and a draw during a deeply damaging six-game spell. McCoist was adamant on Friday that he intends to work his 12-month notice period. It could be argued that some players might toil for maximum motivation whilst fully aware that their manager is, at whatever speed, on his way out. McCulloch rejects that notion. ‘It shouldn’t be the case because there is self-motivation as well,’ he insisted. ‘There are seven, eight, nine players out of contract this summer. ‘As players, we are backing the manager with everything he has done for us. We want to do better for him, for ourselves, for the fans. McCulloch says uncertainty surrounding manager Ally McCoist cannot be used as an excuse for poor results . ‘It’s not just about one thing here but people do have to look in the mirror after the last two or three games and ask if they have done enough. ‘Do we have to do more for the manager? On the pitch, definitely. Especially in the last few games. ‘As I said, it comes to down to looking in the mirror and asking if you have done enough. Did I play like a Rangers player should play? ‘It’s slightly harder playing for a club like this and you can’t be hiding. You have got to be demanding and taking the ball. We need 11 players doing that.’ That certainly wasn’t the case at Palmerston as Rangers handed yet another advantage to Hearts in the Championship title race. So did the news that McCoist had handed in his notice have an impact on their efforts? Rangers skipper McCulloch called on his players to look in the mirror and ask if they are doing enough . ‘The biggest thing for me is that if you put excuses in front of players then, nine times out of ten, they will look to take those excuses,’ said McCulloch. ‘We probably could have covered up the last two or three games by using excuses about the timing of things coming out and so on. ‘But for me it’s about trying to get the dressing room to forget about everything that has gone on and try to get our game back — and some points back on the league leaders. ‘We need to just concentrate on ourselves and forget all the excuses that are round about us. It’s about concentrating on being a football player, turning up focused on the job and your individual job within the team.’ Ally McCoist was all smiles as he looked relaxed in training ahead of Saturday's match with Livingston . McCulloch insisted that he hadn’t spoken directly to McCoist about the situation, which seems somewhat curious given his standing within the squad. ‘I think if I wanted to know then I could go and chap his door,’ he added. ‘And I think if there’s anything I need to know, he would come and tell me. So there is no issue. ‘I’m not aware of anything else that is going on at the club. It’s probably a good thing. My job is just to try and keep players focused going into a game. And not thinking about things outwith that. ‘Have I seen a difference in the manager? Not at all. I didn’t see it coming, but that’s all I know.’ It was interesting when McCulloch suggested the current climate around the club somehow felt similar to the bleak financial crisis of 2012 and the descent into administration. It was something he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, explain in any detail, but perhaps it indicates the extraordinary sense of flux within Rangers just now. McCoist, who tendered his resignation earlier this month, oversees the session at Murray Park . Beyond the manager’s situation, a number of long-serving staff have been made redundant as part of a cost-cutting programme. That was led by former Newcastle United managing director Derek Llambias, who was on Friday appointed as chief executive in a sign that Mike Ashley’s influence is being further cemented. Amid all this, Rangers sit nine points adrift of a Hearts side who have a game in hand. A run of exceptional consistency is now required, beyond anything they have mounted so far this term. Asked if they were capable of a winning streak between now and the end of the season, McCulloch replied: ‘It’s possible, it’s definitely possible. We have got the players, the squad, the strength in depth. ‘In the last couple of weeks we have not had the mentality. But we have got it in the dressing room. It’s just let us down in the last couple of weeks with our eye being taken off the ball by various things. McCulloch believes Rangers have the players to arrest their slump and put together a winning run . ‘What gives me confidence? Past results, performances, beating Premiership teams — three or four this season. Lots and lots of things. We are just on a wee dip. A dip in form and maybe confidence as well and it’s up to ourselves and each other to get out of it. ‘We were on a great run of form before and that’s exactly what we have to get back to. We had eight straight wins, conceding just two goals. We were working hard and scoring goals, showing a desire to pull on a Rangers strip and deal with pulling on a Rangers strip which is quite a big thing. Then all of a sudden we’ve hit a lull. ‘You wouldn’t think there is any margin for error, with Hearts nine points ahead and having a game in hand—– albeit we still have them twice to play and there are Edinburgh derbies. I don’t know for sure, but I don’t think there is any margin for error.’","Ally McCoist tendered his resignation at Rangers last week .

"Owen Williams wants to extend his stay at Leicester and compete for a place in the Wales team from the Aviva Premiership. Having moved to Welford Road as a complete unknown last year, the fly-half has been one of the club’s stand-out performers, seeing off competition from England internationals Toby Flood and Freddie Burns during his first two seasons. The 22-year-old is at an advanced stage in contract negotiations and told Sportsmail that he is prepared to stay in the East Midlands, even though a return across the border would boost his chances of being selected for Wales. Leicester fly half Owen Williams was Man of the Match in his side's 25-21 win over Toulon at Welford Road . ‘I’m happy to stay at this club,’ said Williams. ‘If it means playing in front of 24,000 people every week and playing in big games, then I want to play for Leicester. Hopefully it doesn’t affect my Wales chances in the future but we’ll see how it goes. ‘The Premiership is a tough league and there are no easy games. Every week is a grind and, after two years at the club, I like to think I have improved a bit. I just want to win things with Leicester and if I’m doing well, then all good. I’ve not heard anything from Wales.’ If Williams does pen a new deal with Leicester it will be a blow of Wales coach Warren Gatland who is keen to have the best talent playing for one of the four Regions. Northampton winger George North has a a full international release clause to allow him to play for Wales . After a bitter stand-off between the Welsh Rugby Union and the clubs, a peace deal has now been signed and a batch of central contracts have been offered to the best players under the new Rugby Services Agreement (RSA). The spin-off is that regions only pay 40 per cent of player salaries and, as a result, Gatland has control over when they are available for international duty. It is a positive step forwards with regard to retaining young players but, in the case of Williams, there are questions over whether a return to Wales would stunt the rapid development he has enjoyed in the Aviva Premiership. Ospreys number 10 Dan Biggar is currently first choice fly half for Warren Gatland's Wales team . If the youngster does sign a new deal, he is likely to request a full international release clause, similar to that of George North at Northampton. Williams is the first out-of-contract player since the RSA was agreed and the risk is that Gatland makes an example out of the playmaker, to set a precedent, if he does re-sign at Leicester. Who should fill the No 10 jersey has been a long-term problem for Gatland, although Dan Biggar is the stand-out choice going into the Six Nations after his stellar performances in the autumn internationals. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill has backed Williams's decision to stay with the Tigers . But there is a lack of competition — Rhys Priestland, Gareth Anscombe and Rhys Patchell are among the next in line — and Williams’ club performances, including a man-of-the-match display in last week’s victory over Toulon, make him an obvious choice. ‘The reality is if you are the best player you are going to play for your country,’ said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill. ‘I want Owen to play for Wales. He can play for Wales whilst playing for this club. I know there are issues around release, but that can be worked out. At this point, the best thing for Owen is to stay here and play in this team.’","Owen Williams has starred at fly half for Leicester the past two seasons .

"A mysterious dark energy could be swallowing up the universe to leave a 'big, empty, boring' place. Researchers from the UK and Italy clam to have found indications that dark matter, the cosmic scaffolding on which the universe is built, is being slowly erased by dark energy. They claim the latest astronomical data favours a dark energy that grows as it interacts with dark matter, and this appears to be stunting the growth of structure in the cosmos. A mysterious dark energy could be swallowing up the universe to leave a 'big, empty, boring' place. Researchers from the UK and Italy clam to have found indications that dark matter, the cosmic scaffolding on which the universe is built, is being slowly erased by dark energy (artist's impression pictured) 'This study is about the fundamental properties of space-time,' said Professor David Wands, director of Portsmouth's Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation. 'On a cosmic scale, this is about our universe and its fate.' 'If the dark energy is growing and dark matter is evaporating we will end up with a big, empty, boring universe with almost nothing in it. Dark matter provides a framework for structures to grow in the universe. Meanwhile, dark energy is a mysterious substance that is thought to be pushing the universe apart. 'The galaxies we see are built on that scaffolding and what we are seeing here, in these findings, suggests that dark matter is evaporating, slowing that growth of structure.' Scientists claim the latest astronomical data favours a dark energy that grows as it interacts with dark matter, and appears to be stunting the growth of structure in the cosmos. Pictured is a Hubble Space Telescope composite image of evidence for a dark matter ring in galaxy cluster CI0024+17 . Dark energy can be observed in models that show how the universe expands. But no one knows exactly what it is. One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. Another suggests that dark energy comes from the quantum theory of matter. In this theory, 'empty space' is full of temporary particles that continually form and then disappear. Scientists believe roughly 68 per cent of the Universe is dark energy and dark matter makes up about 27 per cent. The rest - everything on Earth and all normal matter - adds up to less than five per cent of the universe. Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. Scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. Professor Wands said cosmology underwent a paradigm shift in 1998 when researchers announced that the rate at which the universe was expanding was accelerating. The idea of a constant dark energy throughout space-time - or the 'cosmological constant' - became the standard model of cosmology. But researchers at the universities of Portsmouth and Rome believe they have found a better description, including energy transfer between dark energy and dark matter. He said: 'Since the late 1990s astronomers have been convinced that something is causing the expansion of our universe to accelerate. The simplest explanation was that empty space - the vacuum - had an energy density that was a cosmological constant. 'However there is growing evidence that this simple model cannot explain the full range of astronomical data researchers now have access to. 'In particular the growth of cosmic structure, galaxies and clusters of galaxies seems to be slower than expected.' Professor Dragan Huterer, of the University of Michigan, said: 'The paper does look very interesting. 'Any time there is a new development in the dark energy sector we need to take notice since so little is understood about it. 'I would not say, however, that I am surprised at the results, that they come out different than in the simplest model with no interactions. 'We've known for some months now that there is some problem in all data fitting perfectly to the standard simplest model.' 'This study is about the fundamental properties of space-time,' said Professor David Wands at Portsmouth University. 'On a cosmic scale, this is about our universe and its fate.

"Teen girls who have sex should use IUDs or hormonal implants - long-acting birth control methods that are effective, safe and easy to use, the nation's most influential pediatricians' group recommends. In an updated policy, the American Academy of Pediatrics says condoms also should be used every time teens have sex, to provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases that other forms of birth control don't provide, and to boost chances of preventing pregnancy. Condoms alone are the most common birth control choice among teens, but with typical use they're among the least effective methods at preventing pregnancy. Teen girls who have sex should use IUDs or hormonal implant, (pictured) the nation's most influential pediatricians' group recommends (stock photo) Both long-acting methods are nearly 100 percent effective, with lower failure rates than birth control pills, patches and injections, the academy says. IUDs and hormonal implants cost more, usually hundreds of dollars, because inserting them involves a medical procedure typically done in doctors' offices. But they're less expensive in the long run than over-the-counter condoms or prescription birth control pills, said Dr. Mary Ott, an adolescent medicine specialist and associate pediatrics professor at Indiana University. IUDs — intrauterine devices — are small, T-shaped devices containing hormones or copper that are inserted into the womb to prevent pregnancy. IUDs with more copper are more than 99 percent effective. This means that fewer than one in 100 women who use an IUD will get pregnant in one year. IUDs with less copper will be less effective . Hormone-containing birth control implants are matchstick-size plastic rods placed under the skin of the upper arm. If implanted correctly, it's more than 99 percent effective. Fewer than one woman in 1,000 who use the implant as contraception will get pregnant in one year. She is the policy statement's lead author. Teens have to remember to use pills and condoms consistently. By contrast, IUDs typically work for three to 10 years after insertion, while implants typically last three years. The new guidance was published Monday in Pediatrics. It echoes 2012 recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The policy emphasizes that abstinence is 100 percent effective at preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases and says pediatricians should encourage teens to delay sexual activity 'until they are ready.' But since many teens don't heed that advice, the policy also says pediatricians need to provide birth control guidance. IUDs — intrauterine devices — are small, T-shaped devices containing hormones or copper that are inserted into the womb to prevent pregnancy. Hormone-containing birth control implants are matchstick-size plastic rods placed under the skin of the upper arm. Both long-acting methods are nearly 100 percent effective, with lower failure rates than birth control pills,  (pictured) patches and injections, the academy says . 'All methods of hormonal birth control are safer than pregnancy,' Ott said. These include pills, patches and injections. The academy's new advice updates a 2007 birth control policy that didn't recommend specific methods other than condom use. For the first time, the new policy addresses obese teens because pediatricians are seeing increasing numbers of patients whose excess weight may affect birth control effectiveness, Ott said. For example, hormonal patches may be less effective in girls weighing more than 198 pounds, the policy says. Also, obese girls are more likely to gain weight with hormonal injections than with birth control pills.","IUDs or hormonal implants are long-acting birth control methods .
The American Academy of Pediatrics says condoms also should be used every time teens have sex, to provide protection against STIs ."
"Good news for witches – you won’t need your extra-warm cloak as you take to your broomstick tonight. This Halloween will be the hottest on record, according to forecasters. Temperatures could reach 21C (70F) in the South East, eight degrees higher than expected at this time of year. But don’t get too excited; next week will see a return to traditional autumn temperatures. Scroll down for video . Beach life: It was a sunny and warm day in  Brighton, East Sussex, as people relaxed and made the most of the weather . Autumn leaves: A woman rests while two men run today in warm weather at Regent's Park, north London . Beautiful day: People punting on the River Cam in Cambridge today as temperatures remained high in the South East of England . The balmy forecast for today represents another high during a year which is so far the warmest on record. Much of the country has enjoyed sunshine and warm weather this week. Meteogroup forecaster Laura Caldwell said: ‘Friday is expected to break the record for the last day of October. ‘Right across England and Wales it will be warm but it could get up to 21C in the South East, about seven or eight degrees warmer than average. ‘It’s been fairly warm for an October in general. The whole year to date has been the warmest on record so far. It’s been a remarkable year for above-average temperatures.’ Temperatures this week have hovered just below 20C at their peak in central England. Next week the weather will cool as bands of rain cross the country and temperatures will return to the average of around 10C or 11C for November. Met Office forecaster Dan Williams told MailOnline: ‘By Monday night, Tuesday night, we could start to see the temperatures returning to average. ‘We'll start to see the things we expect in November, like snowfall over the mountains in Scotland. That's exactly what we'd expect at this time of year. ‘It's a gradual process - each day will be a little bit colder than the previous. In terms of temperatures going over 20C, you can't completely rule it out. ‘But it becomes less and less likely as you go on into late autumn and early autumn.’ We are sailing: Londoners enjoy warm weather in Regents Park in north London as temperatures were said to have reached 19C . Relaxing: A woman enjoys the weather on Brighton beach, but next week the weather will begin to cool and temperatures will fall . Red sea: Crowds stand at the perimeter of the Tower of London on London Poppy Day, which sees a huge street collection take place . Meanwhile, families looking for pumpkins to help mark Halloween could be disappointed. Some supermarkets are running low after the wet autumn led to one of the worst harvests for years. Thousands of pumpkins rotted in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, with some suppliers reporting losing as many as seven in ten. Some Morrisons stores had run out while Tesco, M&S and Waitrose said they were aware of a shortage. A Morrisons spokesman said: ‘Our buyers have been working extremely hard to bring in extra pumpkins and we aim to have them available up until Halloween.’ Yesterday’s top temperature was 17.1C (62.8F) in Bude, Cornwall, while the coldest in the day was Lentran in the Scottish Highlands, at 8.1C (46.6F). Tonight will be dry in the South East, but there will be a chance of patchy rain in the North-West - while tomorrow will be mostly dry and fine. On Saturday, a band of rain will edge eastwards across much of England and Wales, although East Anglia and south-east England may stay dry. Rain is expected to push south-eastwards across much of the UK on Sunday, but it will turn brighter behind with sunny spells and a risk of showers. The Met Office has no severe weather warnings in place, but the Environment Agency has one flood alert out, for the Upper River Derwent in Cumbria. Three-day forecast: It is expected to reach up to 19C (66F) on Saturday, before falling to 14C (57F) on Sunday . And they're off: Horses run in the Download The Ladbrokes App Apprentice Handicap Stakes at Lingfield racecourse today in Surrey . Meanwhile, Mr Williams moved to dismiss reports today that Britain could be battered by the coldest winter in 100 years. He said: ‘We have seen these kind of forecasts before - we saw the same thing last year before what was a very mild year. ‘Essentially within the short range forecasts we see temperatures by Tuesday return to near normal or below normal for the time of year. 'So it will be feeling much cooler, but that's by no means any kind of Arctic freeze that will bring widespread issues to the UK. ‘Essentially, to forecast the kind of temperatures out to months ahead, the science just doesn’t exist to do that.’ Averages: This Met Office map shows the UK mean temperature for October 1 to 28, compared to the long-term (1981-2010) average . MailOnline’s betting partner Coral is offering 9/1 that it will snow on Christmas Day in Cardiff, 8/1 in London, 8/1 also in Belfast, and 9/2 in Edinburgh. Met Office figures up to last Tuesday show the UK mean temperature for October so far is 11C (52F), which is 1.5C (2.7F) above the long-term average. However, that is far short of the 12.2C (54F) record in 2001 and would currently rank 11th warmest in the forecaster’s national records dating to 1910. Last year’s October average (11.2C; 52.2F), and that of 2011 (11.3C; 52.3F), were both warmer than this year’s early figure. But nine out of the ten months this year have seen above average mean temperatures, with only August having been below average.","Forecasters say UK could see 21C in South East tomorrow, topping October 31 record of 20C in Kent in 1968 .

"A nanny caring for a baby who was having a good old cry before settling down for her afternoon nap got the shock of her life when the police showed up following a complaint. Jenna Cooper says that when she got home from work this past August she was terrified when her nanny informed her that a mother at the playground had called the police on her. Little did she know just why police were called. Over the line: Jenna Cooper (above with daughter Anna) was shocked to learn a Brooklyn mother called the police on her nanny because her baby was crying . 'I heard the word ""police,"" and got really nervous,' Cooper, a lawyer, told Yahoo Parenting. 'But after my nanny Nicki explained the situation to me, my worry turned to anger and disbelief.' Anna, the young child in question, often would take her afternoon nap in her stroller, and it being summer she and Nicki were at the park when she went down for her nap. And, like almost every other toddler and child being out down for a nap, Anna began to cry - loudly. 'My daughter has a strong set of lungs, and she sometimes cries when she’s put down to nap, as I imagine many kids do,' said . 'Since we did sleep training with her when she was very young, we’re fine with that — as Nicki knows.' Taking it too far: Jenna (with her husband and Anna) explained that her daughter usually takes her afternoon nap in her stroller, and often cries . A local mother was not fine with this however, and went over to Nicki to ask why the baby was crying. After Nicki explained the woman walked off, accusing her of neglect, and called the police. Unfortunately for the angry woman, by the time police arrived, Anna was asleep and they were confused as to why they had been called in. Feeling bad for Nicki, and upset, Jenna then did what many mother in Brooklyn do, writing about what happened her neighborhood listserv. 'As I told our nanny, if she had let my daughter crawl/play around unsupervised, I would obviously have a serious problem and would appreciate someone looking out for my daughter’s safety,' she wrote. 'But the fact that she let her cry before a nap is totally par for the course and in my mind does not constitute anything close to neglect. (If you think it does, you should call the cops on me, too.)' Happy girl: Jenna (with Anna) then wrote on a local listserv about the incident, saying to call the police was inappropriate . 'While I appreciate that parents in the neighborhood are keeping a watchful eye while some of us are working, let’s remember that getting the police involved is a serious decision and one that should be reserved for obvious cases of neglect/abuse, not merely situations that exemplify child-rearing styles different than one’s own.' Lucky for Jenna, almost everyone seemed to agree with her. Wrote one father, 'In a world of internet intemperance and incendiary outbursts, you have written a response to provocation that is a model of sanity and reason.'","Jenna Cooper says that her nanny Nicki had a woman call the police on her while she was caring for Jenna's toddler Anna .

"A civil liberties campaigner decided to turn the tables on a Washington state sheriff by pulling him over for patrolling in uniform in an unmarked car and issued him a stern warning. Gavin Seim, a former candidate for the US Congress, videoed the entire incident after he caught the officer on Saturday driving through Grant County. Flagging the patrolling officer down, Seim asks the man, who identifies himself as Deputy Canfield of The Grant County Sheriff's Office, if he is working undercover or on patrol. Scroll Down for Video . You what? Deputy sheriff Canfield initially entertains Gavin Seim's intervention and listens as he upholds the law . Hmmmm........The attitude of the deputy changes as Seim explains that he has fallen foul of the law . Prove it: Seim makes the officer produce his official identification as he explains to him the 1937 Washington state law . Staggered: The officer is mildly taken aback when Seim explains that he will not be reporting him and is letting him off with a warning . The unsuspecting Canfield makes the straightforward admission he is driving on patrol, which Seim jumps on and tells the deputy that he is breaking the law. Indeed, he explains to Canfield that in Washington, it is against the law for a non-state officer to work patrols in unmarked vehicles and subsequently any deputy in one could be arrested. The deputy then stares at Seim and tries to regain the upper hand by telling him, 'This is not a game.' Unfazed, Seim shoots back calmly, 'You are right, this isn't a game, it is the law.' The officer then realizes that because he is being videoed it is best to follow through with Seim's requests and produces his ID when asked by the civil rights champion. Incredibly, after checking the deputy's ID, Seim tells him that he is lucky - because in this case he will only give him a warning and tells him to return to his station and review the law. Result: Gavin Seim has been a thorn in the side of law enforcement officers for years and has even run for congress in the past . Seim tells the officer that police in uniform on patrol need to be in marked cars for safety reasons. He then tells the officer that the public need to know who is representing the law and who is not. The directive was first introduced in Washington State in 1937 and states that 'vehicle marking exemption for vehicles used by sheriffs, local police and local peace officers is continued but is limited to vehicles used for undercover or confidential investigative purposes” and was implemented to provide better public visibility of government owned vehicles.' Gavin Seim has a history of interfering in the day to day activities of law enforcement officers in a bid to keep them honest. He claims his actions are justifiable because he is acting to 'hold police and other state authorities accountable'.","Free speech advocate Gavin Seim pulled off the stunt on Saturday .

"A 47-year-old man has been charged after he allegedly lured and sexually assaulted a woman and teenager using an online classified for flatmate.

"Florida authorities opened a new investigation into the 2010 death of a woman whose shooting was ruled a suicide, her family's attorneys said on Friday, after questions were raised about the local police department's handling of the case. Florida Governor Rick Scott earlier signed an executive order appointing a state prosecutor without apparent conflicts to investigate the death of Michelle O'Connell. Scott appointed Jeffrey Ashton, a state attorney from the Orlando area, to oversee the investigation. 'Today, we are heartened that this won't be the end of my sister's story,' said her sister, Jennifer O'Connell, in a statement. 'We will continue to fight for Michelle, as long as it takes.' The 24-year-old mother was found shot to death on Sept. 2, 2010, at the St. Augustine home of her boyfriend, St. Johns County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremy Banks, whose weapon was used. Banks has denied any involvement in her death. What really happened? Michelle O'Connell was found was found shot to death at the St. Augustine home of her boyfriend and deputy Jeremy Banks . Boyfriend: Banks has denied any involvement in his girlfriend's 2010 death, which involved his service weapon . On Monday, Michelle O'Connell's friend Ciara Morris told ActionNewsJax 'I’m very confident someone like Jeff Ashton will do the right thing and give this case the look that it deserves and answer any lingering questions and look at all the facts from scratch and not just the former investigation but he will put it together himself. It gives us a significant amount of hope.' Questions about improprieties in the death inquiries, in which local law enforcement authorities investigated one of their own, have drawn national media attention. Last year The New York Times and Frontline covered the story. The Times reported that at the scene 'though investigators collected the gun, clothing and other evidence, they never tested it for fingerprints, DNA or gunshot residue. Officers also failed to canvass neighbors; failed to file required reports on what officers had seen that night; failed to download Mr. Banks’s cellphone data or collect and test one of the shirts he wore that night and failed to isolate and photograph Mr. Banks before he was interviewed.' During an investigation with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), two women later said they heard Banks and O'Connell argue before she was killed, according to the newspaper. Later, a crime scene re-constructionist with the FDLE 'concluded that for the shells to end up where they had [...] whoever pulled the trigger had to have been left-handed. Unlike Ms. O'Connell, Mr. Banks is left-handed,' The Times said. The newspaper also contacted various experts, who disagreed with the assertions of one of the medical examiners brought in that O'Connell shot herself with the gun in an upside down position and its tactical light caused an injury on her face. O'Connell's friends and relatives have said that evidence such as a bruise, cut and a broken tooth suggest that she may not have killed herself, but was the victim of abuse. They stressed that she would never have left her young daughter, Alexis. Christine O'Connell told The Times that Banks abused her sister on multiple occasions. 'She was afraid of him, and Alexis was afraid of him,' she told the newspaper. Speaking out: Jennifer O'Connell is seen next to one of the O'Connell family attorneys, Benjamin Crump, on Friday . 'There is no evidence and no truth that points to Jeremy Banks as being responsible for Michelle O'Connell's death,' said Banks' Florida attorney, Mac McLeod, adding that a brother with whom she was close is supporting Banks. Others in the O'Connell family had petitioned Scott for the independent probe. Their request moved forward as he faces a tight re-election campaign. The new investigation also follows heightened attention to domestic violence amid allegations of abuse by players in the National Football League. The attorney for Banks, who is suing a FDLE investigator involved in the case, denied allegations of abuse in their relationship. A new witness recently emerged accusing Banks of inflammatory remarks the night after her death, said McLeod, calling the allegation false. In an affidavit obtained by ABC News, Danny Harmon claimed on Sept. 3, 2010,  '[Banks] told me that all she ever did was put him down and make him feel bad about himself. He was going to be moving on with his life, and he wasn’t going to let the [expletive] hold him back anymore.' 'It is part of the bigger picture of women who stay in relationships that are fraught with violence and abuse,' said Janet Johnson, a Florida attorney for the family. 'Our belief is that Michelle had told him that it was over and that she was ending this cycle, and that's what precipitated this horrible ending,' she said. Domestic violence? Christine O'Connell has said Banks abused her sister on multiple occasions . Questions about improprieties in the death inquiries, in which local law enforcement authorities investigated one of their own, have drawn national media attention . Experts have disagreed with the assertions of a medical examiner  that O'Connell shot herself with the gun in an upside down position and its tactical light caused an injury on her face . Sheriff David Shoar said in a statement 'Since 2010, many of you have become aware of the tragic death of Michelle O’Connell. The more this case became controversial, the more we embraced the idea of having two experienced death investigators who are 'objective,' 'expertly trained,' with years of experience and who have not been subjected to the vagaries of social media, examine and review this case. On many occasions I have thought about asking for this but chose not to once I realized the utter unfairness it would be to Deputy Banks. Along that same line, I often wish some of us could walk for a bit in his shoes. We are confident that the new Special Prosecutor will reach the same conclusion that one law enforcement agency, two State Attorney’s including one who was assigned as a Special Prosecutor by the Governor, and three medical examiners; that the tragic death of Michelle O’Connell was the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We certainly hope that the O’Connell family finds peace and acceptance in the findings of this new Special Prosecutor, something we have never been able to provide. 'We must also remember that a year and a half ago I filed a very serious complaint with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement accusing two of their personnel with serious misconduct relating to this case. Immediately after filing this complaint, one agent retired and the other was placed on paid leave where I believe he remains today. 'Additionally, State Attorney Bill Cervone is currently investigating one of those agents (Rusty Rodgers) for 'Official Misconduct' in regards to this case and his treatment of Deputy Banks. 'Finally and very importantly, Deputy Banks and Michelle’s brother Deputy Scott O’Connell have both filed civil lawsuits against the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and their agents Pape and Rodgers. It is truly ironic that the man that certain members of the O’Connell family have accused of being culpable in Michelle’s death is the one filing a civil lawsuit where one cannot hide behind the Fifth Amendment.'","Florida Governor Rick Scott signed an executive order appointing a state prosecutor  to investigate the death of Michelle O'Connell .

"Borussia Dortmund's general manager Hans-Joachim Watzke is optimistic Marco Reus will still be at the club next season. Reus is the focus of interest from Bayern Munich and reportedly from clubs in England and Spain, with a clause in his contract permitting him to leave for a set fee at the end of the current campaign. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge claimed several months ago that he knows the value of that clause to be £19.9 million. Marco Reus will be at Borussia Dortmund next season, insists general manager Hans-Joachim Watzke . However, suitors would need to convince the 25-year-old to leave his home region of Westphalia. 'I believe that fundamentally Marco would love to stay here because he loves the city and he loves Borussia Dortmund,' Watzke told Stern magazine. 'But I'm sure the people who are interested in him moving will provide him with other arguments.' Reus (right) has a release clause in his contract that becomes active at the end of this season . Dortmund have seen Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski move to Bayern in the past two years and are eager to avoid losing another star player to their bitter rivals. If Reus were to leave, he would not be sold for financial reasons, Watzke has suggested. 'We're aiming to build revenue to around 300 million euros by 2017/18, but that excludes transfers,' he added. 'That would mean we would be able to invest an additional 20 million in the team than we can now.'

"Eight-year-old Gabe White has long supported his big brother's football team - so in the last game of the season, they decided to show their appreciation. The freshman team at Rhinelander High School in Wisconsin called the youngster, who has Down syndrome, out on the field for the last play on Thursday and handed him the ball. A video captured by a fan in the stands shows the moment he slowly figured out what was going on - before out-running his opponents and scoring an incredible touchdown. The touching moment was thought up by coach Mark Apfel. Scroll down for videos . Final play: Gabe White (center) runs to grab the ball after his big brother Owen (left) deflected it towards him during the final home game of the season at Rhinelander High School in Wisconsin on Thursday . On his way: Gabe, seen bottom left, grabs the ball and runs down the field as his rivals fail to stop him . No stopping him: A player from rival team Mosinee leaps towards the boy but he keeps on running . 'Just have him on the sidelines, he makes everybody happier,' team coach Mark Apfel told WAOW. 'So that made me think I wanted to do something special with him.' After the final play in their losing game against Mosinee, the team headed back out on the field and called Gabe on. The other team kicked the ball off and Gabe's big brother Owen White intercepted it - before knocking it down towards the boy. He scrambled to pick it up and, with a few helpful nudges from his brother, he took off, dodging his opponents, who made a convincing show of diving towards him and tumbling to the ground. Winner: He reaches the endzone and throws up his hands in celebration as his teammates celebrate . Fan: The team lift up Gabe after he scores the touchdown at Rhinelander High School on Thursday night . After he scored, he threw up his hands in celebration and the rest of his team ran towards him before hoisting him into the air. 'When he got in the endzone, we just went and picked him up and started chanting ""Gabe"",' said Owen White. 'It was special.' And the pint-sized football fan hasn't stopped talking about it since. 'I ran a touchdown and made a score!' Gabe told WAOW. Excited: Gabe has long supported his big brother's team and calls himself their honorary manager . Thankful: The team's coach, Mark Apfel (left) came up with the idea to give Gabe a special experience, while Gabe's big brother Owen (right), who plays on the team, was also in on the secret . The team said it was their way of showing Gabe, who calls himself their 'manager', just how much they appreciate him. Gabe's older brother said that when the team is losing 'and it's kind of a rough game, he'll go up to a player, give him a hug, just changes your mood'. Apfel added: 'I hope [he] will remember this for the rest of his life because it was a special moment for us.'

"Victim: Joshua Unsworth, 15, was found hanged after allegedly being bullied on social media sites . A schoolboy found hanged in his parents’ garden had complained of cyber-bullying on a notorious social networking site, it has emerged. Josh Unsworth, 15, had endured months of abusive messages on his profile on  Ask.fm, which has been described by child safety experts as a ‘stalker’s paradise’. At one point his father Gary, 46, apparently took over the page, threatening to report the abusers to police. Josh himself wrote: ‘Last time I checked, cyber-bullying and “trolling” were a criminal offence.’ Ask.fm has been heavily criticised by anti-bullying charities because it allows users to post anonymous comments or questions – often of a sexual or insulting nature – on the pages of children as young as 13. It is not covered by British online safety regulations as it is based in Latvia. An investigation into Josh’s death is at an early stage, and police who have spoken to his family say they have not been made aware he had problems with bullies. Nevertheless, friends have taken to Facebook to blame bullies for the tragedy. One wrote: ‘R.I.P Josh Unsworth, we’ll forever remember you! Bullied to death.’ Another said: ‘I hope your bullies can’t sleep at night knowing what they did to you.’ Josh, whose father is sales director of a haulage firm, attended St Cecilia’s Roman Catholic High School in Longridge, Lancashire. His body was found in the garden of the family’s stone-built converted farmhouse in a nearby village last Thursday morning. The headteacher of Joshua's school asked parents to make children aware of the effects of cyber-bullying . His parents, Gary and Michelle, both 46, yesterday said: ‘Our son Joshua . was a thoughtful, loving, compassionate boy. We will miss him dearly.’ Teachers are understood not to have been aware of problems with bullies, . but posts on Joshua’s Ask.fm profile page – which remained online . yesterday – make worrying reading. Last September, an anonymous poster wrote that he was a ‘f****** . n*****d’. It went on: ‘honestly no one cares for you even your parents . don’t want you, there (sic) gunna put you in care’. In response, Josh wrote that his father had looked at his account and . planned to report the abuse to police. Messages apparently written by Mr . Unsworth followed, demanding an apology and adding he had called the . police. Some posts appeared to mock Josh’s father’s occupation, calling the . teenager a ‘farmer’, while others accused him of mistreating girls and . acting like ‘a player’. In response to a post stating ‘no one likes you’, Josh apparently . replied: ‘Let me tell you within that time I have learnt that words are, . well, just words so whatever your miserable low life self thinks of me . can say to my face or on here knowing I don’t care.’ Many posts however, . contained supportive messages, apparently from friends. Joshua was a year 11 pupil at St Cecilia's Roman Catholic High School in Longridge . Josh’s headteacher, Steve Tattersall, said he would be asking parents to . speak to their children about the possible impact of negative comments . on social media. He said: ‘I’m aware of some of the comments that are being made about . Josh’s sad death on social networks, both by those who knew him, and . those who did not.’ He added: ‘Josh was always a smiling, friendly presence in school  which . made him very popular.’  Schools across the country have written to . pupils in recent months urging them not to use Ask.fm, which has more . than 30 million users worldwide. Earlier this year Jim Gamble, former chief executive of the  Child . Exploitation and Online  Protection Centre, said the site  had been . linked with a number of recent teen suicides in Ireland and the US. He said: ‘It is almost a stalker’s paradise. Young people need . protection from those who exploit internet anonymity to intimidate, . isolate and bully.’ Lancashire police said: ‘We are in the very early stages of an . investigation and it would be premature to speculate about the possible . reason for his death.’ An inquest will be held at a later date.

"High-flyer: Banker Svetlana Lokhova, who nicknamed ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ during a smear campaign by her bullying male colleagues, is claiming compensation of £14 million after she won her employment tribunal . A high-flying banker nicknamed ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ during a smear campaign by her bullying male colleagues is claiming compensation of £14 million after she won her employment tribunal. Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova, who worked in the London office of Russian firm Sberbank, said she was victimised before being unfairly dismissed. Last November, the tribunal rejected 19 of the 22 complaints made by Miss Lokhova but found in her favour on the substantive areas of harassment and intimidation on the grounds of her gender. The tribunal heard that colleagues referred to her as 'mad Svetlana', 'Crazy Miss Cokehead' and told her to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to 'calm her down.' She was also branded 'crazy, mental, totally unstable, quite likely clinically bonkers' and 'a major car crash.' Miss Lokhova claimed she had been targeted because she had previously reported a senior trader for insider dealing, who was later dismissed. The tribunal also ruled that her main tormentor David Longmuir should have been fired from the bank for gross misconduct. Mr Longmuir, Miss Lokhova’s former manager at Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd, not only sent a host of emails but also made remarks behind her back that were 'offensive and derogatory and often personal in nature.' He referred to Miss Lokhova as 'Miss Bonkers' said she had 'unfortunate natural brain chemistry' and described the daughter of a Russian shipping broker as 'living in a flat that Daddy bought.' Today Miss Lokhova told Central London Employment Tribunal even though she had won her case, being dragged though the courts had ruined her reputation and meant she would never work in finance again. Place of work: Cambridge graduate Miss Lokhova had worked in the London office of Russian firm Sberbank, where she says she was victimised before being unfairly dismissed . 'I am completely broken down and exhausted by the respondent’s campaign against me,' she said. 'I endured six months of abuse at work and almost three years of highly acrimonious litigation which has had a profound aspect on every part of my life.' She said she had even been referred to with the 'Little Miss Cokehead' nickname at a family gathering because of publicity. And because the bank had dragged her sister’s name into proceedings, her sibling refused to speak with her. 'My name will be forever linked with drug addiction and mental instability,' said Ms Lokhova. 'I have suffered extreme detriment and could not hope to return to financial services. 'It is a highly regulated industry and no one would want to employ someone accused by a previous manager of being a cocaine addict and mentally unstable. 'I can never return to financial services again, which I loved and where I was enjoying considerable success. Everybody knows everybody’s business in banking and people believe there is no smoke without a fire. My reputation has been shredded.' Ruling: The first tribunal found Ms Lokhova's (pictured) former manager David Longmuir who referred to her as 'Miss Bonkers' should have been fired from the bank for gross misconduct . Sberbank, the former Soviet savings bank, has been transformed under Herman Gref, a former economy minister for Russian president Vladimir Putin. The bank is Russia’s largest lender, held almost half of the nation’s deposits last year and has diversified into investment banking and asset management. The resources of Sberbank and its subsidiary Troika Dialog UK, where Miss Lokhova worked, have now been integrated under Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd. Ms Lokhova said she was employed because of her proven ability to make money and, had she not been harassed, would have continued to make money for the bank. In her first period of employment, from 2008 until 2010, she said she was earning £80,000, which rose to £120,000 in 2009. She left for a year, but was offered a job at the bank in 2011 - which is when the discrimination occurred that led her to take sick leave in January 2012. Had she remained in employment she claims she would have been rewarded pay rises of ten per cent until it reached £200,000. In this period she received a bonus of £189,000 in 2009. She also pointed out she had generated £5.7m of a £18.8m profit for the bank and was awarded a cash bonus of £570,000. 'There was only one other employee who earned a larger cash bonus than this,' she added. Ms Lokhova, who has appeared as a Russia expert on BBC Radio 4’s the Today Programme, said the only other field she could hoped to be employed in was academia, which would pay far less than banking. She added she was hugely in debt after the litigation, accusing the bank of trying to drag the procedure out as long as possible so she would run our of money and be forced to give up. 'The bank believes I am entitled to no compensation,' she said. 'The bank chose to throw all its resources into defending the claim. As a result everything I have worked for in life has been irretrievably damaged. I spent £1.2million at the liability stage.' Success: The bank is Russia’s largest lender, held almost half of the nation’s deposits last year and has diversified into investment banking and asset management . She also said she had not received any apology from the bank and despite the tribunal’s findings Mr Longmuir should have been fired, he was not. She added: 'Despite the tribunal’s findings those responsible have not been punished and the bank has offered no apology for its wrongdoing. 'David Longmuir left the bank under a compromise agreement, the bank decided it would not dismiss him. The other individuals have not been investigated. No reforms have been made. 'The lack of remorse the respondent has shown adds credibility to their derogatory remarks.' The bank accuses her of wanting to get as much money out of them as she can, pointing out she did not raise initial grievance until after she had been paid her bonus in 2012. The bank also questions whether she was indeed worth the amount of money she is claiming she was, adding she “lacked the multifaceted experience” she would have needed to earn those sums had she she stayed in 2012. It also accuses her of lying about her inability to return to a career in finance, saying she has exaggerated the damage to her reputation. The tribunal continues.","Svetlana Lokhova worked in the London office of Russian firm Sberbank .

"Two sisters have sued the founders of Snapchat for using their images without permission to promote the popular app. Sarah and Elizabeth Turner, who both live in Georgia, say cofounders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy caused them 'emotional distress, embarrassment and the loss of pecuniary value of the use of their photographs, images and likenesses’ when they led them to believe that their pictures, which they took for free in 2011, would be used for a 'class project'. In most of the pictures, the girls - who were 18 and 19 years old at the time - are shown on the beach in bathing suits. One of the images, however, is cropped to make them appear naked, as if one sister is pulling the other one's top off, according to the lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Faces of Snapchat! Sarah and Elizabeth Turner are suing the app, saying they were led to believe its founders were using their pictures for 'a school project' The girls' images have appeared on Snapchat's site as well as in the carousels that come up when you click into the app from iTunes' App Store and the Google Play Store. Mr Spiegel also used Elizabeth's image when he was promoting the app in its early days. In a pitch to blog BroBible, he said of Elizabeth: 'The girl who modeled in our iTunes screenshots is from Duke and very good looking.' He then attached her picture to the email as 'proof.' Now, more than three years later, the sisters claim that the app's 'tawdry reputation as being a ""sexting app""' has tarnished their own personae. As an example, the lawsuit points out, the Turners' images appears when you type 'Snapchat slut' into Google. To make matters worse, their photos, they say, have helped Snapchat grow into one of the world's most popular apps. It was recently valued at $10billion - and they haven't received a penny. Scandalous! While some of the pictures are innocent, the lawsuit points to a picture (on the right) that is cropped to make the girls appear naked . Will they get any money?Snapchat did make the sisters sign a model release form, but it said they pictures could be used for iPhones only - and Snapchat is now extremely popular on Androids . The younger of the two sisters, Elizabeth, was first contacted in 2011 by Mr Spiegel, who was then a student at Stanford, asking her to come pose for pictures at his Pacific Palisades, California, home, according to the lawsuit. Elizabeth, who was doing some professional modeling at the time, said she would come only if her sister Sarah could come along. Mr Spiegel and Mr Murphy photographed the sisters at various locations in Los Angeles. They were reportedly told that the pictures would be used for 'a school project.' Three days after the photo shoot, Mr Spiegel sent the Turners a Model Release form, which they both signed. In the document, Snapchat - which was then called Picaboo - was given all rights to the pictures for the purpose of promoting the app 'for iPhone.' (The app is also available on Android.) The document also said the Turners would not be paid for their participation - and that Snapchat would not be responsible for 'any expense or liability incurred as a result of [the girls'] participation.' Almost twins! Sarah (left) and Elizabeth Turner (right) were 19 and 18, respectively, at the time the pictures were taken . Intentionally deceptive? Snapchat cofounder Evan Spiegel initially contacted the Turners in 2011 . Earlier this year, Snapchat was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of deceiving customers about the disappearing nature of messages sent through its service.The company and the FTC were able to reach a settlement. Even amidst the legal troubles, Snapchat is growing rapidly: Almost a third of 18- to 24-year-olds use the app (that's more than double the amount of users the company had last November).","Sarah and Elizabeth Turner’s images appears in Google after a search for 'Snapchat sluts,' the lawsuit says .

"Survivors of the 2004 tsunami have been left 'in tears' as cinemas are screening the trailer for a movie about the disaster without warning. The trailer for the film uses graphic imagery to re-tell the story of one family's fight for survival after the 98-foot-tidal wave hit Thailand on Boxing Day eight years ago. The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami in the Indian Ocean killed 230,000 people, including 155 British citizens. Traumatic: The trailer for new film The Impossible, starring Ewan McGregor is being shown in cinemas in the days before the eighth anniversary of the tragedy . The promotional video for The Impossible, starring Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts, is being screened without any prior notice . before fantasy fiction movie The Hobbit. Now a tsunami survivors' group said they are . aware of survivors and grieving relatives who have been 'caught . out' by the trailer. One incident saw a man who flew to Thailand to identify his sister-in-law following the 2004 tragedy being 'ambushed' by the trailer during a screening of The Hobbit at the Odeon in Maidenhead, Berkshire. He said: 'On Boxing Day 2004 I got the . worst telephone call of my life from my brother in Thailand telling me . his wife had been killed when they were overwhelmed by the wave. 'I flew out immediately to bring him . home and help trace his wife. Only those who were there can understand . the trauma of it all. 'This time of year is terrible for my . brother, his wife's family and me because it brings back the memories . like it was yesterday.' Haunting: Tsunami Survivors UK said the graphic imagery of the trailer brings back memories for those who were affected by the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 . The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, . added that his brother had been invited along to watch The Hobbit but . had thankfully declined. 'There were scenes of people drowning and bodies floating about and it brought it all back so hard. 'I could not believe a cinema chain could be so ignorant and crass as to show such a trailer without any prior warning. The 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami was a result of an underwater earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Over 230,000 people died when the massive waves hit the coasts of the countries surrounding the Indian Ocean. The worst hit countries were Indonesia, India, Thailand and Sri Lanka. The tsunami hit many tourist resorts killing thousands of foreign nationals. The highest death tolls for foreign nationalities were Sweden, 543 and Germany, 539. 'This was nothing more than an ambush in surround sound and 3D on a giant screen in front of me. 'I was furious and close to tears. It could not have been any more distressing.' Tsunami survivor Steve Gill has not . personally been caught out by the trailer but said he knows of others in . his situation who has. The 59-year-old who now works for Tsunami Support UK, was carried away by the wave while his teaching assistant wife Heather, 42, was killed during their holiday in Thailand. He said: 'When you go to the cinema to watch a fantasy fiction film such The Hobbit, you do not expect to be dragged back to the worst day of your life. 'For survivors of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, The Impossible trailer and film is the antithesis of entertainment. 'You can't stop people making films about the disaster and people have a choice whether they go to see it. 'But cinemas should issue a warning prior to the trailer so people who are there for a form of escapism are not ambushed.' Distress: Survivors and their relatives urge cinema's to issue a warning prior to the trailer so they are not 'ambushed' Steve, from Portsmouth, Hampshire . added: 'The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami is the biggest natural disaster any . of us can remember and it directly affected 10,000 British people. 'Around 9,000 people returned to the . UK from affected areas having been there when the tsunami hit and 1,000 . were injured or hospitalised. 'That is a large number of people who . would be very traumatised by what is a faithful rendition of the wave . hitting, especially so close to the anniversary.' 'One of our members went to a private screening of the film and was in floods of tears. 'He is very level-headed and not an emotional man but he could not control himself.' Reality: The aftermath on one of the Phi Phi islands, Thailand, two days after the 2004 tsunami . The man forced to identify his sister-in-law after the disaster added that there ought to be a warning before the tsunami trailer. 'It was less than eight years ago and is almost on the anniversary. It is too raw a subject to ambush on anybody. 'Can you imagine what would have happened if my brother was sat next to me when that came on screen? 'I genuinely fear that relatives and close friends of victims will find themselves in that position over Christmas and the New Year.' He said his family has contacted the manager of the Maidenhead branch who said that Odeon had not realised the potential impact. An Odeon spokesman said: 'All trailers are classified by the British Board of Film Classification before being shown on screen. 'Film fans expect a wide choice when they visit their local Odeon and we do our best to meet those expectations. 'In doing so, this may include films and trailers that unfortunately are not to everyone's personal taste as we consider the enjoyment of films to be subjective. 'We can only apologise for any offence caused on this occasion.'","Trailer for The Impossible shown before The Hobbit .

"The Connecticut doctor whose family was mercilessly killed in a 2007 home invasion has given a rare interview in which he reveals his lifelong torment over the incident and what it means for his new family, including his baby son. Dr. William Petit, who was savagely beaten before his wife was strangled and left to burn in their home with their 17- and 11-year-old daughters, says he now can't shake the fear that something terrible could happen to 10-month-old William Petit III. 'What if something happens to the baby? What would you do? What would you think,' he told the Hartford Courant in an interview published Sunday. 'You want to feel like it didn't happen. But after a while, then you realize it never goes away.' Sorting through trauma: Pictured here with his Now 10-month-old son, Petit says he sometimes succumbs to fears that his new family could be harmed the way his last one was . One day at a time: Now remarried to wife Christine, right, Petit says getting out of bed was almost impossible in the initial months after his daughters and wife were ruthlessly slain . The interview was a rare glimpse inside the mind of a man who's been to hell and back. It was a harrowing journey that began in 2007 when Petit and his family were held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by invaders Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky. Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds. After the 11-year-old was raped and her mother raped and strangled to death, the intruders set the home ablaze and left all but Petit dead. 'I used to have awful weeks and awful days. Now, most of the time, it's awful minutes and hours,' Petit, who married his current wife Christine in 2012, told the Courant. Horrific: Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds only to be killed via smoke inhalation when their captors set alight their Connecticut home after raping and strangling their mother, Jennifer . 'What if something happens to the baby? What would you do? What would you think,' Petit revealed. 'You want to feel like it didn't happen. But after a while, then you realize it never goes away' Petit describes a time, back when things were at their toughest, when he had little more keeping him going than the solace that came from the kindness of strangers. 'Right in the aftermath, there was money pouring in from multiple sources from all 50 states, overseas, everywhere,' said Petit, who started a charity in his family's names. 'I was blessed to have so much support,' Petit quit practicing medicine after his harrowing ordeal to focus solely on the non-profit, though in the beginning it wasn't always easy. 'I was dazed, semifunctional,' he told the Courant. 'I pretty much couldn't get through the meetings without crying.' The years since have been a slow crawl towards normalcy for Petit. While his new life has been a godsend, he says its sometimes difficult not to fear for their safety now, too. 'That happened last night while I was thinking about the baby,' he said. 'And then I'm thinking about Michaela, thinking about Hayley, thinking about Jennifer. My brain is just thinking all of these terrible memories.' Still, Petit is in the business of keeping the memory of his past family alive even if it's difficult sometimes. 'I don't want people to forget Jennifer, Hayley and Michaela, and I want some good to come because they would have done an awful lot of good if they had lived their natural lives. I want their lives to go forward, and I want to be able to pay it forward for them,' he told the Courant. The family's horrific end came when Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky spotted Mrs Hawke-Petit at a supermarket and followed her to her home in Cheshire, Connecticut, where they tied up the family. Both Michaela and her sister, Hayley, were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the men doused the home with gas and set it on fire. Both Hayes and Komisarjevsky were convicted and sentenced to death.

"Film companies and record labels will not be able to force mash-ups and spoofs to be taken down from the internet under a major shake-up of copyright law. Ministers have vowed to legalise parodies after countless viral hits have disappeared from sites like YouTube because multi-national firms failed to see the funny side. It also means the creators of hits like the countless parodies of the Hitler film Downfall, Cassetteboy's mash-ups of TV shows and the genius behind the Masterchef Synthesia (buttery biscuit base) will no longer be breaking the law by copying and editing popular TV shows. Scroll down for video . Parodies of the 2004 film Downfall are now so widespread online there is even one which shows Hitler's fury at the number of spoof versions . The shake-up, ordered by Lib Dem Vince . Cable, also means the hilarious video of his boss Nick Clegg 'singing' his tuition fees apology would be freed from copyright control. The government argues 300-year-old laws have failed to keep pace with online technology, which makes it easy for anyone with a computer to create smash hit videos online. It means internet successes will no longer be killed off by complaints by global entertainment giants. Last year a Greenpeace spoof of an advert for VW was pulled after a complaint from the car firm. It complained about the manufacturer's commitment to being green. Mash-up creators like Cassetteboy have long run the risk of breaching copyright laws by editing clips from TV shows like the Apprentice and documentaries by Boris Johnson to comic effect. This summer Mr Clegg became an . internet sensation after filming an apology for breaking his promise to . vote against a rise in tuition fees. Alex . Ross from comedy website The Poke re-edited it to music, so it sounded . like the Deputy Prime Minister was singing his regret to voters. After . securing permission from Mr Clegg, the song was released as a single . ahead of the Lib Dem annual conference - but only reached 143 in the . official charts. Proceeds went to Sheffield Children's Hospital. VIDEO: Masterchef Synthesia mash-up has been watched 5.8million times . Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, told MPs: 'The creative industries sector, which is crucial to the economy, depends heavily on intellectual property rights. 'However, we are dealing with a body of law that is extremely old - I believe that it goes back to Queen Anne. It certainly needs modification in the digital age.' The new rules on ‘parody, caricature and pastiche’ set out by the government will ‘allow limited copying on a fair dealing basis which would allow genuine parody, but prohibit copying disguised as parody’. The changes to copyright laws will also mean music users who copy CDs to iPods and laptops will no longer be treated as criminals. Ministers will scrap the law which means it is technically illegal for someone to copy a CD or ebook on to an iPod or Kindle. Most of the millions of people using mobile music devices have no idea they are unwittingly breaking the law every time they move a song from one device to another. Six years ago, the British Phonographic Industry said it would not seek to punish people, provided they were only copying tracks for their personal use. Users will be able to copy music and ebooks between devices without breaking the law under the shake-up of copyright . But only now have the government agreed to change the law to keep pace with technology, which sees people regularly swapping and copying files between devices and software like iTunes. The change means users will be able to copy files as many times as they like for their own use, but it will still be illegal to give copies to other people. The government has also ruled out imposing an ‘iTax’ on all music storage devices, despite being levied across much of Europe. Mr Cable has refused to follow other EU countries that have imposed a copyright levy – dubbed an ‘iTax’ - on any technology that can copy, including iPods, computers and photocopiers. For example, in France, a 64GB iPod is hit with an iTax of 15 euros. In Poland the charge is added to anything which can be used to make a copy, including blank paper. It puts Britain at loggerheads with Brussels, where EU officials are drawing up plans for a Europe-wide iTax, due to be announced within weeks. Mr Cable is refusing to back the idea of an EU levy set centrally by Brussels. A raft of changes will make it easier for people to use work covered by copyright without getting permission from the copyright owners. Teachers will be able to use more material on interactive whiteboards and share files across secure networks for students. Sound recordings, films and broadcasts can also be copied for non-commercial research and private study purposes. Under existing legislation a breach of copyright can be punishable by up to two years in prison or a fine of £5,000.","Copyright law shake-up to make it easier to transfer files between devices .
iPod and e-book users will not be criminalised if copy is for personal use .

"A couple had to be rescued in a race against the high tide when they found themselves trapped waist-high in quicksand on a Cumbrian beach. The man, 46, and woman, 25, screamed for help as they began to sink - only a fortnight after a 14-year-old girl became trapped at the same spot. The woman was submerged up to her waist and the man stuck from his knees down before they were pulled from the quicksand on Sunday afternoon in a 40-minute rescue operation. A man and woman were pulled from quicksand after they became stuck on a Cumbrian beach . The 25-year-old woman, who has not been named, was submerged up to her waist at Sandside, overlooking Morecambe Bay . Emergency teams raced against the high tide to pull the couple from the quicksand . Their pet dog also became trapped in the mud at Sandside, overlooking Morecambe Bay, but managed to free itself. They were close to a sign that reads: 'DANGER Beware fast rising tides, quicksands, hidden channels.' Local man Craig Woodburn, 27, threw a lifebelt to the couple while his wife Julie drove off in search of another one. He and off-duty police officer Belinda Friend shouted advice and kept onlookers away from danger. 'The tide was due in so it was very scary, but I did what anybody else would have done,' said Mr Woodburn, who had been celebrating Father's Day with his wife and son Alfie at the nearby Ship Inn pub. 'I've lived round here all my life and . know the dangers. I've been in difficulty on the sand myself as a child. You just don't walk there.' The coastguard and local MPs have warned that people could die on the sands following two rescue operations within a month. The man, 46, and his partner were treated for shock at the scene of the rescue . Rescuers lost some of their equipment to the quicksand, which was described as a 9ft-deep lake by the coastguard . Craig Woodburn, 27, began the rescue efforts by throwing lifebelts and shouting advice to the couple, who found themselves trapped near this 'DANGER' sign . Nigel Capstick, Arnside station . manager, said: 'After the incident two weeks ago, we predicted another . would happen, although we never expected the conditions to be this bad. 'If people don't listen to the warnings someone will die on the sands.' He praised Mr Woodburn's actions, saying: 'It's important that . people who do the right thing are recognised. 'A lot of people walk past and don't help those in trouble and Craig deserves credit.' Mr Capstick said sand in the area . tended to solidify within minutes of someone getting stuck so gallons of . water had to be injected into the ground to loosen it. He said a combination of heavy rain . and shifting channels has caused conditions to worsen. On the day of the rescue the . sands were 9ft deep. 'The quicksand was horrendous,' he . said. 'It was a lake of sand. I have never seen it so bad. People do not . realise how lethal it is.' The couple seen awaiting rescue. Their pet dog managed to free itself and escape . The coastguard, paramedics, firefighters, police and the RNLI joined in the rescue efforts . Cedric Robinson, the Queen's Guide to the Sands warned residents to stay away from the bay because he had never known it to be so dangerous following the rescue of the 14-year-old girl. Conditions were so bad that rescuers' equipment sank in the quicksand and could not be retrieved. The couple, who have not been identified, were freed at 4.10pm and treated for shock at the scene. Tim Farron, MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, spoke of his 'relief' that nobody died during the rescue, but said: 'This latest incident is a reminder that we're not far off. 'Local people know how dangerous the sands . are but I think local authorities need to raise the awareness of . tourists that the sands are beautiful but incredibly dangerous.' This was the second major rescue operation within a month at the same spot, following a 14-year-old becoming trapped a fortnight before . Morecambe and Lunesdale MP David Morris said he would table a parliamentary motion to highlight the dangers of Morecambe Bay and urged anyone wishing to cross the sands to go on a guided tour instead of going it alone. 'I am concerned there have been two high profile incidents on the sands,' he said. 'I think it is imperative that . visitors know that while we have some of the most beautiful views in the . world here, the sands can also be dangerous.'","The man and woman were pulled from quicksand in race against high tide .

"It is not just women who tend to lose interest in sex after having a baby. Men do too. New fathers make love less often, and it seems that the better they are at being a dad, the less sex they end up having. Lee Gettler, of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, tracked the lives and hormones of 433 young men from the  Philippine islands. New fathers make love less often, and it seems that the better they are at being a dad, the less sex they end up having . He found that the most testosterone-fuelled men were also the most likely to become fathers. However after having a baby their levels of the male sex hormone dropped – along with the amount of sex they had. Dr Gettler also found an increase in the hormone prolactin, which is normally associated with breastfeeding, particularly among men with the most hands-on approach to parenting. It is thought the hormonal changes make a man more responsive to the needs of his child. Dr Gettler told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual conference: ‘Mothers undergo substantial biological change with pregnancy and birth, yet there has been a tendency to think of the father as kind of inertly along for the ride. The study of a group of men in the Philippine Islands revealed a man's testosterone levels drop once he has had a child . But it is not just mothers who respond to the demands of parenthood. ‘I think evolution has shaped male physiology to help men invest in their children and provide good care for them.’ Dr Gettler added that the drop in libido could well be nature’s way of stopping the new father from straying. But it is not for ever – as hormone levels return to normal within a year or two.","Men that put the hours in being a good dad have less sex .

"A mother-of-two was asked by a Marks and Spencer worker why she had mutilated and disfigured herself by decorating her neck and arms with tattoos. Natasha Henson, 35, had told the cashier that a customer in the store tutted and commented about her tattoos. But she did not get the understanding she expected when the woman replied that she was not surprised she had 'tutted' and branded her tattoos 'disgusting.' Mrs Henson, whose husband is a tattoo artist, left the shop in Bournemouth in tears. Scroll down for video . The mother of two was criticised for her tattoos when she asked a cashier in Marks and Spencer about them . She said: 'It was absolutely horrible. 'It's my choice to have tattoos and I do not expect people to judge me for it.' Mrs Henson mentioned being tutted at by a customer to the cashier and got a response she described as 'upsetting and insulting'. She said: The woman responded something like, ""I am not surprised she tutted I think they are appalling! 'Why on earth would you want to mutilate and disfigure yourself like that?

She also said 'Why would you want to have the pain of them are you weird or something?' Mrs Henson, whose husband is a tattoo artist based in Bournemouth, left the till in tears and spoke to a manager who took her address and said they would look into the incident. She added: 'I feel this is a disgusting way to treat another human being and even worse with it being from someone who is supposed to be using good customer service skills. 'My son is autistic which is extremely hard work and it is hard enough job as it is without hearing this after a stressful day with him.' Mrs Henson said most of her body art has been done by her husband, who runs John Henson Tattoists in Bournemouth and has done so for 31 years. The couple are both members of Bristol Tattoo Club, which was established in 1953 and has strict conditions of entry. But she said she would not let the incident, which took place in June, put her off having more tattoos in the future. The cashier is now understood to have quit her job after being told she would face disciplinary action, The Sun reported. Mrs Henson said she was initially offered a cream tea as an apology by Marks and Spencer but declined the offer and instead the store sent a summer basket to her son's school where they are raising funds for a sensory garden. They also apologised. Her 10-year-old son is autistic and attends Springwood campus, a specialist unit at Linwood School, in Bournemouth. Her other son is five. A spokeswoman for Marks and Spencer said: 'Customer service is extremely important to us. 'If our high standards are not met, we will do everything we can to resolve it for the customer.' Mrs Henson, who works at her husband's shop and volunteers at a wildlife sanctuary, is not the first person to be criticised for  body art.

"Manchester City playmaker David Silva is hungry for more goals after filling a void for the champions by striking twice against Crystal Palace. The Spaniard helped City overcome the absence of any recognised strikers by setting up a comfortable 3-0 Barclays Premier League win at the Etihad Stadium with a second-half double. Yaya Toure completed the scoring in the latter stages as City pulled level with Chelsea at the top of the table. Silva races off after finally breaking down the stubborn Crystal Palace defence with a slightly fortunate shot . City were without forwards Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic due to injury and so played with midfielder James Milner as a lone striker with Silva just behind him. Silva revelled in the central role, hitting a deflected opener four minutes after the restart and turning in a second from close range on the hour. Despite all his creative brilliance and technical excellence, Silva is not a renowned goalscorer but he enjoyed the role on Saturday. David Silva (right) struck his second goal after the interval to send the champions right back into the title race . David Silva celebrates his second goal of the day as City cruise out to a 2-0 lead on Saturday afternoon . The 28-year-old told City TV: 'I have always said that I like to play in the middle and every time I play there I try to score goals, as when I play wide, but I prefer a central position. 'I was able to score two goals and help the team, so I am very happy. 'Without strikers we have to work a bit more on trying to score goals and we did that, as in the last game, so hopefully we can continue like this.' City trailed Chelsea by eight points at the end of last month but confidence is now soaring after a run of eight successive wins in all competitions. Manchester City players celebrate Silva's goal as they move level on points with Chelsea at the top of the table . Attention now shifts to Chelsea's response as they play their game in hand at Stoke on Monday. Silva said: 'We know that we have to play a lot of games during this month and that we have to try to get as many points as we can. 'So let's see if they drop some points and we can put some pressure on them.' City dominated possession throughout against Palace but the visitors, for whom Yannick Bolasie impressed, had some good opportunities in a goalless first half, notably when Fraizer Campbell put a close-range overhead kick wide. David Silva holds up his international cap award (left) and his man of the match award (right) from Saturday . City failed to get any of their eight first-half attempts on target - with Pablo Zabaleta going the closest - but stepped up a gear after the break. Victory was ultimately routine but Palace manager Neil Warnock had justifiable complaints after James McArthur had a headed goal, when the score was 2-0, incorrectly ruled out for offside. Warnock felt Palace might have made more of a game of it had that been given but he also conceded, after just one win in 11, that his side lacks firepower. Warnock said: 'We don't score enough goals, that is true to say. We had opportunities and couldn't get on the sheet. But if they get chalked off when they are good ones, you haven't got much chance have you? Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock was furious James McArthur had a headed goal ruled out for offside . 'I think we have got some good strikers but, if I am honest, I just think we need something a little bit different, either from the bench or more of a physical presence. '(Marouane) Chamakh has tried his best over the last few weeks but with him being out, I think we just lack that physical (presence). 'All the other lads have got their attributes, it is just to supplement what we have got and give us more options off the bench.' The chief reason Palace were shut out at Eastlands was because of the improved defensive resilience of City, who have now kept four successive clean sheets. Manchester City centre back Eliaquim Mangala (2nd left) believes he is settling in well in the Premier League . Three of those have come without captain Vincent Kompany and the shakiness evident earlier in the season is starting to disappear. Centre back Eliaquim Mangala said: 'It is always important for us to keep a clean sheet. 'I think we are not making as many mistakes as we did one or two months ago. We need to keep going and continue that run. We need to defend well and score goals like we do at the moment.' Mangala himself had a difficult introduction after his £32million summer move from Porto but is now looking a stronger proposition. He said: 'It is true that I had difficulties to adapt at the beginning, but I was expecting that and was prepared. I didn't have any moment of doubt. The more games I play, the more I am settling in.'","Manchester City moved level on points with Chelsea following the 3-0 win .

"Divers have discovered an array of precious artefacts from a Greek shipwreck located 40 miles north of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea. The team of divers, who were specially trained in Florida's deep underwater caves, went to depths of over 400 feet to retrieve the items which were too deep for most divers. The shipwrecked Panarea II and III vessels were first discovered four years ago in the deep waters of Capistello Bay by researchers using sonar gear and a submarine. The divers and archaeologists from Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) prepare to go underwater . Cargo: A plethora of amphorae, or large urns, cover the sea basin 410 feet underwater . The unusual depths made the operation of successfully bringing the precious items to the surface a complicated exercise. Florida-based divers and archaeologists from Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) were recently assigned to work with researchers to piece together the mysteries of the ancient shipwreck.

The divers use a camera to document artefacts during their dive to the shipwreck site . Ancient: One of the archaeologists observes an artefact after it was recovered from the sea . The divers and archaeologists found an ancient pile of amphorae, or large urns, which were used to transport cargo such as olives and wine in the ancient world. The team also found a sacrificial altar which was inscribed with Greek lettering. The government has asked the divers  to document the list of precious items they find and then return to excavate them at a later stage. Archaeologists believe the ship sailed around 218-210 BC, during the time of the second Punic Wars.","Shipwreck was located 40 miles north of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea .

"Plants are slowing the effects of climate change far more than expected, researchers have found. They said the impact of rising CO2 levels on plant growth has been underestimated by 16 per cent, as they thrive with more of the gas in the atmosphere. And as plants absorb CO2, this has led to overestimates of how much of the greenhouse gas is left in the atmosphere. Researchers say the impact of rising CO2 levels on plant growth has been underestimated by 16 per cent. In a separate study, reported in the same journal, scientists artificially elevated CO2 levels in a US prairie grasslands ecosystem for eight years. They found that the added carbon had increased the overall volume of the plants and promoted the ecosystem's stability by reducing the growth of normally dominant plant species. The study was conducted by climate and earth scientists at the University of Texas at Austin and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. It says a 16 per cent 'correction' would be 'large enough to explain the persistent overestimation of growth rates of historical atmospheric CO2 by earth system models'. 'Our study will lead to improved understanding and modelling of carbon–climate feedbacks,' the paper says. Lianhong Gu, from the Climate Change Institute at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, said most carbon-cycle models had over-predicted the growth rate. Dr Gu said the growth rate of carbon levels had been over-predicted by 17 per cent over a 100-year period. The study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences focusses on the slow diffusion of CO2 in plant leaves, with particular attention to the mesophyll or their inner tissue. It concludes: 'Carbon cycle models that lack explicit understanding of mesophyll diffusion will underestimate historical and future terrestrial carbon uptake. 'Consequently, they will overestimate historical and future growth rates of atmospheric CO2 concentration due to fossil fuel emissions, with ramifications for predicted climate change.' Professor  Peter Cox, Professor of Climate System Dynamics at the University of Exeter, said even if the study was correct, the effect will be 'relatively small' compared to uncertainties about how much carbon will be absorbed by plants and soil. Researchers said the growth rate of carbon levels had been over-predicted by 17 per cent over a 100-year period. He said: 'Avoiding 2C of global warming is a huge challenge for humanity even if this effect is taken into account.' Prof Richard Betts, Head of Climate Impacts Research at the Met Office and Chair in Climate Impacts at the University of Exeter, said: . 'This is a very interesting paper adding to our understanding of plant physiology. 'The authors remark on the potential importance of their results for global carbon cycle modelling, and this is indeed relevant, but as a priority for improving carbon cycle modelling there are other processes which current models treat either very simplistically or not at all. 'Fire disturbance, for example, is not included in some of the models examined here – its inclusion could be more important than any improvements in modelling CO2 fertilization, as it seems likely to be an important feedback on climate change. 'Changes in global soil respiration at the global scale are also poorly understood. 'So while this is an interesting and useful contribution, it should be put into context with the bigger picture – disturbance mechanisms as well as physiological processes are important.' In a separate study, reported in the same journal, scientists artificially elevated CO2 levels in a US prairie grasslands ecosystem for eight years. They found that the added carbon had increased the overall volume of the plants and promoted the ecosystem's stability by reducing the growth of normally dominant plant species.","Researchers say impact of rising CO2 levels on plant growth has been underestimated by 16 per cent .

"Contrary to popular belief, Lewis Hamilton hasn't had the best of luck in Brazil, but home Formula One fans want to claim him as one of their own. Ahead of Sunday's race, the championship leader was handed a mock oversized passport and a football kit adorned with his face by a wacky Brazilian TV comedy duo. And a delighted-looking Hamilton bought into the joke, holding the comedy props with an enormous grin. Lewis Hamilton holds a giant mock Brazilian passport ahead of Sunday's race at Interlagos . Hamilton was also presented with a Selecao shirt with his face adorned on the kit . An amused Hamilton checks out the mock document in a press conference . While he won his only world title  with a dramatic, last-gasp fifth-place finish in 2008, since that unforgettable afternoon his record at Interlagos has been unspectacular. He's never finished higher than third and has failed to finish two of the last three races in South America. Yet this year he heads into the penultimate race of the season with a healthy-looking 24 point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg after four wins from the last five races. Hamilton examines his new kit . Hamilton knows there is still all to play with 75 points up for grabs. 'You don't really look five or 10 races ahead. I've just always kept my head down, kept chipping away,' said Hamilton. 'I had those four wins (early in the season), and then there was the bad patch from Monaco onwards. 'Then Spa was like 'I'm going to turn this up. I'm going to have to turn this up. This means war', that kind of feeling. In reflecting on it, I turned the energy from that negative bomb into a positive.' And Hamilton is all-too aware that Rosberg can snatch the title, particularly with double points up for grabs in Abu Dhabi on November 23. 'I'm not sure I do have an edge,' said Hamilton. 'Every weekend Nico resets, he comes in and qualifies on pole. He's massively strong mentally. He's still there, still fighting.'

"Lewis Hamilton broached the subject that may yet tarnish the crown of the 2014 world champion —the absurd double points to be awarded at the last race in Abu Dhabi. If he should lose by that arbitrary and inflated margin it would ‘suck’, he said. Hamilton’s words were less startling than his attire. He came to the paddock here dressed as a one-man art gallery.

At the end of a chunky gold chain hung an Andy Warhol print of Mercedes 300 SL Coupes. But back to the points dispute, Hamilton said: ‘The question is what is fair. This is a rule they have brought in for the first time. ‘We have to deal with it and hope for the best, but it would suck if that was the case. ‘I am not going to let any negative energy into this and what will be will be. Everyone will be in the same boat. ‘You never know what is going to happen but I have been there before and I know what it is like to go to the last race and lose the championship.

A general view of the colourful track at the Circuit of The Americas in Austin, Texas . ‘But I don’t feel that is going to happen. The car has been going great and I hope it will be great for the final three (races).’ Hamilton takes a 17-point lead over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg into Sunday’s race — a more slender margin than it sounds with 100 points on offer between here, Brazil (a week on Sunday) and Abu Dhabi (November 23). Hamilton, who stopped off for a TV appearance in New York en route to Texas, was in a jaunty mood, pleased with his new jewellery. ‘I designed it,’ he said. ‘I like designing things and I am into art. I saw the Andy Warhol painting come up in an auction but the bidding went too far. So I got it on a smaller scale — and much more cheaply. I can change the art piece and keep the frame.’ Daniel Ricciardo was sporting a new look on Thursday, and says he expects a good result this weekend . Away from the championship battle, 17-year-old Max Verstappen will return to the cockpit in practice for Toro Rosso. His involvement is a bright spot for a race missing the four cars of Marussia and Caterham, the two teams in administration. The paddock is still thinking of the stricken Jules Bianchi, the Marussia driver who was injured in the Japanese Grand Prix a month ago. His family said he remains critical but stable in hospital in Yokkaichi. ‘Jules does indeed continue to fight,’ they added in a statement. In response, the FIA are expected to trial a new safety procedure in practice — a compulsory slower lap time when accidents occur but a safety car is not deployed.","Lewis Hamilton looking to build on 17-point championship lead .

"David Beckham has joined the fight against Ebola, warning that the world faces a 'race against time' to tackle 'the invisible enemy'. In a video message to be broadcast across Sierra Leone, the former footballer urges those living in the country to 'take the right measures' to halt the spread of the killer disease. The father-of-four says he is delivering the message after being 'inspired' by the people he met when he travelled to Sierra Leone six years ago, in his role as a Unicef Goodwill ambassador. Scroll down for video . David Beckham has recorded a video which will be broadcast across Sierra Leone, warning people they face a 'race against time' to tackle 'the invisible enemy' of Ebola . In the video, footage is shown of Beckham's trip to Sierra Leone six years ago, when he said he was 'inspired' by the people he met . Beckham also recorded a second video message, urging people to donate to Unicef's Ebola appeal, so the charity can continue to tackle the crisis on the continent. His message came amid growing anger at the lack of international support in the fight against the epidemic which is ravaging parts of West Africa. Wearing a black Unicef t-shirt, the 39-year-old says: 'I was inspired and honoured to have met so many amazing people and see the challenges they faced in a country then devastated by civil war. 'Today, the courageous people of Sierra Leone are facing an invisible enemy. I know Unicef is on the ground working with you in your communities preventing it from spreading.' He continues: 'The good news is this disease can be avoided if you take the right measures. 'Learn more about the life-saving instructions you can follow to protect you and your families from Ebola and together we can collectively halt this disease in its tracks. Let's start now.' Beckham also urges people to help Unicef, by giving funds to the charity as it attempts to tackle the ever-growing problem. He says: 'Right now, in West Africa, Ebola threatens the life of millions of people. As a father, I can't imagine what it must feel like, seeing your child suffer and feeling so helpless. 'But there is something you can do. Unicef is on the ground, working around the clock to protect children and families from this deadly virus. 'Please give Unicef the help it needs to tackle this crisis. We're in a race against time.' The father-of-four, pictured here meeting people during his trip, urged people to give to Unicef so they can continue with their work in West African country . He says: 'Today, the courageous people of Sierra Leone are facing an invisible enemy - a ferocious Ebola disease that's spreading fast across West Africa' The first short film has been made with the aim of breaking down the stigma and shame connected to the disease. It will be broadcast across national TV and in town halls and community centres across the country, encouraging more people to protect themselves and seek medical help. It will also be shown on giant outdoor screens and in football stadiums. The second video is an attempt to raise more money for Unicef. The charity is working to control the disease by trying to reaching families and communities with messages about  the disease. It is trying to spread information about its symptoms, its methods of transmission, the importance of hygiene, and where to seek help. Its teams are also distributing life-saving supplies, including gloves and chlorine, and supporting children and families affected by Ebola. At least 3,700 children have lost one or both parents to the highly contagious virus, according to the charity. In a second video messages, David Beckham urges people to donate to Unicef, a charity currently working in Sierra Leone to stop the spread of the virus . He says: 'Unicef is on the ground, working around the clock to protect children and families from this deadly virus' And it is estimated the death toll from the Ebola crisis will rise to more than 4,500 lives this week from among 9,000 people infected by the deadly disease. It has also been deemed the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' by the World Health Organisation. Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the World Health Organisation said the new numbers also show the outbreak is hitting health workers hard, with 2,700 infected and 236 dead. She said cases are doubling every four weeks, and the effects of the crisis are increasingly being felt beyond its epicentre in West Africa. Meanwhile, British boarding schools are said to be monitoring the travel of their international students and their families during the school holidays. Guidance published by the Boarding Schools Association (BSA) warns that schools with international students may be faced with concerns from parents about the potential risk of Ebola. The BSA says parents could become worried about their child mixing with youngsters from nations affected by the virus, particularly after half-term and the Christmas holidays. A health worker fixes another health worker's protective suit in Sierra Leone. The epidemic is ravaging parts of West Africa . In its guidance, published online, it says: 'Some pupils may also be displaying their own ""fear of contagion"" behaviour having reached their own conclusions, informed or otherwise, about whether they are at risk.' The advice suggests that senior school leaders should reassure parents, staff and pupils that the risk of Ebola in the school is low. It goes on to say that schools with students from seriously-affected countries or neighbouring nations should follow the latest government advice if they plan to travel home during the holidays. It says: 'This could, potentially, mean that they are advised not to travel home (in which case alternative supervision arrangements will need to be made for them) or they may face screening or other restrictions when returning to the UK. 'In issuing any specific advice for students, it is crucial this is done in full accordance with guidance from your school nurse and GP, and that any medical steps they recommend are closely followed.' Health workers hard at work in Sierra Leone. At least 3,700 children have lost one or both parents to the highly contagious virus, according to Unicef . Nearly 1,000 Nigerian students and more than 400 youngsters from other parts of Africa attend UK boarding schools, according to the Times Educational Supplement (TES). There is also a separate guidance note from the BSA and the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents 1,200 fee-paying schools. The note says both organisations have been contacted by schools looking for advice on dealing with students returning from or visiting countries affected by the outbreak. Jo Heywood, headmistress of Heathfield, a girls' boarding school in Ascot, said that her school, which has fewer international students than many others, has issued advice on Ebola. But she said it was no different to guidance issued in the past for other health concerns, such as swine flu. Mrs Heywood said: 'The measures I've put in place are to allay any fears and concerns of parents might have and to give advice to prevent scaremongering.' BSA national director Robin Fletcher told the TES: 'With a rich mix of overseas students, you do get concerns being raised and questions being asked. 'What we are saying is that it is a managed situation... and every school has a nurse who can keep up to date with the latest official advice.' In the first clip, he says: 'Six years ago, I travelled to Sierra Leone with Unicef. I was inspired and honoured to have met so many amazing people and to the challenges they faced in a country then devastated by civil war. 'Today, the courageous people of Sierra Leone are facing an invisible enemy. I know Unicef is on the ground working with you in your communities preventing it from spreading.

"Lewis Hamilton is adamant he will sit down with Mercedes at the end of the year to discuss a new deal as rumours regarding the prospect of Fernando Alonso taking his seat in 2016 gather pace. In Japan last week the driver merry-go-round began in earnest, with Red Bull confirming four-time champion Sebastian Vettel would be leaving the team. Although his destination has yet to be officially announced, Vettel is replacing Alonso at Ferrari as Red Bull team principal Christian Horner let the cat out of the bag on that score. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton ditch his race car for the school run . Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton speaks with reporters at the Sochi Autodrom on Thursday . Nico Rosberg leads Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in the early stages in wet conditions at Suzuka . It is understood Alonso’s attempt to engineer a move to Mercedes led to Ferrari opting to release the Spaniard a year early from his deal and pursue Vettel, who has long made clear his affection for the team. Alonso now finds himself in limbo because, although wanted by McLaren as they look for a marquee name to spearhead Honda’s return to F1 as a power-unit supplier, a one-year deal is not an option. That is what Alonso is believed to be pushing for, so allowing him the opportunity to focus on securing Hamilton’s seat in 2016, with the 29-year-old out of contract with Mercedes at the end of next year. It is why, when asked specifically by NBC whether he would be in F1 in 2015, Alonso replied: 'I don’t know.' There is a possibility Alonso could opt for a sabbatical, or choose a switch to a lesser marque in Lotus as replacement for Romain Grosjean after the Enstone-based team announced Mercedes as their power-unit supplier from next year. The blur of rumours over the past week has left Hamilton stunned as his focus on the title has taken a new twist in light of the Alonso gossip. Lewis Hamilton is adamant he will sit down with Mercedes at the end of the year to discuss his future . Lewis Hamilton holds up the trophy after winning the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka on Sunday . 'It’s an interesting time in Formula One,' the Briton said. 'Drivers making changes, top drivers making changes, a lot of fiction, a lot of silly stories going around. 'Whoever is starting those silly conversations... I always have made it clear I’m here (with Mercedes) to do a job. 'I have a contract until the end of next year. We have confirmed we will sit down and talk about the future at the end of the year when the most important thing (the championship) is done. 'Mercedes helped me get to Formula One. I’ve been here since I was 13, so I feel pretty relaxed. 'But I’m also aware of what goes on in the business and I’m aware that those people (the rumour-mongers) are trying to intervene. 'All I can do is do what I’ve done up until now. I think hopefully my performance speaks for itself.' Hamilton goes into this weekend’s inaugural Russian Grand Prix with a 10-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg following a run of three successive victories.

"The FIA are monitoring the progress of Typhoon Phanfone with Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix under threat from strong winds and heavy rainfall. This weekend's race has been thrown into doubt with the typhoon making its way towards Japan from across the Pacific. Suzuka however, looks like swerving the worst of the weather caused by the typhoon - with heavier winds and stronger rainfall not expected until after the chequered flag. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg previewing Suzuka . Championship leader Lewis Hamilton takes cover underneath an umbrella in the paddock on Thursday . Nico Rosberg takes a stroll along the Suzuka pit-lane ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix . As things stand at the moment, the worst of the typhoon should still be out at sea by the time the lights go out on the track. 'If we focus on the main race day, the centre of the storm looks to be still offshore east of the south island of Japan,' a MeteoGroup forecaster said. 'The typhoon's track is to veer north-eastwards just before it makes landfall and track up the eastern coastline of Japan before heading towards Tokyo. 'It actually doesn't look to make landfall (just south of Tokyo) until well into Monday daytime - therefore the winds may not have too much of an effect at the time of the race. 'However, rain is expected, although the much heavier amounts don't look to hit the Suzuka circuit until later on Sunday and overnight into Monday, at this stage.'

Jordan is a long-time admirer of Ecclestone, but he feels the 84-year-old’s increasingly erratic statements mean he should retire and hand the sport on to the next generation. ‘Bernie says one thing to your paper, another thing to a different paper, and another thing to me,’ Jordan told Sportsmail. ‘It is out of control.

Settle for third: Hamilton pipped Rosberg in Hungary last time out but finished third behind Ferrari's  Fernando Alonso and race winner Daniel Ricciardo (left) for Red Bull . * Daniel Ricciardo’s win in Hungary last time out means he remains the only driver to score a win this season aside from Mercedes duo Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. * In finishing third in Hungary, Hamilton now has 63 podiums to his name (1st: 27; 2nd: 18; 3rd: 18), the most by any British driver in F1 history. * Mercedes have won nine of the 11 races this season. Only five teams have scored more in a single campaign - Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Benetton and Williams. King of Spa: Michael Schumacher has won the most amount of Belgian Grand Prix with six and made his F1 debut at Spa with the Jordan team in 1991 . One to watch: Kimi Raikkonen is the most successful of the current drivers at Spa, winning four times with his most recent victory coming in 2009  - his most recent win for Ferrari . * Ferrari and McLaren have now gone 25 and 30 races without a win respectively. * With just two exceptions (2003 and 2006 when the Belgian GP was not held) the race has been staged at Spa-Francorchamps every year since 1985. This will be the 47th F1 grand prix held at the circuit. * The leader in the title race after Hungary has only been overhauled four times in the last 14 years, but three of those have been in the last seven - Michael Schumacher reeled in Mika Hakkinen in 2000; Kimi Raikkonen did it to Lewis Hamilton in 2007, while Sebastian Vettel closed down Mark Webber in 2010 and Fernando Alonso in 2013. Drivers' favourite: The uphill Eau Rouge corner is one of the more challenging corners on the circuit . * The most successful driver at the Belgian Grand Prix is Michael Schumacher with six wins, followed by Ayrton Senna with five. * Ferrari are the most successful constructor in Belgium with 16 victories to McLaren’s 14. Both, however, have won the race a dozen times at Spa-Franchorchamps. * There are five Belgian Grand Prix winners entered this weekend. Felipe Massa won in 2008, Hamilton in 2010 and 2012, Vettel in 2011 and 2013, whilst Kimi Raikkonen has four victories to his credit in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009. * Raikkonen’s first win at Spa came from a starting position of 10th, although that is not the lowest grid slot from which victory has been achieved as Schumacher’s 1995 win was from 16th. * The circuit has a 75 per cent risk of a safety car deployment, placing it in the ‘very high’ risk category.","Formula One returns following summer break ahead of Belgian Grand Prix .

"Lewis Hamilton has become the latest high-profile figure from the sporting world to take part in the Ice Bucket Challenge. Nominated by Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo, who performed the stunt in the paddock on Thursday, Hamilton accepted the Australian’s challenge after today’s opening practice session ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix. The 29-year-old Briton hopped out of his Mercedes before he was promptly drenched by four of his mechanics armed with two rather large buckets.

"Lewis Hamilton has hailed Daniel Ricciardo as one of the best drivers in Formula One at present following his impressive performances this season. In going up against four-time champion Sebastian Vettel at Red Bull following his promotion from Toro Rosso, few people gave Ricciardo a chance this term. Yet the amiable Australian has stunned everyone in the sport, and in many eyes has been one of the stars of the show. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the Hungarian GP review . Impact: Daniel Ricciardo has made a big impression in his first season driving for Red Bull . Other than Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, Ricciardo is the only driver to win a grand prix race in 2014, taking the chequered flag in two of the 11 races to date, propelling him to third in the drivers' standings. The 25-year-old's maiden victory in Canada may have come at Mercedes' expense as both drivers suffered technical issues, but his win last time out in Hungary saw him come up trumps in tricky conditions. 'He's been driving fantastically well from the beginning of the year,' said 29-year-old Hamilton. 'It's not only now, but through the whole year he's shown his capability and is going from strength to strength. 'He's not only one of the nicest guys in the paddock, but also one of the best drivers here, for sure.' VIDEO Review of the Hungarian Grand Prix .

"Lewis Hamilton hopes to agree a new deal with Mercedes this season even though his current contract still has more than a year to run. 'I am sure something will happen this year,' the 2008 world champion told British reporters at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Thursday. 'But now is not the time to really focus on that. 'I've made it clear to them that they don't have to worry, I'm not out seeing what else there is for me. Mercedes has been my family since I started Formula One so I don't see that changing any time soon.' Settled: Lewis Hamilton is happy to extend his Mercedes contract but isn't in a hurry . Competitive rivalry: Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate are in a fierce fight for the Drivers' Championship . Hamilton has won five of the 10 races so far this year but is still 14 points behind German team-mate Nico Rosberg, who has four wins to his credit, ahead of Sunday's race. Rosberg signed a new multi-year contract with the British-based team last week, ahead of his home Grand Prix at Hockenheim. A new deal, if of the same three-year duration as the last, would be worth tens of millions. Estimates have put Hamilton's current salary at around £20 million a year. Healthy: Hamilton maintains his relationship with Mercedes chief Toto Wolff is a good one . 'I've made no secret to both (technical director) Paddy (Lowe) and (Mercedes motorsport head) Toto (Wolff) - we have a very good, open relationship - and I've said ""you will be the first to know if I was ever to speak to anyone else"",' he said. 'But I've said ""there wouldn't be because I want to be speaking to you"". We spoke about having a chat at some stage but I think they're quite relaxed as well, as far as I'm aware. 'I've shown an interest in sitting down and talking. We haven't sat down yet, but the team know I'd like to push to continue, and they have made clear they would like to do the same,' said Hamilton. The driver started his career with Mercedes-powered McLaren in 2007 and has been backed by the German manufacturer since he was 13-years-old. He joined the Mercedes team in 2013 and the heavily tattooed driver said he felt like he had ""Mercedes imprinted on my chest"". Not interested: Hamilton didn't entertain speculation that Mercedes could sign Sebastian Vettel . The 29-year-old dismissed with a shrug speculation that Mercedes were also interested in signing four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, who has been having a difficult season, from Red Bull. 'I am not concerned about that,' he said. 'Ultimately if the team wanted him in the car, that's their decision. I don't have any feelings about it. There will always be a place for every driver and what will be, will be. 'But I feel like I'm very much part of the family here. I'm not knocking on Toto's door or Paddy's to get something done because I have faith in them and I think hopefully they have faith in me. 'I would wish to continue with them and I think they hopefully want to do the same with me.' Hamilton is a favourite to win in Hungary, having done so for the last two years and four times in total. Another win would break the record he currently shares with Michael Schumacher. High-flier: Hamilton is favourite to win in Hungary and reduce Rosberg's lead in the Drivers' Championship .

"Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has suggested more measures may be taken to make a driver's life more difficult over the course of a grand prix weekend. Ecclestone's remarks follow on from a suggestion of his coming into force from this weekend's race in Singapore with the banning of certain types of radio messages. Asked whether he was in favour of the ban, Ecclestone smiled and then replied: 'As I was the one who started it off, yes.' Formula One CEO Bernie Ecclestone, with wife Fabiana Flosi, wants to make races harder for drivers . Suggested it was imperative drivers do more rather than continually relying on information from the pit wall, Ecclestone added: 'I think none of the drivers want it (radio). They are all happy it has gone. 'They drive the cars, they should know what is wrong or right. They don't need someone on the pit wall telling them what to do. 'We have a regulation in force drivers must drive the car unaided. They have been aided - and still are. 'Even if we get rid of this 'ship to shore' as I call it, there are still a lot of aids that they should not have. 'Driving is still not easy, but it was easier than it was.' Asked whether more rule changes would come into effect, the 83-year-old replied: 'I think we might...to make their life more difficult.' From the Singapore Grand Prix this weekend teams can't assist their drivers as much via radio contact . Ecclestone, meanwhile, has poured cold water on plans to reduce his race-sanctioning fees to promoters in order for them to lower ticket prices to get more fans through the turnstiles. Empty seats this year at venues such as Hockenheim and Monza that are traditionally packed have raised concerns amongst teams.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (bottom left) says teams have proposed a reduction in fees for teams . That, however, according to Ecclestone, would mean a reduction in the prize pot available to all teams at the end of a campaign. 'Has he (Wolff) told you how?' responded Ecclestone with regard to Wolff's remarks. 'You should tell him about reducing what they want for racing, and then we can reduce the fees.

"Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are both determined to claim a win in Hungary this weekend that will put them in good spirits heading into Formula One's summer break. The duo have claimed nine victories from 10 races so far this season, and although Hamilton has a five-to-four edge over Rosberg, it is the latter who has a 14-point lead in the championship. Hamilton, however, has made the Hungaroring his own since arriving in F1, chalking up four wins in seven attempts, including the last two. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton complete a lap of Hungarian GP in simulator . Getting ready: Great Britain's Lewis Hamilton and Germany's Nico Rosberg have both got their eyes on the prize . Another triumph on Sunday will make him the most successful driver in the history of the race as he and seven-times champion Michael Schumacher are tied. Hamilton said: 'This race is always a special one for me, with four poles and four wins from my seven races there so far, including my first victory for Mercedes last season. 'I don't really have any secrets there. I've just been very fortunate over the years, and it's a circuit I really enjoy. Podium finishers: The duo have claimed nine victories from 10 races so far this season . 'It's one where you can really attack, which works for an attacking driver like myself, so perhaps it suits my driving style a little bit more than some others. 'I'm looking forward to it, and I'm doing absolutely everything I can to get back on level terms with Nico in the title battle. I can't focus more or work harder than I am doing right now.' Rosberg, meanwhile, is on a high after his success on home soil in Germany on Sunday. Chase: Hamilton trails Rosberg by 14 points at the top of the drivers' standings going into Hungary . 'To win at Hockenheim was a very, very special day for me,' he said. 'That race and Monaco were the ones I really wanted to win, so to have done that is really awesome. 'But now I'm just looking forward to this next race in Hungary where I'll naturally be aiming for another win to extend my championship lead.' Motorsport boss Toto Wolff is still due to attend despite sustaining a number of fractures in a cycling accident on Tuesday. Focused: Hamilton is currently sitting in second spot behind Nico Rosberg but he has a great record in Hungary . On a team-bonding exercise along the river Danube in Vienna, several members of the F1 team - but not including Hamilton and Rosberg - were involved in the incident. Wolff received treatment in a local hospital for a fractured wrist - which required a pin - elbow, shoulder and collarbone, whilst executive technical director Paddy Lowe escaped with only cuts and bruises. A Mercedes spokesperson has confirmed Wolff is in 'good spirits', and will arrive at the Hungaroring at some point over the weekend following a further day or two to recuperate. Injuries: Toto Wolff is nursing a fractured shoulder, collar bone, elbow and wrist . Via Twitter, Wolff joked: 'We've decided to leave it to the pros now. Lewis & Nico are better wheel to wheel at 300 km/h than we are at 30 km/h!' Wolff's wife Susie, currently Williams development driver, via her account added: 'My husband the hero!

"Murray Walker, the unparalleled voice of Formula One, is expected to be absent from Sunday’s race. Walker, 91 later this year, told The Mail On Sunday: ‘This is going to sound big headed - and I don’t mean it to - but if I go the British Grand Prix I don’t get any peace at all. 'It’s very touching but I am there as an enthusiast. It is also gigantically tiring and I don’t have the stamina I once had.’ VIDEO Scroll down to see how Wolff became first woman driver at GP weekend in 22 years . Enthusiast: Murray Walker, pictured in 2007, admits he doesn't get any piece when he attends Silverstone . Silverstone, celebrating its 50th British Grand Prix this weekend, sold 124,000 tickets for Sunday’s race. The circuit’s bosses may be disappointed not to have attracted a sell-out crowd - there are still 3,000 seats to fill. ...................................................................................................... Sergio . Perez issued an apology following his ill-advised comments about Susie . Wolff. The Mexican was asked whether he'd like a female team-mate ahead . of this weekend' s race, to which he replied: 'No, they are better off . in the kitchen.' But Perez moved to rectify his comments saying: 'I feel . really ashamed by the way my words have been distorted. I want to be . absolutely clear that my intention was not to offend anyone.' Wolff, who . became the first female racer in 22 years after she took to the wheel . of the Williams in Friday's practice session, didn't appear offended by . Perez's remarks. 'Saw some comments made by Sergio Perez as I was making . dinner in the kitchen last night,' Wolff, who lasted just four laps on . her full F1 debut after suffering an oil-pressure problem, said. 'Please . give him a break. His comments were taken completely out of context. Anyway, as my family will tell you, I drive better than I cook.' Disappointing debut: Williams' Susie Wolff was was forced to retire from first practice after an engine failure . Williams have launched a Martini-branded motorhome in the Silverstone paddock. The building, which stretches over three floors, has walls adorned with largely amusing black andwhite photos of Sir Frank Williams, the team’s founder, his daughter, Claire, who is also the team’s deputy principal, and drivers Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Construction began on the motorhome in March and is incomparable to their former one-floored home. ‘We’re loving it; it looks amazing at night as well because of all the lovely lights,’ said Claire Williams. ‘There will be a few Martinis drunk,’ she added with a smile. The Williams motorhome is among 600 tons . of equipment - enough to fill 100 freight trucks - transported for . teams, broadcasters and hospitality at every race. DHL, F1's official . logistics partner, delivrt the entire cargo to the next race, or back at . the team's headquarters, dependant on their preference, within 48 hours . of the chequered flag falling. Impressive, indeed. George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, spent Saturday's qualifying session with McLaren boss Ron Dennis. Osborne, who also sported a team jacket, proved to be somewhat of a good luck omen for the British constructor with Jenson Button claiming his best qualifying result of the season. He will start from third as he bids to battle his torrid run of bad luck at Silverstone. Incredibly, in 14 previous attempts, the Briton has never stood on the podium at his home race. Over in Red Bull's garage, Hollywood actor Michael Fassbender hid behind a pair of dark sunglasses despite the overcast conditions in Northamptonshire. Former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan was the star on show at Williams, while number cruncher Carol Voderman made her customary British Grand Prix appearance courtesy of Mercedes. Remaining in the paddock, Bernie Ecclestone's impressive new statue outside his motorhome has been course of much discussion this weekend.

"Valtteri Bottas has been hailed as a potentially exceptional driver of the future if he continues on his upward path in Formula One. That is the verdict of Williams' head of vehicle performance Rob Smedley in the wake of the Finn's recent performances. In scoring the first podiums of his F1 career in the last two races - third in Austria and second at Silverstone - Bottas became the first Williams driver to claim back-to-back top-three finishes since Nick Heidfeld in 2005.

Regardless of whether Bottas manages such a feat, Smedley cannot help but be impressed with what he has seen so far from the 24-year-old. 'He's a great driver, someone who could become an exceptional driver, so we're lucky to have him.' said Smedley. 'His racecraft is phenomenal, he's super-quick, but the good thing about Valtteri is he's a young lad with his feet absolutely on the ground. He's not spoiled in any way shape or form, which is great. 'He's also able to accept advice very readily, not only about the very basics, but also about his racecraft and how he communicates with us. 'At Silverstone, the communication between him and the pit wall - the messages we sent him and those that came back - were exceptional. 'That's what you need, to have that level of synergy between driver and pit wall, that cohesion between what we're all trying to achieve so that it's all going in the right direction. Carving through: Bottas made his way through the field to grab second at Silverstone as he leads the way in front of McLaren's Jenson Button and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso . All a blur: Bottas has now grabbed successive podiums in Formula 1, the first for a Williams driver in nine years . 'At Silverstone it came off as well as it could do, to be honest. You couldn't really have hoped for anything more than that. My opinion is growing of him week-by-week.' With 33 points from the last two races, Bottas has rocketed up to fifth in the drivers' standings.In the constructors', Williams are up to fourth, just three points behind third-placed Ferrari, yet Smedley is eager to put the brakes on any rising expectations. 'It would be quite remiss for me to say Williams has the second fastest car and it will remain like that' added Smedley. All smiles: Williams Head of Vehicle Performance, Rob Smedley, has lavished praise on Bottas . On the right track: Bottas drives on the start/finish straight during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone . It's so tight in the midfield it can swing either way and you can go from having the second fastest car to the fifth fastest very easily. 'You need to keep the pressure on in every single area, That's how you end up with a car able to win races, and eventually comfortably win races. 'You have to keep your feet on the ground and be respectful of your competitors and respectful of every single circuit you go to, and we absolutely are.

'This win feels as good as the first,' said Ricciardo, after cementing third place in the drivers' standings behind Rosberg and Hamilton. 'It honestly does compare to Canada. Obviously the first victory is special, but it definitely leaves you wanting more. 'I was just as hungry for this second one, and it feels just as good - I won't say better, but you realise it a bit more so it feels like you can enjoy it a bit more. 'When I crossed the line everything felt a bit more real, so I guess I took in a bit more of this one, so, yeah, it feels awesome. 'I'm definitely going to celebrate and party for a few days, I think, enjoy a bit of time off.' Double: The win in Budapest was the second of the season after victory in Canada . It also underlined Ricciardo's status as a driver to now be respected as aside from the two wins, he has also been on the podium on three other occasions and is 43 points clear of team-mate Sebastian Vettel. Paying his dues to Red Bull, Ricciardo added: 'I want to obviously thank the team. 'To have two victories in the first half of the season with them is phenomenal, and I obviously owe a lot of that to them as well, for letting me settle in, establish myself with them. 'They never put too much pressure on me, they let me roll into it as I like, and that's been the best balance for all of us.

"Lewis Hamilton turned the World Championship into class warfare, claiming that his humble origins make him 'hungrier' than his privileged Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton, who is the richest sportsman in Britain with an estimated fortune of £68million and joined girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger at a star-studded Cinema Against AIDS event on Thursday, grew up in an end-of-terrace house on a tough council estate in Stevenage. He once talked of watching drug dealers from his window. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton and Rosberg previewing the Monaco GP . Ready to go: Lewis Hamilton poses for a picture with Nicole Scherzinger and Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst . Conflict: Hamilton claims his humble beginnings make him hungrier than rival Nico Rosberg to win the title . Rosberg is the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg and attended elite European schools. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton said: 'I come from a not great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad's apartment. 'And Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats. So the hunger is different. I've got to be the hungriest guy in the cockpit to win the World Championship.' The pair have tried to keep their rivalry friendly this season to help them cope with the pressure of being first and second in the standings. Hamilton now lives in Monaco and previously spoke of how he and Rosberg played table tennis while sharing a Monaco apartment block. Rosberg has since moved out and Hamilton has changed apartments. Despite living so close to the track, Hamilton 'overslept' on Thursday. He had to be taken by boat to the paddock. He then ran along the harbour front to get into his overalls for first practice, in which he set the fastest time of the day. Home from home: Rosberg grew up in Monaco and walked the roads, which form the track, to get to school . All eyes on me: The Brit has won the last four races, all with his team-mate Rosberg finishing second . The second session was a damp squib. It rained beforehand, and with eight minutes remaining only nine cars had set times - why not introduce a regulation demanding cars do a minimum of, say, 30 laps per session unless the rain is so extreme the officials ban running? Nobody expects anything other than Mercedes coming first and second in qualifying tomorrow and in the race on Sunday. But Hamilton hopes not. Asked for his ideal result, he said: 'Ha, me finishing first, Fernando Alonso second and Sebastian Vettel third. 'The dream result for the team would be the Mercedes cars finishing one-two and one of those guys in third.","Lewis Hamilton says his modest upbringing in Stevenage is vastly different to the formative years Nico Rosberg spent in Monaco .

"Formula One’s top designer Adrian Newey has agreed a new multi-year agreement with world champions Red Bull, the team announced on Sunday. It indicated, however, that the Briton’s focus would no longer be entirely on Formula One. 'As part of this new agreement, Adrian will work on new Red Bull Technology projects, as well as advising and mentoring Infiniti Red Bull Racing as it develops its Formula One cars over the next few seasons,' the team said in a statement. Scroll down for video... New deal: Designer Adrian Newey (R) has signed a contract extension with Infiniti Red Bull Racing Team . It said details of the new projects would be announced in due course. Newey has been at Red Bull since the start of the 2006 season after designing title-winning cars for Williams and McLaren. Milton Keynes-based Red Bull have won the last four drivers’ and constructors’ championships in a row with Germany’s Sebastian Vettel. Newey had made clear last month, when he moved to quash speculation about a possible big money bid from rivals Ferrari, that he wanted to stay at Red Bull despite the current domination of Mercedes. 'I remain committed to Red Bull for the foreseeable future,' the 55-year-old Briton said at the Monaco Grand Prix. Newey has . been linked to Ferrari in the past as well as a switch to Americas Cup . yachting, but has forged a close working relationship with Red Bull team . principal Christian Horner. Broader horizons: Adrian Newey's new role will not be restricted to the development of F1 cars only . Horner told reporters in Monaco that Newey had a 'paternal feeling' towards Red Bull. 'He . has been involved (with the team) since the beginning,is much more . involved than he has been at any other team, and he enjoys the . environment he works in,' said the Briton. Speaking to Press Association Sport, team principal  Horner refused to categorically define Newey's new role. 'It's . great news for us as it shows he is still committed to Red Bull and . he's going to be around for multiple years,' said Horner. 'We're . now going to take on some exciting new projects we will talk about . later in the summer, so it's good for everyone - good for Red Bull, good . for Adrian and good for the whole team.' Dominant: Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel has won the last four consecutive driver's championships . Asked whether Newey would still continue to design cars, Horner replied: 'He's still going to be involved, mentoring and advising the design team. 'He's a wealth of experience and knowledge the design team will be drawing upon. 'He'll still be involved, for sure, but the details will come a bit later in the summer.

Team orders? No, thank you, I have a world championship to win. It was the British driver’s defiance in the face of an instruction to let through Nico Rosberg, his Mercedes team-mate and only rival for the title, that dominated talk here in the paddock long after Daniel Ricciardo’s win in a topsy-turvy Hungarian Grand Prix of sliding and safety cars had parked up for the night. The order came three-quarters of the way into the race during the eight laps in which Rosberg, who was on a different strategy, was about a second behind Hamilton. Hamilton refused to yield. Rosberg, who was informed that the team had decided Hamilton should give way, twice asked why his team-mate had not done so. Twice more Hamilton was asked to allow Rosberg in front. Again and again he disobliged the pit wall.It was an act of regrettable insubordination, one that took the gloss off a wonderful recovery drive that took Hamilton, whose car burst into flames in qualifying, from a pit-lane start to a third-place finish.

He . was putting his own needs above those of the team. He may even have . denied them victory, through Rosberg. That was the view of Mercedes . director Toto Wolff, who said: ‘If Lewis had let Nico go, Nico could . have won the race.’ Instead he finished fourth. Hamilton . sadly failed to emulate Rosberg’s good behaviour towards him in two . races last season when he respectively held position and gave way in the . Malaysian and German grands prix. Admittedly, there was less at stake . then. Given that team orders are permitted in the rules, they should be followed. Otherwise, why have them? That is the case against Hamilton. And it is unarguable – to some degree. Hamilton, . however, could cite mitigation. Rosberg was never exactly on his . gearbox, and it would have taken a big gulp to hand over his place. Spin: Lewis Hamilton left the track at Turn 2 of the first lap at the Hungaroring but was able to continue . Carrying on: Hamilton told his Mercedes colleagues that his front left wheel struck the wall but was able to return to the track . Coming through the field: Hamilton stormed on to the podium after starting from the pit lane . As . Hamilton argued afterwards, he was in ‘the same race’ as Rosberg, the . man who led him by 14 points at the start of the afternoon but only 11 . at the end. Hamilton added that he was 'very, very shocked’ by the . instruction, while Rosberg, who is an even-keeled non-controversialist, . said he would not comment publicly on the situation until he had . discussed the matter with the team. Hamilton was supported by the . ever-loyal Niki Lauda, the executive chairman of Mercedes, who said: ‘I . feel it is a racer and I would have done exactly the same thing. He did . nothing wrong. He was just defending his position. ‘Nico was too far . away. Paddy (Lowe, the technical director who relayed the instruction to . Hamilton via his race engineer Peter Bonnington) saw this and he . stopped telling the engineers to slow Lewis down. He told them just to . race.’ Leading the way: Nico Rosberg, who started the race on pole, leads Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel into the first corner in wet conditions in Budapest . Treacherous: The wet weather in Hungary played havoc with the team's strategies in the early stages of the race . The team were doing their best to protect Hamilton – as they . always do – and smooth over the searching questions the controversy . prompted. Can anyone control Hamilton? Seemingly not given that Wolff . said there would be ‘no ramifications’ for this act of disobedience. ‘I don’t want to play the vicious general and demand that they obey the rules,’ said Wolff, somewhat benevolently. ‘Paddy or I could have gone on the radio, but we didn’t.’ That means Lewis can blithely do as he pleases. Wreck: Force India driver Sergio Perez climbs out of his mangled car after crashing into the wall on the final corner . Setting the pace: Nico Rosberg leads Valtteri Bottas and Sebastian Vettel into the second corner at the Hungaroring . Inches: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso gets close to the rear end of Sebastian Vettel's Red Bull . It . is at crisis moments such as these that the calming, experienced . presence of Ross Brawn, the super strategist who left Mercedes last . season, is missed. Would Hamilton have defied him over the radio? Less . chance. Wolff said at the start of the season that he was confident . the word of Lowe and himself would be writ. It was embarrassingly . exposed not to be so by this incident. Wolff, admitting he was now in . corporate mode, tried to defuse the situation, saying: ‘That was such a . difficult race with so many difficult decisions that needed to be made, . quick decisions. We need to analyse how we ended up there and whether . from here we need to discuss the racing between the two. ‘It is . getting intense and it is clear that they are direct competitors for the . world championship. We need to sit down and discuss it. Delay: The safety car leads Fernando Alonso and the rest of the field on lap 23 of the race . Faithful: Fans get behind the Ferrari team in the grandstands at the circuit in Hungary . Nice view: Pirelli hostesses take selfies against the backdrop of the Grand Prix . At the start . of the season the team drew up a long list detailing how they and each . driver would respond in any given situation, but that is no longer . relevant given the developing dynamics of the championship: a deep . internal duel among the drivers and a constructors' championship . practically won. ‘Maybe that (blueprint) doesn’t function anymore,’ said Wolff. ‘We cannot ask either driver to give up positions or . jeopardise their own championship chances for the benefit of the team.’ Away . from this dispute, there was a fantastic race. Not least by Hamilton, . who scythed his way up the field. ‘Once the green light came I was just . in hunting mode,’ he said. He made a particularly daring move stick, . passing Jean-Eric Vergne’s Toro Rosso on the outside of a left-handed . turn. Fabulous. Shunt: Marcus Ericsson ended up in the barriers after losing control of his Caterham on the exit of Turn 3 . Before the wet conditions dried out, the safety car was out twice, which helped Hamilton as the field concertinaed.

"This was the finest drive of Lewis Hamilton’s career in the greatest grand prix of the century. It was a privilege to be in Bahrain, where Hamilton and his fellow Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg duelled and duelled again, only inches from perdition at up to 200mph. The action behind them was hardly less compelling.

The victor was Hamilton, taking his . second successive win and his 24th in all to equal Juan Manuel Fangio’s . career total. It was a race that all the laws of logic decreed he should . never have won. He started . second on the grid to Rosberg, having made a slip in qualifying, but . stayed tight around the first corner to take the lead and then held off . Rosberg’s counter-attack on the fourth turn. Rosberg did not give up. At the start of the 18th and 19th laps he tried to wriggle past Hamilton. The . lead changed hands, by my estimation, five times. Rosberg said on the . team radio: ‘What he did wasn’t on.’ It was heat-of-the-moment . exasperation rather than a serious complaint.

Head-to-head: The fierce battle between Rosberg and Hamilton began at the outset of the race . Fortune . favoured Rosberg when a spectacular shunt brought out the safety car. Esteban Gutierrez’s Sauber went into a 360 degree somersault when he was . flipped by Pastor Maldonado’s Lotus. The two Mercedes immediately came . in to be reshod. Hamilton had to change to the harder tyre, Rosberg . could use the softer. The . softer rubber is faster so, once the safety car peeled away with 10 laps . remaining, Rosberg would be able to pass his team-mate from a gap that . had been reduced to virtually nothing by the break in racing. So . the theory went. ‘I remember our first race in karting,’ said  Hamilton . afterwards. ‘Nico was leading all the way and I overtook him on the . last lap. I thought that would happen to me today.’ So . did we all. But, no, Hamilton produced his best ever defensive driving . in repelling the relentless attack from behind. They were crawling over . each other like  spiders. Rosberg would get in front but Hamilton — in a . now-you-see-me-now-you-don’t flash — squirmed back ahead.

He . said: ‘This is Paddy.’ That made it clear it was the headmaster speaking and defiance would not be tolerated. ‘With 10 laps to race,’ he added, ‘let’s just make sure we bring both cars home.’ It was not an instruction to hold position, but an appeal for sense. Credit, too, to both Hamilton and Rosberg for possessing the serenity and skill to follow the appeal meticulously. The . best drive of Hamilton’s career, we have asserted. A case can be made . for Silverstone in 2008, when he dominated the wet conditions, . Senna-like, to win by more than a minute.

Moments . afterwards, his thoughts calmer, the German admitted: ‘I strongly . dislike losing to Lewis.’ So was this the best of grand prix of the . century? Hamilton’s title win in 2008 had a single epic moment of drama. Jenson . Button’s triumph in  Canada in 2011 was wet, mad and protracted. Mika . Hakkinen’s  victory over Michael Schumacher at Spa in 2000 produced an . overtaking move for the ages. But has any race contained more wheel-to-wheel action throughout the field?

"Lewis Hamilton could not even bring himself to look at Nico Rosberg, the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix. Neither put his arm around the other’s shoulder for the podium pictures. They then travelled back to the paddock press conference in separate minibuses. They sat on the dais side by side without so much as a glance at each other. The two World Championship contenders are not talking in private or public. Rosberg winked at his manager, Georg Nolte. A smile constantly played across his lips.

The stewards . investigated the incident and exonerated Rosberg. The driver steward was . Derek Warwick, a veteran of 146 grands prix and a man noted for probity . and fairness. That, however, did not satisfy Hamilton. He believed Rosberg had deliberately thwarted him. If he did, it was the perfect crime. So . tense are relations that the two men did not share a room for their . post-qualifying debrief.  Hamilton said, slightly implausibly: ‘I went . to the toilet and Nico did his debrief before I got there, which is . unusual.’ On Sunday morning . the froideur persisted. Hamilton rejected  Rosberg’s apology and . proffered hand. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, said: ‘This thing we . have with Lewis accusing the other of doing something stupid, I tried to . fix it this morning with Lewis but I couldn’t.

Later, . when he had something in his eye and was told how close Ricciardo was . getting to him, he said: ‘I don’t care about Ricciardo. I want to know . what the gap is  to Nico.’ Afterwards, Hamilton returned to the subject . of qualifying and again argued the case against Rosberg by innuendo, . saying: ‘I wish you could have seen the data. I’m sure you did see on . TV. If you haven’t seen what was on TV then you should go and watch it. I . saw something late on last night, and all I could do was smile.’ Pressed . on the nature of the data he saw, Hamilton said: ‘I’m not going to tell . you. I just wish you could see it. Then you could see for yourself.’ A straw poll of informed paddock observers returned a verdict split pretty much down the middle on Rosberg’s intentions. There . is a background to Saturday’s events. Sources within  Mercedes have . revealed Hamilton pressed the overtaking mode  button on his steering . wheel in the closing stages of the Spanish Grand Prix a fortnight ago . despite being told by his engineers not to. The extra power enabled him . to hold off Rosberg. Hamilton was admonished, Rosberg mentally noted the . incident for future reference.

So . it may be there was a tit-for-tat element to Rosberg’s actions as the . clock ran down in qualifying: if you play dirty, I’ll play dirty. Hamilton . said last week he is hungrier for success because he comes from a . Stevenage council estate rather than brought up in Monaco as Rosberg was . (though Hamilton was lavishly funded by McLaren: a salary, a private . tutor and a Mercedes). But both are tough and resilient. As Lauda said: . ‘You have to be a b****** if you want to win in Formula One. Tell me one . nice guy out there. Do we start with Fernando Alonso? This is a breed . of people who are 100 per cent focused. They use every trick to blow the . other one off. And in the same team it’s harder. Here it’s very tense.’ Hamilton, who at times . wallows in his distress and wears it indulgently, was somewhat more . sanguine after the official press conferences when speaking to a smaller . group of journalists in the garage. ‘What doesn’t break you will make . you stronger,’ he said. It . is rare for an internal team rivalry to erupt so spectacularly as early . as the sixth race of the  season. Lauda is there to manage it. He is . close to both drivers and speaks from experience as a three-time world . champion. ‘You can’t stop . the rivalry,’ he said. ‘One thing is clear, that Lewis, from my point of . view, has a one or two tenths advantage over Nico.

"1. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 2. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 3. Valtteri Bottas (Williams) 4. Felipe Massa (Williams) 5. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) The question crowding in on Lewis Hamilton as he lost further ground in the World Championship battle is whether he has any card to play other than his sheer, natural genius as a driver. His voice was thin and meek after he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, the calculating German who is threatening to win the title by small margins of Teutonic precision. VIDEO Mercedes reassert dominance in Austria . Champagne moment: Championship leader Nico Rosberg celebrates his third victory of the season in Austria . The winner: Rosberg (centre) celebrates his victory with Lewis Hamilton 2nd and Valtteri Bottas 3rd . Champagne: Rosberg (right) and third placed Williams' driver Valtteri Bottas celebrate . Jubilant: The Mercedes driver shares his champagne moment with the fans in Austria . Close: Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg (left) and Lewis Hamilton battle it out for top spot in Austria . Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) - 165 . Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 136 . Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) - 81 . Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) - 79 . Nico Hulkenberg (Force India) - 61 . Hamilton . had driven beautifully here at the Red Bull Ring in the rolling hills of . green countryside, threading his car through the pack from ninth on the . starting grid to zoom into fourth place on the first lap alone, en . route to a second-place finish behind Rosberg. But . it is when cool calculation is needed that Hamilton is lacking against . the cerebral, icy Rosberg. For example, in qualifying on Saturday, . Hamilton spun — ‘maybe I pushed the brake pedal too hard,’ he said — and . had one lap wiped because he ran off the track at Turn Eight. Rosberg . was inch-perfect, so much so that the stewards spent half an hour . studying an image that suggested he, too, had put all four wheels off . the tarmac at the same corner. They gave him the benefit of the doubt. Round the bend: Pole-sitter Felipe Massa led the pack into turn 1 but ultimately finished in fourth . So . Rosberg started from third with the Williams cars of Felipe Massa and . Valtteri Bottas surprisingly starting on the front row.  Rosberg said he . had been slowed a fraction by Hamilton’s excursion off the asphalt. The . marginally superior pace of Rosberg’s Mercedes allowed him to force his . way into the lead in the 15th of the 71 laps. The win gives him a . 29-point lead going into Hamilton’s home race at Silverstone on Sunday . week. Bizarrely, . Rosberg was asked afterwards whether, if he won the title, he would . grow a moustache to resemble that of his father Keke, the 1982 champion. He said he might. The . similarities are growing: Keke was a pugnacious character and Nico, for . all his blond looks that won him the moniker ‘Britney’, as in Spears, . is showing a hard-edged pursuit of  perfection that is not so obvious in . his rival. Costly: Hamilton lost almost two seconds to team-mate Rosberg during the two round of pit-stops . Flying: Lewis Hamilton get off to a stunning start at the Red Bull Ring in Austria . Out: Sebastian Vettel was forced to retire from the race in Spielberg, Austria . This . weekend had echoes of the last race in Canada. Hamilton erred in . qualifying, surrendering pole to Rosberg. That allowed the German to . nurse the technical glitches that blighted both Mercedes from the front . while Hamilton pushed his car until it retired hurt. The . British driver was hindered by two slow pit stops yesterday but, again, . his own minute error was a factor. He admitted he went ‘a bit long’ — . fractionally beyond the ideal pit-box stopping place — on his first . visit to the pits. A . problem with a cracked wheel rim delayed him in the second stop. It . cost him 1.9sec compared to Rosberg. That was almost exactly the margin . by which the pair were separated at the end. ‘Valuable, but it would not . have put me first,’ said Hamilton. ‘There is not much more I can do. I . have good pace. I just need to execute it.’ So close: Hamilton pushed team-mate Rosberg right to the chequered flag but came up short in Austria . Talent: Hamilton battled well to come from ninth position to earn a second spot finish . Peace: Hamilton finished second in Austria . It . was noticeable that Mercedes were not as dominant as in the past. Lauda . said there would be a meeting at the factory in Brackley this week to . analyse how to re-establish their hegemony. The fast Silverstone layout . should suit their super-powerful engine. Toto . Wolff, Mercedes’ executive director, has another job: trying to get the . garage’s two sides working collaboratively. ‘The playing field must be . kept equal,’ he said. ‘On Saturday, the atmosphere wasn’t like in the . races before. We see it’s getting very competitive. ‘We . need the knowledge of the whole group, not only the drivers but the . engineers on both sides of the garage. It’s not about  winning the next . couple of races but staying competitive in the next couple of years.’ Williams, a team who deserve some respite, took third and fourth through Bottas and Massa. Red Bull had the indignity on their own track of only one finisher from their team and their subsidiary Toro Rosso. Christian . Horner, Red Bull’s team chief, said of engine suppliers Renault: . ‘Reliability is unacceptable, performance is unacceptable. There needs . to be change at Renault.’","Rosberg claimed his third win of the year and is 29 points clear of Hamilton .

"He was hunted and harried but finally Lewis Hamilton won the Spanish Grand Prix — his fourth consecutive victory and the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. Back in the Mercedes team home in the paddock, a seasoned observer in his red hat — Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman —was banging the table as he claimed in that direct Austrian style of his that Hamilton is simply unbeatable. That proposition was mildly under threat in the closing few laps of the race as Nico Rosberg, assisted by fresher, quicker tyres, came within six-tenths of a second of overtaking him. Another couple of laps and he would probably have managed it. It provided a dramatic conclusion to a race that could best be described as a slow burner around the procession-inducing tarmac of Barcelona. Leader: Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Spanish GPwhich put him top of the World Championship table . Hamilton was less than ecstatic, despite having established a three-point lead over Rosberg to lead the championship for the first time in nearly two years. ‘I wasn’t fast enough today,’ he said. ‘Nico was quicker.’ Hamilton was being hard on himself (as well as tetchy in some radio exchanges earlier). But he deserved to win for being fractions better than Rosberg at the decisive moments of the weekend: in putting his car on pole and making the cleaner start to protect his advantage going into the first corner. Lauda, contented after his team’s fourth crushing one-two of the season, declared: ‘Lewis Hamilton is unbeatable. It’s very simple. Because he’s getting better and better every race. He makes no mistake whatsoever. He’s got a strong personality. He’s focused. Nico tried every trick today to get him. And he did a good job, but he couldn’t pass him. ‘Nico is aware at what level Lewis is driving because they both drive the same car. And Nico will continue to fight, which for me is the most important thing. ‘Because if Nico keeps on pushing himself to beat Lewis, the big advantage is that both cars will go quicker. So I’m in a very comfortable situation — outstanding by Lewis and Nico trying to catch up.’ In form: Hamilton edged out Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo to win his fourth race in a row . Lauda was not finished. ‘My strategy is very simple. We do not interfere with who is winning what. We let our drivers drive from beginning to the end. So far nothing bad has happened. If there is no third driver in championship contention then I’m completely relaxed. ‘Then they can drive over each other, and whoever is surviving is the world champion. This is my dream. But we’re not there yet. When we are, it’s really going to be warfare.’ Is it? How nasty it all gets depends to some degree on Rosberg being able to match Hamilton more regularly than he has this season. If he fails to do that in the next few races, starting in Monaco in a fortnight, Hamilton’s dominance may prove unstoppable. Rosberg said: ‘I wasn’t close enough to give it a go (attempt to pass Hamilton). Next lap I would have been. So I am a bit gutted. But, still, it was second place, I am close in the championship and there are many more races to go. ‘The start was poor. It’s a bit of a weakness at the moment. But there are a lot of positives to take and I am fully motivated.’ Impressive: Mercedes chairman has labelled Hamilton unbeatable following his run of wins . Mercedes’ team hegemony certainly remains unshaken by the three-week break and the move to the European stretch of the season. The Mercedes cars were more than 49 seconds ahead of Daniel Ricciardo’s Red Bull in third place, though he was delayed at the start by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas. The true gap is six-tenths of a second a lap, according to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Some people questioned Hamilton’s move from McLaren to Mercedes for 2013. However, he rightly detected their potential as a ‘super team’ in embryo. McLaren, on the other hand, had lost Mercedes as partners and had not then done a deal with Honda — an arrangement that comes into effect next season. ‘I feel truly blessed to be part of this team,’ said Hamilton. ‘It is just unreal.’ Close run: Nico Rosberg was disappointed not to get closer to Hamilton in the Spanish GP . The disparity between Mercedes and McLaren was clear yesterday as Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen were lapped comprehensively. That is intolerable for a team of McLaren’s stature. Ferrari also suffered, with Kimi Raikkonen being lapped. They were at least saved from the further humiliation of Fernando Alonso suffering the same fate on his home track in front of his adoring fans. The drive of the day probably belonged to Red Bull’s world champion Sebastian Vettel. He started 15th after being penalised for a gearbox failure, yet carved his way up to fourth. His boss, Horner, knows better than most about dominating a season, or several. Asked if he thought Mercedes would win all 19 races, he said: ‘Possible but improbable.’ Comeback trail: Sebastian Vettel finished fourth after starting the day in 15th .","Lewis Hamilton lauded by Niki Lauda after run of wins continues .

"Lewis Hamilton responded to conjecture that he has the brawn, but not the brains, by claiming his 32nd career pole for tomorrow's Australian Grand Prix. The new Formula One campaign, with its emphasis on fuel and tyre management, is expected to favour the thinking driver, and critics of Hamilton have suggested this could work against him. While we'll yet to see how Hamilton handles the new regulations in race conditions, the early signs in qualifying were promising. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton, Daniel Ricciardo and the Lotus team . In control: Lewis Hamilton will start tomorrow's race from pole after mastering the inclement conditions . In black and white: Hamilton has 32 career pole positions which is one shy of Jim Clark's British record . He resisted calls to tackle the tricky Albert Park conditions on intermediate tyres – instead opting for the wet-weathered Pirelli, with its greater tread. His timing too was impeccable, crossing the line after both Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg when the track was at its greatest. Hamilton now joins compatriot Nigel Mansell on the all-time list for the highest number of pole positions. He only needs two more to eclipse the legendary Jim Clark as Britain's greatest specialist over one lap and four-time world champion Alain Prost. It's difficult to say what drew a better response from the partisan Australian crowd – Daniel Ricciardo sticking his Red Bull on the front row or Sebastian Vettel failing to make it into the top-10 shootout. The Melbourne crowd clearly haven't forgotten Vettel's sour rivalry with home favourite Mark Webber, raucously cheering the German's early bath from qualifying. Out of sorts: World champion Sebastian Vettel will start tomorrow's race from 12th on the grid . Slumping to 13th, Vettel failed to make it out of Q2 for the first time since the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix – that's 28 races. His final lap would certainly have been affected by Kimi Raikkonen's crash – the waving yellow flags forcing him to slow – but the reigning world champion was well off the pace of team-mate Ricciardo throughout qualifying. There was some consolation for the 26-year-old after he was bumped up to 12th following Valtteri Bottas' five-place grid drop following a gearbox change. Thumbs up: Ricciardo will start on the front row . Red Bull team principal Christian Horner sparked much controversy after he claimed that Mercedes would win the Australian Grand Prix by two laps. Unsurprisingly, it seems his prediction may have been somewhat premature. Red Bull endured a nightmare pre-season, so it is testament to the incredible work done by those at Milton Keynes in the aftermath of the final test in Bahrain to see Ricciardo haul the champions on to the front row. And what of the Australian himself? There was some displeasure that Red Bull chose to promote from within instead of hiring Raikkonen who ended his two-year spell with Lotus at the end of last season. But Ricciardo justified his selection by splitting the Silver Arrows while in contrast Ferrari were counting the cost of Raikkonen's dramatic spin in Q2. The Finn will start from 11th oh his Ferrari comeback. Ricciardo's notorious grin however, will be wider than ever tonight. Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat will start fourth and eighth respectively after a sterling job from the F1 rookies. Magnusessen's effort is the best from a Formula One first-timer since Hamilton qualified fourth for the curtain raiser in Melbourne some seven years ago. His lap looks all the more impressive when you consider team-mate Jenson Button failed to make it out of Q2. Rookie delight: Danill Kvyat and Kevin Magnussen in his McLaren (right) showed maturity on their debuts . Kvyat, who is just 19-years-old and won last year's GP3 championship, was born just five days before Ayrton Senna was killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. The three-time world champion, a master of wet conditions, would have doffed his cap to Kvyat's start to life in F1. Lotus were victorious at last year's Australian Grand Prix after Raikkonen stormed to glory in Melbourne. But the troubled team have zero chance of repeating that feat tomorrow after somewhat of a nightmare on Saturday. In trouble: The Lotus of Pastor Maldonado failed to post a competitive time in qualifying . Romain Grosejan and Pastor Maldonado will start 20th and 21st – the latter, a winter arrival from Williams, spent much of Q1 on the grass, failing to complete a single lap. The team somehow managed to see the funny side writing on their Twitter account: 'It was double points for the last race and reverse grids all season right?'","Lewis Hamilton is one shy of Jim Clark's record for most poles by a Brit .

"An embarrassed local official and an adopted local hero left their unique marks on the Chinese Grand Prix. The identity of the first, a marshal who waved the chequered flag a lap early, was being concealed for his own sanity.

'I'm in the . happiest mood that I can remember,' said Hamilton. 'It's where I am in . my life, family, girlfriend, all things, where I live, everything, . having the right people in place, management, being in the right team.' Nothing went wrong all weekend for Hamilton. Off the track, he enjoyed . the adulation of his fans at the airport, at the track and at his hotel . 'every morning, every evening, day and night'. They even gave him a . digital photo frame with a specially-made video. Job done: Hamilton claims his third victory on the spin and punches the air in delight as he crosses the line . Psychological blow: Hamilton left title rival Rosberg trailing as he claimed his third win of the campaign . On . the track, he drove supremely in qualifying through the gloom and . drizzle to set himself up for yesterday's demonstration that took him to . 25 career wins. The . total took him past the immortal Juan Manuel Fangio and level with his . Mercedes boss Niki Lauda and the British great Jim Clark. As . coincidence would have it, on Clark's 25th and sadly final victory, in . Kyalami, South Africa on January 1, 1968, the chequered flag was also . waved prematurely but the Scot was awake to the fact and raced on. Hamilton lifted, he said, for a second-and-a-half but was told by the . team to keep going. The regulations, bizarrely, dictate that if the flag is waved early, the placings are taken from the preceding lap. That . meant Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi's last overtaking move on Marussia . Jules Bianchi did not count. Thankfully, they were contesting 17th place . rather than the important positions at the front. Pole position: Hamilton leads his challengers into the first corner and never relinquished his lead . Trailing: Kimi Raikkonen in the Ferrari was well down the leaderboard at the Shanghai International Circuit . Another . consolation of sorts for the unnamed marshal is that the last . flag-related error of this sort was committed by none other than Pele. He had to be prompted to wave the flag in Brazil in 2006 after the . winning Ferrari of Felipe Massa had already whizzed by. In . second place here was Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. His . telemetry failed before the race even started, so he had to think for . himself rather than rely on his team's analysis. Having . made a poor start as a result of his problems, slipping from fourth on . the grid to seventh on the first lap, he bided his time coolly, . squeezing up the field gradually. It was impressive in the circumstances. Fernando . Alonso, of Ferrari, drove pugnaciously to a third place that probably . flattered his car. Given that Hamilton has won three consecutive races - . a feat he had never achieved before - it is amazing that Rosberg . nevertheless holds a four-point lead in the championship table, by dint . of his own consistency and Hamilton's mechanical failure in the opening . round in Melbourne. Pursuit: Fernando Alonso negotiates a corner in his Ferrari . 'S' bend: Hamilton leads the field round a series of corners . Spectacle: Fans in the main grandstand take pictures of the start . The . most controversial aspect of Sunday's racing came when Sebastian Vettel . was ordered to give way to his Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. The world champion was nonplussed and asked what strategy Ricciardo was on. 'Tough luck,' was Vettel's response when told. Defiantly he refused to yield for a couple of laps before finally making room for his supposedly junior partner to pass. Christian Horner, who had worn an anxious expression as the drama . unfolded, excused his star driver afterwards, saying: 'He hasn't won . four world championships by not being a racer. Of course, he's going to . question the instruction to understand it, but as soon as he understood . the reasoning, bang, he moved aside.' Coming through: Rosberg passes Sebastian Vettel on the run down to turn 1 . Aussie rules: Daniel Ricciardo finished 25 seconds clear of Vettel . Did he? Should he have questioned it all? Should Red Bull have employed . team orders so readily? The most surprising thing of all though is that . Vettel was again slower than Ricciardo. It was the second time he has . been asked to move aside in consecutive races. Whither the boy genius? Horner . said: 'He's not getting the feedback from the car that he wants. The . compound effect is that he's damaging the tyres more, which is very . unusual for Seb. As soon as we have worked those out then I'm sure he'll . be back with a bang.' Red . Bull and McLaren are heading for a legal dispute over the . aerodynamicist Dan Fallows, who left Red Bull, seemingly agreed to join . McLaren and then turned up again at Red Bull. It is a point of . principle, no doubt, for McLaren chairman Ron Dennis, who watched his . cars driven by Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen finish in 11th and 13th . places. They are slipping back. No so their old boy, Hamilton, who had China in his hands and the world at his feet. On the three previous occasions Lewis Hamilton triumphed in three straight races — Formula Renault in 2003, Formula Three in 2005, and GP2 a year later — he went on to win the title. KIMI'S TRAILING . Kimi Raikkonen continues to be blown away by fellow former world champion Fernando Alonso following his high-profile move back to Ferrari. The surly Finn has managed just eight laps ahead of Alonso this season and finished Sunday’s race 50 seconds adrift of his Spanish team-mate. No driver has won a Formula One world championship without winning one of the first four grands prix. That’s a strong omen for Hamilton and Nico Rosberg; not so for Sebastian Vettel and the chasing pack. NUMBER OF THE DAY - 4 .

Another victor was Nico Rosberg, who extended his championship lead to 22 points over his unfortunate Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who retired with mechanical failure when vying for the lead of the race.

Ricciardo, who had a podium finish in his home race in Melbourne in . March taken from him because his team broke fuel flow regulations. On Sunday, told over the radio that he had won, he simply said: ‘Wow.’ Half-collecting . his thoughts during the ceremony he said: ‘I’m still in shock. This is . ridiculous. It is a bit surreal. It’s not that we were leading the race . from start to finish.’ Too . right. Nothing was that simple. The dramatic start set the tone. Rosberg, beginning on pole, was not away as quickly as Hamilton. But the . German had the positional advantage to hold his team-mate off at the . first, tight left-hander. Hamilton lost second place to Red Bull’s . Sebastian Vettel, who ended up third. Race over? Not a bit of it. More . drama ensued just moments later involving Marussia. What a difference a . fortnight made for them. In Monaco they celebrated their first point in . a four-and-a-half year history through Jules Bianchi’s ninth place. But . neither of their cars made the end of the first lap here, as Bianchi . and Max Chilton collided, leaving a smear of oil on the track that . brought out the safety car for six laps. The . accident ended the world’s least spectacular record: Chilton’s streak . of 25 unbroken finishes stretching back to his debut in Melbourne last . season. Hugs all round: Ricciardo is congratulate by team-mate Sebastian Vettel . Arms aloft: An ecstatic Ricciardo on the podium at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve . Silverware: Ricciardo lifts the winners' trophy after his victory at the Canadian Grand Prix . Soon Hamilton had . passed Vettel using the DRS boost. At this stage both Mercedes were . struggling slightly on their supersoft tyres but still lapped quicker . than everybody else by dint of their superior engines. After . 18 laps, Rosberg came in. It was a smooth stop of 3.1sec. He was . followed by Hamilton, delayed half a second longer in the pit box. Rosberg rode the kerbs high at the first chicane and nearly wobbled off. Hamilton . pulled closer and closer to Rosberg’s exhaust over the following . minutes, turning the timing screens purple, the colour that denotes . fastest sectors and laps. Rosberg . could see Hamilton getting bigger in his mirrors and, under pressure, . missed the apex of turn 14, cutting the corner. The stewards issued a . final warning. Shower time: Second-placed Rosberg sprays champagne over the winner Ricciardo . Collision: Williams driver Felipe Massa crashed out on the final lap of an eventful race . Unscathed: The Brazilian escaped from his collision and walked out of his abandoned car . Damage: The remains of Massa's Williams is dragged away from the circuit by a recovery vehicle . Problems: Both Mercedes drivers reported a lack of power midway through the race . It was . probably the right decision on balance: Rosberg had gained time but not a . place. It would have been harsh to order the German to cede the . position. Hamilton, who . harried Rosberg for much of the race, started to fall away around the . middle of the 70 laps, before he complained over the radio: ‘I am losing . power guys.’ We then learned that Rosberg was suffering the same . affliction. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman in his trademark red cap, wore a worried look in the team’s paddock home. A . ship’s horn sounded — like a warning in the St Lawrence River on which . this island track stands — and well it might. The trauma had barely . started for the Silver Arrows, who instructed both their drivers to . reset their systems. Rosberg was told: ‘We don’t think we can resolve . it. You need to  pick up the pace. P3 (the third –placed car) is . catching us now.’ Bold: Hamilton tried to jump Rosberg into the first corner but went in too deep . Squeezed off: Hamilton ended up falling behind Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel on the first lap . All gone wrong: Hamilton was forced to retire with over 20 laps of the race remaining . The two . Mercedes came in for their second stops. Rosberg’s stop was slower than . that of Hamilton, who came out in the lead. It was short-lived as . Rosberg passed him. Hamilton fought back but missed the apex at the same . spot as Rosberg had and had to let his rival back through. It . was chaos now. Hamilton, smoke coming from his car, slowed down and . finally retired with rear break failure, having completed 45 laps. Rosberg inexplicably ran over the grass and, still struggling for power . and therefore speed, was now in a different race — with those behind . him. Could he hang on? No. With two laps remaining, Ricciardo wrestled his way past the Mercedes of . Rosberg. ‘Daniel is an amazing young man,’ said Red Bull designer . Adrian Newey. ‘What impresses me most is how calming he is when he comes . on the team radio. We were a bit lucky today in truth but we were there . and ready.’ End of the road: Hamilton is wheeled back into his garage after being forced to retire . Lonely walk: Caterham's Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi walks away after being forced to retire . Correct. Rosberg, who had problems with the energy recovery system and . consequently with overheating brakes, said afterwards: ‘We need to be . bullet-proof.’ Nevertheless, he could take many positives from the . weekend, not least beating Hamilton to pole on Saturday. The . final twist came in the closing moments when Felipe Massa ran his . Williams into the back of Sergio Perez, who had driven so brilliantly . for Force India for so much of the afternoon that he was lying fourth at . the time. It looked bad, but neither driver was seriously hurt.

"Andy Murray must learn to choose his tennis commitments wisely to avoid a repeat of his 2014 ATP World Tour Finals exit, former mentor Sergio Casal has warned. Murray was beaten 6-0 6-1 by Roger Federer in his Group B match at the O2 Arena last month, which was the Scot's worst result in seven years. His seventh successive qualification for the World Tour Finals needed a mammoth run of tournaments in Shenzen, Beijing, Shanghai, Vienna, Valencia and Paris - the eventual strain meant Federer needed all of 56 minutes to dispense of Murray. Maria Sharapova and Andy Murray share a joke while participating in the inaugural IPTL last weekend . The Scot apologies to the crowd after being thrashed 6-0, 6-1 by Roger Federer last month in London . And Casal, who mentored and coached a teenage Murray during his years at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona, feels the Scot has to start working smarter in 2015. Speaking at the academy's visit to York, where it delivered a series of performance player, coach, and adult workshops, Casal told Press Association Sport: 'He needs to choose well. 'I think he did about five (tournaments) in a row before the World Tour Finals. 'It's difficult to play more than three for these guys. More than three, it depends on the player. Andy Murray's, in action in Manila, played six straight tournaments to qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals . Murray linked up with Amelie Mauresmo just before Wimbledon, where the two are pictured back in July . 'At the beginning, when you are young, it's good that you play everything - it is the best way to learn. 'At 18, 19, 20 we used to play 36, 37 tournaments. The more you get a better ranking you have to choose little bit. He has to do that. 'He took the risk maybe with that match (against Federer), I don't know what happened.' It has been a transitional year of sorts for Murray, not least with Amelie Mauresmo joining him as coach in June, following Ivan Lendl's exit. In late November, Murray parted ways with long-term coaches Jez Green and Dani Vallverdu, the latter having befriended him as a teenager in Barcelona. Sergio Casal mentored Murray for 15 years at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona . Nevertheless, Casal is confident Murray remains in prime condition to challenge for more Grand Slam titles, despite the pressure that comes from being Britain's most successful tennis player of the Open era. 'These guys play a lot, they play a lot of years at high level with pressure from sponsors, press, the country, and they get tired,' Casal added. 'As far as you are getting older, you are fit, but it's tough to recover. From one day to the other one, when you wake up it's different to when you were in your twenties. 'Murray is still very young - 27 is good. He's at his peak. 'You mature well, you don't do mistakes as when you were a junior. He has three, four very good years left.' Sergio Casal was speaking at the Sanchez-Casal academy's UK coaching tour, held in conjunction with Down The Line Sports.

"Andy Murray's former mentor Sergio Casal has no worries about the Scot's choice of coaches, insisting he has plenty to learn from 'champion' Amelie Mauresmo. Murray's appointment of Mauresmo has come under a measure of criticism, ever since the former women's world No 1 joined forces with him in June. Former British No 1 Tim Henman recently expressed doubts about whether Mauresmo was having the right impact on Murray - a feeling exacerbated when the Scot's season came to a crushing end in a 6-0 6-1 loss to Roger Federer at the ATP World Tour finals. Andy Murray's decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo as a coach drew plenty of criticism . However, Casal, who mentored a 15-year-old Murray at the famed Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona, feels the partnership with Mauresmo, much like the previous one with Ivan Lendl, will be a fruitful one. Speaking at the academy's visit to York, where it delivered a series of performance player, coach, and adult workshops, Casal told Press Association: 'He had Lendl, now Mauresmo. You can always get something from these champions. 'It depends on the connection. But the important thing is that he is connected with champions. 'These champions, always you can learn something from them.' Murray linked up with Mauresmo just before Wimbledon, where the two are pictured together here in July . Murray announced that Dani Vallverdu (left) would leave his backroom team along with Jez Green . Indeed, it was at the Sanchez-Casal academy more than a decade ago that a teenage Murray struck up a partnership with Venezuelan Dani Vallverdu, who later became part of his coaching staff and was highly valued by Lendl. Vallverdu and Murray recently ended their association and Casal, a former world No 3 in doubles, hopes this decision is also for the best. 'They've been together so long,' Casal said. 'They are best friends. I hope there is nothing wrong between them. 'Sometimes you have to make these decisions to make another step. Who knows what is happening inside?' Murray in action for the Manila Mavericks in the International Tennis Premier League with Maria Sharapova . Sergio Casal mentored Murray for 15 years at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona . A recently engaged Murray is currently playing for the Manila Mavericks in the inaugural International Premier Tennis League, as he looks ahead to the 2015 season. Casal is already proud of his protege's achievements, including the Grand Slam victories of recent years, even if 2014 has not gone completely to plan for the Scot. Should Murray ever need another helping hand though, Casal is happy to oblige. When asked if he would consider ever coaching the 27-year-old again, Casal said: 'We never thought about that! 'But, of course, to be with him, one of the best players in the world, is great. I know him since before juniors. 'The results he has made already are incredible. 'Even winning Wimbledon is so complicated, especially here with the people wanting it, and finally he did it. I think he handled the pressure well.'

"When Sam Sheppard's boyfriend Ryan proposed to her it was, she says, more like 'being asked out for pizza'. So disappointing was this pivotal life moment that Sam decided to ensure no other women were ever let down in such a way again. So the 34-year-old from Gilwen, Monmouthshire, made it her mission to train men in the art of popping the question, founding The Proposal Expert, Wales' first bespoke wedding proposal planning service. On bended knee: Sam Sheppard, 34, right, launched her proposal expert company after her boyfriend Ryan, left, offered her such a disappointing one . Catering for clients with any budget - from £10 to £10,000 - Sam has already helped couples all over the UK get engaged, and boasts a 100 per cent success rate. She said: 'The idea came from my own disappointing experience - my boyfriend, Ryan Galeozzi, proposed to me during an argument in the same way you might ask someone if they'd like to go for a pizza. 'When he proposed I didn't even realise what he was asking. He said he spent too long looking and planning and in the end he just blurted it out. 'At the time I thought it was because . he didn't care enough to put any effort into it, but once he explained I . realised I was being silly. He said he wants to have another go, so now I'm just waiting.' You have got to be kidding: Sam doesn't want other women to be as let down as she was when their boyfriend's finally pop the question . She said: 'I want to help other people not to feel how I felt. Initially, I felt like he couldn't really care about me to have asked that way, though of course I know that's not true at all.' Sam spends up to three weeks planning the perfect way for the prospective groom - or bride - to propose. The client can choose from a number . of packages, ranging from an bespoke ideas consultation costing under . £100, to a full proposal planning service, where Sam organises every . aspect of the proposal, including negotiating a discount with venues and . vendors and handling payments. Sam added: 'I ask key questions to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what makes their partner laugh, how they spend their Saturday mornings - those little things build up a picture. 'Once we've got the idea, the proposer can then have as much or as little input as they like.' Be mine? Ryan and Sam have been together for four years, but Ryan says he is planning to propose all over again because Sam was so disappointed by his first attempt . Clients can even choose to have their proposal recorded or photographed with a paparazzi-style lens. Sam said: 'A lot of guys use Google for ideas and end up with something generic. They can become overwhelmed and a little bit paralysed with it. 'A good proposal can be lasting talking point, but a bad one can end up on YouTube for the whole world to see. 'I haven't heard any really wacky ideas yet - unless your partner is really wacky too those are best avoided.' Say cheese! Sam caters for clients with any budget, from £10 to £10,000, and says she builds up a picture of the couple and their relationship before putting together their 'proposal package' Sam's research has shown that most women prefer to be asked while their partner is on bended knee, and that a treasure hunt proposal is the most fail-safe option - just so long as it has been personalised to the couple. Sam, whose background is in marketing and teaching English, believes her creative flair and organisation have helped her to become The Proposal Expert. She said: 'A lot of my friends are male which has helped me to know how they think and what makes them tick. 'I know that they need help with this sort of thing and I'm here to give it to them. I can give them a female's perspective and they don't have to worry about being judged by their friends - or their girlfriend finding out. I offer absolute discretion. Meet the expert: 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner. Their fiances usually love that they've used one too' Sam admits that most men she has helped choose not to tell the bride-to-be that they've used her services, but she believes that will change. 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner,' she said. 'Their fiances usually love that they've used one too. 'Everything the man says is what helps me to put the idea together - so whatever package they choose they still play a big part.' To hire Sam's services, visit www.theproposalexpert.co.uk .

"Saracens left their recent Aviva Premiership form in the dust as they notched 11 tries in beating winless London Welsh 78-7 to return to the play-off spots. Mark McCall's men had not secured a league victory for more than two months but that winning feeling returned with consecutive triumphs over Sale Sharks during the European break. And they did not give Welsh a sniff at Allianz Park, as Mako Vunipola, who grabbed two tries, Brett Sharman, George Kruis and Chris Ashton all crossed in the first half. Richard Wigglesworth scored three tries as Saracens thrashed London Welsh . Mako Vunipola also went over twice in a commanding victory for Sarries . Cross-code convert Elliot Kear did respond for the Exiles but Sarries made the scoreline even more emphatic as replacement Richard Wigglesworth grabbed a hat-trick of tries, in addition to scores from Jackson Wray, Richard Barrington and Ben Ransom. The eagle-eyed Owen Farrell converted 10 tries of 11. It proved the perfect send-off for Saracens stalwart Mouritz Botha, who came on a replacement for his final appearance before moving back to South Africa. Exiles wing Seb Stegmann gave away a kickable penalty early on and after Farrell decided to go for touch, Vunipola burrowed over to score a try. Farrell, who in total notched 23 points from the tee, converted and then bagged a penalty, before the England fly-half got himself involved in a flowing move with Neil de Kock. That nearly resulted in an Ashton try but after he was held up on the try-line, Sharman was eventually adjudged to have touched down after referee Ian Tempest consulted the television match official. England fly half Owen Farrell made 10 out of 11 kicks in a resounding win . Richard Barrington of Saracens was another among the try scorers at Allianz Park on Saturday . Kruis made it a hat-trick of tries for the Saracens pack when he piled through the Welsh defence beneath the posts, with Farrell nailing the conversion once more. Then a mighty leap from Kruis gave Saracens possession from a line-out, and Vunipola scurried over for his second converted try to snatch the bonus point by the half-hour mark. Try number five came after a blistering run by Ashton down the right, with Farrell doing well to make the conversion. The Exiles did however get off the mark when Peter Browne slipped a pass through to Kear and Will Robinson added the extras. England winger Chris Ashton was also among those to cross over on Saturday afternoon . Elliot Kear managed a consolation try for London Welsh despite their resounding defeat . Saracens kept the pace up after the break as flanker Wray scored a try from a rolling maul after 48 minutes. And Allianz Park was in seventh heaven as replacement Barrington bagged a converted try on the hour mark. A wonderful jinking run by fellow substitute Wigglesworth saw him dance through the Welsh defence to touch down, and moments later Ransom used his speed to race away for the home side's ninth try of the day. Wigglesworth bagged two more tries in quick-fire fashion, the first of which came from a lovely shimmy and pass from Farrell, as Welsh's miserable day came to an end.","Saracens notch 11 tries in commanding victory against London Welsh .

"Elementary, my dear Hamilton. So the demanding task of winning the Malaysian Grand Prix was made to look by the supreme  racing craft of the Briton chasing his second, life-defining, world title. With victory secured in the suffocating heat of the Sepang track, Lewis Hamilton beamed on the podium as he was interviewed, bizarrely enough, by Sherlock Holmes, aka actor Benedict Cumberbatch. But what looked like a piffling one-pipe triumph for a driver of Hamilton’s brilliance was a massive statement of intent in what, at this early stage of the season at least, is a private championship duel between the two Mercedes’ men, Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. My race: Lewis Hamilton celebrates after securing victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix . Jump for joy: It was the Brit's first points finish of the season after retiring in Australia two weeks ago . Much deserved: Sebastian Vettel congratulates Lewis Hamilton after he secures first place in Malaysia . Celebrity guest: Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch was a surprise interviewer for the drivers after the race . ‘Strike One to Lewis,’ was the verdict . of Jenson Button, the grid’s most experienced competitor. Yes, the . Hamilton-Rosberg tally stands at a single race win each, but Rosberg’s . triumph in Melbourne a fortnight ago was achieved after his garage-mate . suffered early engine failure. The . statistic of relevance was the 17.3sec gap between Hamilton . and Rosberg in second place. That is light years when two men, unimpeded . by incident and without any apparent technical faults, are driving . identical cars. Hamilton, . who was on pole, started impressively by moving to block Rosberg, who . started from directly behind him in third. His advantage established, he . merely purred into an ever-increasing lead. Still, . there was the heat, the fuel, the tyres to contend with. We heard how . this season would serve-up ‘the hare and the tortoise’ races. Would . Hamilton’s hare be caught? No chance. The absence of a safety-car period . and no more than the merest  sprinkling of fleeting rain added a sense . of inevitability as the 56 laps ticked by. All too easy: Hamilton comfortably won in Malaysia as Mercedes dominated the race . Comradery: Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg embrace after shutting out the top two places . You can't catch me: Hamilton started well from pole to avoid any collisions with the chasing pack . Podium: Mercedes team-mate Rosberg fought off Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel to take second place . Lewis Hamilton shares the British record for number of pole positions with Jim Clark — he has 33 — but he doesn’t usually convert them like on Sunday. He has won just 13 times from pole, including only six victories from his last 21.

So . Lewis, 17 seconds? ‘It’s massive,’ he said. ‘I can’t remember the last . time I had a gap like that, particularly with a team-mate driving the . same car. That’s  definitely a good feeling. ‘I . learned a few things in practice but it’s a different thing learning it . from applying it, but today I applied it and that’s why I blew him . away.’ Hamilton’s win was . the 23rd of his career, passing Damon Hill’s 22. That accolade went with . his 33rd pole on Saturday, which made him the joint British record . holder alongside no less a legend than Jim Clark. His perfect weekend . was completed by his setting the fastest lap. It . is a delight to watch Hamilton at the wheel in this commanding form. He . is simply the fastest man on the planet. As the paddock was being . dismantled — next stop Bahrain on Sunday — he summed up his approach to . racing. He said: ‘My trainer . was saying in the last few years, “If people could see that you’re . always in bed early. Nobody sees that, and they say you’re less focused. And they say Sebastian (Vettel|) is more focused just because he’s . getting results.” ‘I’m . giving it everything. I’m only thinking about the championship. I’m . thinking about winning. I’m living and breathing it, as I do every year. ‘In . my driving style, I’m more mature. I’m starting to see the benefits of . the mistakes, and the things I’ve said, or the things I’ve done, and I . even noticed it today. I am more calculating in the race.’ Rosberg still . leads the championship table. In fact, he can follow Hamilton home in . the next two races and still lead the table. No wonder Rosberg seemed . reasonably unperturbed afterwards. His confidence, apparently at an . all-time high prior to the race, is far from being shot. It . is the contention here that the best seasons are shaped by a straight . rivalry between team-mates. Think Mansell-Piquet, Prost-Senna, . Alonso-Hamilton. Fireworks abounded. Are we in for a repeat treat? Button’s . thoughts are instructive. Even he, the most balanced of drivers, had . the odd moment of friction with Rubens Barrichello’s side of the garage . in his championship year of 2009. History: It was Hamilton's 100th points finish in his F1 career . Tight: Fernando Alonso had to be on guard in his Ferrari to hold off Force India's Nico Hulkenberg . Comfortable: Hamilton crosses the chequered flag . Down to you: Rosberg and Hamilton celebrate with Mercedes team engineer Andrew Shovlin . ‘It . matters who the individuals are,’ he said. ‘Nico and Lewis are close as . friends but one has won a world championship and the other hasn’t, so . that might change things a bit between them. Looking at what Lewis did . today is going to hurt (Rosberg) a little bit. He was super-fast.’ In other news, Vettel’s third place was a tribute to Red Bull’s infinite resource and sagacity. It . was impossible, though, not to feel some sympathy for Vettel’s . team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. After being disqualified for an alleged . fuel-pressure irregularity in Australia, he suffered a broken front wing . after being released unsafely from the pit box. That cost him a 10sec . stop-go penalty. He retired from the race and will still get a 10-place . grid penalty under the new harsh regulations. Fernando . Alonso was fourth, showing that Ferrari could yet enter the fray as . serious title  contenders when the European season starts in May. As . for Hamilton, the victor in the first Mercedes one-two since 1955, he . said: ‘I’ve already made notes now and will go away the next  couple of . days. There’s more to come.’ Stand by. Mistake: Daniel Ricciardo was forced to retire after an early release from the pit-stop, followed by wing damage .

"Former Ireland rugby star Keith Wood talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life. Who is your sporting hero? Muhammad Ali. He was one of the first sportsmen I ever watched on television as a six-year-old in a big fight. What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman? If I was a kid today, I’d want to be an architect but I went into banking when I left school and worked as a banker until the game went professional. Keith Wood said he would have liked to have been a golfer and greatly admired Seve Ballesteros . Which other sportsman would you like to be? I am envious of so many sportsmen with all the skills they bring to bear — but I would have loved to be a good golfer. Seve Ballesteros in his magic gloves. Career highlight? The Lions in 1997 when we beat the Springboks 2-1. ... and the worst moment? The European Cup final of 2000, when Munster lost to the Northampton Saints 9-8. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? My family. What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given? Never be ashamed of being proud of what you are good at. The former British and Irish Lions captain said his sporting hero was former boxer Muhammad Ali . Favourite karaoke song? Sunny Afternoon by The Kinks. Three most-listened to songs on your ipod? I have very catholic tastes — I listen to anything. It’s constant. Anything by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen or Beck. Last film you saw? The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Last book you read? Ed Smith’s What Sport Tells Us About Life. It was fantastic — absolutely incredible! Which three people would you invite to dinner and why? Spock because he is so logical, Muhammad Ali because he is a legend, and Nelson Mandela because he is an inspiration. Wood admitted to being a huge Star Trek fan and said he would like to have dinner with Dr Spock . Favourite pre-match meal? Chicken and pasta with a light mushroom sauce — how specific is that? Can you cook? Best dish? Yes I can. I will have a go at cooking anything but I do love a good Sunday roast. The meat has to be beef. Your favourite holiday destination? I love the west coast of County Clare where I am from. It is magic. For sun, I’m not really sure but I do love skiing, so Saint-Legier-La Chiesaz in Switzerland. I like travelling, I am incredibly organised and I have a routine. In a film of your life, who would you like to play you? Telly Savalas. What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought? My house, obviously. Tell us a secret... I am a big Star Trek fan — I am a total Trekkie. Wood breaks through a tackle by Wales scrum half Rob Howley while playing for Ireland back in 2001 .

"Luther Burrell breaks out into a broad grin when asked if he’d relish the prospect of playing alongside Manu Tuilagi in England’s midfield. ‘One hundred per cent,’ he replies unerringly. ‘If a defensive team was to come up against that, it would be quite daunting. He’s a freak isn’t he? To play alongside him would be awesome.’ Luther Burrell will start at No 12 for Northampton when they take on Leicester Tigers on Saturday . The Burrell and Tuilagi pairing was a heavyweight combination, in every sense, that Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team were seriously considering in the lead-up to the autumn before one snapped a bone in his hand playing for Northampton and the other injured his groin. Without their most muscular midfield pairing — which would tip the scales at a combined weight of 220 kilos or 34st 6lbs in old money — England were again forced to settle for a hotch-potch of combinations. They finished the series no closer to knowing their preferred midfield pairing than when they began. Burrell knows a run of performances between now and the end of January would put him at the front of the queue to face Wales in Cardiff on February 6. A relative lightweight in comparison to Tuilagi at a mere 108 kg, the Huddersfield-born star is fit and raring to go again following a frustrating few weeks. He starts on Saturday at inside centre for Saints against bitter east Midlands rivals Leicester at Franklin’s Gardens. And Burrell has said he hopes to line up next to Manu Tuilagi (pictured) for England in the near future . ‘I’m feeling fresh after a spell on the bench on the weekend,’ he said. ‘But this is the fixture that you look out for. It’s the one you look forward to at the start of the season. ‘The reason I joined this club was to be involved in this sort of thing. It’s as close to an international game as you’re going to get. ‘It was a six-week injury but I was back within three weeks which was positive. I’m back on the mend and looking forward to a big performance.’ Sadly for the sell-out crowd, Leicester’s Tuilagi remains sidelined, although his return is thought to be imminent. But even without the powerhouse Samoan-born centre there is no question of Saturday's encounter fitting into anything other than the blood-and-thunder category. England flanker Tom Croft and hooker Tom Youngs return to bolster a rejuvenated Leicester pack that also includes Geoff Parling and Dan Cole. The Tigers’ horrendous injury jinx appears to have finally abated. Burrell breaks through the Treviso defence during their European Champions Cup match . For Burrell, the need to put a consistent run of performances together to remind England’s management why they made him an ever-present in their midfield alongside Brad Barritt during last year’s Six Nations is paramount. At just 91kg (14st 4lbs), Burrell’s opposite man Anthony Allen will concede more than two stone in weight on Saturday. His relative lack of bulk is the prime reason the 28-year-old Tiger has failed to add to the two caps he won eight years ago under Andy Robinson. Last Friday night, Bath fielded a back line containing rugby league convert Sam Burgess (18st 4lbs) at 12 and Matt Banahan (17st 7lbs) on the wing. Like it or not, it’s the reality of modern rugby, and Burrell is up for the challenge. ‘The game has really moved on now and you have got some brilliant athletes now,’ he said. ‘People are getting stronger, bigger, faster. The competition is healthy. I need to stick in the gym and keep working on that because the last thing I want to do is fall behind them.’ But the 27-year-old, who wears No 12 for Saints on Saturday but has shown he’s just as comfortable at 13, is eager is point out that size isn’t everything when it comes to his own game. Burrell has said World Cup rival Sam Burgess is 'more suited to the back row' ‘I think initially I was pigeon-holed as a basher,’ he said. ‘Actually there’s more subtlety to my game. I can kick on the front foot, I can pass a ball on both sides. People are starting to pick up on that. I do have a point-of- difference and I have to use that. Size, getting over the gain line. But when the composure is needed in terms of getting to the line and throwing the right pass at the right time … it’s something I really have worked on. ‘It’s something the England bosses are picking up on.’ Of all his World Cup rivals, Burgess is dominating the column inches. ‘I think he’s more suited to the back row,’ Burrell says with a smile. But whoever he’s paired with, and wherever he’s picked, Burrell insists he just wants to play. ‘If they picked me at hooker I’d say “yes”. All I can do is play well for Saints. This is a pretty good stage to start.’ Take a bow Luther. It’s play time.","Luther Burrell  would love to play alongside Manu Tuilagi for England .

"Two moments of ‘magic’ from Danny Cipriani lifted Sale into the Premiership top four on Friday night. Cipriani, watched by England coach Stuart Lancaster, struck in the 50th minute by making a try for wing Mark Cueto and followed up by scoring one himself nine minutes later. Sale’s head coach Steve Diamond described Cipriani’s play as ‘magic’ and insisted the playmaker would sign a new deal despite mounting speculation over interest from rival Premiership clubs led by Harlequins. Danny Cipriani scores a try for Sale Sharks in their Aviva Premiership win over high-flying Exeter . Diamond added: ‘Danny wants to stay in Manchester. We will get round to having a chat in the next week or two and, hopefully, get it nailed.’ Cipriani sustained a leg injury in scoring his try and missed the last 20 minutes when a late try from Exeter’s No 8 Thomas Waldrom earned a losing bonus point. Diamond also praised the pressure of his pack which helped Sale dominate the first half to earn a 6-3 lead through two penalties from Cipriani to one by Gareth Steenson. Sale's fly half scores a penalty during the first half of their 18-11 Premiership victory . ‘Danny produced two moments of magic as he does, but that was more down to the pressure of the forwards,’ Diamond commented. Exeter’s head coach Rob Baxter had no complaints. ‘We were physically and mentally not quite there,’ he admitted. Baxter watched his team, who had put together an unbeaten run of eight games, make a slow start which brought sin bins for forwards Damien Welch and Ben White. Mark Cueto scored Sale's first try in the 50th minute at the AJ Bell Stadium .","Sale Sharks beat high-flying Exeter to go fourth in the Aviva Premiership .

"Charley Hull has become the youngest winner of the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit - just 12 months after being named Rookie of the Year. The 18-year-old from Kettering sealed the award after finishing joint fifth at the Dubai Ladies Masters on Saturday, a final-day 72 leaving her on 10 under for the tournament. Charley Hull was the season's top earner on Ladies European Tour with £208,500 . That took Hull’s season’s earnings to 263,096.69 euros (£208,500) and left her 29,808 euros (£23,633) clear of second-placed Frenchwoman Gwladys Nocera, who was tied for 11th in Dubai. Hull, who won her first professional title at the Lalla Meryem Cup in March and recorded nine top-10 finishes in 2014, said: “It’s good to win. I didn’t really know coming into this week.” She added on the BBC Sport website: “I’m happy. Gwladys is a good player. Just on the back nine today, I thought, ‘don’t make any silly mistakes.’ I double bogeyed the first, but got two birdies on the bounce back, so pretty happy with myself there.” Hull claimed her first professional title at the Lalla Meryem Cup in March . Hull last year became the youngest player ever to compete in the Solheim Cup . China’s Shanshan Feng was the runaway winner of the Dubai Ladies Masters after a closing round of 70 left her on 19 under, with Spaniard Carlota Ciganda five shots behind in second.

Created by Oregon-based OnTheGo Platforms, the system uses a mobile gesture recognition technology known as Ari. ‘It’s kind of like the Xbox Kinect but for a smartphone and with no added hardware,’ Ryan Fink, chief executive of OnTheGo, told MailOnline. ‘The phone has to be in landscape mode, then, you put your hand over the phone at least a foot to almost three feet away. ‘If you want to play or pause a song, you can put an open hand in front of the phone. Waving skips the song, while a wave in the other direction will take you to the previous track. Once the user downloads BrainWave, all of their compatible music apps - including Pandora, iHeart, Spotify, Beats, Google Play - are automatically added to the apps list (left). When a user selects their preferred music player, BrainWave will automatically run in the background, working even if the screen is switched off (right) • Gestures are recognised 1-3ft (30-90cm) away from the phone . • It uses the front-facing camera on an Android smartphone or tablet . • The app automatically adds compatible music players . • Open hand gesture means 'play' or 'pause' • A swipe right moves you onto the next song . • A swipe left takes you to the previous song . • The app works when screen is locked and off . • It is currently compatible with Pandora, iHeart Radio, iHeart Auto and Spotify . Once the user downloads BrainWave, all of their compatible music apps - including Pandora, iHeart, Spotify, Beats, Google Play - are automatically added to the apps list. This then allows the third party apps to be controlled with gesture recognition using the camera on the front of the Android device. When a user selects their preferred music player, BrainWave will automatically run in the background, working even if the screen is switched off. ‘[Its accuracy] is pretty dead on,’ said Mr Fink. ‘It should work almost every single time.'In the near future, Brainwave’s creators are hoping to add gesture control that will adjust volume and like/dislike songs. A car mode is also in development so that the app will automatically turn on when a user is driving. The app is currently free on Google Play, and is only compatible with an Android device. An iOS version will be available in the near future. ‘[Its accuracy] is pretty dead on,’ creator Robert Fink told MailOnline. ‘It should work almost every single time' The app is currently free on Google Play, and is only compatible with an Android device.

"Dual Champion Flat jockey Jamie Spencer performed one of the most expected U-turns in the world of sport when he scrapped plans to retire. The 34-year-old’s unplaced effort on Trade Storm in the Hong Kong Mile had meant to be one of the Irish rider’s last race rides. But he will now continue to compete as a freelance during 2015. Jamie Spencer (left) confirmed he would not be retiring after riding Trade Storm at the Hong Kong Mile . Spencer will compete as a freelance after leaving Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s (centre) Qatar Racing . Spencer surprisingly announced his retirement in August 24 hours before it was confirmed that Andrea Atzeni was to replace him as No 1 jockey to Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s Qatar Racing organisation. The decision was accompanied with plans that Spencer was to become one of the Sheik’s management team. But, after initial strenuous denials, Spencer was later to confirm that there had been no elaborate plan and that his initial decision to walk away from riding had been prompted by the hurt and humiliation this complex character felt after being informed he was going to be sacked. Spencer is looking forward to being 'entirely free' Some bookmakers priced up a market that Spencer, who won the 1998 Irish 1,000 Guineas on Tarascon when only 17, would return but some, like Corals, felt the odds would be so short on him changing his mind, it was not worth the ink. The same firm now make his Breeders’ Cup Classic mount Toast Of New York 5-1 to win the Dubai World Cup in March, a ride which alone must have effected Spencer’s plans. In a pre-prepared statement, Spencer said: ‘I have discussed at length with Sheik Fahad my decision to carry on riding and he fully understands and supports me. ‘He appreciates racing is what made me happy and the last thing he wants to do is stand in the way of that. ‘I will be riding primarily as a freelance but obviously I have certain links and relationships with trainers that I will be utilising. ‘I am also looking forward to being entirely free for the first time in six seasons and developing new associations. ‘I have no specific target other than to continue to be successful.’ Spencer, who was 2004 champion jockey in Ireland during his one season as stable jockey to Aidan O’Brien, was still riding on the British All-Weather circuit last week, At the time, it hardly seemed the actions of a jockey happy to walk away from the sport. Now we know why.","Jamie Spencer has scrapped plans to retire after riding in Hong Kong mile .

"A grieving Russian mother who was told her premature baby son had died shortly after being born has spoken of her joy after she was reunited with him alive and well five years later. Vera Fomina, 48, from Mohirevo near the city of Sverdlovsk, gave birth to a baby boy a month and a half early, with doctors telling her his chances of survival were incredibly slim. The child was rushed away for emergency treatment but two days later she and her then husband were given the devastating news that the boy had died. The truth, however, was that their newborn son was still alive but had been mysteriously sent off to an orphanage for abandoned children, where the child lived for five years until a human rights activist researching his background worked out what happened and reunited him with his mother. Mystery: Grieving Russian mother Vera Fomina (right) - who was told her premature baby son Vova Lipin (left) had died shortly being born - has spoken of her shock at discovering he was alive and well five years later . Shock: Despite his parents being told he was dead, Vova Lipin (pictured) had been mysteriously sent off to an orphanage for abandoned and ill children, where he lived for five years . While seven and a half months pregnant in 2003, Ms Formina was rushed to hospital where she gave birth to her son Vova Lipin prematurely. Describing the ordeal, she said: 'Vova was very weak and the doctors said his chances of living were very slim. They took him away for treatment and I never saw him again. 'A few days later they told me had died... I was absolutely devastated and never really recovered,' she added. In reality the boy survived and doctors had mysteriously decided to send him to an orphanage for abandoned and ill children. Their reason for doing so has never been made clear. Vova is now 11-years-old and has been reunited with his mother since he was six - but she has only now decided to tell her story to the media to try and get to the bottom of what went wrong. Strange: It remains unclear why Vova (pictured right with a man dressed as Santa Claus) was declared dead and sent to an orphanage but a spokesman for the hospital said: 'We are looking into why this happened' Reunited: Describing the ordeal, Ms Formina (pictured right with her son) said: 'Vova was very weak and the doctors said his chances of living were very slim. They took him away for treatment and I never saw him again' For years after his birth Ms Formina lived a single life and vowed never to have children again. 'After my ex-husband and I were told about Vova our lives fell apart. He went into depression and the marriage split up,' she said. 'I decided to never marry or have another child again as the pain caused already was too great for me to bear,' she added. But then, out of nowhere, Ms Formina got a phone call that would change her life. Human rights activist Boris Evseyev, 35, was watching a television programme about the orphanage  in which Vova lived and became intrigued by his story. 'There was something about the way he talked that made me interested. He was articulate and intelligent and I decided to look into his background,' Mr Evseyev said. When he did, he found to his shock that Vova had been declared dead shortly after his birth. 'That's when I became really interested and decided to find his birth mother, which didn't take long as she was named on his hospital certificates and she still lives in the same place.' Celebration: Human rights activist Boris Evseyev, 35, was watching a television programme about the orphanage in which Vova (right) lived and became intrigued by his story . Within days a reunion had been organised, with Ms Formina saying she 'nearly died from shock' upon being told her son was still alive. 'When we met we both cried for hours,' she said. 'I could never have dreamed that such a miracle would happen. 'I have been told that he is suffering from tetra paresis but it doesn't matter. He is alive and we are back together. We shall never be separated again.' It remains unclear why Vova was declared dead and then ended up at the orphanage but a spokesman for the hospital said: 'We are looking into why this happened.' Vova has now been happily living with his mother for the past six years.","Vera Fomina gave birth to a baby boy a month and a half early in 2003 .

"The man who faces champion Michael van Gerwen in the first round of the PDC World Championship on Thursday night knows a thing or two about bringing down giants of darts. Joe Cullen was just 21 when he stunned Phil Taylor at a tournament in Killarney and recalls: ‘It was a weird game. I didn’t really feel nervous. All of a sudden there were loads of people round the board. I realised I had three darts to beat him. He didn’t get a shot to win. 'There was a big cheer, the room was more pleased than I was. Phil was gracious, as he always is. But the next time I played him it was my first Pro Tour final and he murdered me, 6-1.

Taylor (left) and Van Gerwen (right) are the two favourites for the title at Alexandra Palace . Van Gerwen won his first world title last year (right) and will be looking to retain his crown . Now 25, Cullen has been taking the game seriously for a shorter time than Van Gerwen, only quitting his job as a Royal Mail postman four years ago. He has an uncanny ability when it comes to impersonating rivals. A YouTube clip shows his mimicry of Taylor is as precise as his darts. ‘I can do a few,’ he says. ‘It’s just a laugh!’ He is aware tonight will be tough but is keen to progress beyond the first round for the first time at the fifth attempt. Playing in front of his boy Travis, six, for the first time, he believes he can cause another shock. ‘There is pressure from myself but no one expects me to win,’ he says. ‘But if I play well I’ve got a great chance. I’m definitely going to get chances, taking them is a different thing.’ Sky Sports Darts will show the William Hill World Darts Championship exclusively live — starting today from 7pm.

"Jose Fonte is determined to prove Southampton are a match for the Premier League's best after securing a 'massive' victory against Everton. Saints' astonishing start to the campaign recently came to a shuddering halt, with the embarrassing midweek Capital One Cup exit to third-tier Sheffield United making it five successive defeats in all competitions. It would not have been a surprise if the club's worst losing streak of the 21st century had continued on Saturday given the string of injuries and suspensions they had to contend with against Everton. Jose Fonte  celebrates as his attempt at goal was deflected in by Romelu Lukaku . However, Ronald Koeman's side rallied impressively and ran out comprehensive 3-0 winners at St Mary's, where efforts from Graziano Pelle and Maya Yoshida added to Romelu Lukaku's first-half own goal. 'It's massive after the results that we've been having,' Saints captain Fonte said. 'Not so much the performances, because I thought that we deserved more in a couple of games, but the fact is we had zero points in four games. 'So, to have a performance like we had, and get the clean sheet - three points, three goals - just puts us on the right track to go on a good run again.' Fonte congratulates Graziano Pelle as Southampton returned to winning was against Everton . The win had extra importance as it was Southampton's first point, never mind all three, against a team that finished above them last season. Defeats to Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United fed those suggesting that Saints could not cut it against the top teams and were only flying high due to a kind fixture schedule. The win against Everton, who finished fifth last term, is therefore an important marker, especially with home matches against Chelsea and Arsenal following the Boxing Day trip to Crystal Palace. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman saw his side return to winning ways after five defeats in a row . 'They are great games, again,' Fonte, suspended for the trip to old haunt Selhurst Park, said. 'Once and for all I think we have to prove we can compete against these big teams . 'We'll prepare ourselves first for Crystal Palace - that's the most important - and then we'll think about the others, but we want to prove we're at the same level.' Saints certainly looked back to their early-season form against Everton, who welcome Stoke to Goodison Park on Boxing Day - a match in which Steven Naismith knows the players need to make amends. 'Fortunately for us the games are going to come thick and fast now,' he told evertontv. 'We've got the chance to rectify it in less than a week which is good. 'Then after that we have two more games in the space of a week so we will definitely be ready for Crystal Palace on Boxing Day where hopefully we can change the result from Saturday and push on.'","Southampton beat Everton 3-0 at St Mary's after give defeats in a row .

"Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev was damned as an unreliable witness by an SFA Judicial Panel on Tuesday after they threw out his appeal against a seven-match ban for racial abuse. A Judicial Panel Appellate Tribunal chaired by senior judge Lord Bonomy found the Bulgarian guilty of calling Aberdeen defender Shay Logan a ‘black c***’ and ruled there was no reason to overturn the initial verdict. Although Celtic insist they will stand by Tonev and press for changes to a disciplinary system that relies on the balance of probabilities, the Written Reasons behind both judgements - published on the recommendation of Lord Bonomy - left Tonev’s reputation badly damaged. Aleksandar Tonev (near) was deemed an unreliable witness by the SFA Judicial Panel . The Celtic winger lost his appeal against a seven-match ban for racial abuse . The 24-year-old, who refused the offer of a translator during both hearings, was found to have delivered an ‘inherently improbable account’ of the verbal exchange he had with Logan during the Celtic-Aberdeen game in Glasgow on September 13. And the official report declared: ‘On the central issue in the case we were unable to accept him as either credible or reliable. ‘We found on the balance of probabilities that Mr Tonev did say to Mr Logan “Don’t touch me you black c***”.’ Celtic’s counsel argued that Logan could have misheard Tonev, something the English defender denied ‘one thousand per cent’ – and also insisted that the burden of proof should be higher for such a serious accusation. Tonev is alleged to have called Aberdeen defender Shay Logan (pictured) a 'black c***' Celtic have insisted they will stand by Tonev who does protest his innocence . Celtic’s response also attacked a system that as, Tonev’s lawyer described it, pits ‘one player’s word against the other’. A club statement declared: ‘Celtic Football Club is extremely disappointed by the outcome of the Scottish FA’s Appeal Tribunal. ‘We do not consider that any player should be found guilty of such a grave offence on the basis of the evidence presented in this case. Celtic Football Club will be approaching the Scottish FA to seek to address this issue. ‘We would like to make it clear that at no stage was it ever suggested that Shay Logan had made any false allegations. However, Aleksandar Tonev’s position consistently has been that he did not say the words that were alleged to have been said and that he is not a racist. Celtic's counsel argued that Logan could have misheard Tonev, something that the Aberdeen man denies . Winger Tonev is currently on loan from Premier League side Aston Villa . ‘Celtic Football Club has enjoyed an excellent relationship with Aberdeen Football Club and this, of course, will continue. ‘As we have said many times before, racism has no place in football and as a Club which has been open to all ever since its formation in 1888, Celtic abhors racism of any kind. Clearly, Aleksandar continues to have our full support.’ Celtic also have the option, if they wish, of taking the Tonev case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The on-loan Aston Villa winger’s ban will begin immediately, although he has already served one match of the suspension, meaning he will be back in time for Ross County away on January 24.

"American sprinter Tyson Gay's former coach has been suspended for eight years for doping violations, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said on Wednesday. An independent arbitration panel found that Jon Drummond possessed, trafficked, and administered banned performance enhancing substances to an athlete under his care as a coach, USADA said on its website. Tyson Gay's former coach Jon Drummond has been suspended for eight years for doping violations . Jon Drummond, who won Olympic gold as part of the US' 4x100m relay team in 2000, faces an eight-year ban . The former US Olympian and Olympic coach was Gay's coach when the former world champion tested positive in 2013 for a banned substance, according to the arbitration panel decision. Gay was suspended for one year in May, returned the silver medal he won with the U.S. 4x100 metres relay team at the London Olympics and was disqualified from all races he contested from July 2012.
