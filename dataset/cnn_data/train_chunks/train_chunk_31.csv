"(CNN) -- Mourners gathered Saturday to remember two California firefighters who died last month battling the largest fire in the history of Los Angeles County. Capt. Ted Hall and firefighter Specialist Arnie Quinones died while seeking an escape route for their crew. ""We were all blessed by these two men, and we will continue to be blessed by their example and their spirit. Their deeds and their names live on,"" Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger told the crowd at Dodger Stadium. ""Ted Hall and Arnie Quinones, you are giants in my eyes and in the eyes of all Californians."" Hall, a captain, and Quinones, a firefighter specialist, were killed on August 30 when their vehicle slid down a steep embankment in Angeles National Forest. Schwarzenegger said the two men were searching for an escape route for their crew, which included 55 inmates. The governor said Hall and Quinones had sheltered the crew in a cinder block dining hall. ""Everyone reached safety, except Ted and Arnie,"" he said. ""We are humbled by their courage."" Firefighters are still fighting the blaze, which is 84 percent contained. Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Frank Garrido said officials expected 15,000 uniformed firefighters and, including members of the public, as many as 40,000 people, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. No official attendance figures were immediately available . ""Ted, trusty veteran, widely respected, hardcore firefighter; he was immersed in the fire service,"" said Dave Gillotte, of Los Angeles County Fire Fighters, Local 1014. ""Arnie, he knew no strangers,"" Gillotte said. ""What a smile, what a family."" Vice President Joe Biden also spoke at the memorial, saying there was ""very little that we can do today that is going to bring genuine solace to the empty void that the families are feeling."" Hall is survived by his wife, Katherine, and two sons, Randall, 21, and Steven, 20, as well as his parents. Quinones is survived by his wife, Loressa -- who is expecting the couple's first child within the next several weeks -- his mother, his brother and numerous nieces and nephews, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Biden said the men's wives ""knew every time their husbands walked out the door to report for duty, they knew every time that it was a risk. ... but they supported their husbands' doing that job they loved."" He added, ""It's above and beyond the call of duty when two fathers seeking to save a building full of people leave their own families behind, that's real courage. ""The only thing we can do for certain, is to promise and keep the promise, we will give the Teds and the Arnies all the support they need, the equipment they need, the capacity they need, for we owe you.""","Capt.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A campaigner for a British grandmother on death row in Texas made a unique plea for her life Thursday -- from atop a plinth in London's Trafalgar Square. Brian Capaloff uses his slot on the plinth in Trafalgar Square to campaign for clemency for Linda Carty. Linda Carty, 51, recorded her message this week from the prison in Gatesville, where she is serving her sentence, as part of an effort to win clemency. Campaigners say Carty's trial was ""catastrophically flawed"" and that her court-appointed lawyer failed to take steps that could have at least spared her the death penalty. An appeal is pending in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ""I'm sorry if I sound like a desperate woman,"" she said on the tape. ""I am desperate. The British people may be my last hope."" A Scottish man who has taken an interest in Carty's case played her seven-minute recording over and over for an hour while standing atop one of Trafalgar Square's large statue bases, or plinths. He held up placards with messages from Carty and stood in front of a life-size cardboard cutout of her. Do you think the campaign will have any effect? Send us your comments . ""Please listen and tell everyone you know,"" Carty said in her message. ""Please don't let me die here."" A contest currently under way in London allows members of the public to win an hour atop the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square. Winners can do anything during their hour that they like -- perform, demonstrate, speak, or simply be silent. Brian Capaloff, 46, who works for a local government homelessness service in Scotland, won a slot but couldn't think of what he would do during his hour. He said he asked Reprieve, a British charity that he supports, whether he could do anything for them, and they suggested he focus on Carty's case. ""I thought that was the most important thing of all -- to stop someone who is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, who I believe is innocent, of being executed,"" Capaloff told CNN. It's ""just an unbelievable injustice."" He said he hoped his demonstration would lead people to inquire about the case and ask their members of Parliament to do the same. ""Linda Carty's speech to Trafalgar Square shows that she is a terrified woman, and with good reason,"" said Clive Stafford Smith, director of Reprieve. ""Texas plans to kill her by lethal injection, which is a painful and lonely death."" He added: ""The British government must do everything in its power to prevent Linda's death."" The British Foreign Office has filed two amicus briefs in Carty's case complaining that Britain was not notified of her original arrest, said a Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to be named in line with policy. The first was in 2006 with a U.S. district court in Texas and the second was in May of this year with the federal appeals court. The Foreign Office is also in close touch with Carty and her legal representatives, the spokesman said. ""We're continuing to provide her with consular assistance,"" he said. ""We've also made the U.S. aware of our stance (against) the death penalty."" Carty was convicted of taking part in the May 2001 murder of Joana Rodriguez, a 25-year-old Texas woman, Reprieve said. Rodriguez and her 4-day-old son were abducted by men demanding drugs and cash; she later suffocated while her son survived. Prosecutors said Carty had hired the men to kidnap Rodriguez so she could steal her baby because, even though Carty had given birth to children in the past, she was no longer able to get pregnant, Reprieve said. Carty, who asserts her innocence, was sentenced to death in February 2002. Reprieve said Carty's court-appointed lawyer was incompetent. The lawyer failed to meet Carty until immediately before the trial, failed to spot flaws and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, failed to interview witnesses and did not look at key mitigating evidence, Reprieve said. ""My lawyer told me he was too busy to work on my case,"" Carty said in her recording. Carty was born on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts to Anguillan parents and holds a British passport, Reprieve said. She worked as a primary school teacher in St. Kitts, a former British colony, until she was 23 and later moved to Texas. ""After her conviction, investigators from Reprieve visited St. Kitts and learned that Linda was still remembered as a passionate teacher who frequently held extra classes for children with special needs. She also taught at Sunday school, sang in a national youth choir and led a volunteer social-work group,"" Reprieve said. ""This information would have enabled (her lawyer) to present her to the jurors as a dedicated teacher and community leader -- factors that might well have induced them to vote to spare her life."" Carty worked as a confidential informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency during the 1980s, befriending suspected traffickers to get information and sometimes to make test purchases of drugs, Reprieve said. Carty believes that she was framed because of her work with the agency, Reprieve said. Lawyers for Carty have lodged an appeal with the appeals court court in New Orleans, Louisiana, Reprieve said. If the court rejects her appeal, an execution date will be set, the charity said. Capaloff said he had a lump in his throat when he arrived at Trafalgar Square for his demonstration. ""This is about someone's life and there's nothing more important than that,"" he told CNN. ""It is an emotional thing."" Only three of Trafalgar Square's four plinths have statues on top. The fourth plinth never had a statue and has stood empty for years, with specially commissioned artworks occasionally being featured on top. This year, sculptor Antony Gormley came up with the idea to have people stand atop the plinth as a sort of living monument. Thousands applied for the chance to occupy the plinth. The project runs 24 hours a day. It began in July and is set to end in October.","Campaigner for Briton on death row in Texas pleads for her life in London .

"(CNN) -- The Guatemalan army stole at least 333 children and sold them for adoption in other countries during the Central American nation's 36-year civil war, a government report has concluded. Around 45,000 people are believed to have disappeared during Guatemala's civil war, 5,000 of them children. Many of those children ended up in the United States, as well as Sweden, Italy and France, said the report's author and lead investigator, Marco Tulio Alvarez. In some cases, the report said, parents were killed so the children could be taken and given to government-operated agencies to be adopted abroad. In other instances, the children were abducted without physical harm to the parents. ""This was a great abuse by the state,"" Alvarez told CNN on Friday. Investigators started examining records in May 2008 for a period that spanned from 1977-89, said Alvarez, the director of the Guatemalan Peace Archive, a commission established by President Alvaro Colom. Of 672 records investigators looked at, Alvarez said, they determined that 333 children had been stolen. The children were taken for financial and political reasons, he said. Alvarez acknowledges that many more children possibly were taken. Investigators zeroed in on the 1977-89 period because peak adoptions occurred during that time frame, particularly in 1986. They will investigate through 1995 and hope to have another report ready by early next year, he said. A presidential ministry has determined that about 45,000 people disappeared during the nation's civil war, which lasted from 1960 to 1996. About 5,000 of those were children, the ministry said. Another 200,000 people died in the conflict between the leftist guerrillas and right-wing governments. The nation's public ministry and attorney general's office will determine whether anyone is prosecuted over the abductions, Alvarez said. Asked if he would like to see prosecutions, Alvarez answered, ""I hope so."" Alvarez said he has attended several reunions of abducted children -- now adults -- and family members. ""I can't tell you how happy that makes me,"" he said. Adoption has served as a source of income in Guatemala for decades. The war just made it easier for abuses at the hands of soldiers to occur. Guatemala has the world's highest per capita rate of adoption and is one of the leading providers of adoptive children for the United States. Nearly one in 100 babies born in Guatemala end up with adoptive parents in the United States, according to the U.S. consulate in Guatemala. Adoptions can cost up to $30,000, providing a large financial incentive in a country where the World Bank says about 75 percent of the people live below the poverty level. Officials fear that often times mothers are paid -- or coerced -- into giving up their children. Some unscrupulous lawyers and notaries, who have greater power in Guatemala than they do in the United States, have taken advantage of the extreme poverty and limited government oversight over adoptions to enrich themselves. Alvarez said corrupt lawyers and notaries were the driving force behind many of the army abductions of children. The problem is confounded because many Guatemalan parents can't provide for their children. The United Nations' World Food Programme says Guatemala has the fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean. Chronic undernutrition affects about half of the nation's children under the age of 5, the U.N. agency said. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom Caballeros declared a state of national calamity this week because so many citizens do not have food or proper nutrition. Despite the nation's problems, Alvarez hopes some good will come of the report, which was released Thursday. ""We have to tell the truth about what happened,"" he said. ""Guatemalan society must know what happened and must never allow it to happen again."" CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report .","Children stolen for adoption in the U.S., Sweden, Italy and France, report says .

"PADUCAH, Kentucky (CNN) -- He arrives in the early morning hours, when the downtown streets here are empty and quiet. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl. An electric gate jerks to life as the black sedan with tinted windows pulls into a parking lot protected by an iron fence. It's five blocks from the local county jail to the U.S. Federal Courthouse of Western Kentucky. Not even a five-minute drive. This is the only freedom Steven Green knows. He's ushered from the car by a contingent of U.S. marshals. It's 30 feet out in the open air. A brief chance to look up at the clouds. A moment to hear sounds not reverberated against cell walls: a bird, a car engine, a breeze in nearby trees. He is a lanky 24-year-old. He looks lean, like he could grow a little more. Not really a man, but too old to be called a boy. Regardless, he is a convicted murderer, rapist, and conspirator. The orange prison coveralls make him look a bit taller. The jury never sees Green in the fluorescent jumpsuit. Inside the federal courthouse there is a change of clothes. Usually it's a button-down shirt and a pair of khakis. He keeps his cuffs buttoned. He looks nerdish, and you half expect him to start working on the courtroom computers. Not like a man who once asked FBI agents if they thought he was ""a monster."" Evidence comes in a steady display of pictures and videos that seem oddly connected. The snapshot of a smiling woman lying in a field of bluebonnets. The image of a dead Iraqi strapped to the hood of an Army Humvee. A high school yearbook photo of a Texas football team. The diagram of a brain cell. Video of a firefight shot from an insurgent perspective. The most unusual trial exhibit sits against the wall behind the prosecutor's table: a small architectural mock-up of a home. Roughly 18 by 18 inches, it is like no home in Kentucky. A flat-topped square with a raised rectangular structure at the top providing access to the roof. It is beige in color. The tiny windows have tiny bars. It is a 3-D map of a crime scene. Earlier this month, a jury found Green guilty of a raping a 14-year-old girl who lived in the home in Iraq, then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence. Green also was found guilty of killing the girl's parents and 6-year-old sister. There is a casual manner to Steven Green's daily entrance into the courtroom. It defies the circumstances of the moment and the imagination without proper context. This is the sentencing phase of his death penalty trial and he is the defendant. Testimony resumes Monday, with the expectation of closing arguments as early as Wednesday. Green faces life in prison without the possibility of parole, or death in prison. The testimony transports the court to unusual places: across Texas following Green's dysfunctional childhood, into the sense of structure and order of Army basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and back to the chaos of horrendous combat situations four years ago in Iraq's Triangle of Death. Green is a former member of the 101st Airborne Division, inserted into a very bad section of Iraq during some of the worst fighting of the war. His memories are of a place known as Yusufiya, 20 miles south of Baghdad. Jurors form a mental picture of his life then as former members of his unit, Bravo Company, take the stand. Amid the military lingo, the witnesses pause occasionally, struggling to convey the contempt, confusion, exhaustion, and death they knew. They speak of being shot, of killings, booby traps and sudden bloody dismemberments. This toxic emotional mix is what former Pfc. Green knew in 2005 and 2006 almost every day, along with the very real possibility of his own death. If the jury opts for its most extreme option -- the death penalty -- unlike his daily death watch in Iraq, at least Green will see that coming. When a friend or family member enters the courtroom, Green tries to make anxious eye contact. He whispers a lot to his attorneys. His hands stay around his face and his gaze on the table when the victims' family speak through an interpreter. The Al-Janabis' relatives do not speak of details of the crime. The questions come only from the prosecution, and the defense does not cross-examine. They speak of an orchard worker, Kassem, and his wife, Fakhriya. They speak of a simple family who did not own either their home or the furniture. They speak of a funny 6-year-old girl, Hadeel, being chased through the orchard trees by siblings. They speak of a 14-year-old girl, Abeer, with dreams of living in the city and wearing nice clothes. The jury never hears the words ""rape"" or ""murder"" come from the translation. It is a testimony about loss. The defendant sits rigid the entire time. The mention of other names comes frequently in court. Spc. James Barker: The jury knows him as the soldier who concocted a plan over a card game to target the Al-Janabi family -- a mission of gang-rape and murder. Sgt. Paul Cortez: The defense counsel describes him as senior non-commissioned officer, the one who approved the mission as long as he was the first to rape Abeer. Pfc. Jesse Spielman: His name is familiar as the fourth member of the squad to leave their traffic checkpoint on March 12, 2006, after donning disguises, and enter the Al-Janabi home. Pfc. Bryan Howard is the soldier left behind to guard their post. Each is out of the Army, sentenced to prison time by a military court for his part in the crime and the failed coverup. Green, the trigger man, is the odd man out. He sits before the jury, convicted in civil court for this war atrocity. His early release from the Army two months after the crime is a possible death sentence, while three of his accomplices face the possibility of parole from an Army prison in 2016. Green still sports a military haircut. Seated at the table alongside his defense team, he often leans over and speaks with Darren Wolff, a former Marine Corps captain turned Kentucky defense lawyer. There are letters on file in the court docket from Wolff petitioning Defense Secretary Robert Gates to re-enlist Green in the Army, so the former private could face trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It is not unheard of in this war. Wolff points out in conversation that the Pentagon re-activated two former Marines after word surfaced of an alleged murder in Falluja in 2004. He says Green should face a jury of his military peers. The fact that has not happened, and the former Army private sits in the U.S. District Court of Western Kentucky tried under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act for crimes committed in Iraq, may be a point of appeal. At the end of the day, Green exits the courtroom, climbs back into his prison garb and is shackled. There's another short walk to the car, then a five-block return drive to take in the world. He returns to solitary confinement. This is his human interaction for the day.","Steven Green was convicted of murder, rape in deaths of girl and her family in Iraq .

"HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- The president of The Valley Swim Club on Friday strongly denied charges of racism after his club canceled the swimming privileges of a nearby day care center whose children are predominantly African-American. John Duesler said he underestimated the number of swimmers who would come to swim at the club. ""It was never our intention to offend anyone,"" said John Duesler. ""This thing has been blown out of proportion."" Duesler said his club -- which he called ""very diverse"" -- invited camps in the Philadelphia area to use his facility because of the number of pools in the region closed due to budget cuts this summer. He said he underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club's capacity to take on the groups was not up to the task. ""It was a safety issue,"" he said. The Creative Steps Day Care children -- who are in kindergarten through seventh grade -- went to The Valley Swim Club in Huntingdon Valley on June 29 after the center's director, Alethea Wright, had contracted to use the club once a week. During their first visit, some children said they heard club members asking why African-American children were there. One youngster told a Philadelphia television station a woman there said she feared the children ""might do something"" to her child.  Watch Wright react to comments allegedly aimed at the children » . Days later, the day care center's $1,950 check was returned without explanation, Wright said. She was dismissive of Duesler's comments Friday. ""He knows what happened at the pool that day,"" Wright told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I was embarrassed and humiliated."" She called it an ""unfortunate situation,"" adding, ""I know what happened; the members know what happened and a higher power knows what happened.""  Watch the club president say racism is not at play » . After news reports of the incident, the office of Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pennsylvania) said Specter sent a letter to the club president asking him to reinstate the contract with Creative Steps, saying, ""I think that you would agree that there is no place for racism in America today."" Duesler said he appreciates the senator's concern, but the club's board has yet to make a decision of how it will proceed. ""If we're going to revise our policies here, we need to make it so for all the camps,"" he said. ""I just don't think we're prepared for that."" Duesler earlier in the week told two Philadelphia television stations the children had changed ""the complexion"" and ""atmosphere"" of the club, a comment that protesters outside the facility Thursday said showed that racism was involved. Bernice Duesler, John Duesler's wife, called the negative response her husband has faced since the incident ""unbearable."" ""He's not one of the good guys -- he's one of the great guys,"" she said, holding back tears. ""He doesn't deserve this."" She added, ""If there really was a racial issue that happened, my husband and I would be the first one[s] picketing."" Jim Flynn, who said he was one of the club members who made a complaint against the children, told CNN this week it was not racially motivated. ""There were a lot of children in the pool and not enough lifeguards,"" he said. ""As general members we were not told that they were coming. If we knew, we could decide to not come when the pool was crowded or come anyway. We could have had an option."" He also said invitations to two other day care centers, neither of which contained minority children, had previously been withdrawn. Girard College, a private Philadelphia boarding school, told CNN on Thursday it would offer Creative Steps Day Care use of its facilities this summer.","Swim club president John Duesler: ""It was never our intention to offend anyone""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court delayed a decision on whether to accept an appeal from a Georgia death row inmate who has gained international support for his claims of innocence in the the murder of a Savannah police officer two decades ago. Troy Davis' case has earned the support of leaders including the pope and former President Jimmy Carter. The justices were scheduled to announce Monday whether they would take the case of Troy Davis, but no order was released. The court is expected to take up the matter again in September. Last fall, the Supreme Court granted Davis a stay of execution two hours before he was to be put to death. A month later, the justices reversed course and allowed the capital punishment to proceed, but a federal appeals court issued another stay. The high court's latest delay means Davis will continue to sit on death row.  Watch a report on Davis' long fight » . His supporters Monday delivered about 60,000 signatures in petitions to Chatham County, Georgia, District Attorney Larry Chisolm, calling for a new trial. ""This delay is an indication that the Supreme Court is concerned by the gravity of Troy Davis' innocence claims,"" said Laura Moye, director of Amnesty International USA's Death Penalty Abolition Campaign. ""We will continue to call on all authorities, including the Supreme Court, to finally hear the evidence that has motivated hundreds of thousands of people worldwide to raise their voices and demand justice."" Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail. Witnesses claimed Davis, then 19, and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King restaurant parking lot when the off-duty officer arrived to help the man. Witnesses testified at trial that Davis then shot MacPhail twice and fled. But since his 1991 conviction, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony. No physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of the police officer. The Georgia Pardons and Parole Board last year held closed-door hearings and reinterviewed Davis and the witnesses. The panel decided against clemency. MacPhail's mother, Annaliese, told CNN at the time, ""This is what we were hoping for, and I hope pretty soon that we will have some peace and start our life, especially my grandchildren -- my grandson and granddaughter. It has overshadowed their lives."" After the justices in October refused to grant a stay of execution, Davis' sister, Martina Correia, told CNN she was ""disgusted"" by the decision. ""It doesn't make any sense,"" she said. ""We are praying for a miracle or some kind of intervention. We will regroup and fight. We will never stop fighting. We just can't be discouraged. The fight is not over 'til it's over."" Ten days after the high court refused last October to intervene, a federal appeals court in Georgia granted a temporary stay of execution. Since then, further appeals by Davis' legal team have dragged on for eight months. Prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group Indigo Girls have asked Georgia to grant Davis a new trial. Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town, South Africa; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr, Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis.","Supreme Court ends session without hearing Troy Davis' appeal .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- And now, the rejects. The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft . Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of ""Air Force One"" flying over New York -- a flight that caused panic on the streets below -- the U.S. Air Force on Friday released the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight. The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 -- a military version of a 747 -- making three passes by the Statue of Liberty, at one point accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet and at another point making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft. That latter move may have contributed to the chaos below. The photographs and several lengthy government e-mail chains were released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests by CNN and other news organizations. The e-mail chains show that the flight's government organizers were aware of many New Yorkers' fears of low-flying aircraft before the April 27 flight, and show a flurry of second-guessing, finger-pointing, damage control and occasional expressions of regret in the hours immediately after the flight.  Watch a compilation of still images of the flyover » . ""Thanks for the heads up on sensitivities in the New York area,"" an Air Force colonel wrote in an e-mail two days before the flight. ""This is an issue that PAG [the Presidential Airlift Group] has also been concerned with. As a result, their coordination has been substantial."" But while the White House, the military and numerous federal and local government agencies coordinated the flight, the federal government demanded secrecy, preparing a news release that was to be distributed only if there were media inquiries. Those inquiries came during the morning flight, triggering a quick chain of e-mails among government officials. ""We...need to construct some sort of timeline on when folks became aware of it if that is possible,"" one Air Force official wrote, responding to the public interest. ""I agree we... need to accomplish damage control, but we aren't the POC [point of contact],"" the response reads. ""Nor do I want to become a belly button for NORAD to push on this one."" Wrote one top Pentagon spokeswoman: ""Nothing like having everyone point the finger at someone else so we ALL look like a big bunch of buffoons... can you say Moe, Larry & Curly!??!?!"" In addition to the informal e-mail banter, the documents show the regimented system the Pentagon uses to monitor and respond to breaking news stories. A U.S. Northern Command document offers this ""assessment"" of the story: ""Last 4 hours: Story reported quickly. Covered by AP, CNN, FOX major news outlets. Local reporting very critical, highlighting 'scare' factor. Local populace very critical of event, due to 9-11 sensitivities."" It continues: ""Web site blog comments 'furious' at best. Twitter search reveals 'tweets' regarding two F-16's chasing commercial airliner. Rate of 1 tweet per minute and growing."" ""No positive spin is possible. Admit mistake,"" it concludes. In another e-mail, USAF Col. Scott M. Turner, commander of the Presidential Airlift Group, was doing just that. ""Again, my apologies sir. Real intent here was to honor NYC, not cause mass chaos,"" it reads. The next day, the Northern Command's internal memo included depictions of New York's three major tabloids featuring the headlines, ""Scare Force One,"" ""Just Plane Stupid!"" and ""How Dumb Was This!"" The photographs released Friday, meanwhile, show the presidential aircraft making a steep bank, seemingly well beyond the 30-degree maximum for Boeing 747s carrying passengers, according to one airline pilot consulted by CNN. That may have contributed to the anxiety on the ground. The Pentagon estimated the cost of the flight at $328,835, which includes the Boeing aircraft and the two fighter jets that accompanied it. But, they said, ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" The VC-25 aircraft is designated ""Air Force One"" only when the president is aboard. President Obama was not on the plane during the photo op. After the incident, Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the flyover, resigned. ""I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office,"" Caldera said in a letter to Obama. ""Moreover, it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president. After much reflection, I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office.""","Presidential plane's flight over New York led to panic on ground .

"(CNN) -- Insurgents locked in a standoff with U.S. Marines tricked them by dressing up as women to escape, a task force spokesman said Monday. U.S. Marines scan the site of a blast that hit a U.S. vehicle in southern Afghanistan. Women and children had been caught in the standoff between the armed groups, but some of the women were not what they seemed, according to task force spokesman Capt. William Pelletier. After the Marines began taking fire from insurgents in the town of Khan Neshin, in south Afghanistan near the Helmand River, the militants ran into a multiple-room compound, the U.S. military said. Unsure of whether civilians were inside the compound, the Marines had an interpreter talk to the insurgents, said an official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After some time, a number of women and children left the compound, the military official said. The released hostages told the Marines that there were no more civilians inside the compound, Pelletier said. But the Marines held their fire anyway, the official said. About 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), in the midst of the standoff, another group of women and children emerged from the compound, the official said. The Marines continued to hold their fire and wait out the insurgents, the official said. Finally, a screaming woman emerged from the compound with a bullet wound to her hand, Pelletier said. Then, another group of women came out, covered from head to toe according to custom, he said, with a couple of children in tow. The Marines attended to the wounded woman while the others walked away. When the Marines went into the compound, they discovered that it empty, Pelletier said. That's when they realized the fighters had dressed up as women to escape, he said. ""Apparently these were tall, rather broad-shouldered women with hairy feet,"" Pelletier said. The Marines' restrained approach differs from previous hits on compounds when airstrikes were readily called in, the official said. Under a new tactical directive for forces in Afghanistan, some of which was unclassified Monday, forces must protect civilians soldiers and must be sensitive to Afghan cultural norms regarding women. Pelletier said that during the standoff, ""the Marines didn't have any female forces to do any searches, and they weren't going to violate cultural norms by patting down these women."" The standoff in the town of Khan Neshin was especially significant because it has been a Taliban stronghold for several years, and the U.S. military reported that the Afghan government regained control of the town Monday. Coalition forces began talks with local leaders several days ago and have moved about 500 Marines into Khan Neshin, a U.S. military news release said. The government takeover of Khan Neshin marks the first time coalition forces have had a sustained presence so far south in the Helmand River valley, the release said. The mission to secure Khan Neshin coincides with ""establishing secure conditions"" for August elections in Afghanistan, according to the release. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a six U.S. soldiers were killed Monday by two roadside bombs, a representative for NATO forces said. Four were killed in Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Two soldiers were killed in southern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Forces said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Fans of Michael Jackson lined the streets outside Harlem's Apollo Theater on Tuesday for a chance to pay their respects to the late ""King of Pop"" at the hall that helped launch his career. A hat and glittery glove represent Michael Jackson at the Apollo Theater tribute. The crowd stood eight to 10 abreast in the sun and 80-degree weather for 10 blocks, waiting for hours for a chance to enter the theater. Fans were allowed in 600 at a time, where they lay flowers and other mementos at the foot of the stage and danced to Jackson's music as it played over the sound system. ""We left our house at 4 o'clock in the morning and got here at 9, and we were lucky to get here,"" said Angela Staples, who came to New York from Pennsylvania with her daughter Jasmine. ""I'm so happy about the outpouring of love and the crowd and the people. It's so respectful to Michael."" Those in the hall observed a moment of silence at 5:26 p.m. -- the time Jackson was pronounced dead Thursday in Los Angeles, California. The cause of the 50-year-old singer's death has not yet been determined. An autopsy on the 50-year-old singer was was inconclusive, leaving authorities waiting on the results of toxicology tests to determine what killed him. Fans have been gathering outside the theater since last week to remember Jackson, who at age 9 won a 1967 Apollo amateur night showcase with his brothers in the group the Jackson 5. ""While he went on from the Apollo stage to achieve international fame on an unprecedented level, to us and all of you, he's family because he started out here,"" said Jonelle Procope, the legendary venue's CEO. Jackson became an idol of both black and white fans and was among the first African-American artists to get widespread play on the music-video channel MTV. But in later years, he was known more for a roller-coaster personal life, including extensive plastic surgery, financial woes and a 1995 trial and acquittal on child-molestation charges. The Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York civil rights activist who became a friend of the Jackson family, urged Jackson's fans not to let critics ""scandalize"" a groundbreaking performer. ""Michael wasn't no freak,"" Sharpton said. ""Michael was a genius. Michael was an innovator. You can't take someone with extraordinary skills, extraordinary talent, and make him an ordinary person. He was extraordinary. He lived extraordinarily, and we love him with an extraordinary passion."" The Apollo had been one of the top venues for jazz, gospel and soul artists for decades before the Jacksons' breakthrough.  Sharpton said the theater was home to ""the best and the baddest."" ""You've got to come from the stage of the Apollo and go all over the world to understand Michael,"" Sharpton said. ""We understand his journey, because we were with him every step of the way."" The Jackson brothers' amateur night win led to a $1,000 deal for 31 shows at the Apollo, said Bobby Schiffman, whose family owned the theater. ""Shortly after their appearance, Diana Ross took them on an NBC special that she did, and there was no looking back after that. They just skyrocketed,"" Schiffman said. Jackson at the time ""was a sweet little boy,"" he said. ""He was extremely talented, extremely easy to get along with,"" Schiffman said. ""He always had a smile on his face, and it was a pleasure to see him working in the theater."" CNN's Aspen Steib contributed to this report.","Fans line streets for blocks to pay tribute to Michael Jackson at Apollo Theater .

"(CNN) -- The car breaks down. The lover jilts you mid-trip. The hotel turns out to be a dump. Pericles Rellas thanks a dumpy hotel and a kind stranger for showing him Old Cairo in Egypt 20 years ago. Travel snafus can throw upside down the most thought-out of vacation plans. But what the mishaps lead to, and how people deal with them, can be blessings in globe-trotting disguise. ""When things go wrong, travel gets more interesting,"" said Jim Benning. ""If everything goes exactly as planned, the trip may be all right, but is it the trip you'll tell people about for years to come? Probably not."" No stranger to travel trials -- he's heard about and lived plenty -- Benning is the editor of World Hum, an online travel magazine that focuses on the journey as much as the destination. In 2001, he found himself on a 20-hour-long, overstuffed train ride across China. It was so unbearable that he jumped off in Chengdu in Sichuan province, an area he never intended to explore. ""The only reason I got off is I couldn't stand another second on that train,"" he said. ""It led to the best week I had in China."" Travelers who can stay flexible and roll with the glitches do well, even ""thrive,"" when adversity strikes, Benning said. Nancy Donohue of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, is one such person. Back in 2003, the artist joined her grown son, Jeremiah (or ""Maia""), in volunteering at an orphanage in Guatemala. Once the three-week stint was over, the two set out on a road trip to take his car back to his home in California. But only two days into the drive, the car broke down north of Acapulco, Mexico, leaving them stranded beneath the hot sun for three hours, she said. They found refuge in the town of Coyuca -- her for one week (she had to fly back to the states) and Maia for two weeks -- before the right car part arrived and he could move on. While there, they found bliss, bonding with the locals and spending their days at the beach, swimming in a lagoon and feasting on 10-cent mangoes. iReport: Read about this lucky breakdown . ""It's the story of my life,"" Donohue said. ""Anything that happens is for the good."" Even in the worst of times, there can be blessings, Shirley Brooks-Jones learned. The Columbus, Ohio, resident was on Delta Flight 15 from Frankfurt, Germany, to Atlanta, Georgia, on September 11, 2001. The terrorist attacks had closed U.S. airspace, and for 24 hours, she was on one of nearly 40 airplanes on the tarmac in Gander, Newfoundland, getting bit-piece updates and trying to understand what had happened. When it became clear that they'd be going nowhere anytime soon, she and the others deplaned -- without their luggage. The people of Gander and the surrounding villages wowed Brooks-Jones, 73, and the other stuck passengers with their kindness. Locals gave them shelter, food, and access to phones and televisions so they could follow the news. They made sure prescriptions were filled, gave them clothing when needed and made sure they had every toiletry they lacked. The people of Lewisporte, the modest village where she was stranded, did all of this without allowing the passengers to pay for a thing. ""We just landed on their doorstep,"" said Brooks-Jones, who's been back to visit 16 times since that initial four-day layover. ""I fell in love with those people and the area."" She wasn't the only one. Those on her flight who were touched by the people of Lewisporte helped fund a scholarship for students there. The Lewisporte Area Flight 15 Scholarship Fund has raised nearly $900,000, she said. For Celeste Botha, a far less warm, even icy, reception turned her travels topsy-turvy. She took a four-month leave from her life and career in Seattle, Washington, to explore -- many miles away in Colombia and Panama -- a relationship with a man she'd fallen madly in love with. A Peace Corps volunteer when she was younger, Botha had dreamed about living overseas again. Going away with Mick made sense, she thought. But what she hoped would be a romantic adventure turned into a broken-hearted disaster, said Botha, 61. Almost immediately, the man changed, turning critical and showing disinterest. ""He had just flipped the switch,"" she said of what transpired five years ago. ""When we got to Cartagena [in Colombia], it was all downhill from there."" She could have jetted back to Seattle, defeated, but she refused to do that. ""I was not going to let this experience with Mick destroy my experience overseas,"" said Botha, who ended up meeting a British sailor, a travel companion for years to come. ""I was determined to be happy."" Smiles were hard to come by as Pericles Rellas led his father into the rundown Cairo, Egypt, hotel he'd booked back in 1989. The dump left his dad ""horrified,"" Rellas, 45, remembered. But the next day, as they braved the overwhelming and crowded streets, they happened upon the perfect place to stay. Not only that, they met a desk manager, Nutan, who insisted on taking them around Old Cairo, showing them hidden shops and sights they surely would have missed. iReport: Read further about Nutan's gift . Nutan did this, said Rellas, of the Los Angeles, California, area, because a stranger had once helped her when she struggled to find her way in the United States. ""She was repaying a debt to someone,"" said Rellas, who now thinks about Nutan whenever he stops to help someone who appears lost or confused. ""What have you been given in your life, and what can you give back to honor what you've been given?""","""When things go wrong, travel gets more interesting"" and memorable, expert says .

"(CNN)  -- Somalia said a senior al Qaeda operative tied to several attacks in East Africa was killed Monday in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia. Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan, pictured on the FBI's Web site, reportedly was tied to al Qaeda's East Africa operations. Intelligence sources have confirmed to the Somali government that Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan was killed, Information Minister Dahir Mohamud Gelle said Tuesday. ""We welcome that attack because those people targeted were murderers, and they are unwanted and unwelcome in Somalia,"" Gelle said. Nabhan's death will have ""a major impact"" on al Qaeda's operations in the Horn of Africa, according to one regional analyst. U.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on a car Monday in southern Somalia, killing several people, including one they believed was Nabhan, U.S. officials told CNN earlier. Nabhan, 30, was born in Kenya and had been tied to attacks that included the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, according to the sources. More than 200 were killed, and 4,000 wounded in those attacks, most of them Kenyans. The United States targeted Nabhan in an airstrike in southern Somalia near the Kenyan border in March 2008, U.S. officials said at the time. In February 2006, the FBI announced that Nabhan was wanted for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa, Kenya. Ten Kenyans and three Israelis -- including two children -- were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside Mombasa's Paradise Hotel in November 2002. The bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an Israeli charter jet, which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members. President Obama signed off on Monday's operation, a senior U.S. official said. The United States had been monitoring the situation for days and had intelligence that Nabhan was in the area, the U.S. officials said. The officials who talked to CNN are familiar with the latest information on Monday's strike but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The U.S. helicopter flew from a U.S. Navy warship offshore, while the ship kept watch on the operation, one of the sources said. The warship was ready to rescue the American troops if they got into trouble. Farmers in the southeastern town of Barawe, Somalia, said they witnessed the assault. They said helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died. The witnesses said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter. A U.S. official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of Nabhan for positive identification. Nabhan is believed to be an associate of al Qaeda member Harun Fazul, who was indicted in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies. The U.S. military has long sought Nabhan because he is believed to be deeply involved in al Qaeda's East African operations, a senior U.S. official said last year. ""He was certainly one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa,"" said Rashid Abdi, a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, an independent advisory and analysis organization. Nabhan ""has been living in the shadows"" in Somalia and not much is known about his recent activity, Abdi said. ""The fact that he is now out of the picture will have a bigger impact on al Qaeda than on Al-Shabaab,"" he said, referring to the Islamist militia in Somalia that has ties to al Qaeda. ""He is a man with an important organizational memory, and if a key figure like him is killed, it always has a major impact."" Al-Shabaab is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of its al Qaeda ties. There are growing concerns that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives. Journalist Mohammed Amiin Adow and CNN's David McKenzie, Barbara Starr and Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: Analyst calls operative ""one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa""

"NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- Slain Yale University graduate student Annie Le was intelligent, driven and destined for greatness, said those who knew her. The body of Annie Le, 24, was found in the wall of a Yale University laboratory building Sunday. ""She was also really tenacious and had a sense of humor that was never far away, and she was tougher than you'd think by just looking at her,"" Le's roommate, Natalie Powers, told a crowd of hundreds gathered on campus for the slain 24-year-old's vigil Monday. Le's body was found inside a wall at a Yale medical school building Sunday, the day she was to be married to her college sweetheart, Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at New York's Columbia University. She disappeared five days before her wedding.  Watch timeline leading up to Le's death » . Le and Widawsky attended the University of Rochester together, where Le majored in cell and developmental biology with a minor in medical anthropology. In a self-profile she wrote for the National Institutes of Health's undergraduate scholarship program, Le called her biology studies ""interesting"" but said she would like to pursue a research career in medical anthropology, ""which has highlighted the severity of health issues in societies worldwide."" She further wrote that she would one day like to work for the NIH or become a professor. Once at Yale, she majored in pharmacology and worked long hours in the lab where she was found dead this week.  Watch how Le's body was found » . Le was scheduled to finish her postgraduate program in 2013 and had recently decided the topic of her dissertation: the effects of certain proteins on metabolic diseases like diabetes, reported the Yale Daily News, the campus newspaper. ""She was probably the most brilliant person I've ever met in my life,"" her high school friend, Laurel Griffeath, told NBC's ""Today"" show, ""but what made her more amazing was that there was an intersection of intelligence and personality and ability."" Le impressed her peers and teachers long before delving into complicated medical research. Originally from Placerville, California, Le graduated in 2003 from Union Mine High School, where she was named ""best of the best"" and ""most likely to be the next Einstein,"" according to CNN affiliate WFSB-TV in New Haven. Principal Tony DeVille told Le's hometown newspaper, the Mountain Democrat, that she was ""one of the bright spots in the school's history."" But she didn't excel solely in academic situations. Friends and professors gush when speaking of Le's vibrant personality and her sense of humor. Le ""was as good a human being as you'd ever hope to meet,"" Powers said at the vigil.  Watch why police say killing not random » . Griffeath said Le knew how to balance her social life and academic responsibilities as well. ""She cared about people and she was funny, and she didn't sacrifice one part of her life for another like a lot of people kind of seem to,"" Griffeath said on ""Today."" Thomas Kaplan, editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, described Le as ""very outgoing, a warm person."" ""She was diminutive in stature, but certainly not in personality, and that's what I think just makes this so sad for everyone, regardless of whether you knew her,"" Kaplan said of the 4-foot-11 scholar. Friends describe Widawsky as the perfect match for Le. The portrayed a young couple deeply in love, constantly on the phone with each other and eager to exchange vows. Le tackled wedding planning with the same zeal she brought to her research, friends said. ""She was just so excited about this wedding and everything from, you know, her flowers to her wedding dress and just certain details about it,"" Vanessa Flores, a friend and former roommate, told CNN. ""We talked about this back in 2008. She was already thinking about the weather -- whether June, July was going to be too hot.""  Watch Flores describe Le's plans for ""her dream day"" » . Friend Jennifer Simpson told CBS' ""The Early Show"" that she was heartbroken for Widawsky. ""Jon is a wonderful person,"" Simpson said. ""He is very mild-mannered, very soft- and well-spoken, but very fun."" Despite Le's zest for life, she was always careful and aware of her surroundings in New Haven, a city with about 124,000 people and its fair share of crime. ""She doesn't walk around at night by herself. If she had to work late, she would make sure someone could come pick her up or walk with her,"" Simpson told ""The Early Show."" Friends say they can think of no one who would want to hurt her. She was friendly with everyone, they say, and if someone had threatened or intimidated Le, her friends and family would have known about it.  Watch Natalie Powers, Le's roommate for two years, give an emotional tribute » . New Haven police spokesman Joe Avery has said Le's killing was not random, and authorities and those familiar with the campus say there are only a handful of people with access to the building where her body was found. The uncertainty surrounding Le's killing -- and the possibility that one of its own is behind the crime -- has left the Yale campus frightened, Kaplan said. ""Only Yalies had access to that basement, and that seems to point to someone in our community being involved in this,"" the editor said.  Watch CNN's Mary Snow report on a shaken Yale campus » . Said Powers at the vigil, ""That this horrible tragedy happened at all is incomprehensible, but that it happened to her, I think, is infinitely more so. It seems completely senseless.""

"(CNN) -- This is the summer of Auto-Tune. The Gregory Brothers have become a viral hit with their ""Auto-Tune the News"" videos. No matter how hard some people -- notably Jay-Z --have tried to kill the trend of musicians using computers to make their voices sound like whiny robots, Auto-Tune technology continues to ride a cultural high. Now the voice-altering effects are migrating from recording studios to YouTube and mobile phones. An iPhone app called ""I Am T-Pain"" lets people manipulate their voices to sound like the popular rapper and Auto-Tune advocate. The Gregory Brothers, a sibling band out of Brooklyn, New York, has become a hit on YouTube with a series of videos that Auto-Tune cable newscasts and political speeches. The group, which also tours as a low-fi soul band, started its series of videos called ""Auto-Tune the News"" during the 2008 presidential debates and has gained millions of fans in recent months. CNN spoke with Andrew Gregory, a 27-year-old member of the band, about the popularity of Auto-Tune -- the trademarked name for the popular pitch-correction software -- and the role of technology in music and society. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation: . Why do you think your videos have taken off like they have? I think with any sort of viral video there's a little bit of luck involved. So we're counting our lucky stars that we've been lucky enough to have it take off like that. At the same time I think the novelty of seeing people like Katie Couric and Newt Gingrich sing has really captured peoples' attention. How do you make the videos? What actually goes into it? Michael likes to joke that there's a huge Auto-Tune lever that he hooks up to his computer and whenever he sees video footage he just pulls the lever, and anything that strikes his fancy is automatically Auto-Tuned. But there's a lot of technical stuff that goes into it. ... We scour a lot of footage to see what's going to work and what's not going to work. We try to find what people are going to tune well and what people won't tune well. ... Really, by the time the video gets made I'd say it's eight or 10 days of work that goes into one of these videos, between the four of us. What makes someone a good candidate for Auto-Tuning? An example of a great candidate for Auto-Tuning would be either Katie Couric or Joe Biden. Both Katie Couric and Joe Biden have just continued to astonish us with their unbelievable, almost hidden melodies in their speaking voices. A lot of it has to do with how they project their voice in terms of their soft palate. But it also has to do with how much of an oratorical fashion they speak. Joe Biden, in a lot of his speeches, is delivering them in a preacher sort of fashion that tunes really well. While someone who ended up tuning really poorly -- we thought he would tune really well! -- was Sean Hannity. We thought he'd tune really well just because Sean Hannity is always talking really loud. But it turns out that despite the fact that he was talking really loud, it was a nasal talking and it was a harsh and abrasive loud voice, so it ended up not tuning well at all. Does President Obama make for a good Auto-Tune? You know, what was great from Obama was the campaign speeches. His campaign speeches were excellent, because he was sort of using that almost gospel-preacher rhetorical style. Since he's been president, he's been so relaxed and sort of so laid back and cerebral and sort of intellectual. He's not been quite as excellent for Auto-Tuning because there's a lot more of a mumbly tone about him. A lot less of the ""Yes we can!"" and a lot more of the ""Weeeeell, as we see ..."" Has ""Auto-Tune the News"" helped your other musical efforts or do you think it's pulling you away? It's certainly making us focus a lot more on ""Auto-Tune the News."" As the videos have sort of grown in scope and become more popular, we can't help but continue to work on them as our fans clamor for more. Do you ever use Auto-Tune in the other performances, like in your band? We've never used it live. We're no Ashlee Simpson. But I think we've used it a little bit on our record. Right now it's a huge fad to Auto-Tune the crap out of people so that they sound like robots. But on pretty much any record you listen to these days there's some level of Auto-Tune on it, even if it's a very, very small amount. If there's just one small note that's just a little bit flat, why wouldn't you Auto-Tune it to make it sound OK? Do you think it's hurting music at all that people expect a singer's pitch to be perfect? It means that people who can't sing as well are becoming famous singers. But I don't know, that's why I love going to see live music, because that really sorts out the real singers from the not-so-real singers. If you could invent any technology or pick a technology that you would like to see invented, what would it be? Oh, wow. I'd probably go for a teleportation machine myself. ... Like the one they used in ""Star Trek,"" hopefully, right? Where you can jump in the teleportation machine and get to your gigs without having to carry all your amps and drive eight hours in your van. I mean, I play music for free. It's carrying my amps and driving places in my van that I have to charge people for. That'd be the real revolution for the music industry. Do you have the T-Pain iPhone app? Yeah, we were beta testers for that app. Do you use the app in day-to-day life? We've been joking around and showing it to friends who didn't have it yet. But we're playing our first concert in a while tonight [September 11]. I'm in North Carolina. And we're going to try to hook our iPhones up to the sound system and we're going to try to T-Pain our voices live. So we'll see if it works. Do you have a favorite iPhone app just in general? I'm not much of an app guy, but when I really need to kill some time I go for PapiJump. It's like the simplest, dumbest game possible on the iPhone. Other than that, the New York Times app is nice. What have you learned about the Internet in watching your videos go viral? I think a lot of people are using the Internet for just a sort of quick laugh fix. Whether you're bored at work or looking for something fun to do at home, people sort of live serious enough lives. I think everyone loves to laugh. And if you can get five minutes of the day at work ... to get a couple yucks in, I think you'd rather do that than watch your latest YouTube conspiracy movie or something.","CNN talks with Andrew Gregory, one of the people behind ""Auto-Tune the News""

"(Tribune Media Services) -- You can cover a lot of territory in Scandinavia without ever checking into a hotel. Overnight luxury cruise liners stacked with saunas, smorgasbords and duty-free shopping sail nightly between Stockholm and Helsinki. Imagine enjoying a Scandinavian feast with a vista of archipelago scenery. Budget travel rarely feels this hedonistic. Boats between Stockholm and Helsinki offer the delights of a luxury cruise ship at an affordable price. Two fine and fiercely competitive lines, Viking and Silja, connect the capitals of Sweden and Finland. Each line offers state-of-the-art ships with luxurious meals, reasonable cabins, plenty of entertainment (discos, saunas, gambling), and enough duty-free goodies to sink a ship. Of the two, Viking has the reputation as the party boat. Silja is considered more elegant (but still has its share of sometimes irritating and noisy passengers). The Pepsi and Coke of the Scandinavian cruise industry vie to outdo each other with bigger and fancier boats. The ships are big -- at 56,000 tons, nearly 200 yards long, and with 2,700 beds, they're the largest (and cheapest) luxury hotels in Scandinavia. Which line is best? You could count showers and compare smorgasbords, but both lines go overboard to win the loyalty of the 9 million duty-free-crazy Swedes and Finns who make the trip each year. Viking has an older, less luxurious fleet, but caters better to low-budget travelers, offering discounts to students, seniors and railpass-holders; selling cheap ""ekonomi"" cabins (shower down the hall); and allowing passengers to pay for deck passage only and sleep for free on chairs, sofas and under the stars or stairs. Both Viking and Silja sail nightly from Stockholm and Helsinki. In both directions, the boats leave about 4:30 or 5:30 p.m. and arrive the next morning around 9:30 or 10 a.m. For exact schedules, see www.vikingline.fi or www.silja.com. During the first few hours out of Stockholm, your ship passes through the Stockholm Archipelago. The third hour features the most exotic island scenery -- tiny islets with cute red huts and happy people. Going in this direction, I'd have dinner at the first sitting (shortly after departure) and be on deck for sunset. Fares vary by season, by day of the week and by cabin class. Mid-June to mid-August is most crowded and expensive (with prices the same regardless of day). Fares drop about 25 percent off-season for departures Sunday through Wednesday. In summer, a one-way ticket per person for the cheapest bed that has a private bath (in a below-sea-level, under-the-car-deck cabin) costs about $125. Couples will pay a total of about $375 for the cheapest double room (with bath) that's above the car deck. If that sounds expensive, remember that you're getting overnight lodging, a fun scenic cruise, and substantial transportation to boot. The fares are reasonable because locals sail to shop and drink duty- and tax-free. It's a huge operation -- mostly for locals. The boats are filled with about 45 percent Finns, 45 percent Swedes and 10 percent cruisers from other countries. The average passenger spends as much on booze and duty-free items as for the boat fare. The boats now make a midnight stop in the Aland Islands, a part of Finland that's exempt from European Union membership, to preserve the international nature of the trip and maintain the duty-free status. While ships have cheap, fast cafeterias as well as classy, romantic restaurants, they are famous for their smorgasbord dinners. Board the ship hungry. Dinner is self-serve in two sittings, one at about 6 p.m., the other a couple hours later. If you pay for both the dinner buffet and breakfast buffet when you buy your ticket, you'll save 10 percent. The price includes free beer, wine, soft drinks, and coffee. Make sure to reserve your table, not just your meal; window seats are highly sought after. Smorgasbord translates to something like ""bread and butter table."" It has evolved over the centuries to the elaborate spread seen today. The key is to take small portions and pace yourself. Begin with the herring dishes, along with boiled potatoes and knackebrod (Swedish crisp bread). Next, sample the other fish dishes (warm and cold) and more potatoes. Move on to salads, egg dishes, and various cold cuts. Don't forget more potatoes and knackebrod. Now for the meat dishes -- it's meatball time! Pour on some gravy as well as a spoonful of lingonberry sauce, and load up on more potatoes. Other roast meats and poultry may also tempt you. Still hungry? Load up on cheese, fruit, desserts, cakes, custards and coffee.

"(CNN) -- Iggy Pop invented punk rock. That's how cool he is. His songs have been covered by the likes of Guns N' Roses, REM, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Sex Pistols. Iggy Pop: The wildest man in rock music. He is the wildest wild man of rock and his four-decade career has been marked by drug addiction, self mutilation and onstage nudity -- and at 61 years old he is showing no signs of growing old gracefully. Born on April 21, 1947, in Muskegon, Michigan, James Newell Osterberg grew up in a trailer park. When he began learning the drums as a teenager his parents gave up their bedroom to house his drum kit. It wasn't long before he took his talent out of the bedroom, playing with high-school band The Iguanas, from which he later took his stage name. After graduating from high school in 1965, Iggy formed a blues band called the Prime Movers. Following a brief stint at the University of Michigan he moved to Chicago, playing drums with local bluesmen, before returning to Michigan with his sights set on fronting a rock band.  Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami » . In 1967, he recruited guitarist Ron Asheton, his drummer brother Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and formed The Psychedelic Stooges. It was after seeing the Doors in concert, and inspired by Jim Morrison's confrontational stage persona, that James Osterberg reinvented himself as Iggy Pop, a drug-fueled, crazed whirling dervish of a front man, who would strut semi-naked around the stage, roll around in broken glass and dive headlong into the audience. The band shortened its name to The Stooges and released its eponymous debut in 1969. Right from the start there was clearly something different about Iggy Pop. At the height of flower power, when The Stooges' contemporaries were singing about peace and love, Iggy was singing ""No Fun"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog.""  See photos of Iggy in action. » . The album was a brilliant mess of raw, blues-influenced garage rock, but it sold poorly, as did the 1970 follow up ""Fun House,"" later described by Jack White of the White Stripes as ""the definitive rock album of America."" Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami . By this time, Iggy had begun the Heroin use that would plague his career and in 1971, The Stooges split up after being dropped by their record label. That same year, Iggy met David Bowie, who took him to England, re-united The Stooges and produced 1973's ""Raw Power."" With ""Raw Power,"" Iggy and the Stooges created the blueprint for punk rock and made an album that would one day be regarded as a landmark in rock music, an album that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain listed as his favorite of all time. Nonetheless, it was another commercial failure and in 1974, The Stooges split again. By this time, Heroin had taken over Iggy's life and in 1975 he checked himself into a Los Angeles mental institution in an effort to kick the habit. Bowie visited him there and took Iggy along on his 1976 tour, before the pair moved to West Berlin in an effort to get away from the temptation of drugs. It was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy's 1977 solo albums, ""The Idiot"" and ""Lust for Life."" The latter included the songs ""The Passenger"" and ""Lust for Life,"" which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks, spawning countless cover versions. More commercial than The Stooges' records, Iggy's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales, but never breakthrough into the mainstream. Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums, with ""China Girl"" becoming a hit single for Bowie. Iggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s, without much commercial success, although the single ""Real Wild Child"" was a hit in the U.S. and UK. But by the end of the decade, Iggy was beginning to be recognized as ""the Godfather of Punk,"" with a new generation of bands citing him as an influence. Members of Guns N' Roses and the B52s appeared on his 1990 album ""Brick by Brick,"" which sold more than 500,000 copies, and his 2003 album ""Skull Ring"" featured the likes of Green Day, Sum 41 and Peaches. But what really made ""Skull Ring"" special was that it re-united Iggy with Ron and Scott Asheton of The Stooges. After years on the periphery, Iggy was suddenly fashionable, with the reformed Stooges appearing at festivals all over the world. The band recorded the album ""The Weirdness"" in 2007, but it was their astonishingly powerful live performances that showed why they were still such a big deal 40 years after they started out. Any hopes Iggy may have had for a peaceful retirement in Miami have been dashed. At 61 years old he is still performing with the same energy and abandon as when The Stooges first formed, with only marginally less stage diving and nudity. It seems that the world has finally caught up with Iggy Pop, the most exciting, unpredictable and entertaining man in rock.","Iggy Pop and The Stooges produced three classic albums in the 60s and 70s .

"Andrew L. Shapiro is founder and president of GreenOrder, a strategy and management consulting firm that specializes in energy and the environment and is a subsidiary of LRN. Brad Bate and Ted Grozier, consultants at GreenOrder, also contributed to this article. Andrew Shapiro says society should aim to transform all jobs into ""green jobs."" NEW YORK (CNN) --   In a recent CNN commentary entitled ""Green jobs: hope or hype?"" Samuel Sherraden argues that green job creation will be insufficient to bring America out of recession. But Sherraden narrowly defines green as a ""sector,"" and fails to see its potential as a strategy for the revitalization of the entire economy. When the public debate is focused around the precise number of green jobs created in, say, a solar panel factory, we miss the opportunity as a country to think more broadly about greening the economy -- and building a foundation for real growth and competitiveness. The aspiration to create ""green jobs"" should really be seen as shorthand for two public priorities -- immediate job creation and long-term transformation of the economy for sustainability and prosperity -- and both goals can be addressed simultaneously. However, in judging our progress, a simple tally of jobs in ""green sectors"" is only a partial indicator of the impact and thus can be misleading. A lot depends here on definitions. For example, Sherraden cites a 2008 report produced by Global Insight on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which identifies a little more than 750,000 green jobs in the United States today. A report in the same year, from the American Solar Energy Society, counts more than 9 million green jobs in the United States. This is not to say that one report is better than the other, but to point out that much difference -- in this case, more than 8 million jobs -- depends on how you count. The critical point Sherraden misses is that it's not just job creation in new green industries that matter, but also new jobs in traditional industries -- or the retooling of old jobs -- to make those industries greener. A great example is the real estate industry. Energy efficiency retrofits of buildings and homes have the potential to yield significant savings in energy costs while creating work for building engineers, electricians, contractors, manufacturers and people in a whole host of other industries that would not typically be considered ""green."" By comparison, 10 or 15 years ago anyone who used a computer was considered to have a ""tech job,"" but now nearly everyone uses a computer (and a cell phone and a PDA) and yet we don't call all jobs ""tech jobs."" We talk about how technology has changed every industry and profession. Moreover, even investments in sectors we recognize as green can have other positive economic impacts. Investing in wind power, for example, creates jobs in wind turbine manufacturing plants as well as jobs in the industries that supply the plant with parts, jobs producing the materials that make up these parts, jobs producing the electricity used in the plant, and so on. There is solid evidence that investment in green economic activity will result in more jobs than many other comparable investments because a greater proportion of funds would go toward labor and would remain in the United States. The Center for American Progress and the Political Economy Research Institute examined the impact of comparable investments in the oil and gas industry, tax refunds to stimulate household spending, and six specific energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies. They concluded that $100 billion of investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency would create approximately 2 million jobs, compared to 1.7 million jobs from stimulating household spending and about half a million jobs from investment in oil and gas. By investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency as strategies for our economy, we will create jobs in the United States, not just green jobs. More importantly, we lay the groundwork for American economic competitiveness and moral leadership in a carbon-constrained world. If we fail to support environmental innovation through investment and public policy, the United States will find itself at a disadvantage relative to other nations. America is at a crossroads. If we see green as an engine of growth, there is an unprecedented opportunity to create jobs and revitalize the economy through smart, wide-ranging investments supported by changes in public policy. In the debate over green job creation, we must not lose sight of the larger objective -- the creation of an economy that is more sustainable, in terms of employment, competitiveness and impact on the natural world. What we need to be asking is: How can we make every industry a green industry and every job a green job? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew L. Shapiro.","Andrew Shapiro: Skeptics argue that only a small number of jobs are green .
He says green industries and jobs can be the key to revitalizing economy .
Shapiro: As economy goes green, jobs will be transformed .
He says U.S. will lose competitive edge if it doesn't invest in renewable energy ."
"CONYERS, Georgia (CNN) -- ""Your daughter is a walking time bomb."" We have been told this more times than I like to remember. We have lived every day not knowing if the next breath she takes will be her last. After 22 years in the dark, Mandy Young is grateful to finally have a name for her condition. Her illnesses come so quickly. It's a daily battle of fear, worry, misery, faith and hope. She has been in the hospital more than 100 times. She has suffered one life-threatening infection after another. We share her story, our story, in hopes of helping others. We make sure that Mandy knows this is not just her illness. It's our families' life, our journey. She is not in this alone. It's extremely hard living a life so mysterious that doctors and scientists named her rare disease after her. It's our story about ""Mandy's Disease."" Mandy was a healthy, nine pound, green-eyed beauty -- until the day she was diagnosed with Spinal Meningitis. Hours and days crept by, waiting every four hours for our ICU visit, 10 minutes of torture. ""Your daughter is very sick. Her mind is surely in a vegetated state from the seizures she continues to have. The stroke that she suffered has caused the left side of her body to be paralyzed,"" the doctors said. See photos of Mandy throughout her ordeal » . ""She is in a coma and we see no way she will wake up. We really don't think she will live through the night. It's time to tell her goodbye,"" they continued. Mind spinning, stomach churning, feeling like I've had the breath knocked out of me, I whispered, ""NO."" ""No. We won't tell her goodbye. And you can't either. She has to fight. She has to know that we want her to fight."" At 13 months, her left eye turned red. Allergies, Pink Eye, minor infection? All easily treated, and cured. By day five, after six trips to doctors and emergency rooms, when her eye was swollen beyond seeing and looked like a piece of raw meat, we were finally able to beg her doctor for more aggressive testing. Surgery, biopsies and a diagnosis. Nisseria Meningitides. Her eye would be replaced with a glass eye. But only if she lived. Watch Mandy talk about her illness on Vital Signs » . At 21 months. Spinal Meningitis again. The same promises of certain death. ICU. Seizures. A 106 degree temperature raged. ""There is no way that she has the strength to fight off another infection of this magnitude. It's time to let go. We're losing her by the minute."" After the first bout of meningitis we were told, ""No one gets it twice. Live your life and enjoy your child!"" Then, bout two. Although not the same type of meningitis, it was the same family. It's rare to have it twice. But impossible to have it three times. But time three did come. ""You have to find out why this keeps happening. She can't go through this again. What can you do?"" we pleaded with the doctors. They told us it could possibly be immune deficiency. This was the first time we heard this term. Mandy was discharged and our journey for a reason began. Our lives were changed forever. Twice a week for the next two years, we handed her over for blood to be drawn. She went into isolation. Daily preventative antibiotics. But nothing stopped the madness of these infections. One fever blister on her lip turned into hundreds during a nap. She was hospitalized on oxygen as the blisters took over her lungs. Double Pneumonia. Scarlet Fever. Ear infection after ear infection. Surgically implanted tubes in her ears, infection, tubes out, surgery, tubes in. 11 times. An abscess the size of a cantaloupe in her abdomen. The grueling, sometimes gruesome, immune studies continued. The only clue continued to be her low white blood count. Everything else, normal. The turmoil in my heart was insane. Years passed. Mandy's illnesses continued. Immune studies continued. Still we had no answers. We traveled the country begging for someone to study her. ""Her body is further advanced than medicine. The test hasn't been invented yet to define her deficiency."" This was the standard answer. But, someone had to have a new test that could give us our answers. And then the time bomb that we had only been warned about exploded. Gas Gangrene and Clostridia Septicemia. A combination not seen since WWII. ""She's fighting to stay alive. Five percent chance to live,"" the doctors said. ICU. And then, in an attempt to save her life, they began to amputate her leg. Before they stopped the spreading, her leg and hip were gone. As she lay in a coma, we prayed for help. Our search for a research specialist intensified. That's when we found Dr. John Gallin at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Mandy is 27 now. Her immune studies began when she was two in 1983. And in May 2003, we received an email that said, ""At long last we have discovered the basis of Amanda's problem."" Mandy has a genetic defect, called IRAK-4. Her body doesn't recognize infection and doesn't produce the cells needed to fight it off. She is still studied at the NIH in hopes of finding a treatment or cure for her disease. And although finding a cure for her would be the ultimate gift, knowing that we have a name for her illness is the prize. We searched for a name for twenty years for Mandy disease. We spent weeks and months with her, in hospital after hospital, praying for her to live through her sickness. And to know that we have Dr. Gallin and his team in the background working on her behalf is incredible! Dr. Gallin did what he said he would do and stayed with Mandy until her diagnosis was made. Now the journey continues as we search for a treatment or cure. But in the meantime, Mandy is beginning a career in motivational speaking. Of her doctors at the National Institutes of Health she says: ""They are like my family too, and I get excited about seeing them. NIH, or 'the House of Hope,' is just that. ""A place for families to find hope, just like we did.""","For 22 years, Mandy suffered from a mystery illness, leaving doctors speechless .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, administered a powerful drug that authorities believe killed the singer, a source with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to CNN on Monday. Dr. Conrad Murray was with Michael Jackson on the day that he died. Murray, a Texas-based cardiologist, allegedly gave Jackson the anesthetic propofol -- commonly known by the brand name Diprivan -- in the 24 hours before he died, the source said. The doctor's attorneys in a statement Monday said they wouldn't comment on ""rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources."" In the past, they have said Murray never prescribed or administered anything that could have killed the pop star. Murray was the doctor who was at Jackson's home when the pop star died on June 25.  Watch CNN's Ted Rowlands report on drug allegation » . Last week, Texas authorities searched Murray's Houston medical office and storage unit, looking for ""evidence of the offense of manslaughter,"" according to court documents. Among the items removed from Murray's office were a computer; 27 tablets of phentermine, a prescription-strength appetite suppressant; 1 tablet of clonazepam, an anti-anxiety medication; and some Rolodex cards. From Murray's storage unit, authorities removed two computer hard drives; and ""important contact list;"" a suspension notice from Houston's Doctor Hospital; notices from the Internal Revenue Service; and a laundry list of medical and hospital documents. Ed Chernoff, a Houston lawyer hired by Murray soon after Jackson's death, confirmed at the time that Los Angeles Police detectives and federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents used a search warrant to enter Murray's office in northeast Houston on Wednesday morning. Chernoff said members of Murray's legal team were at the medical office during the search, which he said ""was conducted by members of the DEA, two robbery-homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department and Houston Police officers."" Tammy Kidd, a spokeswoman at Chernoff's office, told CNN the search ""was absolutely a surprise to us, because we've had open lines of communication this whole time."" Police have interviewed Murray twice since Jackson's death. A third interview was scheduled for July 24, but was postponed after the search warrants were executed. It's unknown when the next interview will take place. Among those who have indicated that Jackson may have been using dangerous prescription medication are nutritionist Cherilyn Lee, who said Jackson pleaded for the powerful sedative Diprivan despite being told of its harmful effects. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County coroner's office continues to investigate the cause of Jackson's death on June 25. It has been waiting on toxicology lab results, but a final autopsy report is expected as soon as this week, a coroner's spokesman has said. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","Murray allegedly gave Jackson propofol in 24 hours before death, source says .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- In the first truly shocking box office result of the year, ""Fast & Furious"" sped away from expectations to gross a humongous $72.5 million, according to early estimates from Media by Numbers. Paul Walker stars in ""Fast & Furious,"" which exceeded expectations after taking in $72.5 million. That result is effectively double what most industry observers had predicted for the debut of the fourth feature in Vin Diesel's car franchise, and it left in the dust a number of notable records: . - Best April opening ever, beating ""Anger Management's"" $42.2 million. - Best Universal Pictures opening ever (three-day), beating ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park's"" $72.1 million. - Best F&F franchise opening ever, beating ""2 Fast 2 Furious'"" $50.5 million. - Best opening yet in 2009, easily beating the bows of the more-buzzed-about ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" ($59.3 million) and ""Watchmen"" ($55.2 million). - Best opening ever for stars Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster, as well as for director Justin Lin. Oh, and let's not forget that it was the best opening ever for a car-themed movie! (Beating ""Cars'"" $60.1 million.) This outcome is impressive, indeed, something that has caught Hollywood by surprise and has the potential to really change things up -- like when summer-esque blockbusters are released (rarely does one open so early in the year) and like, you know, what everyone thinks of Vin Diesel. The film did it all on the strength of a solid A- CinemaScore review from an audience that was 57 percent male and 59 percent over age 25. Like the jaw-dropping early-year debuts of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""300"" before it, this is a history-making premiere that you may well be hearing about for a long time to come. So, yeah, I almost forgot to mention: ""Fast & Furious"" was the No. 1 movie at the box office this weekend. Coming in strong at No. 2 was ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" which dropped a respectable 44 percent to earn $33.5 million. In 10 days, the 3-D extravaganza has banked $105.7 million. ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" (No. 3 with $9.6 million), ""Knowing"" (No. 4 with $8.1 million), and ""I Love You, Man"" (No. 5 with $7.9 million) rounded out the top five. And the weekend's other big new release, ""Adventureland,"" struggled with $6 million at No. 6.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate voted Thursday night to extend the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program with an infusion of $2 billion. President Obama is expected to sign the OK to spend $2 billion more on the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program. White House aides said earlier that President Obama will quickly sign the bill into law to prevent any interruption to the popular incentive. The Senate voted 60-37 to approve the measure already passed by the House. ""[President Obama's] going to want to make sure the funds are in place by this weekend,"" one senior White House official noted, because of the particularly brisk weekend business the program has sparked. The program under Obama's economic stimulus package pays people up to $4,500 for trading an older-model vehicle with low fuel efficiency for new vehicles that get better miles per gallon. "" 'Cash for Clunkers' has been a proven success. The initial transactions are generating a more than 50 percent increase in fuel economy; they are generating $700 to $1,000 in annual savings for consumers in reduced gas costs alone; and they are getting the oldest, dirtiest and most air polluting trucks and SUVs off the road for good,"" Obama said in a statement Thursday night. ""I want to thank Leader Reid and the members of the Senate who moved quickly to extend a program that benefits our recovery and our auto industry while reducing our economy's dependence on oil,"" he said. The program was intended to run until autumn, but higher than expected participation caused the government to warn last week the program would run out of money without an infusion from Congress. The extension would keep the program going through Labor Day. The House voted to add $2 billion to the program before it adjourned for the summer on Friday. With the Senate vote, the additional money will become available right away. Several top Republicans, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, raised concerns about pouring more money into the program at a time when the government is deep in debt. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and other top Democrats had been lining up votes for the expansion by making the case that the program is providing a boost to the economy by increasing weak auto sales, while also helping the environment by getting ""clunkers"" off the road in favor of more fuel-efficient vehicles. The program calls for the engines of the clunkers to be made inoperable so the cars cannot be returned to the road.  Watch what happens to 'clunkers' » . Democratic officials said several hurdles were cleared in order to allow the Senate to pass the bill with new money on Thursday night. On Monday, two key senators who opposed more money for the program announced they had changed their minds and now supported the extension. The announcement by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, boosted Democratic efforts to secure enough votes to pass the measure this week.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Flashback to 1984: As a child, I am glued to my family's black-and-white television set for our daily dose of evening entertainment and news on India's national broadcaster. India holds its first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India on November 21, 1963. But this is no ordinary newscast: Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is speaking via videolink with astronaut Rakesh Sharma, who is aboard a space station. Indian pride soared as Squadron Leader Sharma, an Indian Air Force pilot, became the first in the nation to explore the celestial realm, part of a joint mission with what was then the Soviet Union. I don't remember what show it was, but it etched India's ""astronomical feat"" in the minds of those who watched it, including a 10-year-old like me. But the Indian connection to space was much older than that milestone. In the country's space calendar, November 21, 1963, is a key date: It marks the first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India. Nike-Apache, a two-stage sounding rocket imported from the United States, took off that day from Thumba, a site that eventually became a favorite location for similar experiments by international scientists. So far, there have been some 2,200 sounding-rocket launches from that facility, according to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center. But the South Asian nation's space program has been far more expansive -- the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has more than 60 events that it lists as ""milestones"" since 1962-63, which includes the successful use of polar and geosynchronous satellite launch vehicles.  See India's space odyssey in photos » . Fast forward to 2008: The country launches its first unmanned mission to the Moon in what is being seen as the 21st-Century, Asian version of the space race between the United States and the USSR -- but this time the two nations involved are India and China. In September of that same year, a Chinese astronaut took a spacewalk, his country's first. A month later, India sent Chandrayaan-1 -- Chandrayaan means ""moon craft"" in Sanskrit -- on a two-year mission to take high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the lunar surface, especially the permanently-shadowed polar regions. The craft, carrying payloads from the United States, the European Union and Bulgaria, will search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks. Nonetheless, India maintains competition does not drive its space program. Vikram Sarabhai, seen as the father of India's space program, made this case for government funding of the program in the 1960s: . ""We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically-advanced nations in the exploration of the Moon or the planets or manned space-flight,"" Sarabhai said, according to ISRO's Website. ""But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society,"" said Sarabhai, in what the agency described as a ""vision"" for India's space endeavors.   Earlier this year, the Indian government increased the federal budget for space research to around $1 billion from some $700 million, ISRO spokesman S. Satish told CNN, as scientists propose to send astronauts into space by 2015 on solely Indian missions. ISRO was also studying the feasibility of sending a manned craft to the Moon by 2020, Satish said, adding that plans for unmanned Mars missions in the coming years have not been finalized. The space agency dropped a TV-sized probe on the Moon last November that it said sent sufficient signals to the mother craft before a crash landing. But the country's space ambitions are not limited to public research endeavors, Satish said. ""We have just entered the commercial satellite launch market,"" he said, including what ISRO noted is now the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites. These satellites, according to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, capture images of the Earth that are used in a range of applications -- agriculture, water resources, urban development, mineral prospecting, environment, forestry, drought and flood forecasting, ocean resources and disaster management. Another major system, or INSAT, is used for communication, television and meteorology. ""We have mastered the space technology in these 40 years. We have already sent an unmanned mission to the Moon and now we look forward to sending a manned one there,"" Satish said.","India made its first rocket launch on November 21, 1963 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For almost a century, the old dog has traversed landscapes across the United States, with weary, budget-conscious travelers peeking out of its windows. Greyhound bus services will run from London to cities such as Portsmouth and Southampton. Now, the iconic Greyhound is taking to the road in Britain. The company will run hourly bus services from London to select cities, starting Monday. In contrast to its U.S. services, however, the buses are glitzier and more luxurious. ""The UK service will have wireless Internet, spacious leather seats, more leg room and free newspapers,"" said Alex Warner, managing director of Greyhound UK. ""Obviously, we wanted our services to reflect the nature of UK passengers."" For inaugural Greyhound service in Britain, the company aimed to start with the best the United States has to offer, Warner added. In North America, the same services are available from New York and Washington to select cities such as Boston and Toronto, Canada. ""There are plans to expand that. Americans should watch closely. We will introduce more of these services based on how well they are received in the UK,"" Warner said. Despite the added benefits, fares will still target the budget-conscious traveler in Britain, according to Warner. The service starts with a few cities -- from London to Portsmouth and Southampton, he said. The approximately 120-kilometer (80-mile) trip will cost £1 ($1.60) if a ticket is bought in advance, Warner said. Prices will go up to £4 or £5, depending on time of purchase. ""We are planning to keep the prices within that range,"" Warner said. Greyhound Lines is owned by British transport company FirstGroup, which bought it from its U.S. parent in 2007.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Ali Herbert has spent the last seven months being ""a walking blood bank"" aboard one of the the world's largest hospital ships. Thousands of volunteers join the massive hospital ship ""Africa Mercy"" every year. The 50-year-old nurse and grandmother from the UK resigned from her position in a hospital to volunteer aboard a ship that provides free medical treatment to some of the world's poorest people. Like any of the 450 volunteer crew members currently aboard the Africa Mercy, Herbert can be called on at any time of the day to give blood, as the ship has no facilities for storing blood products. Instead the ship operates a system where there are usually 30 donors for each blood type. Herbert says she recently helped a young woman who needed an amputation. ""This young woman required a below-the-knee amputation, but was very weak so I was called in to give her blood as our blood groups matched,"" she told CNN. ""It was an amazing experience because two minutes after giving my blood, I saw it go straight into her arm. In the UK you have no idea what happens with your blood,"" she added. The ""Africa Mercy,"" currently docked off the coast of  Benin, West Africa, also operates as a floating hospital with medical facilities including six state-of-the-art operating theaters, an ophthalmic unit, two CT scanners and 78 hospital beds onboard. The Mercy Ships charity began in 1978 and since then has been credited with providing medical services valued at $748 million, performing more than 41,000 operations and impacting approximately two million people. Mercy Ships CEO Samuel Smith says the charity has been able to help so many people through what he calls a ""unique business model."" Thousands of volunteers join the ship every year, and they not only do it for free but also have to pay for accommodation aboard the vessels; some like Herbert, pay around $600 a month. See more images of volunteers onboard the ship » . ""This allows almost all our resources to go into state-of-the-art medical facilities,"" Smith told CNN. It costs about $1.25 million every month to maintain, has three wards and a small intensive care unit operated by top surgeons from around the world. Would you give up your holiday to volunteer on the hospital ship? Sound Off below . One of them is Dr. Joe Nasser, a Canadian surgeon and one of the short-term volunteers. Nasser is currently on board for three weeks, time he took off instead of going on holiday with his family. ""It's a wonderful thing to do, a great humanitarian gesture,"" Nasser told CNN. ""There is tremendous need here, as these countries are very poor and have very few resources of any kind."" He described a recent surgery he performed on a 14-year-old boy with a benign but ""extremely aggressive tumor"" that had ""invaded"" almost the whole of the young man's face, leaving him completely disfigured. Following successful surgery to remove the tumor, the boy was given a more ""acceptable appearance,"" Nasser said. The charity behind ""Africa Mercy"" was founded by Texas-based Don Stephens and his wife Deyon. The couple took out a bank loan in 1978 and purchased a retired luxury ocean liner for $1 million. Their dream was to create a modern, mobile hospital that would provide free surgery and treatment to the world's poorest people. In 1982 she sailed to Africa with 350 crew and a new name, the ""Anastasis."" She was the first of five ships that have served in more than 150 ports in developing nations around the world. Last month, the Don and Deyon Stephens were presented with the Humanitarian Award from Variety, the international children's charity for their 30-year commitment to treating the world's poor. Don Stephens said the idea came after he stayed on a tropical island, and a storm occurred. ""There was a hurricane, and I heard that one of the girls had prayed for a ship to come with everything that was needed to clear up the storm damage,"" Stephens told CNN. ""It was like a laser beam going off. I couldn't get the idea out of my mind and I knew it was what I wanted to do."" In addition to complicated surgeries, Mercy Ships also trains local medical professionals in modern health care techniques. The charity also develops construction and agriculture projects. ""We then hope the countries' health care systems can be better off after we leave for the next country,"" Stephens said. Finding that next country takes a lot of research and coordination with local governments and diplomacy. In 2010 the ship will go to Togo, then South Africa. Mercy Ships is also planning to go to the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""We need approval from the local governments and safety is also important. Fortunately, Mercy Ships has a very good reputation, particularly in Africa,"" explained CEO Samuel Smith. ""People know that we're here to help, regardless of race, religion and political affiliation.""","Every year thousands of volunteers join the ""Africa Mercy"" hospital ship in Africa .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Virginia prosecutors are asking a state court to set a November 9 execution date for John Allen Muhammad, convicted in a series of sniper-style shootings that terrorized the Washington area in 2002. John Allen Muhammad was sentenced to death for the slaying of Dean Harold Meyers. In a letter dated Wednesday, Senior Assistant Attorney General Katherine B. Burnett said the November date ""has been carefully coordinated with the governor's office to insure his availability for any clemency petition Muhammad may wish to pursue."" Burnett enclosed a copy of a proposed execution order ""for the court's convenience."" Muhammad's attorney said he will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, and will ask the governor for clemency. During a three-week period in October 2002, police say, Muhammad and his young protege, Lee Boyd Malvo, shot 13 people, killing 10. The two also are suspected in other shootings and murders in Tacoma, Washington, Montgomery, Alabama, and the Washington, D.C., area. Muhammad, now 48, was convicted of murder in the death of Dean Harold Meyers at a Manassas, Virginia, filling station. Meyers was killed by a single bullet, which became the signature of the two-person sniper team. Ultimately, Muhammad was convicted of the Meyers' killing and of one Maryland murder, which prosecutors there said was ""insurance"" in case the Virginia conviction was overturned. Malvo was convicted of one Virginia shooting and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Muhammad's attorney, Jon Sheldon, released the prosecutor's letter Friday. The letter, addressed to the chief judge of the Prince William County Circuit Court, says the court must hold a hearing within 10 days of receiving the letter, and must set an execution date no later than 60 days after the hearing. Since Muhammad is not required to be at the hearing, Burnett asks that the court conduct the hearing by means of a conference call.","Execution date proposed for convicted D.C. sniper John Allen Muhammad .

"(CNN) -- Michael Vick, recently reinstated to the NFL after being freed from federal prison after a dogfighting-related conviction, has signed a two-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, according to his agent, Joel Segal. Michael Vick is set to join his new team on Friday, according to his agent. The former Atlanta Falcons quarterback reports to Philadelphia on Friday, Segal told CNN. Details of the deal were not immediately available Thursday night. The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. Vick, 29, was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20 and returned to his home to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. iReport.com: Is this a good move? The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday night in a statement it was ""incredibly disappointed"" at the news of Vick's signing. ""Philadelphia is a city of dog lovers and most particularly, pit bull lovers,"" said Susan Cosby, the organization's chief executive officer. ""To root for someone who participated in the hanging, drowning, electrocution and shooting of dogs will be impossible for many, no matter how much we would all like to see the Eagles go all the way."" However, Ed Sayres, president and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said in a statement that ""Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Philadelphia Eagles have granted Michael Vick a second chance, and the ASPCA expects Mr. Vick to express remorse for his actions, as well as display more compassion and sound judgment this time around than he did during his previous tenure with the NFL."" ""We hope that Mr. Vick uses his stature for the betterment of the community and the advancement of the issue of animal cruelty,"" Sayres said. Eagles head coach Andy Reid told reporters he knows there are some fans that will not accept Vick. ""I understand how that works,"" he said. ""But there's enough of them that will, and then it's up to Michael to prove that that change has taken place. I think he's there. That's what he wants to do."" He said Vick ""seems very focused, and he wants to get his career back on track."" It is unclear what role Vick will play in the Eagles' offense. But it was clear that the move had the blessing of current Eagles starting quarterback Donovan McNabb. ""I pretty much lobbied to get him here,"" McNabb said. ""Because everybody deserves a second chance."" The NFL reinstated Vick on a conditional basis last month. Vick ""will be considered for full reinstatement and to play in regular-season games by Week 6 based on the progress he makes in his transition plan,"" the NFL said in a statement last month. Week 6 of the NFL season is in October. Vick may participate in practices, workouts and meetings and may play in his club's final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement, the league said last month. ""I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege, not a right, and I am truly thankful for [the] opportunity I have been given,"" Vick said in a statement last month upon his reinstatement. ""As you can imagine, the last two years have given me time to re-evaluate my life, mature as an individual and fully understand the terrible mistakes I made in the past and what type of life I must lead moving forward,"" he said in last month's statement. Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy has agreed to continue working with Vick as an adviser and mentor, the NFL said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters last month that Vick underwent tests, including a psychiatric evaluation, after requests from animal rights groups. Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At a hearing in that case, he told the judge he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison. Court documents released in Vick's case showed that two of his co-defendants, who also pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal, said Vick helped kill dogs that didn't fight well, and that all three men ""executed approximately eight dogs"" in ways that included hanging and drowning. The dogs were killed because they fared poorly in ""testing"" sessions held at Vick's property. The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns. Wayne Pacelle, the organization's president, has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist youths who have already been involved. In testimony before the bankruptcy judge, Vick acknowledged committing a ""heinous"" act and said he should have acted more maturely. In November, Vick pleaded guilty to a state dogfighting charge and received a three-year suspended sentence. The Eagles are scheduled to play Vick's former team, the Falcons, in Atlanta on December 6.","NEW: Eagles head coach Andy Reid: I know some fans won't accept Vick .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A new Taliban military ""code of conduct"" calls for restrictions on suicide attacks aimed at avoiding the killing of civilians, but U.S. and Afghan military officials dismissed the document as propaganda, calling it hypocritical. A Pakistani looks at a bus set on fire by Taliban militants in northwest Pakistan in June. The booklet, obtained by CNN in northwestern Pakistan, has emerged during a crucial moment in the fight between troops and militants in Afghanistan, where battles are raging in the country's Helmand province and troops work to establish stability for the upcoming presidential elections. ""Suicide attacks should be at high value and important targets because a brave son of Islam should not be used for low value and useless targets,"" the code of conduct said. ""In suicide attacks the killing of innocent people and damage to their property should be minimized."" It also says ""all mujahideen must do their best to avoid civilian deaths and injuries and damage to civilian property."" And it says that mujahideen ""should refrain"" from disfiguring of people, such as the severing of ears, nose and lips. ""Mujahideen must be well behaved, and treat the people properly, in order to get closer to the hearts of civilian Muslims,"" the code said. Lt. Cmdr. Christine Sidenstricker, U.S. military spokeswoman in Kabul, saidit was notable that the document is intended to be ""prescriptive on how the bad guys are supposed to conduct themselves.""  Watch why Taliban have brought out new code of conduct » . ""Their day to day actions contradict everything in it,"" Sidenstricker said. ""The long and the short of it is, they don't operate in accordance to their code of conduct."" She said more than 60 percent of civilians killed have been killed by the Taliban, and since January, more than 450 innocent Afghans have been killed and more than 1,000 others have been injured.  Watch why Taliban are proving hard to uproot » . Also, half the casualties resulting from roadside bombs were civilians. ""The booklet also says suicide attacks should always be done against high-ranking officials. In reality, they have killed more then 200 Afghan civilians,"" she said. Afghanistan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Zaher Azimi said the code is "" propaganda"" and that the Taliban ""will never implement that."" He cites a recent beheading of a retired Afghan soldier as a clear example of the group's real behavior. ""It was against all the laws of war,"" Azimi said. As far as the upcoming election, Azimi said, the Taliban has tried its best in the past ""to disrupt the normal process of peace and security, and they will try their best to disrupt the peace and security process in the future."" The code of conduct is dated as coming into effect on May 9, 2009. It is similar to a previous document that emerged in 2006 and covers many topics. For example, it says ""kidnapping for ransom is strictly prohibited."" As for prisoners, the code says ""it is strictly prohibited to exchange prisoners for money. Killing can only be decided by the Imam or his deputy. No one else has the right to do so."" It says an imam or his deputy are on the only ones to make decisions on whether to kill, release of exchange a captured ""military infidel."" Further, it says the practice of taking weapons from people by force ""is no longer permitted."" ""But people may hand over their weapons voluntarily,"" it said. And it says that the ""mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate should not collect donations forcibly"" and that ""people should be free to choose who they want to give to."" It said mujahideen shouldn't search peoples' homes. ""If there is a need to do this, they should get permission from authority and the search should be done in the presence of the imam of the local mosque and two elders."" The code said mujahids aren't permitted to smoke and that ""a male who has not yet grown a beard may not stay in a common sleeping area with other men."" CNN's National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said the militants ""clearly"" are aware of the need to win ""hearts and minds"" and are trying to rectify the ""mistakes"" of al Qaeda in Iraq. ""They have their own counter-insurgency strategy in winning hearts and minds,"" Bergen said. ""This is a corrective, absolutely."" He said ""there's a window for both sides to make some progress"" and the Taliban want to exploit the moment. ""The Taliban believe they are either winning or not losing. If you are an insurgent not losing is important,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- French researchers have identified a new human immunodeficiency virus, the first derived from gorillas, a report said Monday. A new virus is difficult to detect by tests because it is not closely related to the other three HIV variants. The three previous HIV variants came from chimpanzees. The new findings indicate that gorillas, in addition to chimpanzees, are likely sources of HIV, the researchers concluded in a report published in the weekly Nature Medicine journal. The new virus, called RBF 168, was detected in a 62-year-old woman who moved to Paris, France, from the western Africa nation of Cameroon, the report says. She tested positive for HIV in 2004, and researchers led by Jean-Christophe Plantier identified the virus as being closely related to a recently discovered simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The new gorilla virus ""has many of the biological properties necessary for human infection,"" the report says. ""The human case described here does not seem to be an isolated incident, as before coming to Paris the subject had lived in the semiurban area of Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, and reported no contact with apes or bush meat,"" the researchers said. That would indicate that the woman contracted the virus from another human. The significance of the latest findings is difficult to determine without more information, said Robert C. Gallo, who co-discovered HIV in 1984. ""It's yet to be known,"" Gallo said. ""It could be zero. ... Let's see a more full report on this individual and let's see wider testing."" Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, calls the latest HIV variant ""an oddity"" but said it's not surprising that it cropped up, because the virus has been circulating in non-human primates for centuries. The three previous HIV variants are labeled M, N and O. The new one has been classified P. The N and O variants, Fauci said, are extremely rare. ""It's not significant unless it establishes itself as a predominant strain,"" he said. ""We have not seen that with N and O."" Fauci lumps the new P variant with the rare group because it has been detected in only one patient. If it were widespread, Fauci said, ""we would already know about it. When these things happen, you see a lot of them around."" Even if the new variant proves lethal, it's not likely to increase AIDS infections, said Gallo, director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. There are so many HIV variations, he said, that one more is not likely to make a difference. The new virus is difficult to detect by conventional tests because it is not closely related to the other three HIV variants. ""This demonstrates that HIV evolution is an ongoing process,"" co-researcher David Robertson of the University of Manchester said in a release. ""The virus can jump from species to species, from primate to primate, and that includes us; pathogens have been with us for millions of years and routinely switch host species."" HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system, giving rise to lethal infections. Patients diagnosed with HIV can take medications to delay or stop HIV from developing into AIDS. There are 33 million confirmed cases of AIDS worldwide. The unnamed woman has no signs of AIDS and remains untreated, Nature Medicine said. The most likely explanation for the emergence of the new virus is gorilla-to-human transmission, though researchers say they cannot rule out the possibility that the chimpanzee SIV gave rise to the new strain ""either indirectly by transmission to gorillas and then to humans or directly by transmission to humans and also to gorillas."" Researchers said they don't know how widespread the virus is among humans. ""The human prevalence of this new lineage remains to be determined,"" the report says, adding that ""it could be circulating unnoticed in Cameroon or elsewhere."" Western Central Africa bears close watching, the researchers suggest. ""In conclusion, our findings indicate that gorillas, in addition to chimpanzees, are likely sources of HIV-1,"" the report states. ""The discovery of this novel HIV-1 lineage highlights the continuing need to watch closely for the emergence of new HIV variants, particularly in western central Africa, the origin of all existing HIV-1 groups."" Co-researcher Robertson noted that the new virus may not be restricted to Africa. ""It also highlights how human mobility can rapidly transfer a virus from one geographical location to another as has been dramatically evident with the recent emergence of swine flu,"" he said.","Strain is the first known to be derived from gorillas .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States and Britain said Wednesday they are committed to remaining in Afghanistan, despite increased military casualties and declining public support for the war effort. U.S. Marines partrol part of the Gharmsir district in Afghanistan's Helmand province on Wednesday. ""We went into this together, and we will work it through together because we are stronger together,"" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said after a half day of talks at the State Department with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton praised Miliband's approach on Afghanistan, including the call for the government to reconcile with moderate elements of the Taliban. ""His analysis of the way forward is very much consistent with ours, and we will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder in pursuit of our common objectives,"" Clinton said of her counterpart. In a speech at NATO headquarters on Monday, Miliband called for rank-and-file Taliban to be given the chance to reconcile with the Afghan government, even as the campaign continues against Taliban commanders who are waging jihad. He also urged greater burden sharing not only among NATO allies in Afghanistan but by the Afghan government. ""There is a lot of talk, rightly, about burden sharing within the coalition, but the greatest burden sharing must be between the international community and the government of Afghanistan, which increasingly needs to take the lead -- the security lead, as well as the political lead -- in shaping the future of that country,"" he said. Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told reporters that boosting the training of Afghan forces would be a big focus after the country's August 20 election. When asked whether the election would be fair, Holbrooke, who just returned from the region, said he had heard complaints from all sides but was not ""unduly upset."" ""It's an extraordinary thing to hold an election in the middle of a war, and this is the first contested election in Afghanistan in history,"" Holbrooke said, adding the United States has no favorite candidate but only wants ""an election whose outcome is accepted as legitimate by the Afghan people and the world, which reflects the desires of those who vote."" July has been the deadliest month for U.S. and British forces since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, with 39 U.S. troops and 22 British troops killed. Miliband said the effort was going through a ""tough phase,"" but added that the British people understood the ""vital nature"" of the mission to stabilize Afghanistan. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been under under enormous pressure from his opposition, which charges that British troops don't have proper resources to fight the war, including helicopters. But he was sanguine. ""I think the British people will stay with this mission, because there is a clear strategy and a clear determination on behalf of the United States and other coalition members to see this through,"" he said, adding that the British people understood the mission's ""vital nature."" Americans, too, have questioned whether the war in Afghanistan is winnable and worth the effort. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and members of Congress, including Democrats, have predicted that President Obama has a year to show progress in Afghanistan before public support for the war further erodes. Clinton said Britain and the United States ""have made significant gains in the recent operations"" against the Taliban, but ""there remains much work to be done."" ""We know that this is a challenge that is not going to be easily resolved in a short period of time,"" she said, adding ""both of our countries are still threatened by the same enemy, an enemy that has attacked London, New York and Washington."" ""We know they've attacked us in the past, and, unfortunately, we know that they plot against us even today,"" she said.","July deadliest month for U.S., British forces in Afghanistan since '01 invasion .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- The Mexican Supreme Court has ordered the release of 20 people who were convicted in the massacre of 45 people in 1997. Mexican Mayan Indian massacre survivors reenact the killings of 45 people in Acteal village in this 2003 photo. The court ruled that authorities obtained evidence illegally and that the defendants were denied due process and lacked an adequate defense. The 20 were convicted for taking part in a massacre in the community of Acteal, in the southern state of Chiapas. Four of five Supreme Court justices decided Wednesday to order their immediate release, the court said in a statement. ""It's obvious that the evidence was obtained illegally,"" said Judge Jose de Jesus Gudino. Investigators say 45 men, women and children were killed in Acteal by people who suspected they had links to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, a group that launched a rebellion against the Mexican state in January 1994. It was nearly four years after that rebellion, on December 22, 1997, that the 45 unarmed indigenous peasants were massacred in Acteal. Then-President Ernesto Zedillo  ordered an investigation that eventually led to arrests. In addition to ordering 20 people released, the Supreme Court called for the review of cases involving six others who were convicted in the massacre. Judge Juan Silva Mesa decried the judicial process that led to the convictions. ""For me there is no greater injustice than allowing them, under and in the name of the law, to commit injustice"" and thereby ""affect someone's fundamental human rights,"" he said.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A 14-year-old who was trained to kill by radicals in the tribal regions of Pakistan now sits in a crowded classroom at a detention facility in Kabul. His only wish is to see his parents again. Shakirullah, 14, is convicted of planning to carry out a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. ""I miss my parents, my mom and dad,"" Shakirullah says in soft tones. Like others in tribal regions, he goes by one name. Shakirullah  is already a convicted terrorist for planning to carry out a suicide bombing. He says Muslim radicals lied and tricked him into becoming a would-be bomber. ""I have been detained for trying to commit a suicide attack,"" he says. He says his recruiters told him it was his mission as a Muslim to kill British and American soldiers because they were killing Muslims.  Watch teen say recruiters ""cheated me"" » . They told him that once he blew himself up he wouldn't die because God would save him for being a true Muslim. Asked what he now thinks of Americans and Westerners, Shakirullah is calm, but quick in his response. ""I don't know. God knows what type of people they are, whether they are good or bad. I don't know them,"" he says. Shakirullah now passes his hours in a cell block at a juvenile detention facility in Kabul. He is serving at least five years in detention. He is to be transferred to an adult prison in a couple of years, authorities say. He hasn't heard from his family in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. He tried to send them a letter through the International Committee of the Red Cross but is not sure it reached them. ""I don't know what they are thinking. They have no news of me,"" he says. On this day, Shakirullah attends a rehabilitation class, easily lost in the crowd of boys with shaved heads. All of the children are convicted for various crimes, including theft, fighting and even murder. Three boys like Shakirullah are here, all guilty of planning to kill themselves and others after being recruited by terrorist groups. With the increased violence in Afghanistan, international observers say they have seen more and more children being recruited by armed groups and national forces. The Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan with its strict Islamic rule from 1996 to 2001, has regrouped and launched a fierce insurgency. ""As you see in many places in the world, children are being used in armed conflict. They've been recruited as child soldiers; they've been recruited as armed groups. And the phenomena is now impacting, again, Afghanistan,"" says Catherine Mbengue, the UNICEF representative in Afghanistan.  Watch one boy's struggle begging for food on streets » . Inside the detention center, Shakirullah walks up to his cell, his sandals sliding across the tile floor. The cell block is empty and has metal bunk beds lined across the wall and a television set, ready for the times they have electricity. Shakirullah shares this space with 10 other boys. He sits in the center of the room with a blanket draped around him. He barely makes eye contact and looks away as soon as he does. He is shy, but forthright in his words. ""I didn't want to do it but he forced me to go,"" he says of his recruiter. Rubbing his face with his hand, he says he now spends his time dreaming of his life back home in rural Pakistan. His eyes begin to water and his voice becomes softer when he talks about missing his mother. Asked what he misses most about her, he says simply, ""A mother is a mother."" His was a life of farming and tranquility in Pakistan, he says. It was also a life that took a drastic turn when his father decided to send Shakirullah for studies at a madrassa. He says his dad wanted him to learn more about Islam and the Quran, something he could not do himself. He says his father didn't know radicals ran the school. In the madrassa, Shakirullah learned to recite the Quran in Arabic, not his native language. He relied solely on the fanatical interpretations the mullahs were giving him. ""When I finished reciting the Quran, a mullah then came to me and told me, 'Now that you have finished the Quran, you need to go and commit a suicide attack.' That I should go to Afghanistan to commit a suicide attack,"" he says. The teenager wasn't given the chance to say goodbye to his parents or siblings when he was driven to the Pakistan-Afghan border and handed over to strangers. He says he was taken to the southeastern province of Khost, a hotbed for terrorist activity in Afghanistan. Suicide attacks have risen in Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion to topple the Taliban began in late 2001, after the 9/11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Shakirullah says that before the police arrested him, he was learning how to drive a car but that he was not sure how he was supposed to carry out his attack. Khost is the province where a suicide car bomb went off near a voter registration site this past Sunday, killing 16 people, 14 of whom were children.

"PENSACOLA, Florida (CNN)  -- Detectives are questioning two people in connection with the killing of a Gulf Coast couple known for adopting special-needs children, the Escambia County sheriff said Saturday. Police were questioning two people Saturday, one of them the owner of a red van seen driving from the home. Investigators have found a red Dodge van recorded on surveillance cameras leaving the Beulah, Florida, home of Byrd and Melanie Billings, who were found dead in their home Thursday, Sheriff David Morgan said. ""Interviews with associated neighbors, friends and family"" led to a relative of the van's owner and another person, who were being questioned Saturday evening, the sheriff said. No arrests have been made, and Morgan would not discuss whether the ""persons of interest"" had any connection to the Billings family. But the sheriff said investigators can tie the pair ""to enough significant events and instances in this case that would lead a reasonable person to believe that they have an association with these murders."" A third person sought for questioning had not been found, Morgan said. The Billingses died in what police are calling a home invasion, but investigators have not said whether the couple was robbed. Eight children found at the home after the shootings are being cared for at an undisclosed location, Morgan said. The children, ranging in age from infant to about 11 years old, were not injured, police said. Twelve of the Billingses' 16 children were adopted, some of them with special needs, the Pensacola News Journal reported. Emergency personnel and police went to the home after receiving a call just before 8 p.m. Thursday about shots being fired, said Escambia County Police spokesman Sgt. Ted Roy. An employee of the couple found their bodies, Roy said. Beulah is west of Pensacola, near the Alabama state line. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Two people are being questioned and a third is being sought .

"(CNN) -- A giant panda at the San Diego Zoo gave birth to a cub the size of a stick of butter on Wednesday, her fifth cub born in the zoo since 1999. The public can view live video of the cub and its mother, Bai Yun, on the zoo's Web site. The sex of the mostly hairless, pink newborn, which was born around 5 a.m., is not known yet, said Dr. Ron Swaisgood of the zoo's Institute of Conservation Research. It will take about one month for the iconic black-and-white coloration of the giant panda to become visible, Swaisgood said. Its mother, Bai Yun, will care for the newborn by herself until she starts leaving the den regularly, at which time members of the zoo's giant panda team will step in briefly to check on the cub, he said. ""She is a very experienced mother. She raised all of her other cubs until about 1.5 years, the natural age for separation,"" Swaisgood told CNN Radio. ""She's a real pro."" Weighing in around 300 pounds, Bai Yun is about 1,000 times the size of her cub, who weighs around 4 ounces., the typical size of a baby panda, Swaisgood said. ""Pandas give birth to what's called very 'altricial' cubs. That means they are very small and fragile. This cub would probably weigh about 4 ounces. It would be pink and hairless and completely dependent on the mother,"" he said. The birth is considered a success for the zoo's Institute for Conservation Research, which works with research and breeding centers around the world to boost the endangered panda population . Herself a model of that effort, Bai Yun was the first panda to be born and survive at the breeding center of the China Center for Research and Conservation of the Giant Panda in the Wolong Nature Reserve in 1991. She has given birth to four other cubs since arriving at the San Diego Zoo in 1996 from China. Two of them have since been returned to China, Swaisgood said. The newborn's father, Gao Gao, is a wild-born giant panda that arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 2003 from the Wolong Nature Reserve. He will not be involved in raising the cub. The cub will remain in the den with its mother for a few months and gradually start to come out as soon as it is able to walk, Swaisgood said. In four to five months, the cub will be ready for the public, Swaisgood said. Until then, the public can view live video of the cub and its mother on the zoo's Web site. ""This highly endangered species still requires a lot of attention and assistance, but there is hope for the future,"" he said.","Giant panda Bai Yun gives birth to fifth cub at the San Diego Zoo .

"(CNN) -- Inter extended their lead at the top of Serie A to nine points after beating AC Milan 2-1 in a thrilling San Siro derby on Sunday, dealing a fatal blow to their city rivals' Serie A title hopes in the process. Dejan Stankovic celebrates scoring Inter's second goal in the superb 2-1 victory over city rivals AC Milan. Jose Mourinho's side, who were the home team in the 150th league meeeting between the two Italian giants, should have taken an 18th minute lead when a fine flowing move resulted in Esteban Cambiasso crossing from the left for Dejan Stankovic to score. However, the Serbian midfielder just delayed his shot on goal, allowing Masssimo Ambrosini to come back and produce a goal-saving challenge in the area. Inter did eventually take the lead in the 29th minute, but the goal was shrouded in controversy. Maicon's cross from the right was met by the head of fellow-Brazilian Adriano, but the effort clearly brushed off the striker's arm before finding its way into the net. Milan were struggling to cope with the pace of Inter's attacks and it was no surprise when the league leaders doubled their advantage two minutes before half-time. A long free-kick out of defense was headed down by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Dejan Stankovic was on hand to crack home a superb shot on the half-volley. Inter were inches from making it 3-0 in the 47th minute when Milan again failed to deal with a long ball. Georgian defender Kakha Kaladze slipped over when trying to deal with the danger, allowing Adriano a free run on goal. However, the striker fired just wide with Ibrahimovic unmarked in the area begging for the ball. David Beckham had a quiet match for Milan and the England midfielder was eventually substituted in the 55th minute for Filippo Inzaghi, seemingly holding a hamstring injury. The chances kept coming for Inter. On the hour mark the superb Ibrahimovic was denied by a brilliant reflex save from goalkeeper Christian Abbiati. However, against the run of play, Milan gave themselves hope with a 71st minute strike. Ronaldinho produced some Brazilian magic to lay a delightful ball through for Marek Jankulovski on the left -- and the Czech layed a simple pass square for Alexander Pato to find the corner of the net. That goal brought Milan to life. Inzaghi had a shot well saved by goalkeeper Julio Cesar and the same player then headed home a Pato cross, but the linesman correctly flagged for offside. The longer the game went on, Pato began to have more influence, and the teenager nearly levelled for Milan in the 78th minute but Cesar did well to save with his feet. Then, in the final minute, Inzaghi again went desperately close, producing another fine save from Cesar as Inter held on for a classic and vital victory. Meanwhile, Juve's title hopes were dealt another blow as they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Sampdoria -- meaning Claudio Ranieri's side have now won just one of their last four matches. The visitors took a 10th minute lead when Giampaolo Pazzini was left unmarked to score from a pass from Antonio Cassano. The home side dominated proceedings but could only score once when Amauri headed home a Sebastian Giovinco cross in the 62nd minute. Despite plenty of chances, the hosts could not find the winning goal, with Pavel Nedved (twice) and Alessandro Del Piero hitting the woodwork. Elsewhere, Fiorentina held on to fourth spot and the final Champions League qualifying position as they remarkably came back from 3-0 down at Genoa to snatch a 3-3 draw with Adrian Mutu's equalizer deep into injury time. Roma, who had won 10 of their previous 13 matches, drop to sixth after they were well beaten 3-0 at Atalanta, for whom Cristiano Doni scored twice.","Inter extend their lead in Serie A to nine points after defeating AC Milan 2-1 .

"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN)  -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford left the Governor's Mansion on Friday to visit with his family in Florida, his office said. South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford says her husband, Mark, must rebuild trust with his family and with the state. Sanford departed the mansion, where he has spent much of the last 48 hours, in the passenger seat of a state vehicle. The Republican governor will spend the Fourth of July holiday weekend with his wife and their four boys. ""The Sanford family asks members of the media to respect their privacy while they are together this weekend,"" his spokesman said in a statement Thursday. ""The Sanfords also hope to take a longer family vacation toward the end of July."" After disappearing for nearly a week, Sanford admitted last week that he'd been in Argentina with his mistress. His admission followed days of confusion over his whereabouts. His staff had said the governor was hiking the Appalachian Trail, and his wife had told reporters she did not know where he was. He later revealed to The Associated Press that he'd seen his mistress several times in the past year and that he'd also ""crossed lines"" with other women. Jenny Sanford released a statement Thursday calling Sanford's actions ""inexcusable,"" but she left the door open to reconciling with her husband. She said that although she is willing to forgive her husband, ""it is up to the people and elected officials of South Carolina to decide whether they will give Mark another chance as well."" ""Actions have consequences, and he will be dealing with those consequences for a long while. Trust has been broken and will need to be rebuilt. Mark will need to earn back that trust, first and foremost with his family, and also with the people of South Carolina,"" she said in a statement. ""The real issue now is one of forgiveness. I am willing to forgive Mark for his actions. We have been deeply disappointed in and even angry at Mark."" Her statement came shortly after it was announced that a review of the governor's travel records showed no misuse of public funds in his travels. Sanford already paid back the state for the Argentina leg of a state-funded missions trip last year because he saw the woman he had an affair with on that trip. ""Mark showed a lack of judgment in his recent actions as governor. However, his far more egregious offenses were committed against God, the institutions of marriage and family, our boys and me. Mark has stated that his intent and determination is to save our marriage and to make amends to the people of South Carolina,"" Jenny Sanford said. In the week after Mark Sanford admitted to his affair, nearly half of South Carolina's 27 Republican state senators called on him to step down. Despite the growing chorus, Sanford has no plans to step aside, his office said Thursday. ""He remains committed and determined to repair the damage he has done in his marriage and to building back the trust of the people of South Carolina,"" his office said. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Bill Bennett said that politically Sanford, once a rising star for the GOP, is ""a dead man walking."" Bennett joins calls for Sanford's ouster . ""He is embarrassing himself. There is the old notion of indecent exposure -- usually that refers to somebody showing some skin they shouldn't -- and there's another form of indecent exposure: He is telling us way too much,"" he said.  Watch Bennett discuss the political drama » . Bennett also suggested that the GOP can easily fill the gap Sanford would leave. ""We have other people,"" he said. ""We have other people who are not only fiscally interesting and sound but also can keep their lives together."" CNN's Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","South Carolina Gov.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Iason Athanasiadis' ordeal began at the airport, shortly after he checked in for his flight to leave Tehran. Iason Athanasiadis said he endured hours of questioning over several weeks in sound-proofed rooms by interrogators he could not see. ""I was heading to the gate,"" the Greek-British journalist said. ""This guy materialized on my right. He said 'are you Iason Fowden?' [Athanasiadis' passport name]. I said 'yeah that's me.' He said 'please step to the side ... you're not going to be flying tonight.'"" It was an ominous introduction to Iran's security apparatus. Athanasiadis spent the next 21 harrowing days in Iranian prisons, accused of espionage, subjected to interrogations and, on several occasions, beatings. The journalist, a freelance writer and gifted photographer who had been on assignment for the Washington Times newspaper at the time of his arrest, spoke to CNN by phone from his parents' home in Athens Thursday, several days after an extraordinary international lobbying effort helped secure his release. Athanasiadis has extensive experience reporting in Iran. He also did graduate level academic work in Iran in 2004, as part of a program sponsored in part by Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The young freelance reporter realized he was in serious danger at the airport in Tehran on June 19, when a half dozen plain-clothed security officers arrived and began leading him out of the building. The reporter resisted, and began yelling to crowds of nearby passengers that he was a journalist. ""I got kind of pulled kicking and screaming and getting punched behind an escalator,"" Athanasiadis recounted. While being dragged outside to an unmarked car, the journalist said he managed to get the attention of a Western-looking woman waiting in the airport. To this day, Athanasiadis says he does not know the woman's name. But he believes she was instrumental in helping spread the word of his detention. ""She was the best thing that happened to me that day,"" Athanasiadis said. ""I just said 'I'm a Greek reporter for the Washington Times. Please contact the Greek Embassy.' And she ran after me with a note pad and pen and asked me to spell my name."" International human rights organizations estimate thousands of Iranians have gone missing, since the Iranian government launched its crackdown on opposition activists and journalists following the disputed June 12 presidential elections. Eyewitnesses in Tehran say many families are still struggling to determine the whereabouts and official status of their detained relatives. But in Athanasiadis' case, the Greek Foreign Ministry announced it was working for the journalist's release just days after his arrest. That night, Athanasiadis says security officers forced him to ride into Tehran from the airport, with his head buried in his lap. Later, when he tried to make a phone call from a police station in Tehran, Athanasiadis said security forces tackled him, threw him to the ground, beat him with a club and pepper-sprayed him. Eventually, they transferred him to Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where he witnessed new Iranian prisoners being delivered by the busload to the prison gates. That is where the interrogation began. Dressed in a prison-issue uniform, Athanasiadis endured hours of questioning over the next several weeks in sound-proofed rooms where he was never allowed to see his interrogator. ""I just sat in one of these school desk situations, a chair with a desk extension,"" he explained. ""I was told to face the wall ... and they sat behind me and they crooned into my ear."" On the second day of his incarceration, a prosecuting judge told Athanasiadis, a fluent Farsi speaker, that he was facing charges of espionage. Since incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner of the June 12 election, opposition candidates and their supporters have accused the Iranian government of falsifying election results. In response, the Iranian government has accused Western governments, particularly Britain, of organizing large protests in the streets of Tehran and other cities. ""The lesson I take from this is that the Iranians,"" Athanasiadis said, ""have decided to start arresting foreigners."" Last May, an Iranian-American freelance journalist named Roxana Saberi, was released after being detained for four months on charges of espionage. This week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy demanded the release of 23-year old Clotilde Reiss, a French academic reportedly arrested last week on charges of spying. Meanwhile Maziar Bahari, an Iranian-Canadian who freelanced for Newsweek, is another prominent intellectual now sitting in an Iranian prison. According to the New York-based organization Committee to Protest Journalists, Iran is now the ""world's top jailer of journalists,"" with at least 30 reporters and bloggers in prison. Unfortunately, few of these prisoners enjoyed the international support that was rallied on behalf of Athanasiadis, said Michalis Kosmides, a Greek journalist and vice president of the Foreign Press Association in London. After learning of his colleague's arrest, Kosmides launched a Facebook page titled ""Free Iason."" Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Istanbul, also intervened. He sent a high-ranking cleric and a letter to the Iranian Consulate in Istanbul, to plead for Athanasiadis' release ""on humanitarian grounds,"" said Father John Chryssavgis, an adviser to the patriarch. ""Iran has separate nodes of power,"" Kosmides said. ""The patriarch's statement appealed to one node with religious sentiments."" Athanasiadis says the lowest point came 19 days after his arrest, when it appeared he would be released. ""They took me to the airport, the Greek ambassador met me with a ticket. We started heading towards the gates, then we suddenly veered off to the escalator,"" the 30-year old journalist said. ""I promptly got re-arrested and spent this very strange night in a windowless room listening to bags thumping through the chutes and listening to departure announcements ... it was the most scary time."" It took another 24 hours of intense diplomacy led by Greek ambassador Nikolaos Garilidis before Athanasiadis finally flew safely out of Tehran. Throughout his ordeal and the countless accusations of spying, Athanasiadis said he realized one thing about his captors: they had never bothered to read any of the articles he has published over the years about Iran. ""I was shocked that they would arrest someone who had lived in Iran and had such a record of trying to introduce Iranian society to an outside audience.""","Iason Athanasiadis arrested at Tehran airport on June 19 .

Pitt tells the magazine. ""Do you want the guy next to you to hear your entire conversation? ""That's why you should only text in the bathroom. Just be sure you don't hit the wrong button and end up putting a photo of your junk on Twitter. Trust me, you don't want those followers.""  Watch a CNN video about cell phone etiquette » . Humor covers for Pitt's lack of tech credentials as the Hollywood hunk and star of Quentin Tarantino's new film, ""Inglourious Basterds"" offers up a range of tongue-in-cheek advice for Wired readers. He touches on subjects ranging from managing your online persona to looking at porn on your work computer. Wired says Pitt approached the magazine with ideas for the story. The magazine, which is owned by Conde Nast and is a CNN.com content partner, collaborated with Pitt and contributing photographer Dan Winters to create the article. ""How to Behave: New Rules for Highly Evolved Humans"" hits newsstands July 21. Wired said in an e-mail that the piece is a re-think of the celebrity magazine profile. On the cover, a photo shows Pitt wearing a Bluetooth device in his ear. ""Rule No. 52: Ditch the headset. He can barely pull it off -- and you are not him,"" a blurb on the magazine front says. Most of the article is delivered in a spoof question-answer format. Pitt contributes several answers, as do regular Wired writers. One question asks if a person who exaggerated his or her salary on an online dating profile should confess. ""Hell no,"" Pitt writes. ""Everyone lies online. In fact, readers expect you to lie. If you don't, they'll think you make less than you actually do. So the only way to tell the truth is to lie."" A question about viewing pornography at work is paired with a photo of Pitt scanning a copy of Hustler magazine at an office desk. A half-eaten doughnut sits on the table in front of him. ""Don't just look at it at work, bring in your old porn mags and scan them there!"" Pitt writes in the magazine. ""It's like converting your vinyl to MP3s. Fill up your hard drive, and when you need a break from spreadsheets, just open a favorite pictorial."" Pitt's OK with porn, but he's less understanding of people who want to answer urgent cell phone calls during movies.

"GUADALAJARA, Mexico (CNN) -- President Obama said Monday the United States remains Mexico's partner in the fight against drug cartels, despite some calls in the United States to delay counter-narcotics aid because of alleged human rights violations by Mexican soldiers. President Obama speaks at a news conference in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Monday. Mexican President Felipe Calderon reaffirmed his commitment to transparency and human rights in his offensive against the cartels, Obama said. Some $100 million in anti-drug aid, known as the Merida Initiative, could be delayed because of concerns about human rights violations, it was reported last week. ""We have been very supportive of the Merida Initiative, and we remain supportive,"" Obama said. Obama also said the United States would work to reduce demand for drugs and stop the illegal flow of weapons south to Mexico. The remarks came at a summit of North American leaders in Guadalajara, Mexico. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper also expressed support for Mexico's strategy, saying that the drug cartels were a problem shared by all three countries. Turning to immigration, Obama said he is committed to ""fix the broken immigration system."" The three North American countries depend on their borders being safe and secure, Obama said, adding that he supports ""orderly and legal"" migration, while respecting the American tradition of welcoming immigrants. He also responded to critics who say that the United States has not been forceful enough in demanding the return of ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya to power, calling them hypocritical. ""The same critics who say that the United States has not intervened enough in Honduras, are the same people who say that we're always intervening and that Yankees need to get out of Latin America. You can't have it both ways,"" Obama said. ""We have been very clear in our belief that President Zelaya was removed from office illegally, that it was a coup, and that he should return,"" Obama said. The United Nations and Organization of American States, including the United States, have called for Zelaya's return, but more than one month later, the interim government of Roberto Micheletti remains firm and talks between the two sides have so far been unsuccessful. Harper agreed with Obama's stance. The United States has very clearly stated its position while letting a multilateral process take the lead, he said. ""That's precisely what we want to see from the United States,"" Harper said. Turning to trade, Obama said a ""Buy American"" provision in his economic stimulus plan had little effect so far on the multibillion-dollar trade partnership with Canada. Obama told journalists that Harper has raised the issue every time they have met. Harper has complained the ""Buy American"" provision is protectionist and could harm trade relations between the closely linked North American economies. ""This in no way this has endangered the billions of dollars of trade taking place between our two countries,"" Obama said, standing beside Harper and Calderon at a final news conference. Harper responded to the same question by saying the leaders had a good discussion on the issue, and their respective trade ministers also were talking about it. Canada is the top trade partner of the United States, with cross-border commerce worth more than $1 billion a day. The $787-billion stimulus package enacted in February included a provision that only American goods be used in stimulus projects. It also stipulated that the measure would not override existing U.S. trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. Obama also talked about comparisons between the U.S. and Canadian health care systems, saying Canada's government-run health care model won't work in the United States. ""We've got to develop a uniquely American approach to this problem,"" he said. Opponents of health care legislation in the U.S. House and Senate say it will lead to a single-payer system like the government-run program in Canada, with some warning the Canadian system means restrictions on treatments and long delays. Obama noted the U.S. system is based on employers providing health insurance for most Americans. Throwing that out would be too radical an overhaul, he said. However, he said he expects opponents of health care legislation to continue to make what he called the misleading comparison between proposed U.S. legislation and Canada's system. ""I suspect that you Canadians are going to continue to get dragged into the debate,"" he said.","Obama: Mexico has reaffirmed commitment to human rights in drug fight .

"(CNN) -- He felt lonely, said he hadn't had a girlfriend since 1984. He said his father didn't love him. And he detailed plans to kill young women. The gunman, George Sodini, apparently left behind an online diary that detailed his loneliness. George Sodini, the 48-year-old man police blame for killing three women and wounding 10 others in a suburban Pittsburgh gym, left behind an online diary that is as shocking in places as it is profane in others. It offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a suspected killer who police say walked into an aerobics class, turned off the lights and fired more than 50 rounds from multiple handguns. ""Why do this?? To young girls? Just read below. I kept a running log that includes my thoughts and actions after I saw this project was going to drag on,"" the diary begins.  Watch how Sodini may have targeted a woman » . It seems almost formatted, like a résumé, with Sodini's date of birth and date of death. The date of death is listed as Tuesday, the day of the shootings at an LA Fitness center outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Read an edited version of the diary (PDF) A law enforcement source who identified the shooter said Sodini was a member of the gym. The source provided a month and year of the suspect's birth that matches the month and year listed for Sodini in the online diary. The Web site where the diary appears is registered to George Sodini of Pittsburgh. It lists an address in or near Scott Township; the law enforcement source said Sodini lived in Scott Township. Throughout the log, Sodini refers to a shooting that he is planning as an ""exit plan."" His first entry is November 5, 2008. ""Planned to do this in the summer but figure to stick around to see the election outcome,"" it says. The December 22 entry says: ""Time is moving along. Planned to have this done already. I will just keep a running log here as time passes. Many of the young girls here look so beautiful as to not be human, very edible. After joining this gym, started lifting weights and like it."" Two days later came an entry about loneliness. ""Moving into Christmas again. No girlfriend since 1984, last Christmas with Pam was in 1983. Who knows why. I am not ugly or too weird. No sex since July 1990 either (I was 29)."" By December 26, the writer seems to have picked a date. ""I will shoot for Tuesday, January 6, 2009, at maybe 8:15. I have list of to-do items to make."" In an entry dated January 5, he laments, ""Every evening I am alone, and then go to bed alone. ... Why should I continue another 20+ years alone? I will just work, come home, eat, maybe do something, then go to bed (alone) for the next day of the same thing. This is the Auschwitz Syndrome, to be in serious pain for so long one thinks it is normal. I cannot wait for tomorrow!"" Then he loses his nerve. ""It is 8:45PM,"" reads an entry dated January 6. ""I chickened out! [Expletive] I brought the loaded guns, everything. Hell!"" A May 5 entry outlines a technique. ""To pull the exit plan off, it popped into my mind to just use some booze,"" the entry reads. ""After the gym, I stopped at Shop N Save and got a fifth of vodka and a small bottle of Jack Daniels."" The diary recounts a failure with women and a growing anger. ""There are 30 million desirable women in the US (my estimate) and I cannot find one,"" a May 18 entry reads. ""Not one of them finds me attractive. These problems have gotten worse over a 30-year period. I need to expect nothing from me or other people."" The entry from Monday recounts practice for a shooting. ""I took off today, Monday, and tomorrow to practice my routine and make sure it is well polished. I need to work out every detail, there is only one shot. Also I need to be completely immersed into something before I can be successful."" The next day, around 8 p.m., a gunman with a gym bag strode into the LA Fitness gym, turned off the lights and started shooting without saying a word, police said. Investigators found his body lying atop one of his guns, about 7 feet from a woman he shot.","George Sodini, 48, is accused of killing three women, himself at gym .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Treating flu-stricken children with anti-viral medication including Tamiflu and Relenza could do more harm than good, a new report has warned. Researchers say not enough study has been done into the long-term effects of anti-virals on children. Researchers from the University of Oxford found that while the anti-virals reduced the duration of illness by up to one day and a half, they had ""little or no effect"" on the likelihood of the children developing complications. The researchers conceded that they didn't know the extent to which their report applied to the current swine flu pandemic, but said, ""based on current evidence, the effects of anti-virals on reducing the course of illness or preventing complications might be limited."" In compiling their report, published in the British Medical Journal, the Oxford University researchers searched the world for trials of Tamiflu and Relenza on children under 12. They found seven in total; four relating to flu treatment, and three to prevention. They say none offered a big enough study to determine whether anti-virals have any effect on the chances of children developing serious flu-related complications. ""We've got very little data to go on. These drugs have been used on tens of thousands, in fact millions of children worldwide, and we've found only four trials of treatments involving less than two thousand children,"" said the report's author, Dr Matthew Thompson, a senior clinical scientist at the Department of Primary Health Care, the University of Oxford. ""We didn't find any trials of children under one. And none of the trials was big enough to show if there's any effect on serious complications like pneumonia or being hospitalized,"" he said. The report found that while anti-virals reduced the duration of flu in children, they had little or no impact on the likelihood of the child developing ear infections or any other condition that may require antibiotics. A review of one study into the effect of anti-virals on asthmatic children, who are considered to have a higher risk of developing complications from the flu virus, found that they did not reduce the risk of the asthma attacks. The report said that one in 20 children who take Tamiflu suffer nausea and vomiting, as indicated in warnings from the drug's manufacturer. ""That obviously can be a particular problem in young children and infants where getting dehydrated is a complication of influenza,"" Thompson said. The three studies that focused on the use of anti-virals to prevent influenza taking hold, showed that their potential to stop the spread of flu was ""fairly small."" ""We'd need to treat 13 children with the preventive course of one of these drugs to prevent one of them from getting flu,"" Thompson said. The report's authors suggested governments were too quick to recommend anti-virals as the first defense against the spread of swine flu. In the United Kingdom, people who suspect they have the virus are urged to phone a government helpline. If enough symptoms match the operator's list, they're given an online voucher so a ""flu friend"" can collect a course of Tamiflu. ""We're not criticizing the current Department of Health policy, but we hope they'll inform perhaps a slight shift in policy in terms of use of these drugs,"" Thompson told CNN. The British Department of Health said the report was right to suggest bed rest and over the counter remedies for people with mild cases of flu, but added that it was potentially dangerous to deter people with severe cases of flu from taking Tamiflu, including children. In a statement, a spokesman said: ""Whilst there is doubt about how swine flu affects children, we believe a safety-first approach of offering anti-virals to everyone remains a sensible and responsible way forward. However, we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects."" The British Medical Association (BMA) also adopted a cautious stance. The chairman of the BMA's general practitioner's committee, Dr Laurence Buckman, said doctors always have to balance the risk of major complications from swine flu with the potential side-effects of anti-virals. ""While we know they are safe, we do know that vomiting and diarrhea can occur in some children and adults who take them,"" he said, adding ""The more we learn about these drugs the more we will know how to treat patients with the most up-to-date clinical evidence.""","Researchers examined studies into effects of anti-virals on children .

"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- At least four people have been killed in two days of rioting in Uganda's capital after radio broadcasts encouraged listeners to violently take to the streets against the government, officials said Friday. Residents of the Kasubi suburb, west of Kampala, try to flee from violence as a soldier takes photos. The rioters heard ""sectarian"" broadcasts on Thursday that ""systematically incited the listeners to cause chaos and destruction wherever they could,"" said a statement issued by Minister of Information and National Guidance Kabakumba Masiko. It described those who took part in the rioting in Kampala and its suburbs as ""marauding thugs."" The broadcasts aired in the Buganda Kingdom, said police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba. Ethnic and political tension between the kingdom and the central government had been escalating over the past few weeks. Police and army officers were injured and police-owned property also was damaged along with other vehicles and shops, said the nation's police chief, Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura. In Natete-Ndeba, a southwest suburb, a police station was looted of its ammunition and prisoners set free before rioters burned the prison, Nabakooba said. A curfew has been declared in the suburb, and in Kampala the army is providing support to police, said Kayihura. A doctor at a Kampala hospital said more than 50 people had sought care there, most with broken bones, but others had cuts and gunshot wounds. About 60 people were arrested in Kampala, but arrest totals in the surrounding areas were not available, Nabakooba said. Four radio stations were ordered shut down, Masiko said. Many of the rioters were Baganda between the ages of 18 and 35, Nabakooba said. The Baganda are Uganda's dominant ethnic group, making up about 16.9 percent of the population, according to The CIA World Factbook. The kingdom is one of the oldest monarchies in Africa. The people live mostly in central Uganda and along the shoreline of Lake Victoria. Tension between the Buganda Kingdom, headed by King Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, and Uganda President Yoweri Museveni had been increasing recently over land laws, sovereignty and political power, issues over which the two sides have been in talks for years. The Uganda government sees Mutebi as a traditional leader only and does not allow him to participate in politics. Further estranging the two is a breakaway faction of the Buganda Kingdom, the Banyala. Some interpreted police forces' breaking up a group of Baganda amid preparations for festivities as support for the Banyala, especially after a Banyala demonstration opposing the Buganda Kingdom prompted no police action. It is unclear why the police broke up the Baganda group earlier in the week. Riots broke out after the incident, and again when radio announcers pushed Baganda to take to the streets again. Museveni said in a broadcast statement that he tried to contact Mutebi to discuss the issue as ""mature people"" but he could not reach him on the phone. The president also said that he had intelligence reports showing that the Buganda Kingdom has received foreign funding to carry out a hate campaign against the government. Asians, mostly of Indian origin, suffered severe losses when their business were attacked and looted, Nabakooba said. Although officials said the broadcasts encouraged listeners to put into action their contempt for the government, during such outbreaks of violence Asians are often targeted. Some view Asians as being most protected by the government because of special holidays or tax benefits they may get. In addition, reports of Asians mistreating natives have fueled tension between the groups. None of the four people killed were Asian or of Asian descent, Nabakooba said, but in the northern suburb of Kawembi about 30 Asians had fled to a police station for protection on Thursday and remained there Friday. Samson Ntale contributed to this report for CNN.","Radio broadcasts encouraged violent street action against the government .

"Habib Battah is a blogger, freelance journalist and documentary filmmaker based in New York and Beirut. BEIRUT, Lebanon -- When I heard Snoop Dogg was coming to Beirut, I jumped at the opportunity to show the world a different side of the country I had grown up in. So I hit the phones, tracked down the promoter and before I knew it, I was driving to the airport to film Snoop's arrival. Beirut blogger Habib Battah with U.S. rap legend Snoop Dogg. When I first met the Dogg (as he's known by his very courteous suit-wearing bodyguards), he was seated in the VIP lounge of Beirut International Airport, surrounded by entourage while awaiting passport control. The U.S. rap legend had never been to the Middle East before, and I was wondering why he decided to perform in Beirut of all cities. Outfitted in a hooded sweater, despite the sweltering heat of the Beirut summer, Snoop leaned forward and told me in his low voice: ""There are a lot of places I could have started but I chose to start here because I felt they've been supporting me you know -- they've been down with me for long time."" By ""starting"" in Lebanon, Snoop meant that he intended to embark on a Middle East tour in the coming months. ""Me and my man Roger had a nice conversation about putting together a Snoop Dogg Middle East tour ... so we gonna try to get that together over the next couple of months,"" Snoop, flanked by his forever-smiling local organizer, Lebanese entertainment mogul, Roger Kalaouz, told a room full of eager photographers and entertainment journalists. But the Lebanese paparazzi still wondered, why Beirut? ""This is my first chance to party with the people of Lebanon,"" Snoop said. ""They were always partying to my music but now they get a chance to actually party with Snoop Dogg. ""This is the party capital of the world,"" he added and the room filled with applause. Hours later, Snoop drove the locals wild once again during his performance in front of thousands of adoring young fans by holding up a Lebanese flag on stage and then performing an impromptu sing-along with the chorus line ""Beirut, Lebanon."" When the show ended just before one a.m., Snoop did not leave Beirut without living up to his promise to party hard. Acting on a tip from a source close to Snoop's circle, I managed to follow Snoop's entourage to the afterparty, at a massive and highly exclusive rooftop club overlooking the Mediterranean Sea and the Lebanese mountains. I entered the club through the back entrance with members of Snoop's band that I had met at the airport. When we got inside, the champagne was flowing and the club was rocking with hundreds of people. A mixture of house and trance music reverberated across all surfaces as fireworks lit up the evening sky. Snoop's band and crew were ecstatic, sporting looks of awe when they reached their VIP tables in the balcony section which boasts outdoor air conditioning. And even though the European electric beat was quite a stretch from the hip hop he produces, Snoop himself seemed to be getting down -- waving his hands in the air. But it wasn't long before the Dogg switched things up grabbed the microphone: ""You are now rocking with the big Snoopie D.O. double jizzle for shizzle dizzle"" he said, sending screams through the glamorous crowd. Then he turned toward the DJ podium: ""Hey! Yo! DJ! Why don't you play some of that Snoop Dogg sh*t? Once again the crowd was electrified, as Snoop began rapping to his track ""Drop it Like It's Hot,"" (Part of the that performance is available on Snoop's Web site.) Later he played other local favorites such as ""Gin and Juice"" and then rocked to a new track ""That's the Homie"" from his upcoming album ""Malice in Wonderland"" while being filmed by two cameraman and a flash light. The Beirut show producer, Roger Kalaouz later explained that Snoop was actually filming part of the music video for the new track that night. And when Snoop left the club at 3 a.m., the party continued till seven in the morning, according to Kalaouz, in true Snoop fashion, back at the hotel. Kalaouz says he's now preparing for Snoop's Middle East tour beginning in December, with a focus on cities in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf states, such as the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and maybe even Saudi Arabia. Though it remains unclear how much Kalaouz actually paid Snoop to perform in Beirut, he emphasized that the bidding process was intense with much competition from promoters in other Arab countries.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hannah Clark is a 16-year-old with a shy laugh and a love of animals. She likes to go shopping with friends and dreams of a career working with children. Teenager Hannah Clark's heart has healed itself more than a decade after she received a donor heart. But Hannah Clark is no ordinary teenager and her normal life today could not have been possible without a unique, life-changing heart surgery. In 1994 when she was eight-months-old, Hannah was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy -- an inflammation of the heart muscle that impairs the heart's ability to work properly. Hannah's heart was failing and she needed a transplant. But instead of taking her own heart out, doctors added a new donated heart to her own when she was just two-years-old. The so-called ""piggyback"" operation allowed the donor heart to do the work while Hannah's heart rested. But Hannah was not in the clear yet. As with any organ transplant, Hannah's body was likely to reject her new heart and she had to take powerful immune suppression drugs. Those drugs allowed her body to accept the donor heart but also led to cancer and yet another medical battle for Hannah that lasted for years. Nearly 11 years after receiving the extra heart, there was more bad news: The immuno-suppression drugs were no longer working. Hannah's body was rejecting the donor heart. In February 2006, her doctors tried something that had never been done before: They took out the donor heart. Doctors theorized that the donor heart had allowed Hannah's heart to rest, recover and grow back stronger. Now for the first time Hannah's father, Paul Clark, describes the agonizing decision the family had to make at the time: ""If she'd never had it done, she wouldn't be here.  Watch a report about Hannah's amazing recovery » . ""In the very beginning it was a 50/50 chance she wasn't going to make the operation. But in the next one it was even greater because it had never been done before. But we had to take that risk,"" he told CNN. The doctors were right. Three years later, Hannah has no need for any drugs and has been given a clean bill of health. The operation was a success. ""It means everything to me,"" Hannah told CNN after the pioneering operation. ""I thought I'd still have problems when I had this operation done. I thought after the heart had been removed I thought I'd have to visit hospitals. But now I'm just free,"" she said, smiling. Dr. Magdi Yacoub performed Hannah's original transplant and came out of retirement to perform the second. ""The possibility of recovery of the heart is just like magic."" Dr. Yacoub said at a media conference. ""[We had] a heart which was not contracting at all at the time. We put the new heart to be pumping next to it and take its work, now [it] is functioning normally."" The findings have been published in the British medical journal, the Lancet. Hannah's amazing recovery would not have been possible without a donor. Both Hannah's doctors and her family made an appeal for more people to consider organ donation. ""When it happens to someone close to you or yourself, you don't realize until then how important it is to be a donor and not to be selfish like, I need that part. You don't need that part. Give it to somebody else that needs it,"" said Clark. ""It just proves that if you can, be a donor. This can happen."" Dr. Yacoub now advocates ""presumed consent"" -- a policy by which anyone can be considered an organ donor unless they specifically request to opt out. ""All you are asking is please make up your own mind. Do you or do you not want to be a donor? My own family, my kids, everybody wants to be a donor. But if you don't, then say so,"" he said. ""Just please tell us what you want to do. So, presumed consent is a good thing."" Hannah has made a full recovery and looks forward to doing what many teenagers do during the summer holidays: Work at a summer job. Her family jokes that it's difficult to keep her from racing out the door now that she has so much energy. For Hannah, it took the strength of two to help heal a broken heart, something she could have never done alone.","Hannah Clark suffered from a rare heart condition when she was a baby .

"Editor's note: Jay S. Winuk, co-founder of MyGoodDeed, is the brother of Glenn J. Winuk, an attorney and volunteer firefighter and EMT who died in the line of duty when the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001. This week Glenn was posthumously honored with the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor from the United States of America. Jay Winuk says September 11 is best observed as a day of service to others. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The upcoming eighth anniversary of the attacks of September 11 raises a compelling question for millions of Americans: How should we best observe this uniquely tragic day in our nation's history? Surely, it should not be a holiday. This is no time for days off from work and three-day weekends to enjoy barbeques and white sales. No, September 11 is a day for reflection, and its historical and emotional significance should not lessen with time or be diminished in any way. It is a day to focus on the substantial lessons learned. I'm a 9/11 family member. My brave brother, Glenn J. Winuk, was a partner at a large law firm, Holland & Knight, located two blocks from the World Trade Center. For almost 20 years Glenn was also a volunteer firefighter and an emergency medical technician. When the Towers were hit, Glenn borrowed rescue equipment and ran from safety toward the South Tower to participate in the rescue effort. He died when the South Tower collapsed. Soon after the attacks, I co-founded, with my friend David Paine and other 9/11 family members and friends, a grassroots initiative called MyGoodDeed. Our goal? To establish the anniversary of September 11, 2001 as an annually recognized national day of service. Our widely shared view was that there would be no better way to pay tribute to those thousands lost and those millions who rose in spontaneous, compassionate and effective service to help rebuild our spirit and our nation in the aftermath of the attacks. Supported by all the leading 9/11 family, survivor and volunteer organizations, the initiative has since attracted the attention and participation of millions of people around the world, from all 50 states and more than 170 nations and territories. People choose whatever form of kindness and service they'd like to perform each 9/11. And with acts large and small, they are making a real difference in the lives of people and communities in need. Some make donations -- clothing, books, eyeglasses, money, blood. Some help repair schools and parks and beaches. Some send care packages to our troops overseas, or work in soup kitchens. Some read to the blind, or visit the elderly. This Sunday, retired New York Giants great George Martin is leading a fundraising walk from New York to New Jersey to raise money for the health care of thousands of rescue and recovery workers of Ground Zero who are ailing as a result of their service after 9/11. There is no limit to what people can do to participate. Of note is that just like those who died in the horror of that September morning, those who engage in service on 9/11 represent a wide range of political preferences, ages, races, religions, economic status and geographic locations. Unlike as suggested recently by some conservative journalists and bloggers, this 9/11 service phenomenon is not new and is certainly not about some kind of liberal agenda intended to diminish the meaning of September 11 or redefine it for political gain. Indeed, the notion of engaging in service to mark each 9/11 began during the Bush administration, and has been widely supported by both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill. In fact, in 2004 the U.S. Congress unanimously passed House Congressional Resolution 473, saying the anniversary of September 11 should be a national day of service and compassion. In April of this year, President Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, substantially bi-partisan legislation that included a provision formally establishing September 11 as a ""National Day of Service and Remembrance."" The 9/11 community largely applauded this major step forward. And as I watched the president sign this legislation, along with members of the ServiceNation coalition and surrounded by a diverse group of political leaders, educators, students, service volunteers and others, I experienced both chills and a feeling of great warmth as I thought about my brother who died in service to others. Service as a way to honor the victims, workers and volunteers of September 11 ensures that future generations will learn not only about the attacks but about how good people around the world responded when our nation was severely wounded. Further, it serves as a productive and meaningful way forward out of the ashes of September 11 as our national challenges are now as great as ever. Some people say, ""Enough about 9/11 already. Let's move on."" Surely, I understand that. Even while remembering, we must move ahead. And that's really the point about this observance. Let's pay tribute to all those who were injured or who perished, like my brother, and to all those who rose in service to save and protect our nation, by looking forward and by improving the lot of those people and communities in need. This moment in history was not just about the attacks. It was also about compassion. And that is the lesson of the events of 9/11, and for me is the essence of this National Day of Service and Remembrance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay S. Winuk.","Jay Winuk: 9/11 has been recognized as a national day of service .
He says it's not a day to skip work or go shopping .
He says people choose to do acts of kindness, large or small .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- A fugitive American white supremacist was arrested Monday in Israel, ending an international manhunt that began in 2007, Israeli and U.S. officials said. Micky Louis Mayon, pictured in a 2007 mug shot, entered Israel in 2008, authorities say. Micky Louis Mayon, one of the 100 most wanted people in the United States, was taken into custody in southern Tel Aviv after Israel received information from Interpol indicating he was there. The Ku Klux Klan member was located during a secret operation by Israeli immigration authorities, said Sabin Hadad, a spokeswoman for the country's Interior Ministry. He arrived in Israel in January 2008 on a one-month tourist visa, frequently changed apartments, and earned money by working part time at several restaurants, the ministry said. Mayon, 32, is being held at Israel's Maasiyahu prison and is in the process of being deported, Hadad said. ""The search for Mayon came to a successful conclusion ... with the actions in Israel,"" Michael Regan, a U.S. marshal in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said Monday. ""Locating and identifying Mayon in a foreign country sends a strong message that you can run, but you cannot hide."" Two U.S. marshals are being sent to Israel to escort him back to the United States. Mayon was featured on the television program ""America's Most Wanted."" He is a convicted felon and is accused of setting a judge's car on fire in Pennsylvania, the show's Web site said.","Israeli authorities apprehend fugitive American white supremacist .

"(CNN) -- Comedy isn't evolutionary. Hollywood has been plundering ancient history for yuks at least since Buster Keaton's day, and there's little in ""Year One"" to suggest we've progressed much over the last 90 years. Michael Cera and Jack Black go in search of meaning -- and some food -- in ""Year One."" Quite the opposite, in fact. It's a stretch to envisage Keaton picking up bear poop, as Jack Black does here, giving it an appraising sniff, then a quick lick. And I can't imagine him peeing down his own nostrils, as Michael Cera does (he's chained upside down at the time). Not to say this monkey business isn't funny; these are the highlights of a relentlessly low-brow lark, notwithstanding several sophomoric speeches in a panicky existentialist vein. Black is Zed, a sorry excuse for a hunter in a tribe that has yet to discover the wheel. His buddy Oh (Cera) is even further down the totem pole, a mere gatherer. Neither is a hit with the ladies, and when Zed is exiled after stealing forbidden fruit, well, not even Oh wants to go with him -- though of course he does tag along. It's no fun being a sidekick all on your lonesome. Co-written and directed by comedy veteran Harold Ramis (""Ghostbusters,"" ""Groundhog Day""), ""Year One"" is little more than a series of juvenile skits dressed up in toga party glad rags. It rambles off into Old Testament territory when the boys stumble across Cain (David Cross) killing his brother Abel (Paul Rudd), then arrive in the desert in the nick of time to save Isaac's neck (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) from his zealous father's knife -- though his foreskin is another story. Sorely lacking the anarchic edge that Monty Python brought to ""The Life of Brian"" and the sheer chutzpah of Mel Brooks' ""History of the World: Part One,"" ""Year One"" is more akin to one of those old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby jaunts -- two guys bicker and banter in exotic climes, hopping from scrape to scrape without ever reaching the bottom of the barrel. Inevitably, Zed and Oh find themselves on the Road to Sodom, where Oliver Platt's plummy High Priest orchestrates orgies in the afternoon then presides over human sacrifices in the evening. It is in Sodom that the boys will prove their manhood. Black's manic over-reacher and Cera's shy mumbler complement each other well enough in theory, but at 39, Black is almost old enough to be the 21-year-old Cera's father. It's a big age gap for a comedy duo, and they never quite mesh or convince as bosom buddies, even if they're fairly amusing separately. Among the supporting cast, only Hank Azaria's fundamentalist Abraham really seizes on the possibilities; he and Platt deliver the goods. Too many others, on the other hand, just seem to have dropped by to hang out for a day or two on set. Typically, neither Juno Temple nor June Diane Raphael gets any breathing room as the heroes' designated distressed damsels; Ramis ogles female flesh as enthusiastically as he milks homophobia for cheap laughs. Bearing the tell-tale scars of slash-and-burn post-market testing editing -- several early scenes simply hit a brick wall -- ""Year One"" isn't an out-and-out disaster. It's just another feeble comedy that never finds its rhythm or builds up a head of steam. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Year One"" It was probably a lot more fun to make than it is to watch, but we'll have to take that on trust.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Burberry, the 150-year-old British luxury brand most famous for its distinctive check pattern, has recently experienced a resurgence. Christopher Bailey, Burberry's creative director, has been credited with the brand's resurgence. The brand credits much of its new a la mode image to creative director Christopher Bailey. The unassuming 37-year-old British designer has successfully reconnected Burberry with a trendy young audience -- using the likes of British super model Agyness Deyn, whom he has propelled to international stardom -- in ad campaigns. But times are hard for luxury brands, with a recession that has turned many high-end consumers toward cheaper alternatives. So how is Bailey handling the current economic climate? With stylish new headquarters in the heart of London and the recent opening of a Burberry Children's wear store in the capital, it seems the brand has kept its wheels rolling.  Watch Burberry's creative director speak to CNN » . Bailey believes the new headquarters were an important extension of Burberry's image, telling CNN ""the building is the brand beacon."" ""It's so important that everyone lives and breathes the aesthetic of what Burberry is. We have to do what feels right for the company,"" Bailey added. But that does not mean that Burberry is ignoring the recession. ""It's all about the balance between functionality and emotion. You have to be instinctive about what's going on,"" said Bailey. ""We think about the world recession, but it helps us focus and make sure that the brand purity and integrity is there in everything we do. ""We've just opened our first [children's wear] store in London and the first signs are pretty wonderful."" But Bailey agrees that ""there has been incredible excess in the last five to 10 years, so it's a good moment to re-balance."" So how will that translate to the catwalk?

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Father Alberto Cutie, an internationally known Catholic priest who admitted having a romantic affair and breaking his vow of celibacy, was married this week in Miami, Florida. Father Alberto Cutie was married in Coral Gables, Florida, on Tuesday, according to court documents. Cutie, 40, announced last month that he was leaving the Catholic Church and joining the Episcopal Church. A judge performed the marriage ceremony Tuesday in Coral Gables, Florida, for Cutie and Ruhama B. Canellis, 35, according to Miami-Dade County court documents. Cutie, whose name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, is a native of Puerto Rico, and Canellis was born in Guatemala. He was received into the Episcopal Church on May 28 at Trinity Cathedral in Miami. He will pursue the priesthood in the Episcopalian faith, the Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida said in a written statement. It was not immediately clear how long the process would take. Cutie -- sometimes called ""Father Oprah"" because of the advice he's given on Spanish-language media -- shocked some in the Catholic community when photographs of him embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman emerged last month in TV Notas magazine. He acknowledged having carried on a two-year relationship with the woman, who at that time had not been publicly identified. ""This is something I've struggled with,"" he told CNN in May. ""I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise."" Referring to his relationship with the woman, he said, ""It looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that."" After the photographs surfaced, Cutie was removed from his duties at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace Networks. Cutie had been president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace. He has also written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book, ""Real Life, Real Love."" John C. Favalora, archbishop of the Catholic Church's Miami archdiocese, said last month that Cutie's actions have ""caused a grave scandal within the Catholic Church."" Favalora also had harsh words for the Episcopal Church's decision to accept Cutie. ""This truly is a serious setback for ecumenical relations and cooperation between us,"" he said.","Alberto Cutie married Ruhama Canellis on Tuesday, court documents show .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- An explosion outside a Starbucks on the Upper East Side of Manhattan sent frightened people running into the street early Monday. Police investigate an explosion in a Manhattan Upper East Side neighborhood. The explosion blew out the windows of a Starbucks coffeehouse at East 92nd Street and Third Avenue at 3:25 a.m., according to New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. A ""low-order improvised explosive device"" exploded after being left on a wooden bench in front of the coffeehouse, Kelly said. The blast could be heard many blocks away, according to CNN affiliate WABC-TV of New York. Seven people were briefly evacuated from the building above the Starbucks, Kelly said, but no one was injured. The interior of the Starbucks sustained no damage. It's too early to tell whether Monday's incident is connected to other minor explosions in New York City in recent years, including ones at the British and Mexican consulates and another in Times Square, Kelly said. He did note one immediate similarity between the detonations: All occurred at roughly the same time of night. He said the police would continue to analyze other similarities. However, Kelly also noted that Starbucks has been the target of low-grade explosions in other cities. Police plan to examine surveillance cameras for information that could lead investigators to the perpetrator, he said.","Minor explosion outside of a Manhattan Starbucks sends people fleeing .

"(CNN) -- Michael Ian Black has a fine sense of the absurd. Michael Ian Black, left, and Michael Showalter have ""Issues"" in their new Comedy Central show. You can hear it in the comedian's deadpan delivery, which makes some of his serious musings sound like jokes -- and some of his jokes sound like serious philosophizing. You can see it reflected in his VH1 ""I Love the ..."" guest spots, in which he acts as if the most ridiculous pop cultural events are worthy of solemn commentary. The absurdity is also obvious in his new Comedy Central show, ""Michael and Michael Have Issues,"" in which he and pal Michael Showalter -- the two go back to the early-'90s troupe The State -- play exaggerated versions of themselves doing such things as competing for the attention of an intern and torturing a reporter as they make a TV show.

We made that pilot, it didn't go, but when it was done, they said, ""We'd still like you guys to do something."" So we started pitching around ideas, and this is the one that stuck. CNN: Does Comedy Central keep a hands-off attitude with you guys? Black: Yes and no. They definitely trust us to a certain extent. We've had a long relationship with them, so they have a lot of faith in us. ... At the same time, they're a television network, and I don't know if you're familiar with television networks, but they definitely have opinions. CNN: They like to provide notes, I've heard. Black: Yes, that's exactly right. So they've given us lots and lots of notes. CNN: One thing that always strikes me about you guys is that you like the comedy of discomfort, [as in] the kind of thing that makes you laugh but makes you squirm a little bit? Black: When phrased that way, then yes, I suppose we do like that. There's something very funny to both Michael and myself about putting yourself in awkward situations and revealing this banal awkwardness that kind of happens to everybody. CNN: What makes you uncomfortable in real life? Black: I'm very uncomfortable with sincerity. (laughs) Anybody who's being sincere about stuff gives me the icks. I just invented a term: ""gives me the icks."" CNN: Who did you follow when you were growing up? Black: The comedians who I always really looked up to when I was a kid were John Belushi, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy ... but for different reasons. I can't say I'm particularly like any of them, but I've always responded to comedy that doesn't point itself as being comedy. ... That's where that straight-faced thing comes from. You're telling the joke without telling people you're telling the joke. You have to trust that they're going to get it. CNN: How about Jack Benny? He was always marvelous at being able to stand off to the side. Black: I think what was great about Jack Benny or anybody who sort of does that kind of thing -- that deadpan thing -- is you're allowing the audience to project their thoughts on to you. So you think you understand what Jack Benny's thinking ... but it's because it's what you're thinking. And what you're thinking is funny, and that's what makes you laugh. Does that make sense? CNN: Absolutely. Black: It's a theory I just made up. I feel really, really good about it. ... I'm gonna call it the ""Jack Benny Projection Theorem."" CNN: What do you think you'd be doing if it weren't for comedy? Black: Well, I don't know what recycled cans go for these days, but I suspect I'd be in that industry. CNN: Does ""Michael and Michael"" look like it will be renewed? Black: We just premiered last week, and it's just too early to know whether we'll come back or not. We've been fortunate. The press for the most part has been very good, and so now it's a ratings game and we'll wait and see how it does. CNN: You've worked consistently since the early '90s, but there's always the question of the big breakthrough. Your comedy might be too offbeat for the mainstream to get. Does that concern you? Black: Well, it certainly concerns the people who hold my mortgage. They're very concerned about it. They often say to me, ""Can't you be more mainstream?"" And the answer is, I don't think so. I've certainly tried. I can only be me. CNN: We're getting very philosophical here. Black: Well, that goes along with my Jack Benny Projection Theorem. CNN: Are you working on anything else? Black: I'm writing a book and I'm attempting to be a decent husband and father after not being home the last few months working on this television show. ... When you're working the kind of hours a television show requires, you don't see anybody but the people you work with. And as much as I love them, I don't love them as much as my family.","Michael Ian Black now in ""Michael and Michael Have Issues""

"(CNN) -- Anne and Michael Harris were an ""extraordinary"" couple with a zest for life, their niece said. Anne and Michael Harris' niece says the couple ""loved life, loved everyone."" ""We truly hope that they are remembered for the way they lived their lives and not this tragic end,"" Charlstie Laytin said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ""We're all just devastated and going to miss them both so much."" The Harrises were two of three Americans on board Air France Flight 447 when it crashed Monday. The plane was carrying 228 passengers and crew from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France, when it crashed four hours into the journey. Investigators have not determined the cause of the accident. An official list with the victims' names was not available Wednesday afternoon. The Harrises lived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Anne Harris' sister, Mary Miley, said. Michael Harris, 60, was a geologist in Rio de Janeiro. He worked for Devon Energy, a U.S.-based independent natural gas and oil producer, a company spokesman said. The couple were traveling to Paris for a training seminar and vacation, Miley said. The two ""loved everyone, they loved life,"" Laytin said. ""Definitely glass-half-full kind of people,"" she added, recalling her uncle as a ""ham,"" who could always offer a laugh on a bad day. She remembered a moment a few summers ago when her family was in Vermont, and had just seen a classical performance of Mozart. They were ""just sitting around and having a glass of wine, and laughing and talking about family and life and what was going on in our lives ... [the Harrises] could never get enough information about what all their nieces and nephews and family members were doing,"" she said. ""It's really the last time I can remember us all sitting around as a family and I'm so glad that I have that memory."" She said her family was hopeful the investigation would soon determine what had gone wrong. ""I think the initial shock of it all has really started to wear off, and the reality that they're gone is starting to set in,"" she said. ""The grief and the grieving process is beginning and we're just really focused on helping each other heal."" The majority of the people on the flight came from Brazil, France and Germany. The remaining victims were from 29 other countries. Ten were employees of French electrical equipment supplier CGED, according to Agence France-Presse. Nine of those employees had won the trip to Rio from CGED because of their strong work performance, AFP said. ""There was a competition for the best sales reps ... and nine of them won and went to Brazil for four days,"" Laurent Bouveresse, CGED chief executive, told AFP. The nine were allowed to take a friend or partner, and an executive also went along, Bouveresse said, according to the news agency. CNN tried repeatedly to reach representatives of CGED. Two others believed to have been on the flight were an engaged couple, Julia Schmidt of Brazil and Alex Crolow of Germany, the couple's friend, Brian Buzby of Houston, Texas, told CNN affiliate KTRK.  Watch Buzby talk about friends on Flight 447 » . Buzby said he met the two while they were all students at Bucerius Law School in Germany. They finished studies last August, KTRK reported. ""This was Alex taking her back to tell her mom they were going to get married,"" Buzby told KTRK. ""I just hope that they were not suffering, and at least they were together, because I would have hated for one of them to go through it alone,"" Buzby said. ""They were my two best friends.

"(CNN) -- Liverpool have secured the biggest sponsorship deal in the English Premier League club's history after they announced a four-year deal with Standard Chartered Bank. Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish and managing director Christian Purslow confirm the new sponsorship deal. The Reds have confirmed that the bank will replace current sponsors Carlsberg at the start of the 2010-11 season, ending a 17-year association with the Reds, for the beer maker. The figure for the sponsorship has not be disclosed but reports in British newspaper The Guardian suggest the deal is worth $133 million. Liverpool managing director Christian Purslow spoke of his delight on sealing the sponsorship agreement for the Anfield-based side. ""I am tremendously excited - it's a hugely important day in the history of Liverpool FC,"" he told the club's official Web site. ""This is the largest commercial agreement we have ever entered into. To have attracted a partner of the caliber of Standard Chartered Bank says everything about where we are trying to take this football club. ""They operate in a number of markets around the world where we have a long term plan to increase the family of Liverpool fans and this agreement will be very helpful to us in doing that."" Purslow added: ""Many branches in these countries will effectively be a shop window for Liverpool FC and a means of attracting more supporters to the cause. ""We aspire to be the best at what we do on and off the field. This is the first commercial agreement the club has entered into which can truly be described as the best of its kind in world football. ""I hope this tells everyone, especially our fans, what we are trying to do with this football club in the future."" The move follows Liverpool's American owners, George Gillett and Tom Hicks, concluding a deal in July to re-finance a $380 million bank loan they took out to buy the club in 2007. Plans to develop a new 60,000-seater stadium at a cost of $580 million were shelved due to the recession in 2008 by the club, despite planning permission being granted by the local city council.","Liverpool announce a new sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered Bank .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- An audio message attributed to Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest ranking former member of Saddam Hussein's regime still at large, salutes the ""People of Palestine"" and calls on them to fight back against Israel in Gaza. A 1999 file image of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who served under Saddam Hussien's regime and who is still at large. ""We say to the people of Gaza, give more resistance and we will be with you in the field, and know that our victory in kicking out the invaders is your victory as well, because the main assailant on the nation and on Palestine is the American imperialism,"" the recording said. ""A salute to the martyrs of the massacre, and our condolences to their families."" Al-Douri's recording follows reports of a similarly defiant message from al Qaeda's deputy chief a day earlier. Ayman al-Zawahiri reportedly vowed revenge for Israel's air and ground assault on Gaza and called Israel's actions against Hamas militants ""a gift"" from U.S. President-elect Barack Obama. Israel is in the 12th day of a military operation against Hamas militants, who have been firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel. Al-Douri's 30-minute recorded message was broadcast Wednesday on al-Raei Iraqi satellite television over an old picture of al-Douri, wearing his Iraqi military uniform. CNN has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the voice on the tape. This is not al-Douri's first purported audio message. There have been at least four others over the past three years in addition to a statement attributed to him. Al-Douri, 66, served as vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council. He remains at large nearly six years after the war in Iraq began. He has previously been reported killed and captured, although those reports later turned out to be erroneous. He was the King of Clubs (No. 6) on the U.S. military's card deck of most wanted regime officials. The U.S. military says he has helped finance the insurgency against U.S. troops in Iraq with Iraqi funds he transferred to Syria before Hussein's government collapsed in April 2002. But it says his influence has waned while he has been in hiding. U.S. officials say al-Douri played key roles in the chemical attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 and in putting down Kurdish and Shiite revolts after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.","Al-Douri was vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council .

"(CNN) -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth has been suspended indefinitely by the National Football League, days after he pleaded guilty to killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence of alcohol, the NFL said. Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth on Tuesday pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter. Stallworth, 28, pleaded guilty in a Florida court Tuesday to DUI manslaughter charges in the March death of construction worker Mario Reyes. Under terms of a plea agreement, he will serve 30 days. Prosecutors said he began serving his sentence immediately. ""The conduct reflected in your guilty plea resulted in the tragic loss of life and was inexcusable,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told Stallworth in a letter Thursday, the league said. Excerpts from the letter were posted on the NFL Web site. ""While the criminal justice system has determined the legal consequences of this incident, it is my responsibility as NFL commissioner to determine appropriate league discipline for your actions, which have caused irreparable harm to the victim and his family, your club, your fellow players and the NFL."" Stallworth's suspension is effective immediately, the league said. Goodell wrote in the letter that ""in due course"" the league would contact his attorney to schedule a meeting with him, after which a final determination would be made on discipline. Stallworth was driving his black Bentley GT east on the MacArthur Causeway, which connects Miami, Florida, to the South Beach area of Miami Beach, when he struck Reyes on the morning of March 14, according to prosecutors. He had been drinking at a Miami Beach club, according to court documents. His blood alcohol level was 0.126 percent, prosecutors said; Florida's legal limit is 0.08. Reyes, 59, reportedly was heading to a bus stop after work when he was struck. Court documents said he suffered ""critical head, chest and abdominal injuries"" and died at a hospital. When police arrived at the scene, Stallworth told them he was the driver of the car and admitted striking Reyes. During Tuesday's hearing, Stallworth offered his ""deepest condolences to the Reyes family."" ""Though I cannot bring back Mr. Reyes or ease his family's pain, I can and will honor his memory by committing my time, my resources and my voice by educating this community about the dangers of drunk driving,"" he said. Stallworth could have served up to 15 years in prison. But State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle noted in a statement that he cooperated with authorities and had no previous criminal record or traffic violations. Reyes' family supported the plea agreement, she said. Stallworth's attorney, Chris Lyons, on Tuesday told CNN sister network HLN that Stallworth had reached an ""amicable"" financial settlement with Reyes' family but would not disclose the amount. He said the length of Stallworth's jail term ""had nothing to do with Donte Stallworth being a celebrity, a professional football player or money."" Stallworth has shown ""genuine remorse"" and accepted responsibility for his actions, Lyons said. Goodell wrote Stallworth that there is ""ample evidence to warrant significant discipline"" under both the NFL's personal conduct and substance abuse policies. ""There is no reasonable dispute that your continued eligibility for participation at this time would undermine the integrity of and public confidence in the league,"" the letter said. ""Everyone associated with the league derives tremendous benefits from participating in our game and from the extraordinary support we receive from the public,"" Goodell wrote. ""With these benefits comes, among other things, the responsibility to conduct ourselves in a lawful and responsible way, with no entitlement to or expectation of favorable treatment."" Goodell notified NFL clubs earlier this year that there would be increased emphasis on addressing driving under the influence and other misconduct, the league said. It noted the NFL offers a ""safe rides"" program used by most clubs to provide players and other employees with alternative transportation if they have been drinking. Under terms of Stallworth's plea agreement, he will face two years of house arrest upon his release. He is also required to donate $2,500 to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, serve eight years of probation and submit to random drug and alcohol testing throughout his probation. His driver's license was permanently revoked. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","NEW: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calls Stallworth's action ""inexcusable""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Wendell Potter knows a little something about the health care industry's practices and is not afraid of to speak out as the health care reform debate heats up around the country. Wendell Potter once was a vice president in the public relations department for insurance giant Cigna. The former vice president of corporate communications at insurance giant Cigna, who left his post, says  the industry is playing ""dirty tricks"" in an effort to manipulate public opinion. ""Words matter, and the insurance industry is a master at linguistics and using the hot words, buzzwords, buzz expressions that they know will get people upset,"" he told CNN Wednesday. Now a senior fellow on health care for the watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy, Potter writes a blog on health care reform. He is focusing on efforts to defeat legislation supporting a government health care plan -- something he supports. In early July, Potter testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, telling senators that ""I know from personal experience that members of Congress and the public have good reason to question the honesty and trustworthiness of the insurance industry."" Potter described how underwriters at his former company would drive small businesses with expensive insurance claims to dump their Cigna policies. Industry executives refer to the practice as ""purging,"" Potter said. ""When that business comes up for renewal, the underwriters jack the rates up so much, the employer has no choice but to drop insurance,"" Potter had said. In an e-mail to CNN, Cigna spokesman Chris Curran denied the company engages in purging. ""We do not practice that. We will offer rates that are reflective of the competitive group health insurance market. We always encourage our clients to compare our proposed rates to those available from other carriers,"" Curran wrote. But now, Potter is back in Washington at the invitation from Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York. He is questioning insurance companies' public relations tactics -- and says some of the questions from town hall meetings are familiar.  Watch more on the health care reform debate » . ""People talk about the government takeover of the system ... that's a buzz term that comes straight out of the insurance industry,"" he said. A Cigna spokesman would not comment directly on Potter's accusations. Instead, the company released a written statement saying officials agree that health care reform is needed. But the statement went on to say that officials don't see how a government-sponsored plan can accomplish that. But Potter's concerns fall right in line with the Democrats' strategy of hitting insurance companies hard this summer. Republicans argue that insurance companies aren't solely to blame for the health care crisis, noting that many of their constituents are perfectly happy with the current system. The Democratic Party is also dealing with a group of fiscally conservative members known as ""Blue Dogs"" who are worried over the high costs of the health care plans being bandied about. Slaughter says that the concerns over a government option may be set up to ""try and protect one industry"" -- referring to the health insurance industry. Potter insists he has no agenda -- just a deep passion for the issue. ""This is hard to do. It's scary to do something like this. I don't think I'm any more courageous than anybody but I feel I had to do this."" Potter also has said he decided to resign in 2007 after Cigna's controversial handling of an insurance claim made by the family of a California teenager, Nataline Sarkysian. The Sarkysian family made repeated appeals at news conferences for Cigna to approve a liver transplant for the 17-year-old, who had leukemia. Cigna initially declined to cover the operation, then reversed its decision. Sarkysian died hours after the company's reversal. CNN's Jim Acosta and Bonnie Knapp contributed to this report.","Wendell Potter is a former vice president at insurance giant Cigna .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A $15.5 million payout made by oil giant Shell to settle a lawsuit brought against it by relations of executed Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists will allow the families of the victims to move on with their lives, Saro-Wiwa's son has told CNN. Saro-Wiwa said the settlement would allow the families of the victims to draw a line under the past. The New York lawsuit -- brought to court by the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of Saro-Wiwa's family and others in 1996 -- accused Shell's Nigerian subsidiary of complicity in the writer's 1995 hanging and the killings or persecution of other environmental activists in the Niger Delta. Nigeria's Ogoni people have complained for years that Shell was allowed to pollute its land without consequences. Saro-Wiwa's death sparked a worldwide outcry, and his movement ultimately forced Shell out of the oil- and gas-rich Ogoniland region. ""It enables us to draw a line under the past and actually face the future with something tangible, some hope that this is the beginning of a better engagement between all the stakeholders in this issue,"" Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr. told CNN. Shell said it ""had no part in the violence that took place"" but called the settlement ""a humanitarian gesture to set up a trust fund to benefit the Ogoni people."" Shell fought the lawsuit until last week, when a federal appellate court ruled that the plaintiffs could sue the company's Nigerian subsidiary in American courts, overturning a March decision in the company's favor. Saro-Wiwa said the case set a precedent for oil companies operating in regions such as West Africa by demonstrating that they could ""be brought to trial in America for human rights violations in Africa.""  Watch Saro-Wiwa discuss how he hopes the case will set a precedent » . ""Justice is always hard won... It took 13 years to go through the legal process but clearly before we started this corporations throught they could almost operate with impunity but now the legal landscape has changed,"" he said. Roughly half of the settlement will go into a trust fund to help the people of Nigeria's Ogoni region, according to court papers.","Ken Saro-Wiwa's son says Shell payout will let families move on with lives .

"(CNN) -- Fans of Usher Raymond IV view him as a singing, dancing and acting superstar. Superstar performer Usher Raymond IV at the closing ceremony for Usher's Camp New Look. But to a special group of young people, he is a mentor and a friend. ""He leads by example,"" said Arnold ""Supa"" LaFrance, a ""Mogul in Training"" at Usher's Camp New Look. ""Usher's all about peace and love and giving back to the community, and it's genuine. He does it when the cameras are on and when the cameras are off."" Now in its fifth year, the camp is a passion for the Grammy Award-winning artist, who each year gives more than a hundred teens from underserved communities across the country the opportunity to learn about the entertainment and sports industries. Thomas Springer, a 17-year-old Atlanta, Georgia, resident, has participated in the camp for four years and said he wants to use his talent in filmmaking and what he has learned at Camp New Look to help his community. ""Before I came to camp, I didn't think I had a voice in my community and that I could do anything based on my age,"" Springer said. ""The camp let me know that no matter what your age, no matter what you do, you can make an impact on your community."" Usher came to fame as a teen and has sold millions of records, including the hit singles ""Yeah"" and ""Confessions II."" His success has allowed him to become part owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team and to launch his own line of fragrances for men and women. The camp, the singer said, teaches participants the business aspects of the entertainment and sports industries and imparts the importance of being service-oriented. A selection committee selects campers that are nominated by partner organizations in various cities across the country. Now the father of two young boys, Usher said he is also enriched by the camp's experience. ""It makes me a better man. It makes me a better individual,"" he said. ""There's a difference between hard work and heart work, and this would represent heart work.""  Watch Usher talk about his camp » . As a youngster, Usher participated in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and he said it helped shape his ideas about mentoring. ""I think that the Boys & Girls Club is a very positive environment for kids,"" he said. ""It's another place that allows you to be a product of your experience. I encountered a lot of people who became mentors for me there."" At this year's closing ceremony for Usher's Camp New Look, held at the Alliance Theater at Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, the energy level was high as campers and their family members walked a red carpet alongside some of Usher's celebrity friends, including NBA star Alonzo Mourning and San Francisco 49er Allen Rossum. The free, residential camp held for two weeks every summer in Atlanta is an outgrowth of Usher's New Look Foundation, which he established to empower at-risk youth by giving them the skills necessary to enter careers in the sports and entertainment industries and working with them to provide employment opportunities. Mourning said Usher is one who understands that ""to whom much is given, much is required."" ""The service that Usher is providing for these kids with these educational opportunities and expanding their lives to a whole new level, it's important that we all rally around these particular causes and support these initiatives,"" Mourning said. Gabrielle Brou, 16, a first-year camper from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, who aspires to be an actress, said there were countless opportunities at camp to network with successful people who are living the lives she hopes to achieve. ""Once I found out that there were ways I could better myself in acting, learn the business and also give back ... I decided that this camp would be really great for me,"" she said. ""I would love to do it again next year."" Having a day set aside for the campers and their families to revel in all that they have achieved and their future possibilities left Usher with a huge smile on his face. ""It's really good to see them be able to live out their dreams,"" he said.","Usher's Camp New Look helps kids from underserved communities .

"(CNN) -- The Toyota-owned Fuji International Speedway circuit will stop hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from next year -- the track operators have announced. The Toyota-owned Fuji circuit will not be hosting the Japanese Grand Prix due to financial concerns. Fuji Speedway hosted the Formula One race in 2007 and 2008. The race is set to return to the Honda-owned Suzuka circuit this year, and was due back at Fuji for the 2010 race -- as the 16th leg of the 18-race Formula One series. The two venues were originally due to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix but, due to the current downturn in the global economy, Fuji Speedway have confirmed they will no longer host the event. Fuji Speedway opened in 1965. It staged F1 races in 1976 and in 1977, when a spectator and steward died after a Ferrari driven by Gilles Villeneuve ploughed into the crowd. ""We decided it would be extremely difficult to continue holding the F1 Japanese Grand Prix in view of sharply deteriorating business conditions and few signs of a rapid economic recovery,"" Fuji International Speedway said in a statement. ""I apologize deeply for being unable to live up to expectations. It is truly heartbreaking,"" Hiroaki Kato, president of the the company that runs the circuit, told reporters. Kato said the economic downturn was causing a dramatic fall in the number of people attending motor sports events as the world's second-largest economy struggles through its worst recession since World War II. ""We are afraid that unless we circuit operators and promoters grit our teeth and support domestic motorsports, it will not be able to keep on going,"" he added. Toyota's decision to pull outcomes as the global economic crisis forces Japanese automakers to slash costs. Honda has sold its Formula One team while Suzuki and Subaru have withdrawn from the world rally championship. Motorcycle maker Kawasaki has exited the MotoGP and Mitsubishi is quitting the Dakar Rally despite a dozen victories. Toyota overtook American rival General Motors in 2008 as the world's top selling automaker but fell into the red for the first time in the year to March with a net loss of 436.9 billion yen ($4.6 billion). It expects a bigger net loss of 550 billion yen this year.","Fuji International Speedway circuit will stop hosting the Japanese Grand Prix .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military hopes to kill or capture some 50 Afghan drug traffickers with financial ties to the Taliban in an effort to shut down one of the insurgency's biggest sources of revenue, a U.S. Senate report says. Afghan men smoke heroin in the city of Herat on August 7, 2009. The new plan is the first time the U.S. military has been directly involved in anti-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan, and commanders say it is an essential part of the overall plan to stabilize the country, which is under heavy Taliban influence. Until now the U.S. military has left the eradication programs to other U.S. agencies and the Afghan military, keeping its ""most wanted"" list to insurgent leaders tied to bomb making, weapons smuggling or facilitating foreign fighters into the country. ""The change is dramatic for a military that once ignored the drug trade flourishing in front of its eyes,"" according to the report. ""No longer are U.S. commanders arguing that going after the drug lords is not part of their mandate."" It does not name the 50 targets, but says they are on a list of 367 names of Taliban and other insurgents targeted by the U.S. military. ""Some"" of the 50 have already been apprehended or killed, according to a senior military official. The official would not quantify the amount further and would not speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue. The yet-to-be released report was prepared by staff for members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A copy was provided to CNN. It is based on testimony by U.S. military officials to the committee. Bush-era efforts by the United States and the U.S.-trained Afghan Army to eliminate poppy farms did very little to solve the problem, with numerous farmers' crops flourishing while other farmers were left with no source of income and bitterness toward the Afghan government, the report concludes. It criticizes former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for failing to push forward on a military role in drug eradication even after being shown proof of the connection between the drug lords and the Taliban. The change in the U.S. military's approach to fighting the drug war came last fall after the United States told NATO members that the drug trade was a threat to NATO troops because there was a direct connection between it and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. ""There is what we call a nexus of insurgency. There's a very broad range of militant groups that are combined with the criminality, with the narco-trafficking system, with corruption, that form a threat and a challenge to the future of that great country,"" then-U.S. commander in Afghanistan Gen. David McKiernan told reporters at the Pentagon last October. But with a new approach to the war by the Obama administration, the United States has started attacking the drug problem head on. According to the report, this year U.S. and NATO combat forces started attacking militants, drug labs and buildings connected to insurgents with ties to drug lords for the first time since the start of the war in 2001. Referring to people tied to narcotics and militants, the report says, ""The military places no restrictions on the use of force with these selected targets, which means they can be killed or captured on the battlefield."" The Pentagon's spokesman said the effort is still focused on fighting terrorism. ""There is a well-established link [between] the drug trade and financing of the insurgency and terrorism,"" said spokesman Bryan Whitman. ""It's important to delineate that we target terrorists that are connected to the drug trade. ... Terrorist do interface with drug networks and we know they provide finance for the insurgency, and it's this nexus that creates the security and force-protection issues that make them a legitimate target."" A major U.S. Marine offensive against the Taliban was launched last month in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, home to the majority of the poppy farms and opium trade. The report says the Taliban make about $70 million a year on the drug trade. The report concedes that counter-narcotics alone will not win the war, but says slowing the flow of illicit money will play a crucial role in ""determining whether we can carve out the space required to provide the security and economic development necessary to bring a level of stability to Afghanistan.""","Report: U.S. military pursuing 50 Afghan drug traffickers tied to Taliban .

"(CNN) -- A Mexican man who was allegedly killed on orders from his own cartel believed they were hunting for him after he began working as an informant and was fearful for his life, according to court documents. Police say soldier Michael Jackson Apodaca, 18, acted as the gunman. Jose Daniel Gonzalez Galeana began to worry after he began working as an informant for immigration officials in the United States. ""The victim was concerned for his own well-being and the safety of his family,"" the documents said, referencing statements the victim made to a witness. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials gave Gonzalez a visa so he could live in El Paso, Texas, his fellow Juarez cartel members began to get suspicious, El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said at a press conference. Allen said Gonzalez's exit from Mexico, combined with a raid on a cartel warehouse and the arrest of cartel lieutenant Pedro ""El Tigre"" Aranas Sanchez led cartel members to believe he might be working as an informant, Allen said. Then, a Mexican newspaper named Gonzalez as an informant in the arrest of the high-ranking cartel member, according to court documents. Police say Gonzales quickly became the target of his own cartel. Police said Gonzalez knew if his fellow cartel members found him, he would likely be killed, police said. On May 15, the cartel found him. He was shot eight times outside his home in El Paso, Texas, police said. Pfc. Michael Jackson Apodaca, 18, Ruben Rodriguez Dorado, 30, and Christopher Andrew Duran, 17, were each named as suspects Monday and each are facing one count of capital murder. The three men are being held on $1 million bond. Police said Apodaca was the shooter, Duran was the getaway car driver, and Rodriguez was the one who coordinated the murder. On Wednesday, police also arrested a 16-year-old who they said was involved in the surveillance and reconnaissance of the victim. The juvenile also faces one count of capital murder. Rodriguez and the victim were in the Juarez cartel, based across the border from El Paso, police spokesman Chris Mears said. He said police believe Apodaca and Duran were not cartel members. Apodaca joined the Army a year ago and worked as a crew member on a Patriot missile launcher, officials at Fort Bliss in El Paso said. ""He was in the top of his class,"" said Dave Jackson, his grandfather. ""You talk to all his sergeants. He's a good soldier. Now, before he went in [and joined the Army], he was in, he was in with a bad crowd."" Investigators said at the press conference they think the three suspects met through a relative of Rodriguez. ""He [Rodriguez] was the older guy, he provided the alcohol, the party locations,"" police Lt. Alfred Lowe said. ""And he recruited these people to do his bidding."" Once the three men were allegedly hired, they were ""told to find the victim in the United States,"" Allen said. Rodriguez paid the victim's cell phone bill hoping he would be able to learn where he lived, federal officials learned, according to court documents. Federal law enforcement was apparently concerned enough about the incident that officers told local law enforcement to signal Gonzalez's home could be at risk. Hours before the slaying, police said Rodriguez called a tactical supply store that exclusively sells the same brand of ammunition found at the scene. The suspects found Gonzalez at a relative's home in Canutillo, Texas, and followed him back to his home before shooting him, police said. The three arrested men's phone records showed their approximate locations on the night of the killing and corroborated that the suspects were tracking the victim, according to court documents. During an interrogation, Rodriguez told investigators he ordered Gonzalez's execution, police said. But Allen also said during the press conference that Rodriguez planned the killing and hired the other suspects after he was given the order by cartel lieutenant Jesus Aguayo Salas. Police said there was also a warrant out for his arrest. Rodriguez told police he paid the participants for their role in the killing, the affidavit said. It said he also noted that he was a midlevel member of the cartel, which he called the ""Compania,"" and said he was in charge of coordinating surveillance for the cartel, ""following intended victims up until their execution."" Duran and Rodriguez told police that Apodaca was paid to be the shooter and Duran to drive the getaway car, according to the affidavit. Allen said both men were each paid ""quite a robust amount of money ... under $10,000, in that area."" Police said more arrests could still come in the case. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Tracy Sabo, Mallory Simon and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","Police say victim believed if cartel found him, he would be killed .

"(CNN) -- The price of big screen televisions has been coming down, but this was ridiculous. Best Buy's Web site offered a 52-inch TV for less than $10, but the deal was too good to be true. Early Wednesday morning, BestBuy.com listed a 52-inch Samsung HDTV for $9.99 -- a savings of more than $1600. As customers jumped on the Web site trying to take advantage of the offer, Best Buy announced it was a ""pricing error"" and was no longer available. A recorded message on Best Buy's customer service line told customers ""we will not be placing any more orders for this unit,"" and messages were sent on Twitter apologizing ""for any disappointment."" Customers who placed orders early Wednesday were left wondering if they got away with the bargain. Eric VanBergen of Grand Rapids, Michigan, told CNN he snapped one up for $84.79 -- including $70 shipping and taxes -- at 5:30 a.m. Then, he ordered a second. Dozens of customers were posting to Twitter and Bestbuy.com, saying they also placed often multiple orders. It appears they are out of luck. In a statement, Best Buy apologized for the mistake but said it would ""not be honoring the incorrect price."" Company representatives posted online messages telling customers ""All current and previous orders made for the TV at this price on BestBuy.com will be cancelled, and customers will be refunded in full for the purchase."" The company's Web site states Best Buy reserves the right to ""revoke offers or correct errors"" even if a credit card has already been charged. The price mix-up gave way to customer frustration as people lost out on the deal of the year. "".bestbuy dang you!!!!"" was how VanBergen reacted on Twitter after learning that his two confirmation e-mails from Best Buy were meaningless. But it appears there is little else they can do. A spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission that investigates consumer complaints told CNN ""The FTC act bars unfair and deceptive commercial practices."" Those would be cases of phony offers or sweepstakes, rather than a mistake, she said.","Best Buy's Web site offers 52-inch HDTV on Web site for less than $10 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Two days after the death of Michael Jackson, the family of the pop superstar thanked his fans for their condolences and support in ""one of the darkest moments of our lives."" A girl holds up signs in memory of Michael Jackson outside New York's Apollo Theater on Saturday. ""Please do not despair, because Michael will continue to live on in each and every one of you,"" family patriarch Joseph Jackson said in a statement to People magazine obtained by CNN. ""Continue to spread his message, because that is what he would want you to do. Carry on, so his legacy will live forever,"" the statement told fans. ""Our beloved son, brother and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon,"" the statement said. ""It leaves us, his family, speechless and devastated to a point, where communication with the outside world seems almost impossible at times.""  Watch how one fan mourns pop star » . Family members including Jackson's mother, Katherine, were at the estate Jackson had rented in Holmby Hills. Around midday, two moving vans pulled up. One left empty, and the other apparently contained objects from the house. Other vehicles came and went, including a silver Range Rover driven by a plain clothes police officer. Meanwhile, the doctor who may have been the last person to see Michael Jackson alive was expected to meet with police Saturday along with his lawyer, an associate of attorney Ed Chernoff said. Matthew Alford, an associate of Stradley, Chernoff and Alford law firm in Houston, Texas, said Dr. Conrad Murray, who is represented by Chernoff, was upset but willing to cooperate.  Watch what Alford said about doctor's involvement » . The ongoing meeting could spill into Sunday, according to the firm. ""It's a human tragedy, and he's upset obviously over the loss of Mr. Jackson. But he is not a suspect in the death of Mr. Jackson,"" Alford said. ""We intend to cooperate fully."" Los Angeles police, who met briefly with Murray after Michael Jackson's death, had been trying to set up an interview, Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Charlie Beck said. ""Is important to interview everybody that was in contact with Mr. Jackson immediately prior to his demise particularly anyone involved in his medical care,"" Beck said. ""So it's extremely important to talk to his doctor."" Police said the doctor has been cooperating. Jackson's family suspects that Murray can answer some questions about the singer's death, but they have been unable to contact him, the Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN on Saturday. The parents need to know what happened in the last hours of Michael Jackson's life, Jesse Jackson said. ""The routine inquiry is now an investigation,"" Jesse Jackson said. ""They (Jacksons) didn't know the doctor. ... He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son."" Alford said Murray has ""not been hiding out. He's just being prudent."" Detectives impounded Murray's car, which was parked at the singer's rented home, because it may contain evidence related to Jackson's death, possibly prescription medications. Police have released no information on what they may have found. Alford said he did not have any details. ""I have no information as to what if any treatment, or course of treatment he was doing for Mr. Jackson at all,"" he said. Michael Jackson died Thursday, and an autopsy was performed the following day. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office told reporters Friday that more tests must be conducted before a cause of death can be determined. That could take four to six weeks. The coroner said there was no indication of external trauma or foul play.  Watch the coroner's spokesman discuss the autopsy » . The 50-year-old pop star was discovered unconscious Thursday by paramedics at his home, where Murray apparently had tried to revive him. He was rushed to a Los Angeles medical center, where he was pronounced dead.

Watch Jesse Jackson detail the family's concerns » . There are lingering questions, such as: ""How long had he stopped breathing? How long had he been unconscious?"" he said. Jackson had been preparing for a comeback tour -- aimed at extending his legendary career and helping him to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.

"(CNN) -- Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the sister of President John F. Kennedy and a champion of the disabled who founded the Special Olympics, died Tuesday, the Special Olympics said. She was 88. Eunice Kennedy Shriver speaks at a dinner in honor of the Special Olympics in July 2006. Born on July 10, 1921, in Brookline, Massachusetts, Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics, which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962. Today, 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations, according to the Special Olympics. ""She was the light of our lives, a mother, wife, grandmother, sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others,"" the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement. ""For each of us, she often seemed to stop time itself -- to run another Special Olympics Games, to visit us in our homes, to attend to her own mother, her sisters and brothers, and to sail, tell stories, and laugh and serve her friends."" No final decision has been made on funeral arrangements, a source close to the family said. Shriver's husband, R. Sargent Shriver, and her five children and their spouses and all of her 19 grandchildren were with her when she died, the Special Olympics said in a statement.  Watch a look at Eunice Kennedy Shriver's life » . ""We are tremendously grateful for the extreme outpouring of support and prayer from the public as we honor our beloved founder,"" Brady Lum, Special Olympics president and chief operating officer, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Today we celebrate the life of a woman who had the vision to create our movement. It is an enormous loss, but I know we can rest assured that her legacy will live on through her family, friends, and the millions of people around the world who she touched and transformed."" Even before launching the Special Olympics in 1968, Shriver had established a reputation as an advocate for the disenfranchised and a trailblazer for the rights of the disabled through a variety of roles in the private and public sector. She also persuaded the Kennedy family to go public with one of its most guarded secrets. In September 1962, Shriver wrote an article about her mentally disabled sister, Rosemary, which was published in The Saturday Evening Post. At an event honoring her in 2007, Shriver spoke of her life: ""Most people believe I spent my whole life really interested in only one thing and that one thing is working to make the world a better place for people with intellectual disabilities. ""As important as it has been, it is not the whole story of my life. My life is about being lucky as a child to be raised by parents who loved me and made me believe in possibilities. It is also about being lucky to have had these extraordinary children. ... It is also about being especially lucky to have a wonderful husband.""  Watch Shriver reflect on her life » . At the same event, Edward Kennedy paid tribute to his sister, saying she had inherited the best qualities from his parents, including compassion. ""She had that sense no one should be left out or left behind. She picked this up, obviously, at a very early age. All of us could see that special relationship that Eunice had with Rosemary."" After receiving a degree in sociology from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, Shriver worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division from 1943 to 1945, helping former prisoners of war readjust to civilian life. From 1947 to 1948, she worked for $1 at the Department of Justice as executive secretary for the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency.  See highlights of Shriver's public and private life » . In the early 1950s, she was a social worker at a federal prison for women in West Virginia and in juvenile court in Chicago, Illinois. She married Sargent Shriver Jr., a World War II veteran who was building his career as a lawyer and public servant, in 1953. The couple's five children include California's first lady, Maria Shriver. Sargent Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s, including Head Start and the Peace Corps. He also worked with his wife on the Special Olympics. He ran President Johnson's War on Poverty and was U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970. He was Democrat George McGovern's running mate in the 1972 presidential election. In 1957, Eunice Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, which was established in 1946 to honor the family's eldest son -- who was killed in World War II -- to research the causes of disabilities and to improve the treatment of disabled people.  Watch Shriver receive a special honor » . Her work with the foundation paved the way for a number of initiatives furthering the cause of disability advocacy. In 1962 she helped establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a government agency that conducts research on topics related to the health of children, adults and families that was named after Shriver in 2008. Disturbed by the treatment of disabled people in institutions across the country in the 1950s and 1960s, Shriver began inviting disabled children to a summer day camp, called Camp Shriver, on her farm in Maryland. Her vision expanded over the years, and in July 1968 the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago. She also assisted in the establishment of a network of university-affiliated facilities and intellectual disabilities research centers at major medical schools across the United States, including centers for the study of medical ethics at Harvard and Georgetown universities in 1971. In 1981, Shriver began the Community of Caring program to reduce disabilities among babies of teenagers. That led to the establishment of Community of Caring programs in 1,200 public and private schools from 1990 to 2006. Along the way, Shriver earned worldwide accolades and awards, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame's Founder's Award and nine honorary degrees. In 1995, the U.S. Mint issued a commemorative coin with her portrait. The Mint says that made her the first living woman to be depicted on an American coin. In 2009, a painting of Shriver with several Special Olympians was added to the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery.  See images from Shriver's life » . Her health began to fail in recent years, landing her in the hospital in 2005 after a minor stroke and hip fracture. She was hospitalized again in 2007 for an undisclosed ailment. In addition to her husband and daughter, Shriver is survived by her sons Robert Sargent Shriver III, Timothy Perry Shriver, Mark Kennedy Shriver and Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver.","NEW: ""She often seemed to stop time itself,"" family says in statement .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- The hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery took on a different tone Monday -- the usually quiet and reverent resting place of fallen heroes was buzzing with volunteers, professional landscapers and their equipment during the annual ""Renewal and Remembrance"" project. Monday was the annual ""Renewal and Remembrance"" day at Arlington National Cemetery. ""Renewal"" was started more than 10 years ago by an Ohio lawn-care group that wanted to give a day of service to the cemetery outside Washington, according to Bill Hildebolt, spokesman for the Professional Landcare Network. ""It's grown fantastically from a few lawn-care operators to today we had over 400 individual PLANET members,"" he said Monday. Each year, volunteers take on several projects during the service day, including spreading lime over nearly 300 acres of the cemetery and installing irrigation systems, Hildebolt said. While the 95 companies participating Monday may normally compete for business in the lawn-care market, during Renewal the crews work together to honor the service members buried at Arlington. ""It's just a day of remembrance,"" said Jeff Dietrich of Pennsylvania-based Joshua Tree, who has been volunteering for four years. A crew of arborists from the Joshua Tree company took on one the most expensive projects -- protecting Arlington's biggest trees from lightning. According to Dietrich, the process of lightning protection is important for protecting a valuable part of history.  Watch how trees are protected » . ""Lightning, electricity is unpredictable at best. ... It'll blow a tree apart."" To protect a tree from lightning strikes, Dietrich and his crew climb up to the top of a tree and run copper wires down the trunk with anchors that resemble rifle cartridges. The wire is then grounded by a copper pole entrenched at the base of the tree. If lightning strikes, the electricity runs down the wire and dissipates into the ground instead of harming the tree. Even though it took the Joshua Tree crew longer to reach Arlington from Pennsylvania than the four hours needed to complete their work, the workers seemed eager for their chance to volunteer, cheering each other on while working and sharing some trade secrets with other crews. ""How many people can say they get to come down to Arlington, especially if they're not from around here, and climb some of these trees?"" said Deitrich. For Hildebolt, providing a service for the national cemetery is a way to make a national contribution. ""It's a privilege,"" he said. ""It's a very humbling experience that I'm very proud of.""","Landscapers volunteer during annual ""Renewal and Remembrance"" project .

"(CNN) -- A woman and three children were killed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when a suspected robber fleeing in a car jumped a curb and struck them, police said Thursday. Four people were killed after a car fleeing police struck a home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday. ""He literally cut a tree in half,"" Police Commissioner Charles H.

"(AOL Autos) -- If you have a heavy foot and may travel a bit over the speed limit, you might want to keep an eye out for these popular police car models. Not all police cars are as clearly marked as this one. What to watch for on the interstate . The Ford Crown Victoria is the most popular police car currently in production. Renowned for its durability, many speeders have seen this unfortunate sight in their rear view mirror. But there are other patrol vehicles that road warriors should recognize, and many of them are faster than the popular Crown Vicky. Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor: The standard . Officers value the Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor for its durability, size, and overall performance. These cruisers feature reinforced frames, a special 4.6-liter V-8, and other heavy-duty components that enable them to handle high-speed chases. According to The Michigan State Police, the fastest Crown Victoria Interceptor will hit 128 mph. Chevrolet Impala: Under the radar . The Chevy Impala is one of the best-selling cars in the U.S. This makes it the perfect choice for police departments who want a car that blends in with traffic. The Impala's familiar shape doesn't stand out or call attention to itself. Fitted with the special Police Package (code 9C1), this mid-size sedan with a 3.9-liter V-6 engine hits an impressive 140 mph. Chevrolet Tahoe: Probably not taking kids to soccer camp . Some police departments need the strength and power that only a full-size SUV can deliver. Fitted with the special PPV option, the big Chevy Tahoe SUV can hit 133 mph thanks to its high-performance 5.3-liter V-8 with 320 horsepower. Look for the black wheels with tiny center hubcaps as a tip-off should you see one unmarked or without a light bar. Dodge Magnum: The wagon that knows how to haul . Dodge produced their last Magnum police car in 2008, but many police departments still have these station wagons in service. Fitted with the legendary 5.7-liter HEMI V-8, the wagon can hit 131 mph and charge up to that speed with muscle-car type performance. The wagon sprints from 0-60 mph in under six seconds. AOL Autos: Wonder wagons . HUMMER H3: Special duty . The H3 may be the smallest model in the HUMMER family, but it remains a very capable off-road vehicle. The police-version of the H3 is fortified for running off-road and carries other equipment necessary for police duty. The H3 can be equipped with a 5.3-liter V-8, but high-speed pursuit is not this vehicle's forte, except when the chase is across a desert, through fields, or over the Rubicon. Harley-Davidson Electra Glide: King of the road . Police departments also utilize an assortment of motorcycles in their quest to keep motorists safe. The Michigan State Police test two-wheelers on an annual basis and the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide is a perennial favorite. While the Harley offers other performance benefits, with a top speed of just 104 mph, they are not the best for high-speed pursuits. Dodge Charger: That cop car's got a HEMI! The sight of a Dodge Charger police car should be enough to make you think twice about attempting to out run an officer behind the wheel of one of these. Equipped with the 5.7-liter HEMI V-8, the Charger can hit a staggering 146 mph. This makes the Dodge the fastest mainstream police car available. But what about vehicles that aren't mainstream? AOL Autos: Fast cars --join the 600 horsepower club . Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 . Harper Woods, Michigan borders Detroit: It's a relatively quiet bedroom community that packs a big surprise for anyone speeding on the section of Interstate 94 running across its borders: a 2005 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Acquired to boost ""community relations"" and to intimidate speeders, the Shelby's supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 puts out 450 horsepower and will easily exceed 150 mph. AOL Autos: First drive of 2010 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 . Police ID: What to look for in unmarked vehicles . Departments often use unmarked vehicles, many of which will be identical to their fully outfitted cruisers. Unmarked cars and trucks enable more stealthy operations. Tips for identifying unmarked police cars include looking for; light bars mounted in the rear window, municipal license plates, painted black wheels, and dividers between the front and rear seats.

"(CNN)  -- A Southwest Airlines jet made an emergency landing in Charleston, West Virginia, on Monday after a football-sized hole in its fuselage caused the cabin to depressurize, an airline spokeswoman said. Southwest Flight 2294 made an emergency landing at Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, on Monday. There were no injuries aboard the Boeing 737, which was traveling at about 34,000 feet when the problem occurred, Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis told CNN. The sudden drop in cabin pressure caused the jet's oxygen masks to deploy. Southwest Flight 2294 was en route from Nashville, Tennessee, to Baltimore, Maryland, with 126 passengers and a crew of five aboard, McInnis said. It landed at 5:10 p.m. after the crew reported a football-sized hole in the middle of the cabin near the top of the aircraft, McInnis said. What caused the damage to the jet had not been determined, she said. Both the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident, FAA spokeswoman Holly Baker said. ""There is no responsible way to speculate as to a cause at this point,"" Southwest said in a statement Monday night.  Watch as passenger describes watching the hole form » . ""We have safety procedures in place, and they were followed in this instance to get all passengers and crew safely on the ground,"" the airline said. ""Reports we have are that our passengers were calm and that our pilots and flight attendants did a great job getting the aircraft on the ground safely."" Southwest dispatched a replacement aircraft to take passengers on to Baltimore.  See map of flight path » . Charleston airport spokesman Brian Belcher said a local pizzeria provided food for the passengers as they waited. The damaged jet will remain on the ground there until federal inspectors can examine it, he said. In addition, all 181 of Southwest's 737-300s -- about a third of the airline's fleet -- will be inspected overnight after the emergency landing, McInnis said. Southwest does not expect the inspections to create delays, she said.

"(CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has suspended two air traffic controllers over last week's collision of two aircraft over the Hudson River that killed nine people, a spokeswoman said. The wreckage of a plane that collided with a helicopter is lifted this week from the Hudson River. A controller at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport handling the flight of a Piper airplane carrying three people ""was involved in apparently inappropriate conversations on the telephone at the time of the accident,"" FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said in a statement Thursday. A source with knowledge of the investigation said the controller was on the phone with his girlfriend ""after he cleared the pilot for takeoff; he was still on the phone at the time of the crash."" In addition, ""the supervisor was not present in the building as required,"" Brown said. ""While we have no reason to believe at this time that these actions contributed to the accident, this kind of conduct is unacceptable, and we have placed the employees on administrative leave and have begun disciplinary proceedings,"" she said.  Watch amateur video of the moment of impact » . ""These are serious violations of the FAA regulations,"" said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general for the Transportation Department. The union for air traffic controllers urged caution. ""We support that any such allegation is fully investigated before there is a rush to judgment about the behavior of any controller,"" said a statement from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The National Transportation Safety Board is working with the FAA in investigating Saturday's collision of the Piper, which had taken off from Teterboro, with a sightseeing helicopter that was carrying five Italian tourists and a pilot. No one aboard either aircraft survived the crash. The NTSB has said the pilot of the small plane was cleared electronically and handed off to Newark, New Jersey, air traffic controllers, a standard procedure. However, Newark's control tower never got a verbal response from the pilot of the small plane. The controller put on leave was described as a longtime employee, the source said. He and the supervisor face disciplinary action that could include their firing. Also Thursday, FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said the agency may reissue advisories to pilots using the busy airspace over the Hudson. Pilots are urged to use a radio frequency dedicated to traffic in that corridor, fly no faster than 140 knots and turn on their lights as they enter that airspace. Babbitt made the comments at an event at the agency's research facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

"She told stories, flirted outrageously with boys and was constantly changing her hairstyle. Anne Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office in Amsterdam. It could be the description of almost any young girl growing up in Europe. But this is how Eva Schloss remembers her childhood friend Anne Frank, who had she not died in a Nazi concentration camp, would have celebrated her 80th birthday this week. Schloss described Frank, whose account of hiding from Jewish persecution in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam is one of the world's mostly widely-read books, as a spunky young schoolgirl with a passion for storytelling that often got her into trouble. ""She got her diary in 1942, so obviously her father knew she was interested in writing and I know she told stories,"" said Schloss. ""She talked a lot and she was called Mrs Quack Quack. Very often she used to write hundreds of lines [at school] of 'I'm not going to talk so much,' and so on -- but obviously she had a lot to tell."" In some ways the two friends lived parallel lives -- but tragically they had very different outcomes.  Watch more about Schloss' story » . Schloss and Frank both came from Jewish families who fled to Holland to escape the wave of anti-Semitism spreading across Europe as the Nazis rose to power in Germany ahead of the Second World War. But while Schloss was more of an introvert, Frank loved the limelight. Schloss said: ""I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention. We had steps where we sat, and she had a crowd of children around her. ""She was a big flirt -- she loved boys. She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time. She was always interested in her clothes. Her style, she always changed it. Sometimes she had curls, then she had straight hair."" Schloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe, placing their lives in increasing jeopardy. ""Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened. ""You couldn't go out anymore after 8 o'clock, but for a 11 to 12 year old it didn't matter so much. Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we couldn't do, but we really didn't really take it seriously at that time."" Like Frank, Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland. Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office. But Schloss and her family had to split up. Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere. She and her mother moved around, staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period. Eventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps, where Frank died at the age of 15. Schloss said: ""My father and brother were betrayed by a Dutch nurse who was a double agent, and all four of us were arrested and taken to the headquarters to be interrogated. ""I didn't know anything, which was a good thing. So eventually they realized this and they gave up torturing me. Within two days we were put on a transport to Auschwitz."" Of her family, only Schloss and her mother survived Auschwitz, one of the most notorious concentration camps, located in southern Poland. Today Schloss, who has just celebrated her own 80th birthday, has a husband, three daughters and five grandchildren. Schloss says it took her decades to rebuild her life, with the help of Frank's father Otto, who also survived incarceration in a concentration camp. She met Otto in August 1945, when he showed her Frank's diary. Schloss said: ""He read a few passages but he always burst into tears. It took me 20 years. I was really unhappy, but it was Otto who came to our apartment to talk to us, and he helped me a lot. He had lost everybody. ""Her book, she [Frank] made people aware of what happened. There are many messages. She believed in the goodness of mankind. ""People always ask me, what she would have done. I guess we will never know. But I guess she would have gone into politics -- she was a fighter. It's a pity, but also -- maybe her diary would have never been published.""

"(CNN) -- The music isn't new, but the discovery that a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ""almost certainly"" composed it is a stunning revelation. A researcher in Austria says the works were probably transcribed by Mozart's father, as young Mozart played. The two compositions -- a concerto in G and a prelude in G -- have long been in the files at the International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg, Austria, as anonymous works and were even published in the book ""New Mozart Edition"" in 1982. Now Ulrich Leisinger, director of the foundation's research department, believes the works actually were composed by Mozart before he was old enough to write music, and that Mozart's father, Leopold, transcribed them. The foundation said in a statement that Leisinger analyzed the handwriting and other ""stylistic criteria"" to determine the music was ""almost certainly unknown compositions by"" the young Mozart. The compositions were found in a book, compiled by Mozart's father, that was used for practice and the musical education of both Mozart and his sister, according to the statement. Leisinger's analyses ""support the claim that they were actually composed by the young Mozart, who was not yet versed in musical notation, and transcribed by his father as the boy played the works at the keyboard,"" the statement said. Jeffrey Kimpton, president of the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan, called the works ""a remarkable historical find."" He said Leopold Mozart transcribed his son's early works as a way of preserving them. ""When parents go to a piano recital of an early student, a young student, who's playing for the first time, they get a video tape, they get a DVD, that's a way of recording it,"" Kimpton said. ""I think what's exciting is that Mozart's father wanted to preserve this incredible genius. The young boy at this time didn't know how to write music, but he sure could play it. It's like a family photo or video album."" Finding such historical treasures is like detective work, Kimpton said. ""You're kind of putting together a DNA picture,"" he said. ""This particular museum has hundreds of manuscripts. Over time as you learn more and more by various scholars working on this, you might turn the page and you may have looked at it a hundred times before but suddenly begin to see some things or understand some things that make some sense."" Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and started composing when he was 5 years old. By the time of his death in 1791, he had written more than 600 pieces of music.","Researcher: Two pieces likely composed by Mozart before he could write music .

"(CNN) -- Holly Hunter doesn't take roles based on what she thinks viewers want to see. Holly Hunter plays a tough detective grappling with issues of faith in TNT's ""Saving Grace."" ""I have, frankly, very few expectations when it comes to audience,"" the acclaimed actress said. ""I've done features, I've done stage and I've done television movies."" ""I'm used to having the experience of perhaps missing an audience where your feature, for some reason or another, may not have a large audience, while some of my features have found large audiences, so I am used to both. My expectations are adaptable and they are low."" Hunter need not worry, because she has a hit on her hands with TNT's ""Saving Grace,"" which is soon to debut its third season. The television drama follows the decidedly messy life of Oklahoma City Police Detective Grace Hanadarko, who lives and works hard while being shadowed by a no-nonsense angel. The premise may sound unusual, but it is just that originality that attracted Hunter, an Academy Award winner whose eclectic career has included projects as varied as the films ""Raising Arizona,"" ""Broadcast News"" and the animated ""The Incredibles.""  See the significant roles Hunter has played » . The actress said she continues to be attracted to playing Hanadarko because it allows her to explore emotions and attitudes that a lot of roles these days simply aren't offering. ""She wants to have conversations about sex, she wants to have conversations about faith,"" Hunter said. ""She is very comfortable with the darkness in herself and with the darkness in others and I want to talk about that. There are not a lot of opportunities to have that conversation in features."" It isn't surprising that Hunter was able to find such a rich, creative playground at TNT. The network (which is owned by the parent company of CNN) has carved a niche for itself as a destination for critically acclaimed and popular dramas. That reputation has been strengthened by the popularity of shows like Hunter's as well as the program many credit with raising TNT's game, ""The Closer."" That show's fifth season kick's off the network's summer schedule on June 8. Star Kyra Sedgwick said Deputy Police Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson is in for some changes now that she's married -- though she will maintain the edge that fans have come to love. ""I think the character continues to be great at her job and struggles in her personal life and issues surrounding the possibility of having children come up,"" said Sedgwick. ""I think it's hard for someone who sees a lot of darkness in the world and deals with the darkest part of humanity to believe in the benevolence of the universe and the safety of a world to bring kids into."" Like Hunter, Sedgwick said she loves playing such a strong character. That esteem, and flexibility of working on a cable series, which demands less of a time commitment than a network show, has made it easier to be on an opposite coast from her husband, Kevin Bacon, and their children, Sedgwick said. ""I was very clear on not wanting to give up any other part of my career,"" said Sedgwick, who this season also serves as the show's executive producer. ""By doing the show, I think it has opened up more in the way of feature films for me."" Mark-Paul Gosselaar couldn't agree with Sedgwick more. His series, ""Raising the Bar,"" will be back on TNT for a second season and the actor said he appreciates being part of a network that values drama. His role as public defender Jerry Kellerman in the courtroom drama is a continuation of the actor's long-time collaborative relationship with Emmy-winning producer Steven Bochco. ""I've been fortunate enough, for close to the last decade, to work with one of the most prolific producers in this genre,"" said Gosselaar, who also had roles on Bochco's ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Commander-in-Chief."" ""I couldn't be in a better situation than to have attached myself to a man who is willing to give me these roles and is one of my biggest supporters."" The character of Kellerman is so earnest and passionately idealistic that he might remind some of an adult version of another character who first made Gosselaar famous -- Zack Morris on the teen sitcom ""Saved By the Bell."" It's a role Gosselaar said he has no desire to escape, even after all these years. ""Zack has been something that has made such an impact on people and I am proud that I was able to do that,"" said Gosselaar, who hinted that a long-desired reunion of the show's cast is in the works. ""When I was doing the show, it was almost like some people were closet 'Saved By the Bell' watchers and now it's become this iconic thing, so it's fun."" Gosselaar said ""Raising the Bar"" is a different type of courtroom drama, where viewers are able to witness the lives a different type of attorney. ""I don't think we have ever seen a show that deals with this side of the criminal justice system,"" he said. ""We've seen the cops and the prosecutors, but 'Raising the Bar' gives voice to the public defenders and their clients, who you almost never hear from."" His is not the only TNT show that is giving the audience something different. Hunter said her show will continue to explore substantive themes. ""This season is a real investigation of beliefs and what does it mean to believe as opposed to what it means to know,"" Hunter said. ""It's a large question and many people have different answers. This show is exploring a more global idea of who God is to each of us."" Also Included in TNT's summer schedule are the heist drama ""Leverage"" starring Timothy Hutton, which premiers its second season and new show ""Hawthorne,"" which stars Jada Pinkett Smith as a single mom and the director of nursing at a North Carolina hospital.","TNT has a summer lineup that includes popular dramas .

"THE EVERGLADES, Florida (CNN) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida's Everglades. The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular. Reptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades. ""The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,"" he said. Wasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed. And breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs. They are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say. The travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading. ""It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,"" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python. Volunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons. A ""Python Patrol"" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find. ""The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,"" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys. It is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners. ""These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,"" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle. The state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski. Twenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure. What Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move. When he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed. On one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him. Finally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. ""Yeah, baby! Hee ha! Look at the size of this one,"" he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck. He got out and picked up the brownish-green snake, which immediately coiled around his arm. ""This isn't a big one,"" he said, but as he got a closer look, he did not deny that it was a good one: ""At least 12 [feet.]"" Wasilewski has a soft spot for these species, and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them. He says it is not the snakes' fault that they ended up in the Everglades, but he acknowledges the problems they are causing on the Florida ecosystem and the need to do something. ""One down, 100,000 to go,"" he said.","Florida Everglades are perfect place for Burmese pythons to live and breed .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- The imprisoned leader of the Nigerian militant group MEND has accepted an unconditional amnesty offer from the government, his lawyer said Friday. ""The president has ordered his release, and we are hoping he will be released very soon,"" Wilson Ajuwaand said, referring to his client, Henry Okah. ""We have briefed him on the amnesty and are now working out the details."" CNN could not independently verify the lawyer's information, and Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua could not be reached for comment. Yar'Adua made the amnesty offer to Okah in June. Okah, who had been MEND's main arms smuggler, was arrested in September 2007 in the Angolan capital, Luanda. He was later extradited to Nigeria and has been in prison since then. ""We support Henry Okah's decision to accept any deal that will ensure his early release to attend to his failing health under the current circumstances,"" said Jomo Gbomo, a MEND spokesman. ""Since he has no weapons to surrender, the deal should be a straightforward one."" An International Crisis Group report in April about the conflict between government forces and militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta said Okah is accused of treason, terrorism and kidnapping. His lawyers and relatives say he needs kidney treatment not available in Nigeria, the report said. MEND has declared an ""all-out war"" on the government, demanding a fairer distribution of oil wealth in the Niger Delta. The group wants oil revenue reinvested in the region instead of enriching those the militants consider corrupt politicians. Many of MEND's attacks have been aimed at oil and gas installations in the region. Okah's release had been a key demand of MEND before they accept any government amnesty offer. After receiving news of Okah's acceptance of the government officer, MEND issued a statement. ""The recent appointment of Mr. Timi Alaibe as the special adviser to the president on Niger Delta-Nigeria-MEND-Amnesty affairs by the Nigerian government is a humble and welcome development that is in line with the two-pronged approach of our current campaign,"" the statement said. ""With this channel of communication finally opened, MEND will put together its ... team of frank negotiators to pass our demands and expectations to the president through Mr. Alaibe, a man we respect and can work with.""

"(CNN) -- As Michael Jackson fans and the media pour into Los Angeles, California, for what could be the most widely watched memorial of all time, an obvious question remains: Where will he be laid to rest? Bette Davis is among the notables buried at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn park. Although the Jackson family hasn't made an official statement, all signs seem to point toward Forest Lawn Memorial Parks and Mortuaries, the not-for-profit organization that has buried a vast number of Hollywood's notables. Forest Lawn officials were working with the Jackson family on their plans, which were part of ""a package"" of events Tuesday, said Jim McDonnell, assistant chief of staff of the Los Angeles Police Department on Sunday. His comments, however, did not answer questions about where or when Jackson would be buried. There is speculation that the burial will be at Forest Lawn's Glendale location, but the media are swarming around the Hollywood Hills memorial park, located right off the freeway behind Disney Studios. Tito Jackson's ex-wife, Delores ""Dee Dee"" Jackson, is believed to be buried there. Forest Lawn Memorial is the first stop tourists make in search of the crypts of Hollywood greats. Numerous books and Web sites such as findagrave.com and seeing-stars.com claim to have insider knowledge about celebrity grave locations on the properties, but Forest Lawn is unrelentingly secretive about who, exactly, is entombed in its parks. ""We hold the privacy of our client families in very high regard,"" said Bill Martin, spokesman for the Glendale location, which is considered the ""mother lode"" for celebrity grave hunters. ""There are certain areas and property types that have limited access."" The tombs of Sammy Davis Jr., Humphrey Bogart and Jean Harlow are in locked areas not accessible to the general public, according to findagrave.com. With that kind of commitment to privacy, it's understandable why Jackson, known for being reclusive, might be buried there. Avid grave hunter Lisa Burks, who frequents both the Glendale and Hollywood Hills parks, said she wouldn't be surprised if Jackson were to be buried at either location. Burks was first drawn to Forest Lawn Glendale because of its artwork and statuary, but once she found out that celebrities were ""buried with the regular people,"" she said, she began to grave hunt. ""We leave flowers and take pictures,"" Burks said of her time at famous graves. ""It's the way of remembering someone who made a difference, who cheered me up when I was a kid or entertained me. With Michael Jackson ... if he ends up at a cemetery, I'll definitely go and take flowers. They feel like a member of the family, so you treat them like a member of the family."" Even if you can't find a way to see your favorite celebrity's crypt, Los Angeles residents said that just stepping foot in the park is an experience in itself. ""I know for some people cemeteries can be intimidating or just where you go to mourn. But at Forest Lawn, it isn't sad; it's really a beautiful place,"" said Beth Zeigler, an Echo Park, California, professional who frequents the park's museum. But if you call any of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuaries a cemetery, you would be remiss. There are certainly graves behind the Glendale park's majestic wrought-iron gates, but that's where the similarities end. Amid its 300 acres, the park has three churches, replicas of all of Michelangelo's works and a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" in stained glass. Instead of above-ground tombstones, the park uses flat, engraved markers for grave sites, so from afar all you can see are grassy hills. The memorial park draws over a million visitors each year, including 70,000 who come to get married. Built in 1906 as a traditional cemetery, Forest Lawn was revamped by Dr. Hubert Eaton in 1917. Like Jackson, Eaton was ""an icon [of his] time,"" said Laura Kath, author of ""100 Years in the Life of Forest Lawn."" ""[Eaton] is the man who first envisioned the memorial park concept, that cemeteries should not be filled with tombstones but should celebrate the life of those entombed there and celebrate the living,"" Kath said, ""and people loved the whole concept. Eaton was a visionary."" Burks agrees whole-heartedly with Eaton's vision. ""Cemeteries are for the living,"" Burks said about her visits to celebrity tombs. ""We're remembering them. It sounds crazy, but I dare anyone to do it, and I'd bet it would make them feel good.""","Will Jackson be buried among other stars at a Forest Lawn location?

"(CNN) -- More than 1,100 people worldwide have died from swine flu since it emerged in Mexico and the U.S. in April, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. A young girl wears a mask at a hospital in Hanoi. Vietnam reported its first death from swine flu this week. As of July 31, the total number of victims killed by the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, stood at 1,154 -- an increase of 338 since WHO's previous update on July 27. The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed, spreading as widely in six weeks as common influenza viruses spread in the six months, according to WHO. WHO data showed the total number of laboratory confirmed cases at 162,380, but the number could be higher since individual cases no longer have to be tested or reported. The total number of countries and territories reporting at least one case of infection now stands at 168, with new cases reported in Azerbaijan, Gabon, Grenada, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Monaco, Nauru, Swaziland and Suriname. In the United States, federal health officials are worried about the upcoming flu season. They say nearly 160 million Americans may need to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus, but it won't be as simple as a single shot. In a background briefing with reporters on Tuesday, two senior administration officials said the vaccine, which is still in clinical trials, would require two shots. The first shot would be followed by a second shot three weeks later. Immunity to the virus would finally kick in two weeks after that. That means someone who is vaccinated by the time the program is expected to launch in late October won't get protection until late fall. On Tuesday, British-based pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline announced it had signed contracts with nine governments to provide 96 million doses of a H1N1 vaccine and was in ongoing discussions with governments to provide further supplies. GlaxoSmithKline has already signed deals worth $250 million in total to provide 195 million doses and plans to donate 50 million doses to the World Health Organization. ""First supplies of the vaccine will be available to governments from September onwards, with shipments expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010,"" GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement. ""The exact pace of delivery will be dependent on capacity and the yield of the influenza strain."" Details of the immunization program were revealed as part of the government's overall plan to deal with what is expected to be a difficult flu season. The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week issued sweeping guidelines for a vaccination campaign against the swine flu strain, identifying more than half the population as targets for the first round of vaccinations. The priority groups include pregnant women, health care and emergency services personnel, children, adolescents and young adults from six months to 24 years of age, household and caregiver contacts of children younger than six months and healthy adults with certain medical conditions. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to that of seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, aches and runny nose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A significant number of infected people have also reported diarrhea and vomiting.","WHO: Swine flu deaths up 338 in recent days to 1,154 in total worldwide .

"(CNN) -- They are four American friends and seasoned travelers who were hiking through Iraq's Kurdistan region before three of them crossed the unmarked border with Iran, where they were detained by Iranian authorities. Ahmed Awa, on the border of Iraq and Iran, is where police saw and warned the American hikers Friday. Kurdish officials identified the detained hikers as Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Joshua Fattal, CNN confirmed Sunday. The fourth hiker, Shon Meckfessel, stayed behind in Iraq. ""My husband and I are eager for the best welfare and conditions for our son, Josh, and for the other two companions he's with,"" Laura Fattal of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, told CNN Radio. ""And that is our only concern, his welfare and the best conditions for him."" Meckfessel was identified by his grandmother, who told CNN that he stayed behind because he felt sick. Meckfessel is at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ""My grandson has asked me not to talk to the media,"" said the grandmother, Irene Meckfessel of Carmichael, California, before hanging up Saturday. Iran's state-run media reported that Iranian security forces arrested the three Americans Friday for illegally entering the country from Iraq's Kurdistan region and that the matter is under investigation. U.S. State Department officials say the Swiss ambassador to Tehran is seeking information about the case on behalf of Washington. The United States and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and Switzerland represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran. Friends of the travelers told CNN that the three who were detained have spent time or have lived in Western Europe and the Middle East. Sandy Close, executive director of the nonprofit Pacific News Service, described Bauer -- a photographer whose material was occasionally posted on her Web site in the past -- as a ""gifted linguist and photographer with wanderlust for travel and a student of Arab cultures. He's a remarkably talented guy."" Shourd described herself as a ""teacher-activist-writer from California currently based in the Middle East"" on a profile listed on a travel Web site. Fattal shared his friends' love of travel and learning, and was described as ""fiercely intellectual"" by his friend, Chris Foraker, who spoke to CNN affiliate KVAL in Eugene, Oregon. Foraker said he met Fattal during a study abroad program in 2003, and the two worked together at the Aprovecho sustainable living research center in Cottage Grove. The four travelers spent the night at the Nirwan Hotel in Sulaimaniya on Thursday, said Mudhafer Mohammed, the owner of the hotel. Bauer, Shourd and Fattal left early Friday in a taxi for Ahmed Awa, a Kurdish town near Iraq's border with Iran, planning to hike in the mountains there, according to Peshrow Ahmed, spokesman for the security manager of Sulaimaniya. Ahmed Awa police spotted the hikers at one point Friday, Ahmed said, and warned them that they were near the border with Iran -- which is not marked in the area -- and that they should be careful. The group was in contact with Meckfessel in Sulaimaniya until about 1:30 p.m. Friday, when they reported they were ""surrounded by Iranian soldiers,"" Ahmed said. No further communication was received. Mohammed, of the Nirwan Hotel, told CNN that the hikers said they had come to the area because they heard it was safe, saying they were considering a trip to Ahmed Awa. But, he said, he advised them against it. ""I warned them many times,"" Mohammed told CNN. ""When they told me that they are planning to go to Ahmed Awa, I told them, 'Don't go there because it is unsafe for you because you're American and Ahmed Awa is very close to the Iranian border,'"" he said. Meckfessel left the hotel about 4:30 p.m., Mohammed said, asking him to take care of their luggage and saying he would not return. Later, he said, Sulaimaniya security forces took the luggage from the hotel. CNN's Arwa Damon and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: Joshua Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd detained by Iranians .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A U.S. company is offering a rare chance to holiday on a mega-yacht once used by a Hollywood star and her husband -- and thanks to the recession it's actually affordable. The 100-foot Katania normally would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use. The 100-foot Katania was chartered by Hollywood star Hilary Swank and her husband, Chad Lowe. Seattle, Washington-based mega-yacht rental business CEO Expeditions usually charges around $100,000 a week to charter their 100-plus-foot yachts, but they have introduced a deal waiving the charter fees -- meaning guests will only need to pay for the running of the vessel. The move to make such vessels more affordable comes as the recession continues to put pressure on the luxury holiday and mega-yacht industries. Although the costs of crew and luxury food aren't extremely cheap, it is expected this move will open up the recession-strained market to many more potential holiday-makers. The Katania now costs less than $3,000 per day. Normally it would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use. At the $2,950-per-day special rate, four people can stay on the Katania -- but with the maximum six on board ($450 extra per person) the cost per person is a slightly better $642. The price includes full crew, premium wines, gourmet food prepared by a private chef, amenities such as kayaks, hot tub, fishing/crabbing/shrimping equipment, and even a 30-foot whaler for guest use. According to the company, Swank said of her charter holiday: ""We had an absolutely enchanted time aboard the Katania. A more beautiful yacht does not exist."" There is one small catch with the deal -- the boat is based in the San Juan islands off the coast of Washington and British Columbia, and any cruises to other destinations will attract an additional charge to cover fuel costs. The company's owner, Bruce Milne, released a statement saying the deal was largely a result of the impact of the recession. ""Travel is down, agents and brokers need deals, so rather than just a few full-price charters, we decided to stay busy, put more people to work, and help island tourism by doing charters at cost. ""Since we started chartering 10 years ago, we have been looking for a chance to provide our 'Expeditions to the Extraordinary' in the San Juan Islands at a price any luxury traveler can afford -- this recession provides that opportunity,"" he said. Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the charter market isn't a complete disaster, so he was surprised to see such a discount. ""I wouldn't have expected to see that,"" he said. ""We are seeing discounts on average of about 25 percent. Although some people are trying interesting gimmicks to inspire new business."" Wiltshire said CEO Expedition's fleet isn't among the biggest or most luxurious on the market, and this deal appears to be clever marketing stunt. His opinion is that other larger vessels still warrant their greater price tags.","U.S. mega-yacht charter company waives massive $50,000 charter fees .

"BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) --   Kim Mickens, 49, has always been the caregiver among her eight brothers and sisters. So when her mother, Delphine Mickens, was told she had Alzheimer's disease, Mickens took care of all the arrangements for her mother's care -- among them, she chose a nursing home not far from her place in Baltimore. Kim Mickens, right, moved her mother, Delphine, in with her after unsuccessful stints at two nursing homes. But Mickens didn't like the way her mother was treated, so she moved Delphine to a second facility. That one didn't work out either. Mickens eventually concluded that the only way Delphine was going to receive acceptable care was to move her mother in with her. Moving Delphine into her house wasn't so easy: She needed medical equipment including a wheelchair, medication and round-the-clock care. ""She can't walk,"" Mickens says. ""So we bathe her, we feed her, we do everything for her."" Because Mickens works two jobs, she also needed someone to provide in-home care. Because Delphine is in her 80s, Medicare covers a lot of the costs -- but Mickens didn't know where to start; the logistics were overwhelming. Medicare personnel helped her get some of the medical supplies she needed and also recommend a new Web site called Ask Medicare. Designed to give easy access to people taking care of elderly relatives, Ask Medicare provides information and links to services that are important to caregivers. Mickens says it was invaluable. ""The Web site tells you how to get Medicare assistance,"" she says. ""It also gives you information on how to contact people that you need to get the equipment and supplies for your parents."" The Department of Health and Human Services says at least 44 million Americans provide care for a chronically ill, disabled or elderly family member or friend. Of those family caregivers, 7 percent -- like Mickens -- provide 40 hours or more of care a week. The new Web site designed by HHS is meant to be a navigational tool for caregivers -- for whom time is valuable -- that cuts through all the bureaucratic red tape.  Listen to Kim Mickens talk about caring for her mother » . ""We call it a GPS for Medicare,"" says Rima Cohen, a special adviser at HHS. ""It's meant to make information readily available, and presented in a format that is easy to understand."" According to the Center on an Aging Society at Georgetown University, family caregivers provide approximately 80 percent of long-term care services in the United States. ""We know that family caregivers are really the backbone of a long-term care giving system in the U.S.,"" says Cohen. ""You might be surprised to note that about $375 billion worth of services are provided by family caregivers -- if they were paid."" So helping the caregiver is key.  Watch more on the Ask Medicare Web site » . Mickens says she first used the Web site to set up the living space for her mother. Through a social worker and Ask Medicare, she ordered a special bed, supplies, a new wheelchair, and even filled Delphine's prescriptions. Because Delphine had previously suffered two strokes, she couldn't walk -- a very big problem, since Mickens lives in a two-story home. But through the site, she was able to order an elevator chair that takes Delphine up and down the stairs. Now that her mother is settled comfortably in her daughter's home, Mickens says she needs some emotional support and ""me time."" That's not unusual: A study in the American Journal of Public Health finds family caregivers who provide 36 or more hours of care per week are more likely than noncaregivers to experience symptoms of depression or anxiety. Mickens found support in a chat room that was linked to Ask Medicare. ""The Web site has helped me read other people's stories,"" she says. ""And now I know I'm not going through this by myself."" Today, Mickens and her mother are a loving twosome. When Mickens is at work, she leaves Delphine with an in-home nurse and relies on her son to help out when he gets home from school. Mickens finally feels content about the quality of care her mother is getting, and she says it would have never happened so quickly had she not found the Ask Medicare Web site. ""I have no problems with it: Once I punch it in, it comes up and takes me out to all the different Web sites,"" say Mickens. ""It's very helpful. I am glad they came up with it.""","Ask Medicare is new Web site designed to help caregivers cut through red tape .

"(CNN) -- Another summer, another iPhone hardware update. This one's worth getting, too -- especially if you have an original iPhone or the iPhone 3G. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. If you keep holding out because the iPhone doesn't have everything you want, it may be time to re-evaluate your position. This isn't just a phone -- it's a mobile communications device that boasts few true rivals in the marketplace. Instead of waiting in line at an Apple or AT&T store, I simply ordered mine though Apple, and that process was amazingly simple. I was guaranteed delivery by the June 19th launch date, and indeed, my 32GB (black) iPhone 3GS was handed to me on Friday morning. No muss, no fuss. Kinda. Before I get into the reasons I'm in love (LOVE!?) with the iPhone 3GS, let me just say that the activation process on AT&T's network was less than impressive. It took close to 32 hours for the SIM card to activate, and AT&T could offer little to no assistance in that process. They were, quite simply, overwhelmed. I contend that a lot of perceived iPhone issues have more to do with AT&T than they do with Apple. Even so, Apple saw fit to issue a $30 iTunes gift card to people caught in this delay. Now that is customer service. So, what else has Apple given the world in the iPhone 3GS? 1. Video recording capabilities. With the swipe of a finger, you can record a quick video. With another swipe, you can trim your recording. With yet another swipe, you can email it or upload it to your YouTube account. Even when it's transferred over AT&T's 3G network, the A/V quality is rather impressive. Based on my first mobile YouTube upload test, I know I've sold a few more people on the 3GS. Apple seems to have integrated some kind of anti-shake feature into its video processing, too. 2. It's 50 percent faster than previous generations. Yes, believe me when I say that you'll notice a difference in speed (in direct comparison to the iPhone and iPhone 3G models). If you've never owned an iPhone before, then you're going to be equally as impressed. Animations are smoother, apps launch more quickly, and...well, the dang thing's just faster. 3. Twice the storage capacity. Are you good with 16GB? Would you rather have 32GB? Either way, you'll get what you want. I always say: Buy as much as you can afford. 4. Five times the amount of usable memory. Given that iPhone OS 3.0 now supports push data (that is, it allows applications to send and receive data in the ""background""), you're going to want more than just 20MB available to you. Whereas the iPhone 3G comes with 128MB of memory, the iPhone 3GS has 256MB. This translates into far fewer app crashes. 5. Voice control. Press and hold the home button (that's the round thing at the bottom of the iPhone), and you'll be passed to the Voice Control application -- allowing you to tell your device to call a friend, play a song, and more. It didn't require any training for me to use, either. 6. Compass. Yeah, I have no idea when I'm actually going to need this. More importantly, app developers will take advantage of this new feature. Turn-by-turn navigation, anyone? TomTom's working on an app for that. 7. Improved battery life. I'm not sure you could make it through an entire working day without attaching an external battery pack to your iPhone, but Apple's found a balance in performance and power with the 3GS. They had to throttle the processor speed somewhat, slightly diminish the capability of the video processor, but at least people can't complain that they always have to keep 'er plugged in to an external power source. 8. Better camera. Isn't 3 megapixels usually better than 2? Generally, yes. But Apple also added the ability to take close-up (macro) shots, and an intuitive autofocus feature. Simply tap the area on the screen you want to be in focus, then take your shot. And before I forget, a friend told me that if you wanted to take a picture of yourself (with the screen facing the other direction), tap and hold the ""snapshot"" icon. Flip the screen away and when you're ready to shoot, simply lift your finger from the trigger. Thanks, David! 9. Same form factor as the iPhone 3G. Why is this nice? Well, you don't have to run out and buy new cases for your iPhone (if you were previously using the iPhone 3G). If this is your first iPhone, or you're upgrading from the original, then you'll still have a full range of accessories for your iPhone 3GS. I'm sure a revision is in the iPhone's future, but not this year. 10. Weight Loss support. Okay, this one's a bit of a stretch, but the iPhone 3GS has the Nike sensor built-in (no receiver required). Maybe I can convince people that I'm more healthy because I have the ability to track progress? Meh. Still, it's a convenience for those who use it -- I'd just recommend a waterproof case for your iPhone to keep it from being damaged by sweat! Admittedly, the iPhone isn't ""cheap"" to own. But the device is only getting better with time. The operating system is ever-maturing and (for the most part) backwards-compatible with older iPhones, the 3G S's hardware specs are comparable to today's sexiest smartphones, and Apple isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The only iPhone killer on the market today...is a newer iPhone.","Tech enthusiast Chris Pirillo lists 10 things he loves about his new iPhone 3GS .

"(CNN) -- New Mexico authorities have identified seven of 11 slain women whose remains were discovered several months ago in shallow graves in west Albuquerque, but have yet to identify a suspect in their killings, police told CNN on Thursday. The bodies of Candelaria, Chavez, Elks, Marquez, Nieto, Romero and Valdez were all ID'd by New Mexico police. A dozen victims -- 11 women and the unborn child of one of them -- were found on a 92-acre parcel west of the city in February, police said. Albuquerque police spokesman John Walsh said Thursday that police were considering all the deaths homicides, and believe they are linked because of the proximity of where the bodies were buried and how they were buried. ""It's ... likely that the same individual committed the same crimes,"" he said, ""But we have to leave all possibilities open."" The victims were linked through drugs and prostitution, he said. Police identified the women as Victoria Chavez, Michelle Valdez, Veronica Romero, Cinnamon Elks, Julie Nieto, Doreen Marquez and Monica Diana Candelaria. Walsh said authorities estimate that the killings occurred somewhere between 2001 and 2004. ""We have to leave it wide at this point,"" Walsh said of the time frame. In February, a woman walking her dog on the property -- which had been graded in preparation for development -- discovered a bone, police said. The office of the medical investigator determined that it was human. The bodies were discovered afterward. The killings have been featured on ""America's Most Wanted,"" Walsh said. A task force in Albuquerque has been assigned to the cases, he added.","Bodies of 11 women and one unborn child found in February near Albuquerque .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder stepped up his call for the passage of federal hate crimes legislation Thursday, arguing that the federal government needs to take a stronger stand against criminal activity fueled by bias and bigotry. Attorney General Eric Holder has been a vocal proponent for tougher laws regarding hate crimes. He also sought to assure opponents that such a bill would not allow Christian clergy to be prosecuted for outspoken opposition to homosexuality. Holder made his remarks during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is currently considering the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The bill would allow the Justice Department to provide assistance to state and local authorities in the prosecution of hate crimes while also expanding federal protection against hate crimes to cover disability, gender and sexual orientation. ""Hate crimes victimize not only individuals but entire communities,"" Holder said. ""Perpetrators of hate crimes seek to deny the humanity that we all share, regardless of the color of our skin, the God to whom we pray or the person who we choose to love. ...,"" he said. ""The time is now to provide justice to victims of bias-motivated violence and to redouble our efforts to protect our communities from violence based on bigotry and prejudice."" The attorney general argued that recent numbers ""suggest that hate crimes against certain groups are on the rise, such as individuals of Hispanic national origin."" Specifically, he said, more than 77,000 hate crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007, or ""nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade."" In light of such statistics, he said, it was one of his ""highest personal priorities ... is to do everything I can to ensure this critical legislation finally becomes law."" Republicans on the Judiciary Committee disputed Holder's assertion that there has been a noticeable increase in the number of hate crimes. They also questioned the need for federal involvement in the prosecution of violent acts -- traditionally a function of state and local governments. They pointed to FBI figures showing a slight decline from 7,755 hate crimes reported in 1998 to 7,624 in 2007, the most recently compiled statistics. It is ""important to know (if) we have a problem of significant numbers of (hate crime) cases ... not being prosecuted in state and local governments,"" said Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on the committee. ""Murders occur all over America every day. Robberies, assaults, rapes, burglaries occur every day, and those are handled by our state and local jurisdictions. ... They do a pretty good job."" When pressed, Holder acknowledged he had no hard evidence of trends showing the problem getting worse, nor that states are not prosecuting cases based on their own state hate crimes statutes. The attorney general insisted, however, that the issue should be viewed more broadly. ""It seems to me this is a question of conscience,"" Holder argued. He emphasized that the bill is designed to give special protections to groups that historically have been victims solely based on who they are. Holder added that while state and local governments generally do a good job prosecuting violent crimes, there is nevertheless a need for the federal government to serve as a ""backstop"" on occasion, particularly if localities lack the resources for an effective investigation or prosecution. ""There are instances where the (federal) government needs to come in,"" he said. He also asserted that any federal hate crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias, as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs. ""It is the person who commits the actual act of violence, who would be subject to this legislation, not the person who is simply expressing an opinion,"" Holder said. Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate crimes law could be used to criminalize speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality. The attorney general has been a vocal proponent of federal hate crimes legislation since his tenure in the Clinton Justice Department. Last week, in a speech on civil rights, he cited three recent fatal shootings in calling for stricter hate crimes laws. ""The violence in Washington, Little Rock and Wichita reminds us of the potential threat posed by violent extremists and the tragedy that ensues when reasoned discourse is replaced by armed confrontation,"" he said. Holder was referring to the shooting death of a security guard at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, allegedly by a self-avowed white supremacist; the shooting of two U.S. soldiers in Little Rock, Arkansas, allegedly by a man prosecutors say was targeting the U.S. military for its treatment of Muslims; and the slaying of a doctor who ran a women's clinic in Wichita, Kansas, allegedly by an abortion opponent.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britons including Prime Minister Gordon Brown have leapt to the defense of their creaking healthcare service after President Barack Obama's plans for a similar system in the United States were branded ""evil"" by Republicans. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a heartfelt message of support for the NHS via Twitter. Tens of thousands of people have joined a Twitter group expressing pride in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which offers free taxpayer-funded medical care to all British residents, while leading politicians have spoken out in support. Republican former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin earlier this week condemned Obama's plans to introduce a public heath insurance scheme as an ""evil"" move that would result in ""death panels"" deciding who would live or die. Her criticism has been echoed by fellow Republicans in direct attacks on Britain's NHS. In an article, Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said British healthcare was run by ""Orwellian"" bureaucrats who put a price tag on life. Sound off: What do you think of the British healthcare model?

"Editor's note: Michael Steele is chairman of the Republican National Committee. Michael Steele says it's becoming clear that the Obama administration is spending money recklessly. (CNN) -- Friday marks President Obama's 200th day in office, and in most respects, his second hundred days as president have been worse than the first 100. Obama campaigned on bringing ""change"" to America, and during his first 200 days as president, his real definition of change is becoming absolutely clear to Americans. Obama and congressional Democrats are determined to conduct their reckless and costly liberal experiments on the American people without any regard to the consequences. Whether a $787 billion stimulus bill, a ""cap-and-trade"" scheme that is nothing more than a huge national energy tax on every American family and business, or a $1.6 trillion government-run health care plan, more and more Americans are rightfully concerned about Obama's change for this country. Since Obama and Democrats rushed through Congress a $787 billion stimulus package, unemployment in America has risen close to 9.5 percent, and every indication is that it will climb even higher when July's unemployment report is released Friday. In total, more than 2.6 million jobs have been lost since Obama took office. But what has the president's stimulus bill brought us, if not the jobs he promised? Wasteful spending, such as $18 million to redesign Recovery.gov, the very government Web site used to monitor stimulus spending, or $3.4 million for an ""eco tunnel"" in Florida designed to provide safe passage for turtles looking to cross the street. This is not the economic stimulus that the American people expected. The second of Obama's grand experiments on America was his massive so-called cap-and-trade bill that was rammed through the House of Representatives this past June so fast that congressmen weren't given the chance to read it. This bill is nothing more than a national energy tax, plain and simple. Its sole purpose is to increase the cost of energy so that Americans might use less. The Heritage Foundation estimated that it would end up costing the average American family up to $1,870 per year and decrease the national GDP by $161 billion in the year 2020. The foundation also determined that during the 2012-2035 timeline, job losses would average more than 1.1 million. Add in the fact that it would do almost nothing to prevent ""climate change,"" and all that is left is a national energy tax on environmentally friendly clothing. Obama's third and final experiment of his first 200 days as president -- and arguably his most dangerous -- is the fundamental transformation of our health care system. Obama is correct about one thing: Our health care system needs reform. Health care today costs too much for families and small businesses, preventing too many Americans from accessing the affordable quality care they need, when they need it. However, the president's prescription to rein in these costs has little to do with real-world dollars and cents and everything to do with the complete government takeover and control of one-sixth of the U.S. economy. The president claims that more government involvement in health care will promote competition. However, creating such a government-run entity would result in a massive government health care monopoly. Private insurers would soon be put out of business, unable to compete with the subsidized government-run plan the president and liberals want. More than 88 million Americans could be forced out of their current private insurance plans and into the government-run plan, according to a study by the Lewin Group. Obama claims that if you like your current health care, you can keep it, but this is simply not true. Then there is the issue of cost. Despite what the president says, his government-run plan won't make health care more affordable. Quite the opposite. Nothing ever becomes cheaper by being more expensive, and the Democrats' plan would cost at least $1.6 trillion, according to an analysis by Roll Call. The Congressional Budget Office determined one of the House Democrats' plans would add more than $200 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years. The president is also planning to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare and Medicaid to help pay for his government-run health care scheme. This is the epitome of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The president and his Democratic allies have looked to raise taxes on many small businesses to help pay for his government-run health care scheme, a foolish proposition even during the best of times, let alone during a recession. Many small businesses would be hit with a penalty equal to 8 percent of their payroll for failing to provide insurance for their employees. Punishing small-business owners with punitive tax legislation such as this will only increase the unemployment rate and extend the recession. Obama's first 200 days in office should be seen for exactly what they are: a clear indication of where he intends to direct America during his presidency. It is a direction that places less emphasis on individual entrepreneurs and private creativity and instead places power in the hands of a massive federal bureaucracy. It is a direction that rams massive spending bills through Congress in the name of economic stimulus and job creation, it is a direction that masks a costly job-killing national energy tax in environmentalism, and it is a direction that looks to put federal bureaucracy between patients and their doctors all in the guise of reducing costs and expanding coverage. America simply can't afford the president's experiments. The president has done all this in just 200 days, and there are still more than 1,200 days left in his administration. That's a frightening thought. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Steele.","Michael Steele: The second hundred days have been worse than the first .

"(CNN) -- Yemen's government has laid out ceasefire terms to Houthi Shiite rebels fighting in the country's north, Yemen's official news agency reported Thursday. Yemeni security forces have been fighting against rebels in the north and south. According to SABA, the government's demands include removing check points, ending banditry and destructive acts, handing over all military equipment and weapons and offering information on the fate of six kidnapped Europeans who disappeared in June. The announcement of cease-fire conditions by Yemen's Supreme Security Committee comes only days after Yemeni forces began an offensive against the Houthi rebels in the northern mountainous province of Saada, which is on the Yemeni border with Saudi Arabia. It follows one day after a state of emergency was declared in all regions of Saada Province by the Saada Local Council. The English language Yemen Post reported Wednesday that, according to local sources from Sa'ada, ""army forces and fighter aircrafts launched a massive attack on Houthi leader Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi's headquarters in Saada province."" Thursday, citing official sources, Yemen Post reported that, over a five-year period of sporadic battles between Yemeni forces and Houthi rebels, over 1,000 government soldiers have died and over 6,000 have been injured. According to Yemen Post, ""it is said that thousands of civilians and Houthi's followers died in the same period, but the real number is unspecified."" Yemen's government and Houthi rebels have been involved in intermittent fighting since 2004. The conflict is believed to be both separatist -- over who will have power in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shia Islam will dominate even though the majority of Yemenis are Sunni. Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh is also faced with a separatist movement in the country's south and a growing threat from al Qaeda. Al-Qaeda's presence in Yemen has been a growing concern for the United States. In late July, Gen. David Petraeus, CENTCOM Commander, and an accompanying delegation, flew to Yemen and met with Saleh. According to SABA, one of the topics of discussion was how to better combat terrorism. Nine foreigners were abducted in June while apparently on a picnic in Saada Province. The bodies of three of them, a South Korean teacher and two German nurses were discovered. Five Germans, including three children and a Briton, are still missing and their status is unknown. It is still unclear who is behind the kidnapping. Initial official statements said the group was apparently seized by Houthi rebels. However, Yemen's news agency later reported Houthi rebels accused drug cartels of abducting the group and killing the three. In addition, SABA said a spokesman for the rebels accused regional tribes of being behind the kidnappings and slayings. The incident was the latest in a string of kidnappings of foreign workers in Yemen this year. All of the previous hostages had been released unharmed, including 24 medical workers seized in Yemen's Amran province. In March, four South Korean tourists were killed in the city of Al Shibam when a bomb exploded as they were taking pictures. In January, two female Belgian tourists and a Yemeni driver were killed by gunmen while the three were traveling in a convoy in Al Shibam.","Move follows offensive by Yemeni forces against rebels in north .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's most celebrated fugitive -- ""the last of the gentlemen crooks,"" as he liked to describe himself -- was born Ronald Arthur Biggs in Lambeth, south London, on August 8, 1929. Biggs spent more than three decades as a fugitive after escaping from prison in 1964. The youngest of five children, his criminal career began at the age of 15 when he was arrested for stealing pencils from a local shop. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1947 but was dishonourably discharged two years later after being convicted of breaking into a chemist's shop while AWOL. The latter offence resulted in his first spell in prison -- four months in Lewes Prison for Young Offenders. He was released in June 1949, but was back in jail within a month for car theft. This second prison term -- also at Lewes -- was to change Biggs' life. He met and became friends with Bruce Reynolds, the man who later masterminded the heist commonly known as the Great Train Robbery. Between 1949 and 1963 Biggs was regularly involved in criminal activity -- he served several jail sentences -- although he also made money legally working as a painter and decorator. In 1960 he married Charmian Powell with whom he had three children -- Nicholas, Christopher and Farley. The couple were subsequently estranged. On August 8, 1963 -- Biggs' birthday -- he was one of a gang of 16 who held up the Glasgow to London mail train, escaping with a record haul of more than £2.6 million ($4.4 million). He was arrested a month later after his fingerprint was found on some stolen notes, and in January 1964 he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. After serving only 15 months, however, he made a daring escape from Wandsworth Prison in south London, thus beginning 35 years on the run. His first stop was Paris, where he spent much of his £147,000 ($246,000) cut of the train robbery money on plastic surgery and acquiring papers to Australia. He remained in Melbourne until 1969, working as a builder, before he slipped out of the country using a false passport on a ship bound for Panama. There followed brief spells in Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela before he eventually settled in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1974 he was arrested and faced being sent back to the UK. His Brazilian girlfriend Raimunda de Castro, however, was by that point pregnant with his child, and under Brazilian law that meant he could not be deported. Further attempts were made to bring him back to England, including a highly publicized kidnapping in 1981 when he was seized by adventurers hoping to claim a reward for his capture. He was taken to Barbados in a sack marked ""Live Snake,"" but subsequently released due to a loophole in Barbadian law. In the meantime, he became something of a celebrity in Rio. He would entertain visitors at his house, where for a set fee he would provide a barbecue and tales of his criminal past. He featured on The Sex Pistols album ""The Great Rock and Roll Swindle"" -- singing No One is Innocent. Biggs suffered a minor stroke in March 1998, and with his health and finances failing he finally returned to the UK in 2001. His estranged wife Charmian said at the time: ""The man I remember was a strong, fit, big man who could take on the world. Now he looks like a walking corpse, just skin and bone. I feel so sorry and sad for him."" Biggs and his family campaigned for him to be released because of his poor health virtually from the day he returned to the UK and was immediately incarcerated in Belmarsh high security prison. Instead, Biggs was moved to a prison facility for elderly prisoners in Norwich, his parole prospects dismissed by justice ministers because of his apparent lack of remorse. But on August 4 Biggs was moved to a hospital suffering with severe pneumonia. On August 7, the eve of both his 80th birthday and the 46th anniversary of the heist that turned him into a fugitive, Biggs was formally released on compassionate grounds. In 2001 Biggs said his last wish was to buy a pint of beer in a pub in the southern seaside resort of Margate. But Biggs' legal advisor Giovanni Di Stefano told journalists that Biggs was unlikely to ever leave his hospital bed. ""This man is ill, he's going to die, he is not going to any pub or going to Rio. He is going to stay in hospital,"" said Di Stefano.","Ronnie Biggs was part of gang responsible for 1963 Great Train Robbery .

"(CNN) -- One of three inmates who escaped from an Indiana maximum-security prison was captured Monday about eight miles away in southwestern Michigan, officials said. From left, Lance Battreal, Mark Booher and Charles Smith escaped from an Indiana prison Sunday. Charles Smith, 48, who was serving time on a murder charge, was captured in Grand Beach, Michigan, near the vacation home of Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, Illinois. Daley said he was inside with his wife and three grandchildren at the time of the capture. Smith and another of the escapees were spotted walking near the house at 5:30 a.m. by a Chicago police officer assigned to Daley's security detail, the mayor said. ""I think they were lost, and they happened to pass in the vicinity,"" Daley said. Though Smith was captured and handed over to the Grand Beach Police Department, the other man escaped into the woods, where police have been searching, Daley said. Police urged residents to be on alert. ""I have residents in this area calling their neighbors and telling everybody, stay inside, keep their children inside and watch the news for updates,"" Dan Schroeder of the Grand Beach Police Department told CNN affiliate WLS on Monday. Smith escaped from the prison in Michigan City on Sunday with convicted murderer Mark Booher, 46, and convicted rapist Lance Battreal, 45, said John Schrader, a public information officer with the Indiana Department of Corrections. ""It appears they escaped by traveling in tunnels under the prison grounds,"" Schrader said Sunday. ""This is a very unusual occurrence."" Smith was sentenced in 1999 to a 95-year sentence for murder. Battreal was sentenced in 1998 to 50 years for rape, criminal confinement and stalking. Booher was sentenced in 1999 to 65 years for murder and robbery. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: Escapee found near Chicago mayor's Michigan vacation home .

"Editor's note: Zeyno Baran, a native of Turkey, is senior fellow for the Center for Islam, Democracy and the Future of the Muslim World at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank that says it is dedicated to ""global security, prosperity and freedom."" From January 2003 until 2006, Baran directed the International Security and Energy Programs at The Nixon Center. Zeyno Baran says the United States can learn much from Turkey's expertise on Afghanistan and Pakistan. (CNN) -- Turks greeted President Obama with huge excitement Monday. This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start. His address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy. That said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward. Despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral. With Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the ""good war."" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help? Turkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together. Reading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women. No matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences. Instead, the Obama administration needs to think of ""victory"" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing. Indeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies. There are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions. Still, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way. Just as President Obama referred to his personal story and that of the United States to help Turks look deeper within, Turks can do the same for the United States. To start, Turkey can explain how the vast Eurasian region it belongs to is not just part of the ""Muslim world"" but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia. Moreover, each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations, and these do not move fast. It is important to stop and drink the tea. Turkey can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their Sufi teachings that talk about love, instead of hatred. As a true partner, it can also help the United States recognize its share, along with many others, in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the Taliban and al-Qaeda by making bad foreign policy choices. Anything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future. In other words, we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zeyno Baran.","Zeyno Baran: Obama's speech shows deep understanding of Turkey .

"(CNN) -- She's been compared to the Dalai Lama, the Chinese Tibetan Buddhist leader, but the name Rebiya Kadeer doesn't ring a bell to many people outside of China. Rebiya Kadeer has been dubbed ""the Mother of All Uyghurs."" Nevertheless, the world-famous man and the relatively obscure woman share similarities that chime with political relevance. A diminutive northern Virginia resident, Kadeer has emerged as the voice of the restive but relatively unknown Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic-speaking ethnic minority in China, and the group's far-flung diaspora. And like the Dalai Lama, she's revered by supporters and reviled by the Chinese government. ""Even though one is a man, and the other is a woman, they have one thing in common, and that is they engage in activities to split the motherland and damage national unity,"" said Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Kadeer, 62, emerged in the world media spotlight after China blamed her for stoking July's unrest in China's remote Xinjiang Autonomous Region, an area four times the size of California in the northwestern part of the country. Reports vary on the number of people killed, ranging from around 200 to many more. The problems began in late June, after two Uyghur migrant workers at a toy factory in Guangdong province were killed after a brawl between Uyghurs and ethnic Han Chinese -- the majority group in China. Uyghurs protested in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital, hundreds of miles from the toy factory. Uyghurs and Han reportedly attacked each other. Nur Bekri, the Chinese government's top official in Xinjiang, accused Kadeer and the World Uyghur Congress she leads of instigating the unrest via the Internet. ""The violence is premeditated, organized violent crime,"" Bekri said. ""It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country."" China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. And the Chinese government has implemented several programs designed to help ethnic minorities, but Kadeer says China still treats Uyghurs as second-class citizens -- and she blames China for most of the recent unrest. Since the violence erupted, Kadeer has worked the media with a mission, drumming up support for the Uyghur cause and shining a light on what she says are China's ""unjust policies"" toward her people. The estimated size of Uyghur population in China ranges from 8 million to 11 million people, making them a distinct minority in a country of 1.5 billion people. Uyghurs have long complained of being treated as a lesser class, but China has dismissed that charge and touted its commitment to ethnic unity. ""Let them hear our voice and raise public awareness about our situation,"" Kadeer told CNN. ""That's the main thing that I wish to do right now."" Dubbed ""the Mother of All Uyghurs,"" Kadeer doesn't quite fit the profile of a political firebrand. Born in modest circumstances, Kadeer fell into dire poverty amid the late Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong's forced relocation programs. She worked her way up from laundry worker to become a millionaire businesswoman as China opened to free enterprise. She amassed an empire with department stores, real estate, lumber, scrap iron, factories and other enterprises. She was also chosen as a member of a Chinese National Congress and other posts. However, the mother of 11 children -- some of whom are in jail in China -- wasn't shy about speaking out about the conditions faced by Uyghurs, such as political imprisonment. Her activism landed her in jail in 1999, an incarceration that attracted international attention and condemnation from rights groups and Western political officials. China released her on medical grounds in 2005 amid pressure from the U.S. government. She was granted political asylum in the United States, reunited with her husband, and embarked on activist work. Along with her role as president of the World Uyghur Congress, Kadeer is the president of the board of the Uyghur American Association and the full-time director of the International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation. Those groups receive money from U.S. taxpayers through the National Endowment for Democracy, a private, nonprofit organization created ""to strengthen democratic institutions"" around the world. Hugh Pope, author of the ""Sons of the Conquerors: The Rise of the Turkic World,"" describes Kadeer as a skillful and hard-working activist who has done a lot for the Uyghurs. He said she is well-situated in the Washington area, where she has easy access to media outlets, and is a ""natural focal point"" for the Uyghur rights cause. ""She has a canny sense on how to get on top of the situation. As long as she can maintain the Dalai Lama-like profile, she will persist in being a spokeswoman for the Uyghurs,"" Pope said. Dru Gladney, an expert on China and its ethnic groups, described Kadeer as a significant leader who is a charismatic, determined and maternal figure who can move easily among the elites and the common people. She has a message that can unite Uyghurs, and China's criticism of her in some ways has enhanced her stature, said Gladney, president of Pacific Basin Institute at Pomona College in California. ""She seems like somebody all Uyghurs can look up to,"" he said. He noted that her following is ""quite remarkable"" since she is a woman and both Muslim and Chinese cultures are patriarchal. She abhors violence and favors peaceful resolution of conflicts, Gladney said. In that respect, she mirrors the non-violent sentiment espoused by the Dalai Lama, who wrote an introduction to Kadeer's autobiography ""Dragon Fighter,"" recently published in English. ""The Uyghur and the Tibetan people have a history of relationship and in modern times have shared somewhat similar experiences. I therefore hope that this book by Mrs. Kadeer will enable the readers to comprehend the experience of the Uyghur people,"" the Dalai Lama wrote. Kadeer told CNN she has had ""close communication"" with the Dalai Lama. She said ""our philosophy in peace is the same"" and said the movements of both peoples for justice are connected. ""If the Chinese have the authority to destroy one of them, they have the authority to destroy the other,"" she said. China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday that Chinese President Hu Jintao, in a visit to Yunnan province this week, urged all people to show mutual respect and concern. He also said all ethnic minorities are important members of the Chinese family, the news agency reported in a story that did not specifically mention Uyghurs. The Communist Party of China and the government plan to emphasize more strongly developing areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and strengthen support to improve their livelihood, according to Xinhua's paraphrasing of Hu's remarks. In a recent Wall Street Journal essay, ""China's Ethnic Fault Lines,"" Gladney wrote that by the mid-1980s ""official minorities were beginning to receive real benefits from the implementation of several affirmative action programs."" They include ""permission to have more children (except in urban areas, minorities are generally not bound by the one-child policy),"" paying fewer taxes,  getting ""greater access to public office,"" and better education for children -- in Mandarin Chinese rather than native tongues. Kadeer has spent much of the last few weeks plowing through media interviews and chatting about how she juggles being the ""Mother of All Uyghurs"" with being a mother to her flesh-and-blood children. ""My family is very supportive of my activity,"" she said through a translator. Yet she has spent time apart from her husband, also a Uyghur activist, and children because of political ferment and imprisonment. Kadeer says this is a ""very dark time for the Uyghur people."" She condemned Chinese security forces for killing and injuring Uyghur demonstrators this month in Urumqi. Unrest also took place in the cities of Kashgar and Hotan, she said. While she focuses on what she says is the Chinese crackdown against Uyghurs in ""East Turkestan"" -- the name Uyghurs use for the region -- she also condemned reported violence by ""a number of Uyghur demonstrators."" ""Uyghur demonstrators were doubtless expressing discontent over the severe and comprehensive repression they have suffered for years in East Turkestan,"" she said. She cited ""arbitrary detention, torture, and execution"" the repression of their religion, ""forced abortion and discrimination in several spheres, including health care and employment."" In her talks, Kadeer -- who sports braids and a traditional Uyghur dopa cap -- urges China to ""stop the cultural genocide"" and ""address the legitimate grievances of the Uyghur people."" ""I do believe that even our enemy would come dine at our table,"" she said, ""because what we have been doing is in a peaceful way. So I do believe that they would come to our table and resolve this."" CNN's Jim Clancy contributed to this report.","Rebiya Kadeer emerges as leader of minority Uyghur Muslims in China .

"(CNN) -- Amid the worsening conflict in his country, Somalia's president made a plea for Somalis living in the United States to stop sending their young men to fight. A Somali rebel points a heavy machine gun in the direction of government forces July 3. ""I call on the Somali-American community not to send their youth to Somalia to fight alongside al-Shabaab,"" President Sheik Sharif Ahmed said on Sunday. He was referring to the Islamist militant group that is waging a brutal war against his administration in Mogadishu. ""I am saying to those young men from abroad: 'Your families fled your home to America because of insecurity. You should not return here to ferment violence against your people,'"" he said. Somalis began arriving in the United States in significant numbers after the U.S. intervention in Somalia's humanitarian crisis in 1992. A sizable group of young Somali-American men left Minneapolis last year and were feared recruited by al-Shabaab militants. In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American who had been radicalized by al-Shabaab in his adopted home state of Minnesota, traveled to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others. The incident -- the first-ever suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen -- raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community. The president's call came after fresh fighting erupted Sunday between Somalia's transitional government forces and Islamist rebels. According to several witness accounts, AMISOM -- the African Union Mission to Somalia -- supported government forces to push back al-Shabaab as the militia attacked the presidential palace. AMISOM tanks and soldiers were involved in the fighting, according to witnesses. ""The sound of heavy artillery in Mogadishu was very loud and continuous,"" a witness told CNN. ""It was shaking the ground, and many buildings were destroyed by the shelling."" The president called the operation ""a clear victory"" against al-Shabaab. ""Our forces have weakened the strength of the al-Shabaab militia in this fighting,"" Ahmed said. Government forces displayed the bodies of five al-Shabaab fighters in their trademark green uniforms. Al-Shabaab, a group that is on the U.S. government's terror watch list, remains entrenched in the northeast and sections of the south of the capital. The group categorized the involvement of AMISOM as a shift in their attempts to overthrow the transitional government. ""The fighting in Mogadishu has entered a new phase. Now it's between us and AMISOM,"" said Ali Mohamud Rage, a spokesman for al-Shabaab. ""AMISOM was backing up the government directly, but we will keep fighting."" Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. The transitional government has struggled to establish authority, challenged by Islamist groups that have seized control of Mogadishu and much of the south. The United Nations estimates that more than 200,000 people have been forced to flee Mogadishu since the latest round of fighting began in early May between the government and the Al-Shabaab and Hisb-ul-Islam groups. The Somali-American population in the United States is concentrated in clusters primarily in Minneapolis; Columbus, Ohio; Seattle, Washington; and San Diego, California. The potential recruitment of young Somali-American men has been made possible by ""a number of factors that come together when a dynamic, influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men,"" Andrew Liepman, deputy director for intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center, said earlier this year. Many refugees, he said, ""lack structure and definition in their lives"" and are ""torn between their parents' traditional tribal and clan identities, and the new cultures and traditions offered by American society.""","President Sheik Sharif Ahmed says U.S.-Somalis joining Islamist rebels .

"(CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has suspended two air traffic controllers over last week's collision of two aircraft over the Hudson River that killed nine people, a spokeswoman said. The wreckage of a plane that collided with a helicopter is lifted this week from the Hudson River. A controller at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport handling the flight of a Piper airplane carrying three people ""was involved in apparently inappropriate conversations on the telephone at the time of the accident,"" FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said in a statement Thursday. A source with knowledge of the investigation said the controller was on the phone with his girlfriend ""after he cleared the pilot for takeoff; he was still on the phone at the time of the crash."" In addition, ""the supervisor was not present in the building as required,"" Brown said. ""While we have no reason to believe at this time that these actions contributed to the accident, this kind of conduct is unacceptable, and we have placed the employees on administrative leave and have begun disciplinary proceedings,"" she said.  Watch amateur video of the moment of impact » . ""These are serious violations of the FAA regulations,"" said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general for the Transportation Department. The union for air traffic controllers urged caution. ""We support that any such allegation is fully investigated before there is a rush to judgment about the behavior of any controller,"" said a statement from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The National Transportation Safety Board is working with the FAA in investigating Saturday's collision of the Piper, which had taken off from Teterboro, with a sightseeing helicopter that was carrying five Italian tourists and a pilot. No one aboard either aircraft survived the crash. The NTSB has said the pilot of the small plane was cleared electronically and handed off to Newark, New Jersey, air traffic controllers, a standard procedure. However, Newark's control tower never got a verbal response from the pilot of the small plane. The controller put on leave was described as a longtime employee, the source said. He and the supervisor face disciplinary action that could include their firing. Also Thursday, FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said the agency may reissue advisories to pilots using the busy airspace over the Hudson. Pilots are urged to use a radio frequency dedicated to traffic in that corridor, fly no faster than 140 knots and turn on their lights as they enter that airspace. Babbitt made the comments at an event at the agency's research facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

"Editor's note: Maria Hinojosa, an award-winning journalist and author, joined NOW on PBS as senior correspondent in 2005. Hinojosa, who formerly covered urban affairs for CNN, also serves as anchor and managing editor of National Public Radio's ""Latino USA,"" a weekly national program reporting on news and culture in the Latino community. Maria Hinojosa says Sonia Sotomayor's success has helped boost self-confidence for many. NEW YORK (CNN) -- It's a question I never thought I would ask my daughter. But I loved being able to ask it. ""Yurema?"" ""Yes, Mom,"" my 11-year-old daughter said. ""Tell me what T-shirt you would most like to wear: one that says 'I am a Wise Latina,' 'My Mother is a Wise Latina' or 'Sonia is a Wise Latina'?"" She cocked her head slightly and then quickly said, ""I am a Wise Latina."" Eleven years old, and this is the vision she already has of herself. It's a pretty wonderful thing to watch that certain something blossom in a girl ... one of those often fleeting moments when a girl owns her own power. For me, the decision to wear my own ""Wise Latina"" T-shirt raises all kinds of issues. It makes me confront a past that I have known for decades. Deep down inside, I, like many other Latinas, struggle with my own very deep insecurities in relation to my white male colleagues. I think after witnessing history on television for the past two weeks, those insecurities have pretty much dissipated. Sonia Sotomayor has blazed the trail. I can't go back to thinking that way, anymore, ever. Before, when I told people that I was a Latina, I never knew what, if any, image they might have in their mind. Everyone carries stereotypes and preconceived notions. But now when I say to people that I am a Latina, might they immediately think, ""A wise Latina""? My daughter is learning all of these lessons from Sotomayor, a Puerto Rican woman. When I was Yurema's age, back in the '70s, the only Puerto Rican woman I knew of was Maria (played by Natalie Wood) from ""West Side Story."" I grew up on the South Side of Chicago after being born in Mexico. My Puerto Rican Maria from West Side Story taught me that love and commitment could transcend borders and divisions. Sonia is teaching Yurema, and all of us, that intelligence and compassion (and an honest way with words) can also cross all borders: political ones, those of gender or ethnicity. And I have learned that my own challenge now is to reach this very high bar that Sotomayor has set. I must ""own"" that I am, indeed, a wise Latina. Later on the day of the T-shirt decision, my daughter hears my reaction when I read that Sen. John McCain, whom my daughter knows well because we followed the election, is going to vote against Sotomayor's confirmation. ""What a big jerk!"" was her age-appropriate response. Then, after a pause, Yurema said, ""So that means John McCain thinks Sarah Palin is a wise woman? But not Sonia? Harrumph."" ""Harrumph"" is also an age-appropriate response. But the lasting impact of McCain's decision will be much more profound than upsetting an 11-year-old wise Latina girl. In fact, I would venture to say that, politically, there are many in the Republican Party who are convinced this was a politically unwise choice by McCain. It's just not that complicated. Look at the changing demographics in the United States. Then think about what happens when you vote against the first Latina Supreme Court nominee. Maybe McCain isn't wise enough to see that reality, so I will tell him a story about a Dominican-born, U.S. citizen cabby from my Harlem neighborhood. While he drove down Broadway, I asked the cabby if he thought that President Obama was pandering to the Latino communities across the country with the Sotomayor nomination. ""Pero muchacha!"" he exclaimed in a true Dominican style. ""He is not pandering. He owes us! Everyone knows now that without the Latino vote, you cannot win the presidency. He has to deliver, politically. I am a new citizen, and I voted for Obama my first time. Just like a bunch of us Dominican cabbies. Now this is my country and my politics."" ""And is that the way you guys talk amongst yourselves? That the Latino vote is that powerful?"" ""Yep, asi lo vemos. That's how we see it! But even though we love Sonia, Obama still owes us."" And what must Obama deliver to satisfy this very politically astute cabby? ""Imigracion! He must solve this immigration problem. Families are divided up. It is unjust. So Obama must understand that is what we want him to deliver now."" A wise Latino with some wise advice for the president. And for McCain and the Republican Party? Buena suerte, winning the next elections! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Hinojosa.","Maria Hinojosa: My daughter and I are wearing ""wise Latina"" T-shirts .

"(CNN) -- Nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia, Michael Vick was reinstated to the National Football League on a conditional basis, according to an NFL statement Monday. Michael Vick will be considered for full reinstatement based on his progress by the sixth week. Vick ""will be considered for full reinstatement and to play in regular-season games by Week 6 based on the progress he makes in his transition plan,"" the statement said. Week 6 of the NFL season is in October. Vick may participate in practices, workouts and meetings and may play in his club's final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement, the league said. Vick, in a statement, thanked the league's commissioner and former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy, who has served as his mentor. ""I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Commissioner [Roger] Goodell for allowing me to be readmitted to the National Football League,"" Vick said in a statement. ""I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege, not a right, and I am truly thankful for the opportunity I have been given."" Vick, 29, was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20 and returned to his home to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. Vick also said in his statement that he is re-evaluating his life after the ""terrible mistakes"" he made. ""As you can imagine, the last two years have given me time to re-evaluate my life, mature as an individual and fully understand the terrible mistakes I made in the past and what type of life I must lead moving forward,"" Vick said in the statement. ""Again, I would like to thank the commissioner for the chance to return to the game I love and the opportunity to become an example of positive change."" The former Atlanta Falcons player is a free agent and has not been signed by any team. Goodell said he was not involved in any negotiations between Vick and a team. Dungy has agreed to continue working with Vick as an adviser and mentor, the NFL statement said. Goodell said Vick underwent tests after requests from animal rights groups, including a psychiatric evaluation. ""We worked with animal rights activist groups, and we are clear,"" he said. ""We worked with their medical professionals about the aspects of our evaluations. Michael fully cooperated with all of those tests. Those tests did not indicate there was any reason he couldn't make a transition forward."" In a letter to Vick, Goodell wrote that his decision regarding full reinstatement ""will be based on reports from outside professionals, your probation officer and others charged with supervising your activities, the quality of your work outside football"" as well as factors such as the absence of any further law enforcement issues. iReport.com: Should Vick get a second chance? ""This step-by-step approach is not meant to be a further punishment and should not be viewed as such,"" Goodell wrote, according to the NFL. ""Instead, it is intended to maximize the prospect that you can successfully resume your career and your life. I believe that a transitional approach with a strong network of support will give you the best opportunity to manage effectively the various issues and pressures that you will inevitably face in the coming weeks and months and earn your full reinstatement.""  Watch Goodell talk about his decision » . The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after his guilty plea. Although he was released from federal custody July 20, he must serve three years of probation, the league said. In reviewing Vick's status, Goodell considered court records, submissions from Vick and others, reports from outside professionals and conversations with current and former players, among other items. At a hearing July 22, Goodell spoke to Vick along with his representatives and others, including NFL Players' Association officials. ""As I emphasized to you when we met ... it is actions that count,"" Goodell wrote to Vick. ""I accept that you are sincere when you say that you want to, and will, turn your life around and that you intend to be a positive role model for others. I am prepared to offer you that opportunity. Whether you succeed is entirely in your hands."" Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At a hearing in that case, he told the judge that he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison. ""We take this as a very serious matter,"" Goodell said. ""We're dealing with a young man's life."" He said Vick admitted lying to him about his involvement in dogfighting and apologized. Goodell said he accepts Vick's apology. He acknowledged that he does not like being lied to but said he intends to move forward. The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick has offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns. Wayne Pacelle, the organization's president, has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist young people who have been involved. In testimony before the bankruptcy judge, Vick acknowledged committing a ""heinous"" act and said he should have acted more maturely. ""Your margin of error is extremely limited,"" Goodell wrote to Vick. ""I urge you to take full advantage of the resources available to support you and to dedicate yourself to rebuilding your life and your career. If you do this, the NFL will support you.""","NEW: Commissioner: ""We're dealing with a young man's life""

"(CNN) -- Despite some high-profile bombings in recent days, Iraq's security forces are ready to take over for U.S. forces this week to stabilize the nation's major cities, the U.S. commander in Iraq told CNN on Sunday. Except for soldiers in advisory roles, all U.S. combat troops will leave Iraqi cities and towns by June 30. Army Gen. Ray Odierno said he's seen a ""constant improvement"" in both the security situation and governance in Iraq to prepare for the June 30 deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from major cities. ""They've been working for this for a long time,"" Odierno said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" In a separate interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Odierno said all U.S. troops already were out of Iraq's major cities before Tuesday's deadline. ""We have already moved out of the cities,"" Odierno said. ""We've been slowly doing it over the last eight months. And the final units have moved out of the cities over the last several weeks.""  Watch CNN's Michael Ware on the U.S. withdrawal » . The shift is part of the security agreement that former President George W. Bush's administration signed with Iraq. In the CNN interview, Odierno blamed the recent violence in Iraq on ""extremist elements using the timeframe and date to gain attention to themselves and divert attention from the success of Iraqi security forces."" The 131,000 U.S. troops in Iraq still will ""maintain full coordination with Iraqi forces inside the cities"" and continue to have intelligence capacity, Odierno said. With approval from the Iraqis, they also will carry out operations in major cities as necessary, he said. Odierno said his goal is to help provide security that allows Iraq to hold planned national elections leading to the eventual removal of all U.S. troops by the end of 2011. He said his biggest worry is a breakdown in stability such as a ""consistent increase in violence"" or a situation that Iraqi forces can't handle. ""I don't see that"" happening, Odierno said. ""I think we're on the right path."" Odierno also said Iran continues to ""interfere"" in Iraq, including training insurgents and paying surrogates. But he said his mission is limited to providing security within Iraq, no matter the provocation from Iran or elsewhere. ""I'm not authorized to do anything outside the borders of Iraq,"" he said. Iran's government has repeatedly denied fomenting violence inside Iraq.","Gen. Ray Odierno sees ""constant improvement"" in security, governance in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- A Nepalese journalist who reported on women's rights and wrote several articles criticizing the dowry system was hacked to death in her room, a media rights group said Monday. A Nepalese journalist takes part in a protest last month demanding more freedom for the press. The killing of Uma Singh, 26, is part of a growing and troubling pattern of violence directed at reporters in the South Asian country, the Federation of Nepalese Journalists said. In protest, journalists throughout Nepal are expected to stage demonstrations Tuesday, calling on the government to ensure their safety. ""If the government is not ready to provide any kind of security to journalists, it will be very difficult to do journalism in a free mode,"" said Dharmendra Jha, president of the federation. Singh wrote for a daily newspaper and reported for a radio station in Janakpur, about 240 km (150 miles) southeast of the capital city of Katmandu. When she got home from work Sunday night, a group of about 15 men barged into the room she rented at a house and hacked her with sharp objects in full view of other boarders, Jha said. ""I am very very shocked,"" said Jha, who arrived in Janakpur Monday to probe the killing. ""She was my student and I brought her into active journalism."" Authorities do not have a motive for the killing. In some of her articles, Singh spoke out against the dowry system, where a bride's family is forced to give cash and property to the groom's family before the wedding. Also Sunday, a group of men ransacked the house of another journalist, leaving a cross on her door and telling her it was her turn next, media groups said. Police do not know if the two incidents are related. In recent months, the number of attacks on journalists in Nepal has shot up. The federation released a year-end report, recording 284 incidents -- including three deaths and a kidnapping. The incidents also include shutting down media outlets, burning copies of magazines and beatings. Some of the assailants have ties to the Communist Party of Nepal, the largest party in Nepal's coalition government, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch. The party is led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, or Prachanda -- a man who led a decade-long bloody insurgency before being sworn in as prime minister. During the decade-long civil war, Maoist forces under him carried out numerous attacks on journalists they believed were opposed to their cause, Human Rights Watch said. And after he became prime minister, Prachanda issued a public warning to journalists while addressing a massive crowd in Katmandu: ""Now we will no longer tolerate criticism as we have already been elected by the people."" ""The problem we're facing is the problem of impunity,"" Jha said. ""There are many armed groups in plain sight. The government has to hold them accountable. Otherwise, we are not safe.""","Nepalese journalist who reported on women's rights is hacked to death .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Elizabeth and Mary Profit will not be taking center court at the U.S. Open women's doubles final to face Venus and Serena Williams, but they share many of the athletic qualities that have made Venus and Serena the most dominant sisters in tennis history. Elizabeth Profit plays tennis while wearing an insulin monitor at her waist in this family photo. Elizabeth is 13 years old and holds a top ten ranking among 14-year-olds in Southern California. She is already defeating top-ranked players in the 18-year-old division. Her sister Mary, at 11, is also a top-ranked player and dominating her age group. Mary won her first tournament at the age of 6. Both girls started playing tennis as infants by hitting balls of socks across their living room. Their mother, Yvonne Profit, recognized their talent and saw it as an opportunity to develop sportsmanship and character and help them earn athletic scholarships at top national universities. So far, they have exceeded her expectations. In a sport that more often tends to develop players from affluent backgrounds, Elizabeth and Mary have already beaten overwhelming odds and endured the kind of adversity that too often ends in defeat.  Watch how the sisters hope to achieve their tennis dreams » . The Profit sisters grew up in a single-parent household and trained with less than stellar coaches. They developed an exemplary work ethic to compensate for a lack of resources, Elizabeth said. Yvonne, who earned a degree at the University of Michigan, decided to give up her full-time job and move her daughters into an RV to keep up with the rigorous demands of traveling for tournaments. Elizabeth sleeps on a couch. There is a portable stove and shower. But the girls view living in an RV as an inconvenience rather than a hardship. The Profit sisters may be on a path toward a professional tennis career, but Elizabeth's story off the court is just as compelling. She has juvenile diabetes and has been living with the disease since the age of 2, when her body stopped producing insulin. Elizabeth learned how to test her blood sugar levels before the age of 3 and two years later, she began administering insulin injections on her own. ""My mom said I'm not going use my diabetes as a disability,"" said Elizabeth. ""I've got it for the rest of my life. And if they miraculously find a cure for it then that's great, but I have to live with it. I can't make excuses."" Until she learned how to manage diabetes, Elizabeth found herself collapsing at times. ""In this one particular tournament Elizabeth played in, her blood sugar was totally out of control and I kept hollering out to her, 'Quit! Retire, you don't have to do this,' "" said Yvonne. ""She stopped and she turned around and said, 'I can do this. I can do this, Mom.' "" Elizabeth went on to win the match and the tournament. ""By the time we got home, she had collapsed on the floor. And I said, 'Sweetie pie, why didn't you quit?' "" Yvonne remembered. ""Because you didn't raise me to be a quitter,"" Elizabeth told her mother. In spite of her diabetes, Elizabeth reached the No. 1 ranking in her age group in Southern California at 10 years old. Her sister Mary knows that diabetes can be debilitating and a matter of life and death, so she constantly watches over her older sister. ""Sometimes when I wake up to go to the bathroom, I check her blood sugar, when my mom's sleeping,"" said Mary. ""Sometimes I wake up and give her something if her blood sugar is low."" For the past ten years, Yvonne said, she has been unable to obtain private health insurance on the open market for her daughter because diabetes is considered a pre-existing medical condition. Elizabeth used to rely on a large insulin pump to make it through the day, but now she wears a small patch that releases insulin. Despite the inconvenience of checking her blood sugar level a dozen times a day, Elizabeth has not let diabetes deter her from achieving her goals. ""At 17, I hope to see myself in the quarters of the U.S. Open like Melanie Oudin,"" she said. ""I hope to win some grand slams and get that No. 1 ranking."" Elizabeth's advice to anyone with diabetes is universal. ""I'd say if you give up, you're going to have to look back on your life and say, 'Oh I could have done this, I could have done that,' "" she said. ""You don't want to let life pass you by. You're going to have so many years to live, so you might as well have fun while you do it. And once you die, you're going to have a legacy behind, so make your life as fun as you can."" Next year, Yvonne is planning to enter Elizabeth on the women's professional tour, at the same age that Serena and Venus Williams turned pro.","Tennis player Elizabeth Profit, 13, ranks high in her age group; to turn pro next year .

"(CNN) -- Many skiers who visit Colorado prefer the slopes of Aspen, Vail or Breckenridge. But there's a cool little day trip from Denver that often gets overlooked by out-of-towners. The Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado. The Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later. The 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way, and many riders say it's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70. A roundtrip ticket costs between $49 and $85. There are additional expenses, such as parking at the train station in Denver and lift tickets for skiers. If someone chooses to shop instead of ski, a free shuttle into Winter Park is available. Train riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet. It also travels through almost 30 tunnels, including the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which passes underneath the Continental Divide. ""The train ride up there is spectacular. You see wonderful vistas as you leave Denver through the northern plains and into the mountains,"" Kristal Kraft, a real estate agent in Denver, says. ""And once you get through the Moffat Tunnel, you're right there at Winter Park."" Kraft says she enjoyed her maiden voyage on the train, which came courtesy of a local home builder that bought group tickets in one of the club cars. ""I loved the convenience [of the train],' she says. ""We relaxed, talked, socialized. And when you get off the train, you are right there at the slopes."" According to skitrain.com, three additional cars are available for charter and one for company retreats. The Web site lists the price for the presentation car at $5,000 for a winter trip. The site says the current train cars were purchased after Ansco Investment Company bought the Ski Train in 1988. Kraft says the cars are comfortably heated and there is ample room to move around. Kraft, an amateur photography buff, enjoyed switching from window to window, side to side, to take pictures. There is one occasional hitch to riding the train. It shares the track with the Union Pacific Railroad and at times has to stop or pullover to make way for a freight train or Amtrak. And there are instances where another train has an accident. One time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain. They called the passengers together in a cafeteria in Winter Park and advised them to call friends and family to come pick them up. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m. It was a worst-case scenario, he says, and it only happened once. There are occasional delays of a few hours. The bad news is you're delayed; the good news is you're on a full service train with food service and restrooms. And there's the ability to find a beverage. One reviewer on the Web site yelp.com said there's another bonus to the train. ""What's great is that once you get back into Denver you can hit Wynkoop brewery or any other bars around there to keep the party rolling,"" Ramon G. wrote.","Ski Train from Denver to Winter Park has been a local favorite for 68 years .

"(CNN) -- Rep. Joe Wilson said Sunday he will not apologize again for yelling out that President Obama lied during the president's speech to Congress last week. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, shouts ""You lie!"" during President Obama's speech Wednesday night. ""I am not going to apologize again,"" the South Carolina Republican said on ""FOX News Sunday"" when asked about pending disciplinary steps against him by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Wilson said he already apologized to Obama and that the president accepted it. However, he insisted that Obama ""was misstating the facts,"" and that Democratic leaders in the House were ""playing politics"" by continuing to focus on the issue. House Democrats plan to censure Wilson if he refuses to apologize on the House floor this week. Wilson issued a statement about that Sunday, saying, ""The American people are fed up with the political games in Washington, and I refuse to participate in an effort to divert our attention away from the task at hand of reforming health insurance and creating new jobs.""  Watch the debate over Wilson's comment » . The controversy has shifted the focus of the heated health care debate by calling attention to claims by Republicans that a health care overhaul sought by Obama and Democrats would provide free insurance coverage for illegal immigrants. Obama and Democratic leaders insist that nothing in any of the health care proposals currently before Congress includes health care coverage for illegal immigrants or would provide taxpayer money to help illegal immigrants buy private health coverage. However, Wilson and other opponents of Democratic proposals say the plans provide no enforcement mechanism to screen applicants for citizenship requirements. Wilson said Sunday that Republican amendments calling for such enforcement were rejected by congressional committees that have passed the Democratic proposals. When asked if Obama had lied to Congress, Wilson responded: ""I believe he was misstating the facts."" He noted that Senate Finance Committee members negotiating a compromise agreement have called for enforcement mechanisms similar to what Republicans are proposing. The national response to Wilson's nationally televised outburst, in which he yelled ""You lie"" as Obama spoke about health care to a joint session of Congress, shows the deep public divide over the issue. Wilson and his opponent for re-election next year have each raised more than $1 million since Wilson's heckling of the president on Wednesday, according to aides for each. In addition, Wilson has posted a Web video that asks for campaign cash to fend off attacks from political opponents. Immediately after Obama's speech Wednesday, Wilson issued a statement that apologized for inappropriate behavior. He also called the White House that night and spoke to Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who told Wilson that Obama accepted his apology. Obama said publicly that he accepted the apology. Wilson ""apologized quickly and unequivocally, and I'm appreciative of that,"" the president said. Wilson said Sunday that should be enough, adding that he respected the president and ""would never do something like that again.""","Rep.

"HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- Two of four Uyghurs relocated to Bermuda after seven years of detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, denied Friday that they had ever been terrorists and expressed gratitude toward U.S. President Barack Obama for working to free them. Salahidin Abdalahut and Kheleel Mamut were two of four Uyghurs released from Gitmo. Thirteen remain there. Asked what he would say to someone who accused him of being a terrorist, one of the men, Kheleel Mamut, told CNN's Don Lemon, ""I am no terrorist; I have not been terrorist. I will never be terrorist. I am a peaceful person."" Speaking through an interpreter who is herself a Uyghur who said she was sympathetic toward the men, the other man -- Salahidin Abdalahut -- described the past seven years as ""difficult times for me ... I feel bad that it took so long for me to be free."" The two Chinese Muslims were among four relocated from Guantanamo to Bermuda; another 13 remain in detention on the island. He said he had traveled to Afghanistan not to attend any terrorist training camps but because -- as a Uyghur -- he had been oppressed by the Chinese government. ""We had to leave the country to look for a better life, a peaceful life, and Afghanistan is a neighboring country to our country, and it's easy to go,"" he said. ""It is difficult to obtain a visa to go to any other places, so it was really easy for us to just travel to Afghanistan."" Asked what he hoped to do next, he said, ""I want to forget about the past and move on to a peaceful life in the future."" In addition to the four relocated from Guantanamo to Bermuda, another 13 Uyghurs remain in detention on the island. The four were flown by private plane Wednesday night from Cuba to Bermuda, and were accompanied by U.S. and Bermudian representatives as well as their attorneys, according to Susan Baker Manning, part of the men's legal team. The men, who are staying in an apartment, are free to roam about the island. Mamut accused the Bush administration of having held them without cause, and lauded Obama for having ""tried really hard to bring justice and he has been trying very hard to find other countries to resettle us and finally he freed us."" He appealed to Obama to carry out his promise to shut Guantanamo Bay within a year. ""I would like President Obama to honor that word and to free my 13 brothers who were left behind and all of the rest of the people who deserve to be free,"" Mamut said. Asked how he had been treated in Guantanamo Bay, Mamut said, ""It is a jail, so there will be difficulties in the jail that we have faced and now, since I am a free man today, I would like to forget about all that. I really don't want to think about those days."" He cited a proverb from his homeland that means, ""What is done cannot be undone."" Asked if he had anything to say to anyone watching, he said, ""Thank you very much for those people who helped me to gain freedom."" He said he had spoken earlier in the day with his family. ""They told me, ""My boy, my son, congratulations on your freedom.' "" The move has had international repercussions, including causing a rift between the United States and Britain. A British official familiar with the agreement but not authorized to speak publicly on the matter told CNN the United States had informed London of the agreement ""shortly before the deal was concluded."" A U.S. official, speaking on background, said the British feel blindsided. Bermuda is a British ""overseas territory."" The four were twice cleared for release -- once by the Bush administration and again this year, according to a Justice Department statement. The issue of where they go is controversial because of China's opposition to the Uyghurs' being sent to any country but China. Uyghurs are a Muslim minority from the Xinjiang province of far west China. The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement. They left Afghanistan after U.S. bombings began in the area in October 2001 and were apprehended in Pakistan, the statement said. ""According to available information, these individuals did not travel to Afghanistan with the intent to take any hostile action against the United States,"" the statement said. However, China alleges that the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement -- a group the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization -- that operates in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang. China on Thursday urged the United States to hand over all 17 of the Uyghurs instead of sending them elsewhere. The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities. China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured. A senior U.S. administration official told CNN that the State Department is working on a final agreement with Palau to settle the 13 remaining Uyghur detainees. CNN's Don Lemon and Brian Vitagliano in Hamilton, Bermuda, and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","Two Uyghurs relocated from Guantanamo spoke Friday with CNN's Don Lemon .

"Dutch Harbor, ALASKA (CNN) -- In Dutch Harbor the smell of fish wafting from the docks and the canneries is the smell of money. And lately, the town has smelled a lot less fishy. High seas high jinx: Tobias gives his shipmate Hanns a haircut at sea using a sail bag as a barber cape. Over fishing, new quota systems and changes in expected weather patterns have all played a role in changing the face of this once swashbuckling Alaskan town, fishermen say. ""Last summer we thought that pollock fishing was over for good, it was so bad. Time to turn out the lights and go home. But then they cut the quotas by 30 percent and now there are some small signs of more small fish, so maybe they are coming back,"" said Guy Collins, who coordinates with fishing captains who unload their catch at the Unisea docks in Dutch Harbor. ""The fishermen have to go further north toward Russia now to get the fish that are near the ice. It used to be the boats would go out 100 miles, now they go out 500. It could be partly due to temperature change and weather patterns."" Dutch Harbor saw a revival in popularity with the reality show The Deadliest Catch, but even the high-fiving enthusiasm of the deck hands on the TV show can't match what the town was like in the glory days. ""Those were the days, in the mid 1980's, there was booze, drugs and partying. You had lines of coke going down the bar and no one said anything,"" says Byron Singley, captain of the 24-ton fishing boat the Nancy Allen. ""People were making big money and spending it as fast as it came in. I earned $78,000 as a deckhand the first year I was here but I can't remember where it went. Those days are long gone."" Aboard the Silent Sound, as we sail north through the Bering Sea, we're finding other things are not quite like they used to be. For starters, we've been becalmed for much of the trip when we were expecting to encounter strong winds on the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. We have motored nearly half of our 2,300 miles so far. More importantly, the ice we were bracing ourselves for may not be where we expected to find it. While this is good news for the expedition from a sailing perspective, it's less attractive for wildlife such as polar bears, seals and walruses that use the ice as a platform for hunting, mating and migration. ""The present extent of northern sea ice is very similar to the extents at this time in 2008 and in 2007. It is close to values seen also in 1995 and 1990. It is about five per cent below the long-term average of 12.2m square kilometers,"" said Dr Humfrey Melling, a research scientist with the Institute of Ocean Sciences near Victoria, British Columbia. September 2007 was the first time that the Northwest Passage was open water from end to end. An ice forecast issued by the Canadian Ice Service on July 1 showed earlier than normal break up in many key areas in the Western Arctic. ""In the Western Arctic region, the breakup pattern is one to three weeks early in many coastal areas and by as much as one month in isolated areas,"" the report said. But we're still some 400 miles from the Arctic Circle and a month from entering the heart of the Northwest Passage, which gives the Arctic plenty of time to surprise us.","Team aims to discover how climate change has affected Arctic and Inuit people .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Billionaire Bill Gates has urged industrialized nations to honor aid pledges to developing nations despite the recession. Bill Gates Thursday said industrialized nations need to do more to help developing countries. ONE, the advocacy group backed by Gates and rock musicians Bob Geldof Bono released a report Thursday attacking several Group of Eight nations for meeting financial aid goals, set in 2005, to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The report said that Italy, host to the next G8 summit, has ""performed especially poorly"" in its share of aid spending and that France has fallen behind on its commitment. In an interview with CNN's Richard Quest, Gates said nations such as France had not been able to fulfill their promises due to pressures on budgets and suggested they needed to ""raise the priority so the promises are met."" Are G8 nations doing enough during the recession to help developing economies? The former Microsoft chief set up the philanthropic Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1994. Part of its remit is to help nations trapped by hunger and extreme poverty, donating billions of dollars on health aid during the past two decades. Gates said that as industrialized nations cut their budgets over the next few years to get deficits down there would be a real question of whether aid money will be untouched or increase. But if people knew how valuable such aid was, he said, the pressure on governments would be enough to allow it to be a priority. ""When you get young girls into schools and they're literate,"" said Gates, ""not only do they contribute to the economy, but the population growth that is overloading resources and is creating these problems, that starts to go down. And so the portion of the world that needs aid is far less today than it was 50 years ago.""  Watch full Quest Means Business interview with Bill Gates. » . Trade was also key to developing nations being able to become self-sufficient, said Gates, rather than relying on foreign aid or philanthropy. ""Why did China get to the point it got to?"" Gates asked. ""Aid was part of it but they got their governance and infrastructure up to a level where they are now going to be a net contributor. That's a very positive story for 20 percent of the world. ""We need to improve the trade rules,"" said Gates. ""The Doha Round would have been very beneficial to Africa. That's a failure that one hopes would be fixed."" Gates, answering a question submitted by CNN viewer Jairo Martinez on how aid money was monitored, said that health priorities such as AIDs treatment, vaccines and malaria nets were all measurable. ""My foundation says for every dollar we put in, how many lives have we saved? And, as you save lives, amazingly you actually reduce the population growth and improve the entire ability of the country to move forward."" CNN viewer Phill Elliott asked Gates, through a submitted question, about the importance of the $100 laptop, intended to improve access to education in developing nations. Gates replied that educational technology was a priority once more fundamental basics were in place. ""You have got to get your priorities right,"" he said. ""When children are dying and vaccines that only costs dollars aren't being delivered, that's the most important thing. If you do not have food, that's the most important thing.""","Gates: If people could see direct benefit to nations then aid would not drop off .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN)  -- Former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner resigned as leader of the ruling political party Monday following a poor showing in Sunday's elections, the official news agency Telam reported. Former Argentine Nestor Kirchner accepts defeat Sunday in legislative elections in Buenos Aires. The ruling Justicialist Party, or PJ by its Spanish acronym, lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies after being defeated in 18 of 60 races, the newspaper Clarin reported in its Monday editions. The party also lost four Senate contests. The new composition of Congress could shift power away from Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Kirchner's wife. Nestor Kirchner also lost a race for a congressional seat in Buenos Aires province. He lost his bid to Francisco de Narvaez, who leads a rival Peronist party, Union PRO, by a tally of 34.6 percent to 32.1 percent. The Kirchners' party also lost in some of the most important urban centers, including Santa Fe, Cordoba, Mendoza and Entre Rios. Argentina's ability to withstand the global economic slowdown was a key election issue. Economic indicators from Argentina look good, but there is broad agreement among analysts that indicators such as inflation are underreported by as much as half. An effort by Cristina Kirchner, who succeeded her husband, to tax agricultural exports led to a standoff with angry farmers who ultimately forced the government to backpedal. ""The Kirchners have been weakened by this latest economic crisis,"" said Robert Pastor, who was a Latin America national security adviser for former President Carter. The election could signal that the limelight on the country's most powerful political couple could be evaporating. ""They'll probably begin to fade from the scene,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. ""It's going to be very hard for them to govern unless they do something they haven't been willing to do -- compromise and reach consensus."" CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Ex-Argentine President Nestor Kirchner steps down as leader of ruling party .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Investigators are looking into whether employees at the Los Angeles County coroner's office illegally leaked information about Michael Jackson's death probe to the news media, according to a sheriff's spokesman. Police stand outside the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office when Michael Jackson's body was there in June. Vivid descriptions of Jackson's corpse, which was in the coroner's custody for an autopsy, were published by tabloid newspapers in the days after his death. The Los Angeles County Supervisors office on Friday asked the sheriff to conduct a ""preliminary inquiry,"" which will determine whether there is enough evidence to launch a full investigation, said Steve Whitmore, a sheriff's spokesman. Whitmore did not provide details on what prompted the request. The Los Angeles Times quoted Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas as saying his office called the sheriff's department after reports that coroner's employees not involved in the Jackson death probe had viewed his death certificate in the office database. Ridley-Thomas has not responded to CNN requests for comment. The coroner's office is investigating the cause of Jackson's June 25 death. It has been waiting on toxicology lab results, but a final autopsy report is expected as soon as next week, a coroner's spokesman has said. Los Angeles police are also investigating the death. Detectives traveled to Houston, Texas, this week to search the medical office of Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal doctor.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- After a town hall meeting on health-care reform in Belgrade, Montana, President Obama will escape to Big Sky country on Friday evening where he'll spend time with family and go fly-fishing for the first time. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel carries fly-fishing tackle  to Marine One on Friday. Fly-fishing requires a singular focus, much like golf. Having newly discovered the sport myself, it occurred to me as I watched Marine One lift off the South Lawn on Friday that there are probably some lessons on the river that could apply to Obama's presidency. Thinking like a producer, I called an expert -- fly-fishing instructor Tony Derosier, who described the evolution most fishermen go through. ""Usually, when you first go fishing, all you want to do is catch a fish, and then all you want to do is catch a lot of fish, and then you just want to catch the larger fish. After you've caught a lot of large fish, you kind of go back to square one and catch just one fish,"" said Derosier, manager at Taylor Creek Fly Shop in Aspen, Colorado. ""You basically just want to go fishing -- the numbers, the size, it doesn't matter any more."" Obama is in the ""big fish"" stage of his presidency: He's trying to get health-care reform legislation passed hook, line, and sinker. If he's successful, anything else he gets passed will be icing on the cake. Learning the fundamentals of fly-fishing can serve as a metaphor for health care reform. Obama just needs to look at hooking and landing Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans like he would trout. The first step -- learn how to cast. ""Fly-casting is all about maximizing the energy you put in your rod and you lose energy if you wait too long,"" Derosier said. ""And conversely, if you don't wait long enough, your line will crack like a whip."" Obama has to strike the right balance between rushing things through and losing momentum; and maintaining support while bringing others over to his side. The second step -- reading the water: ""Instead of blindly casting anywhere in the river you want to understand where you might find fish,"" Derosier explained. Obama zeroed in on a fairly conservative state, Montana, where he faces a land full of skeptics about his health care reform plan. Third -- hook and land the fish: Derosier said once you hook the fish you have to know how to play the fish, which is a delicate balance between applying pressure but not so much that the line breaks -- much like the delicate balance of Obama's courting members of Congress. ""The ultimate goal is to gain an advantage over the fish so that you can land him,"" he said. ""It's the hardest thing to teach when it comes to fly-fishing,"" he said. Out in Montana, the game is catch-and-release trout. But in Washington, Obama is trying to hook Congress and take home health care reform, or risk it being the big one that got away.","CNN White House producer: Fly-fishing is a metaphor that fits Obama's presidency .

"SWAT VALLEY, Pakistan (CNN) -- The boys shuffle into the room in a remote army base high in the mountains of Pakistan's Swat Valley. They are disheveled, disoriented. These boys say they were kidnapped by the Taliban and trained to be suicide bombers. There are no smiles, their eyes stare at the floor. These are the lost souls of Pakistan's battle with the Taliban. Each has a story of terror to tell, but the trauma runs so deep they can't even begin to properly find the words to describe what they have been through. That task is best left to the psychiatrist who, with her team, was brought in to try to pick through the pieces of this nightmare; to make sense of the brutality here and try to put broken lives back together.  Watch Stan Grant's report on the boys » . Dr. Fareeha Peracha describes these boys variously as ""psychotic,"" ""depressed,"" and in some cases, ""psychopathic."" ""They have been brainwashed. Brainwashed against people like you and me,"" she said. CNN was given limited access to about a dozen boys. They had all been kidnapped by the Taliban and taken to camps where they would be trained to kill; trained to be suicide bombers.  Watch Grant's exclusive interview with a wanted a Taliban leader » . CNN cannot reveal the boys' names; they have handkerchiefs tied across their faces to conceal their identities. The army fears they could face retribution should they be returned to their homes and families. The boys sit in a circle as I try to get them to open up about their ordeal. What happened? Were they brutalized? What did the Taliban ask them to do? So many questions. They answer hesitatingly, their voices barely a whisper. ""The first day they beat us and then made us exercise,"" one boy said. ""They made us run and told us you will wage jihad."" They said the Taliban especially poisoned their minds against the Pakistan army. ""They just told us that they (army) are against Islam, are against the Quran. They said wage jihad against them; we are waging jihad for the Quran,"" said another boy. They all say they were kidnapped by the Taliban, some snatched from fields and others from the towns they lived in. ""I was coming from the shop to my house, I had some stuff with me. They said, 'put your stuff in the car.' I helped them put stuff in the car. They asked if they should drop me in my village, but when we reached the village they blindfolded me and put a hand over my mouth,"" one boy said. The Taliban's tactics seem to have worked. I ask one boy, would he kill for God? He replied: ""Yes."" I asked the psychiatrist, Dr. Fareeha, if she believes the boys are capable of killing. ""Oh yes,"" she said. ""Two of them would not even give it a thought."" The army freed the boys during fierce fighting with the Taliban. Now they are hoping to rehabilitate the boys and one day return them home. But Fareeha thinks that is a long way off -- if ever. She told army chiefs the boys are unpredictable. One boy, she said, told her if he had a suicide bomber's jacket he would use it, that if he had a Kalashnikov, he would shoot. Of course, it is impossible to verify all of the accounts of the boys, but the doctors have no doubt about their trauma. Fareeha told Army chiefs that these boys were just a tip of the iceberg. After talking to the boys, she believes there are possibly hundreds of others just like them. These boys are the victims of the Taliban's uprising here. All they are left with are the terrible memories, the voices in their heads: the voices of the Taliban telling them to kill, they said.","Boys rescued from the Taliban in Pakistan are receiving psychiatric help .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Rob Thomas is a busy guy -- so busy, he apparently hasn't had much time to check in with his Matchbox Twenty bandmates. Rob Thomas prefers to focus on the ""musician"" side of his career, rather than ""celebrity."" We only know this because we ran into guitarist Paul Doucette at the BMI Pop Awards in Beverly Hills several weeks ago, where he was picking up a plaque for songwriter of the year. ""We're interviewing Rob about his solo album,"" I told him. ""Hey,"" Doucette exclaimed. ""Tell that guy to call me, would you? I didn't even know he was in L.A.!"" By the time we met up with Thomas the next day, he and Doucette had already connected over drinks somewhere between midnight and the morning -- musician's hours. Thomas recently released ""Cradlesong,"" his second solo CD. Even though he's clearly excited about it, he spends as much time talking about Matchbox Twenty as he does the solo album he's in town to promote. For the 37-year-old singer-songwriter, it's all interconnected. One has fed into the other since he gained household name status a decade ago, after scoring a massive, Grammy-winning hit with Carlos Santana on ""Smooth.""  Watch Thomas describe the difference between being a celebrity and a musician » . The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Who has given you the best piece of advice? Rob Thomas: Carlos [Santana] will constantly send you messages out of nowhere. Carlos will call me at 10 at night and be like, ""Listen, I had a dream about you, and so much good is happening, but there's dark forces at work, and when you get out of here, I have this woman who wants to cleanse you."" I think Carlos' most important piece of advice ever was that he taught me the difference between being a celebrity and being a famous musician. CNN: But some artists don't have that kind of success, and they try for celebrity instead. Thomas: Sure, and sometimes that works -- but none of my favorites have done that. I remember when Matchbox Twenty started years ago, and we had a lot of success, but nobody knew who we were. The first time we did an interview with MTV, it was about how no one knew who we were. We had sold 8 million records. I don't know if we were being naive at the time, but we thought we'd won because our songs were more famous than we were. I'm much more known for the music that I make than what I do with my life. It's never, ""Oh yeah, I've been seeing you in [the New York Post gossip column] Page Six at these clubs that you go to"" or ""I know who you're sleeping with."" CNN: When you became famous for being Rob Thomas the solo artist, did that cause problems within the band? Thomas: No. I think the guys would rather it be me than them. None of them want the job, and they realize that it's working now. They have a singer. I can go out and do it [publicity] for them, and they're fine with it. They can stay home. I think there's nothing more attractive than wealth and anonymity. If I'm not out supporting my work, I really don't want people to see me. I go to movie premieres -- my wife and I -- all the time, and nine out of 10 of those movie premieres, much to my publicist's dismay, I get there, but I sneak around the pictures and get into the party [using the back entrance]. If I have a record coming out, I'll go in front of the cameras, and I'll say, ""Hi! Hey, I'm at this movie premiere."" I liken it to being a switch that I can move on and off. CNN: What has doing a solo project enabled you to do that you can't do with a band? Thomas: I get to pick my own schedule, and that's nice. Matchbox Twenty -- it's four lead singers, there's four front men, and everybody's tastes, everybody's schedule, everybody's personal life comes into account when you're doing something like that. We all live [in four different cities] ... so we literally have to pull ourselves up from all over the country and go somewhere, just to get us into a room to write. And you have to not think you're so great so you don't get upset when somebody doesn't like your stuff. Like ""Her Diamonds"" -- one of the singles on this solo album -- is one of my favorite songs that I've ever written, and the guys loved the song, but didn't want to play it. [They said,] ""When you do a new solo record, you should put it on there. It doesn't sound like a song we would do right now."" And they were right. When we put together the last Matchbox record, it was much more of a rock record. CNN: What's the most surprising thing on your iPod? Thomas: Britney Spears. Come on! ""Toxic,"" man, is just one of the baddest tracks ever! I remember the first time we listened to ""... Baby One More Time."" ... We were like, ""Oh, let's go play Britney Spears on the piano!"" And we all come over drinking, and after a couple of minutes, we're like, ""This Britney Spears is a lot harder than we thought!"" CNN: Whose career would you like to emulate? Thomas: Tom Petty is a famous musician. He's not a music celebrity. When Tom Petty walks down the street, you know that it's Tom Petty, but it would be like, ""Oh my gosh, it's Tom Petty! I love Tom Petty, right on!"" It would never be like, ""Aaaaaaaah!"" -- and 3 million teenage girls follow him down the street.","Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty has new album out, ""Cradlesong""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Six hip-hop artists from five countries speaking four languages are on stage, warming up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. International hip-hop artists warm up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday. ""Warming up"" doesn't really capture it; the dancers explode across the stage, each one with a different hip-hop style. Michelle Salazar is chic-grungy in black jeans and white T-shirt, her long black hair swirling around her head. Hassan El Haf, from Lebanon, tall and thin, does a kind of electric hip-hop mixed with salsa. Argentines Mauricio Trech and Silvia Fernandez move in a dramatic break dance. Both hail from Argentina, home of the tango. Hien Ngoc Pham from Vietnam, with a buzz cut and dressed in white jeans and a white T-shirt, has Broadway bravado in his every move. The dancing stops and Samer Samahneh begins rapping -- in Arabic. No translation needed; it comes from his soul. Three weeks ago, the dancers had never met, but now they're a team, participating in the State Department's Cultural Visitors Program. The program consists of three weeks of meeting American hip-hop artists and dancers and visiting New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. ""It's like a dream come true for me,"" Salazar said Tuesday, the day of the team's show, ""because I only read their names in the Internet and now, like, I met Afrika Bambaataa, the founder of hip-hop. I was right next to him. It's a real immersion into the culture. I don't want to wake up!"" Salazar isn't just star-struck. She's learning a lot and she plans to bring it back to her fellow dancers in the Philippines. ""Dancers in the Philippines don't have much of a foundation [in hip-hop],"" she says. ""They don't understand why dancers do this"" -- she moves her arm -- ""or why they do this"" -- she strikes a pose. ""Because if they knew why they would feel it. I can feel it by watching these [American] hip-hop dancers."" Samahneh agrees: ""You've got to feel it."" His rapping, he says, comes from inside-out. ""Even if you don't know the language, you can get involved with what I'm saying."" Samahneh says that when he raps in his hometown of Nablus in the West Bank, he is ""asking God to bring peace to our land."" Colombia Barrosse, the vibrant head of the State Department's Cultural Programs Division of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, says the cultural cross-fertilization is the goal of the program. ""There is nothing that can substitute for being in the United States and meeting Americans in their place, to look at the richness and diversity of the United States. That's irreplaceable,"" she says. The Cultural Visitors Program is part of the State Department's cultural programming around the world. The $8.5 million budget is supplemented by institutions like the Kennedy Center, which is co-sponsoring this performance. Most of the visiting artists in the program found their way to professional dance through hip-hop. Pham, a member of the Vietnam Dance Association, is currently working to open a hip-hop training center in Ho Chi Minh City to reach out to young people. With a broad smile, he says, ""Hip-hop is such energy. It's so young. It's also an opportunity for our countries to get closer, and I have a lot of friends all over the world."" Hip-hop may have started in the United States, but it belongs to everyone. Here's how Hassan El Haf puts it: When he got to New York, he felt as if he had landed on his ""real planet."" ""Yeah, I see them, all the dancers in the street, the music, all the people that like hip-hop music,"" he says. ""When I do hip-hop, it makes me feel happy all the time. This is my life.""","Hip-hop artists from five countries visit the U.S. to meet U.S. artists, perform .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN)  -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the president of the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday. Germany's Ina Menzer, left, fights American Franchesca Alcanter during a WIBF and WBC featherweight bout in May. The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. ""I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing,"" IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. ""I think it's a great decision. Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.  ""The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games.""  Have your say - should women's boxing be included? A men's class will likely be axed to make room for three women's weight categories at London 2012, the UK Press Association reported. Women will compete in the flyweight 48-51kg class, lightweight 56-60kg and middleweight 69-75kg, the agency said. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal. Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120. As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular. Women's boxing has boomed in Britain since 2005, with the number of registered female fighters rising from 50 to 600, PA reported. Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. Blog: IOC has picked the wrong sports, says CNN's Paul Gittings . The IOC has not yet selected the host city for 2016, but its board members will submit golf and rugby to the full IOC session for a final decision at its meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October. ""Golf and rugby scored high on all the criteria,"" Rogge told the IOC's official Web site. ""They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play."" The International Golf Federation has proposed two four-day strokeplay tournaments for men and women, with 18 holes per round and medals awarded to the three players in each with the lowest scores. The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.","Women's boxing will be included in the 2012 Olympic Games in London .

In a story on its Web site, the newspaper known as Stripes said the military violated a congressional mandate of editorial independence by rejecting a request to embed reporter Heath Druzin with the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division, which is attempting to secure the city of Mosul. The military cited various problems in Druzin's reporting on previous embed assignments with units of the division, according to the story. One example noted by the military was a March 8 story that said many Mosul residents would like the American soldiers to leave and hand over security tasks to Iraqi forces, the Stripes Web site said. ""Despite the opportunity to visit areas of the city where Iraqi Army leaders, soldiers, national police and Iraqi police displayed commitment to partnership, Mr. Druzin refused to highlight any of this news,"" Maj. Ramona Bellard, a public affairs officer, wrote in denying Druzin's embed request, according to the Stripes story. A military official in Iraq defended the move to turn down the reporter's request. ""U.S. Army units in Iraq remain committed to the media embed program and appreciate objective media reporting,"" said Lt. Col. David H. Patterson Jr., a spokesman for Multi-National Corps-Iraq. ""The relationship that Druzin established with the command during a previous embed did not facilitate being invited back."" Patterson added that Druzin was welcome to embed in another unit and that the 1st Cavalry Division was open to having a reporter other than Druzin. ""Accusations of censorship are without merit,"" Patterson said. Other allegations against Druzin by the military included that he used quotes out of context, behaved unprofessionally and persisted in asking Army officials for permission to use a computer to file a story during a communications blackout period, the Stripes story said. Terry Leonard, editorial director at Stars and Stripes, denied the Army's allegations, calling Druzin's previous reporting on the division accurate and fair. ""To simply say 'you can't send him because we didn't like what he wrote' is unacceptable,"" Leonard said. He noted that Congress set up Stripes as an independent newspaper so that ""no commander can decide what news troops in the field receive."" Army officials have offered to allow a different Stripes reporter to embed with the division or to allow Druzin to embed with a different Army unit in Kirkuk, Leonard said. Stripes rejected those offers because the military has no right to deflect coverage from Mosul or decide which Stripes reporter covers its operations, Leonard said. ""To deny Mr. Druzin an embed under the reasons stated by Maj. Bellard is a direct challenge to the editorial independence of this newspaper,"" Leonard wrote in his appeal to the decision, according to the Stripes story. ""That independence is mandated by Congress. The denial of the embed constitutes an attempt at censorship and it is also an illegal prior restraint under federal law. ... The military cannot tell us what stories to write or not write."" Stripes receives close to $10 million a year from the Department of Defense to help defray the costs of covering ""contingency"" operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the publishing and distribution of roughly 85,000 free newspapers a day, Leonard said. The newspaper receives additional government subsidies, with the total amounting to less than half of its budget, he said. Other revenue comes from ad sales and circulation at permanent U.S. military bases and elsewhere, Leonard said. CNN has been denied embed requests on occasion but never because of the past conduct of individual journalists. The reasons have almost always involved logistical details involving security and force coverage.","Newspaper says military's rejection of embed request is censorship .

"(CNN)  -- South Africa strengthened their grip on the Tri-Nations with a 29-17 victory over Australia in Cape Town on Saturday. The Springboks charge forward in their 29-17 victory over Australia at Newlands. It was the third straight win for the world champions, who were indebted to the boot of Morne Steyn as he totaled 24 points with seven penalties and a drop goal at Newlands. The Wallabies took a surprise lead in the second minute as Ashley Cooper barged over for a try with Matt Giteau converting, but the home side slowly took command. Steyne kicked three penalties in the space of six minutes to put them ahead and added a fourth after Berrick Barnes had restored Australia's lead with a drop goal. Steyne then sent over a drop goal of his own and South Africa moved further ahead as Victor Matfield went over for their only try of the match. With the Wallabies reduced to 13 men as Giteau and Richard Brown were sin-binned, Steyn took advantage with another penalty to put them 23-10 ahead at the half. Steyn added his sixth penalty shortly after the break, but Giteau charged through for a try and converted his score to give them hope at 26-17. Steyn's final penalty with two minutes remaining wrapped up the victory. South Africa, who have played all their three matches at home, lead the standings with 12 points, with New Zealand on four and Australia, who have played a game less, with a solitary point. Victory continues a fine run of form for the Springboks, who beat the British and Irish Lions 2-1 in a thrilling series which preceded the annual Tri-Nations tournament.","South Africa beat Australia 29-17 in Tri-Nations match at Newlands .

"(CNN) -- Science fiction flicks featuring aliens can be a little formulaic: Aliens invade American territory, mass destruction ensues, and nine times out of 10, Will Smith rides to the rescue . A company operative (Sharlto Copley) gets an alien's attention in ""District 9."" But the alien-infested ""District 9,"" opening in theaters Friday, takes things in a different direction -- if the producer may say so himself. ""It's utterly original,"" producer Peter Jackson -- yes, ""Lord of the Rings"" helmsman Peter Jackson -- told Entertainment Weekly. ""In an industry that's looking to make movies out of every obscure TV show, or sequels, or video games, you look at 'District 9' and it's unlike anything you've ever seen,"" he said. With its inventive plot and crowd-pleasing special effects, the low-profile, relatively low-budget ($30 million, a pittance these days) film was a hit at Comic-Con, creating a buzz before the film's release. The brainchild of newcomer Neill Blomkamp, ""District 9"" is a mash-up of the director's love for science fiction with his rearing in an apartheid-divided South Africa. Set and shot in the shantytowns of Johannesburg, the film is a mix of action-movie shock and sociological food for thought. The mayhem begins when an alien spaceship runs out of fuel over South Africa in 1981, and simply hovers idly in the sky. With no attack forthcoming, officials finally evacuate a group of aliens -- it turns out they've fled their home world -- and corral them into barbed-wire ghettos, effectively separating the shrimp-like creatures from the human populace. Overseeing the aliens' camp is the corporation Multi-National United (MNU). It's an obvious nod to South Africa's own violent and divisive history, but director Blomkamp says he isn't aiming for political commentary. ""This is an organic thing that has grown out of me living in South Africa. I didn't want to go, 'Here's a whole bunch of people that have been oppressed by this apartheid-esque society' and beat people over the head with it,"" he told CNN. ""I wanted to say, 'This is the city I grew up in, and this is what it felt like,' with a science fiction veneer to it so that it doesn't take itself that seriously."" Documentary-like authenticity was of prime importance to Blomkamp, and was the reason for his casting of fellow South African unknown Sharlto Copley as leading man. Copley has no prior acting experience, but critics have lauded his portrayal of Wikus van de Merwe, a private-sector employee who goes from being the oppressor to one of the oppressed after an accidental run-in with some DNA-transforming alien goo. ""Having grown up in South Africa, I was exposed to the tail end of apartheid as a child, [and] it's something I felt I could relate to,"" Copley said. ""Playing the character, I saw so clearly how you discriminate. ... The film deals with things that are fundamentally human."" ""District 9"" is also fundamentally a thriller, and there's no shortage of gory, gritty scenes and clever special effects that will appeal to fans who like a little action with their sci-fi. Indeed, the film has been praised for its masterful use of special effects, weaving the technology seamlessly into the documentary-style scenes. Sometimes the two are in the very same shot, Blomkamp said. ""One of the first shots completed was a motherboard shot, where [computer-generated imagery] was incorporated into some of the handheld footage, and it felt like it was working, this idea of handheld stuff with [CGI],"" Blomkamp said. ""It set a good tone; it captured the essence of what I was going for."" Not bad for a 29-year-old novice, who had previously directed short films and commercials. But that body of work was impressive enough to catch the eye of A-list producer Jackson, who originally had Blomkamp in mind for feature version of Halo, the video game. ""[Jackson] had received all of the crazy short films and commercials I had done, and once I met him and hung out and got familiar with the kind of filmmaking universe he set up down there, he did sign off on me as director of 'Halo,' "" Blomkamp recalled. But, five months into the project, the plug was pulled on ""Halo."" ""Right away, [Jackson] said, 'If you want, you can stay in New Zealand and we can just keep the momentum going and allow another film to take place,' "" Blomkamp said. One of Blomkamp's friends suggested his short film, ""Alive in Jo'burg,"" for feature treatment. Blomkamp ran with the concept, developing it alongside fellow screenwriter Terri Tatchell into ""District 9."" ""It's pretty cool,"" Blomkamp said. ""I would've packed my bags and left had [Jackson] not said that."" It's been more than two years since Blomkamp started the project, and though he's found the experience exhausting, he has quite a final product to show off. ""There is nothing better than to come out the end of that process and have it play in a movie theater,"" he said. ""For that first film, I got what I had set out to do, [and] that's a pretty awesome feeling.""

"GAZA CITY (CNN) -- A radical Muslim sheikh called Friday for the creation of an Islamic emirate in Gaza, sparking clashes with Hamas forces that left 13 people dead, Hamas sources tell CNN. Armed members of the radical Islamist group Jund Ansar Allah surround a group representative in Rafah on Friday. The clashes ended after several hours, after Hamas forces blew up the home of Sheikh Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi, leader of the Salafist jihadist group Jund Ansar Allah, or Soldiers of the Partisans of God, the sources said. Al-Maqdessi escaped, they said, and Hamas security forces were searching for him. The clashes were the latest between Gaza's Hamas rulers, who have said they are moderate Muslims pledged to the Palestinian cause, and more radical Islamic groups. In a televised statement, Hamas ministry spokesman Taher Nunu called al-Maqdessi's group ""outlaws"" and said they have been ""terrorizing the country and attacking civilians."" ""We hold the group and its leader fully responsible for what is happening in Gaza, and we offer our condolences to everyone who was killed during the clashes,"" Nunu said. ""No one is above the law, and we urge everyone who is a member of this group to surrender himself to the authorities, or they will be accountable for all of their actions."" The gunfighting erupted near a mosque in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the cleric delivered his sermon, the sources said. Hamas militants raided the mosque and seized control of it. Later, the fighting spread to al-Maqdessi's home, the sources said. The fighting has left at least 13 dead and more than 100 wounded, the sources said. Al-Maqdessi also called for a public meeting at the mosque, posting on Jund Ansar Allah's Web site an invitation dubbed ""the golden advice to the government of [Hamas leader] Ismail Haniya."" The group posted a statement on the site announcing the establishment of the Islamic emirate in Gaza and proclaiming al-Maqdessi ""the commander of the faithful."" The statement declared that armed forces in Gaza should unite under him. The statement urged Muslims everywhere to support the ""young emirate"" and provide the group with money, weapons and men because ""this is the hope of the Muslim nation in raising the banner of monotheism in Palestine and to liberate all the lands and purify Al-Aqsa mosque from the filth of the damned Jews."" Al-Aqsa mosque is in Jerusalem. The group accused Hamas of not being Islamic enough, saying Hamas cares more about pleasing ""tyrants"" than ""obeying God."" But Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zahri dismissed statements about the establishment of an Islamic emirate as ""theoretical."" ""It is not permitted to any party or individual to enforce their own laws, because this is the responsibility of the security forces,"" he said. Salafi is the term used to describe the radical islamist movement that follows the doctrines of the ""Salaf,"" or the predecessors, referring to the early generations of Muslims. The movement rejects all modern influences such as politics and government.

"(CNN) -- A Florida jury has recommended the death penalty for a plumber who kidnapped, raped and murdered a police detective's daughter. Denise Lee's frantic 911 call was the centerpiece of her killer's trial. Michael King, 38, showed no reaction Friday afternoon as the jury's 12-0 decision was announced in Sarasota. Jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. King was convicted a week ago of first-degree murder and related offenses in the January 17, 2008, death of Denise Lee, a 21-year-old mother of two boys. Nathan Lee and Sgt. Dave Goff, the victim's husband and father, remained composed in court. They had maintained a daily presence in the courtroom during a trial that included the heartbreaking tape of Denise Lee's frantic 911 call on her captor's cell phone.  Watch the jury recommend death » . In Florida, a jury's recommendation for a death sentence is advisory. King will be formally sentenced later. Judges rarely overturn a jury's unanimous decision. Jurors Marcia Burns and Pat O'Quinn told reporters that defense testimony about King's head injury from a sledding accident and his low IQ carried little weight in the jury room. Denise Lee's father and husband had hoped for the death penalty. ""I don't think he should be able to live another day,"" Nathan Lee said Friday as he awaited the verdict. Lee and Goff told the jury that she was a bright young woman who put aside her career ambitions to marry her college sweetheart and raise their two boys, now 2 and 3. ""She was everything we could wish for in a daughter and more,"" Goff said. Several jurors had tears in their eyes as Nathan Lee described his wife as a devoted mother who was nursing one son and potty-training another when a stranger abducted her from their home. ""I was so proud to call her my wife,"" he said. ""Denise was the love of my life, my soul mate. I knew after our first date that I had found the perfect girl."" He added that their boys ""know their beautiful, courageous mommy has gone to heaven and now is an angel."" King's siblings spoke of how a childhood sledding accident left him with a head injury that contributed to a lifetime of troubles. One expert described the injury as a ""divot"" in his brain. Experts testified that scans indicated that King's brain was abnormally shaped, especially his frontal lobe: the center for logic, planning and reason. His IQ was described as about 76, in the low range. A person with an IQ of 70 is considered to be mentally retarded, according to testimony. King's brother, Greg, testified that the defendant was 6 when he crashed head-first into a post while being pulled on a sled by a snowmobile. ""I felt bad for him,"" Greg King said. ""I felt responsible, but I wasn't."" As a child, Michael King would get a faraway look in his eyes, witnesses said. Once, he fired his BB gun at witches he said he saw in the trees. Another time, he chased family members around the house with a running chainsaw. His eyes were ""bugging out,"" his brother testified. King also complained of headaches and hearing ""a buzzing sound"" in his head, Greg King told the jury. King seemed to be deteriorating mentally in late 2007, according to testimony. He faced foreclosure, was considering filing for bankruptcy and broke up with a girlfriend on Thanksgiving Day. The ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Robb, testified that he sat on the bed staring into space and unable to dress himself. ""He acted as if he were somewhere else,"" she said. But she said she never knew him to be violent. According to testimony, Lee was taken from her home during the afternoon, driven to King's home, sexually assaulted and then shot in the head and buried in a ditch. During the trial, Lee's voice filled the courtroom as her desperate 911 call was played to the jury.  Listen to the heartbreaking 911 call » . A 911 operator repeatedly said ""Hello,"" and Lee was heard pleading with her captor: ""I'm sorry. I just want to see my family. ... I just want to see my family again. Please. ... Oh, please, I just want to see my family again. Let me go."" Eventually, Lee managed to say, ""My name is Denise. I'm married to a beautiful husband, and I just want to see my kids again. ... Please, God, please protect me."" Lee's heart-shaped ring, a gift from her husband, was found in King's car, and hair matching hers was found on duct tape at King's house. According to testimony and court records, Lee fought frantically for her life, banging on the windows of King's green Camaro, screaming for help and begging one witness, ""Call the cops."" Several people reported seeing something suspicious and called 911. But authorities didn't find Lee in time, and allegations that dispatchers mishandled the calls have led to criticism of the local 911 system. The 911 communications breakdown was blamed on a shift change, and two dispatchers were suspended, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Lee's husband has launched a foundation bearing her name that works toward 911 reform. He plans to file a lawsuit this month, a family spokesman said.","Jury votes 12-0 to recommend death sentence .

"PARIS, France -- Samoa center Brian Lima's World Cup is over after his dangerous tackle on England star Jonny Wilkinson. Lima arrives for his hearing regarding his dangerous challenge on England's Jonny Wilkinson. Lima, the only player to feature in five World Cups, has received a three-week suspension after being cited for the tackle during Saturday's Pool A clash in Nantes. Wilkinson escaped injury and match referee Alan Lewis did not punish Lima during the game, which England won 44-22 to knock Samoa out of the competition. But World Cup judicial officer Professor Lorne Crerar has upheld the complaint lodged by match citing commissioner Steven Hines. It means 35-year-old Lima will miss Samoa's tournament finale against the United States on Wednesday, with an additional two weeks' punishment also imposed. Lima is poised to quit international rugby after the World Cup, and although he has 48 hours to appeal against the decision, it is improbable a hearing could be convened before Wednesday's game. Samoa will head home after the U.S clash, having already seen the current World Cup campaign consigned to being the worst in their history.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A killer bug is spreading like wildfire. Armed guards stand outside the Mexico City Respiratory Hospital to control the flow of people. Streets of one of the world's biggest cities are eerily empty. Bars and restaurants have been shuttered for days. The president goes on TV to tell workers to stay at home for their own safety. Those who venture outside are clad in surgical masks. Once healthy people are suddenly falling sick and dying from a new disease, H1N1 swine flu. The government swears the situation is under control. But down at the hospital, medics scurry around behind the glass door of an isolation ward. They're clad from head to toe in biohazard suits, goggles and two pairs of gloves. At the airport, officials set up a barrage of thermal imaging machines. If the picture flashes up red or orange, would-be passengers are whisked off to medical facilities.  See where the virus has been confirmed » . It may sound like a sci-fi movie. It's not. Welcome to Mexico City. It's a nightmare scenario and despite twice-a-day news conferences featuring Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova, people on the streets fear the virus may be out of control and that the real death toll may be greater than anyone is letting on.  Watch how the city has been shut down » . ""The measures we're taking are working and are helping us to slow the spread of the virus. But the situation continues to be serious,"" Cordova said at a news conference this week. Government orders to its citizens are clear: wash frequently, don't shake hands or kiss, and stay away from crowded places. That's easier said than done. The doors on the subway car snap open at Hidalgo station. Dozens more passengers clad in surgical masks stream on. It's rush hour deep below the streets of downtown Mexico City. The subway system is the veins of the capital, ferrying millions of people from all social classes to and from work. It's hot and humid down there and there's little fresh air. It's just the kind of crowded place that Mexican authorities say could be a prime breeding ground for swine flu. ""I'm pretty nervous of this whole virus thing,"" welder Frontino Valdez mumbled  through one of the masks.  Watch passengers packed onto trains trying to protect themselves » . Sitting one carriage down, Berta Hernandez, a product demonstrator, tries not to show her panic and applies eyeliner like any other morning. But today she has a problem, she has no intention of lifting her mask to paint on lip gloss. ""I'm nervous of those people who aren't wearing masks. Maybe they will suddenly sneeze or cough,"" she said. In these days of swine flu paranoia, just coughing, or worse sneezing, in the subway, or ""metro"" as they call it here, brings black looks from fellow passengers. This has been a strange epidemic since the outset. So far, the Mexican government has been unable to pinpoint where or when this outbreak started. Authorities admit there was an outbreak of influenza in a village in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz in early April. But only one patient -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez -- was diagnosed as having swine flu.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta ask the boy about his symptoms » . The international media have taken to calling him ""Patient Zero."" He made a full recovery. So far there's no evidence a pig farm near his home reported any problems with its livestock. The family hasn't explained how little Edgar could have infected a capital city let alone the world. The authorities haven't drawn up a genetic map of Edgar's illness nor compared it to the lethal strain that swept through Mexico City and other parts of the country. Lethal it is. But getting to the truth of who has really died from the virus is tough. Since midweek, the government abandoned its initial reporting and began to speak only of confirmed swine flu cases and confirmed deaths due to the H1N1 virus. Previously it had also tallied suspected cases and others under observation. In practice, it is taking days for the government to get test results from autopsies and tests. By the time a case is confirmed the patient may be long buried. One afternoon this week, at a cinder block home perched on a hillside in a poor northern neighborhood of Mexico City, a coffin was mounted on the living room table. A steady stream of neighbors filed in to pay their final tribute to a dead 24-year-old. Biting back tears, a young man said his brother had died of ""respiratory problems."" When asked what kind of a person his brother was, he said simply: ""He was an honest man. He never got in any trouble."" The man seemed to be feeling an underlying sense of shame. Suddenly there was a huge stigma attached to swine flu -- like in the early days of AIDS-related deaths -- and Mexican families were keen to dispel notions their loved ones had died of the mutant virus. They didn't want the prying eyes of the media near their home. We wanted to tell their story, observe the wake and follow the funeral. But death is a rite of passage. They had a right to mourn in private. The following day came a tip-off that a 5-year-old girl, Maria Fernanda Garcia, had died. The modest side street outside her home in eastern Mexico City was swarming with police, health workers and civil protection officials.  Watch how armed guards were part of Maria Fernanda's funeral » . Little Maria Fernanda's father appeared briefly and told us we weren't welcome. He was curt when he told us his daughter had died from pneumonia. A medic confirmed the specific cause of death was indeed pneumonia. But he added the hospital was still waiting for test results to confirm whether the underlying cause was swine flu. He conceded that process could take days. But judging by the heavy security, local authorities certainly feared this was another case of the virus. ""These are the prevention measures we must take. This case is still not confirmed but we must take these steps to protect citizens,"" said Victor Luna, a member of the public security detail for this district of Mexico City. A few minutes later, the hearse with Maria Fernanda's body pulled out of the housing complex where she lived. Her dad was clutching a Winnie Pooh cuddly toy as he rode up front. Police and health officials shadowed the funeral cortege to the graveyard. Police guards only permitted immediate family and close friends through the iron gates. Through the bars silent, tearful mourners could be seen weaving through a labyrinth of headstones. Later that afternoon, the family had left Maria Fernanda's grave -- a tiny patch of newly dug dry earth, not much more than 3 feet long. It was covered with sweet-scented white flowers. The plaque on the grave was a simple hand-painted affair: . ""Maria Fernanda. 2004 to 2009. We love you.""","Every aspect of life has been hit by the spread of H1N1 in Mexico City .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Terrorism groups are using Facebook and other social networking sites to recruit Israeli citizens as spies, the Israeli government warned Monday. Israel says its citizens have been targeted by terrorist groups seeking to recruit spies on Facebook. Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, issued a statement warning Israelis about the dangers of trading confidential information for money. ""The Shin Bet has gotten many reports about cases where terrorist elements are using the Internet to get in touch with Israelis with proposals to enlist in terror activity or to pass classified information in exchange for payment,"" the statement said. Not only could the leaked information hurt Israeli security, citizens traveling to other countries to exchange the information for money ""might lead to them being kidnapped by terror organizations,"" Shin Bet said. The government did not reveal any examples of Israelis becoming spies through Facebook, but it did describe one attempt. ""Lately, an Israeli citizen contacted the Shin Bet and complained about a request in Facebook from a person that presented himself as a Lebanese merchant, who asked him to give him classified information for money,"" the statement said. Shin Bet said this was just one example ""among many incidents that were identified by the security services."" ""It is initiated contacts, concrete and direct to Israeli citizens, with emphasis on the social networks, that offers them to enlist to terror activity or to pass classified information in exchange for payment,"" it said.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN)  -- A federal grand jury has indicted two Minnesota men in connection with the recruitment of Somali immigrants to fight with Islamic insurgents in their home country. Jamal Bana is one of several missing Somali-Americans believed to have fought with an Islamist insurgency. Salah Osman Ahmed and Abdifatah Yusuf Isse are charged with one count each of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure people overseas, the indictment states. The recruiting effort took place between September 2007 and December 2008, according to the charges. Ahmed also is charged with two counts of making false statements to investigators. According to the indictment, he told FBI agents that he had traveled alone on a flight to Somalia when, in fact, he and another person were going together ""so that they could fight jihad in Somalia."" Ahmed was arrested Saturday, FBI Special Agent E.K. Wilson told CNN. Isse had been in custody for some time, said Omar Jamal, the head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis. Both were from Minnesota and in their 20s, Jamal said. Jamal said Ahmed and Isse were ""foot soldiers"" carrying out the work of others, and that he expected more indictments ""in a week or two."" The FBI has been investigating what appears to be a massive recruiting effort by the al Qaeda-linked Somali insurgent group al-Shabaab in immigrant communities in the United States. More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis area in recent months, and at least three have been killed in Somalia, community leaders have said. The latest, Jamal Bana, was confirmed dead over the weekend, his family said Sunday. The same day, Somalia's president -- a former member of the Islamist movement himself -- issued a plea to Somali-Americans not to join the fight in his country. ""I am saying to those young men from abroad: 'Your families fled your home to America because of insecurity. You should not return here to foment violence against your people,' "" President Sheik Sharif Ahmed said. Al-Shabaab has ties to al Qaeda and has recruited foreign fighters to join its battle to overthrow the Somali government, U.S. officials said. It remains entrenched in the northeast and in sections south of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, after fighting that has uprooted more than 200,000 people since early May, according to the United Nations. Wilson said the number of missing men believed to be in Somalia is ""in the 10s,"" but their recruitment is ""a significant concern and one that we're giving our highest priority."" In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American believed to have been radicalized by al-Shabaab, traveled from Minneapolis to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others. It was the first suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen, and it raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI. Burhan Hassan, a 17-year-old Somali-American high school student in Minneapolis, went missing eight months ago, around the same time as Bana. Last month, his family learned that he was killed in Somalia. Neither family has any idea why the young males left the United States, where they came as young boys, and Bana's family believes he was being held against his will, said Omar Jamal, head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis. ""Only one time he placed a phone call [in mid-November], he didn't say much,"" Jamal said. ""He spoke as if he was being held hostage. He couldn't be speak freely.

Maruf was the first of the missing Somalis to head overseas, said Bihi, who has become a spokesman for the families of the missing men. Bihi called him a ""leader"" whom the others consulted on travel plans. Many of the missing Somali-Americans are believed to have left for Somalia when Ethiopian forces were still on the ground. Ethiopia invaded Somalia to push the Islamists out of Mogadishu in December 2006, but their presence in the country was an outrage to most Somalis and became a rallying cry for al-Shabaab. Ethiopian troops left Somalia this year, leaving Ahmed's weak transitional government to battle the insurgents.

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Disney World has not been the happiest place on Earth for employees this year. The Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, has lost some 1,600 jobs. Imagine one day receiving recognition for decades of service from your employer only to be laid off the next day. That is what happened to one Walt Disney Parks and Resorts employee who asked not be identified. Disney has eliminated 1,900 U.S.-based positions since mid-February. Some 900 salaried employees working at Disney's theme parks in Florida were laid off, and 700 open positions were eliminated, said communications Vice President Mike Griffin. In California, 200 workers were laid off and 100 open positions were cut. Disneyland in California and Disney World are having their behind-the-scenes operations combined in a restructuring, said Griffin. Disney officials say theme parks, the Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club and off-property resorts have seen some people with decades of experience laid off during the restructuring. The former employee let go after decades of service is still hoping to return once the economy improves. Several other employees said they did not want speak to CNN in fear of jeopardizing the generous severance packages offered by Disney. Employees let go will receive pay for 60 days; extended medical coverage; and severance packages that vary according to their years of service, said a Disney source. Disney's Griffin said: ""These decisions were not made lightly, but are essential to maintaining our leadership in family tourism and reflect today's economic realities."" Central Florida's unemployment rate is 9.7 percent -- a 33-year high, according to the area's job service agency, Workforce Central Florida. The rate is more than double from the same time a year ago. The job agency's spokeswoman, Kimberly Cornett, said 40,000 to 50,000 people registered with the agency are vying for 1,000 jobs available through Workforce Central Florida. Fewer than 100 available job listings are in the tourism industry. Cornett said she does not believe Disney's layoffs will have a significant effect to the area's overall economy, since currently 107,000 people are unemployed in Central Florida. Cornett said, however, that the effect would be huge for those laid off. Orlando area hotels have been hit hard, too, with fewer tourist and business travelers. Orange County reported in February it collected 29 percent less revenue in a hotel bed tax in comparison to a year ago, said Brian Martin of the Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau. Martin said the large drop is due to fewer booked hotel rooms at reduced rates to attract visitors. The convention and visitors bureau, in a survey of area hotels, has found companies are traveling less for meetings in Orlando. The hotels report that in the first two months of 2009, some 114 small business meetings were canceled, with $26 million in lost revenue. Martin said the White House is partly to blame for the dropoff in business meetings. President Obama said companies that receive taxpayer bailout money should not use the money to ""go take a trip to Las Vegas."" ""When the president said 'don't travel,' business travel has been affected,"" Martin said. Las Vegas is the country's most popular convention destination, with Orlando No. 2. Orlando has not seen any large convention cancellations in 2009, the convention bureau says. Statistics from 2007, the latest available, show that even if Orlando saw a 10 percent drop in visitors, nearly 44 million people would still come to the city. Disney's 2008 financial report showed income was down last year. Disney would not comment on whether park attendance was up or down. A source within Disney said that even though the theme parks are crowded, customers are not buying. Disney's Mike Griffin said: ""We continue to work through our reorganization and manage our business based on demand."" Griffin said the corporation's reorganization has been under way since 2005 and many of the recent positions eliminated would have eventually been cut. Due to the economy, Griffins said, the cuts took place sooner than expected. He added that Disney is downsizing just like many other U.S. businesses.","One Disney employee recognized for decades of service, is laid off next day .

"(CNN) -- At least 44 people, including 23 Filipino soldiers, died Wednesday in fighting between the Philippine military and Islamic militants, the country's armed services said on Thursday. A wounded Philippine Marine receives a medal from Major Gen. Benjamin Dolorfino in Zamboanga Thursday. The fighting was sparked by military raids on Abu Sayyaf militant training camps in the villages of Silangkum and Baguindan on the southern island province of Basilan, said Steffani Cacho, public information officer for the Philippine Armed Services. Thirty to 40 militants were killed, but only 21 bodies had been recovered, the military said. Twenty-three members of the military were killed and 22 suffered injuries. The militants used the training camps to temporarily house kidnapping victims and make explosives, Cacho said, adding that high-power firearms, explosives and documents were seized in the raids. Abu Sayyaf, which has been linked to the al Qaeda terrorist network, is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the Philippine government. The group operates largely in Basilan, according to the U.S. State Department, and wants to establish a separate state for the country's minority Muslim population. The government has been fighting to contain the group, which is blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead. This year Abu Sayyaf has been implicated in the kidnappings of several Red Cross workers and journalists.","Thirty to 40 militants were killed, but only 21 bodies recovered, military says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Cheryl Reed's morning routine starts like that of millions of other mothers around the country. She makes breakfast for her 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter, piles them into a minivan and drops them off at school. Cheryl Reed has a rare form of breast cancer that mostly affects young African-American women. It's the next stop that sets Reed apart from other women. Three weeks a month, she heads to the infusion center at the Emory Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, for chemotherapy treatments. Reed, 40, has breast cancer; not just any form of the disease, but a rare, aggressive and difficult to treat version called triple negative. Of the estimated 180,000 women who learn they have invasive breast cancer this year in the United States, about 15 percent will have triple negative. Like Reed, the majority of triple negative patients will be young African-American women. ""It never occurred to me that I'm going to die from this,"" Reed said. ""I was like, 'I've got breast cancer, let's take care of it.' "" Reed did take care of it. For eight months during 2006, she endured chemotherapy and radiation treatments. She thought the cancer was in remission, but it returned last November. This time, it had spread to her liver, lungs and chest wall. ""Triple negative cancers do tend to be aggressive in their natural histories, so they have a very high rate of recurrence or relapsing,"" explained Dr. Ruth O'Regan, Reed's oncologist at the Winship Institute. She's one of several breast cancer experts around the country who are trying to learn more about what causes triple negative and how to treat it more effectively. Dr. Funmi Olopade, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, was at the forefront of identifying triple negative and the trend among African-American women. She said what makes it different from other types of breast cancer is that women with the disease lack three hormone receptors known to fuel most breast cancer tumors: estrogen, progesterone and HER2.  Health Minute: More on triple negative breast cancer » . ""When you have triple negative, it means that we cannot use hormone therapy. ... The only way we can treat that type of breast cancer is to use chemotherapy,"" Olopade said. Tamoxifen and Herceptin, two of the most effective medications for treating breast cancer, don't work for triple negative breast cancer patients. But if a patient responds well to chemotherapy, Olopade said, there's a very good chance of curing the disease. ""The challenge we have is when the cancer comes back,"" she added. ""Right now, we don't have any effective way to treat it, and that's why when it comes back, it tends to be deadly."" Reed is enrolled in a clinical trial at the Winship center where she's receiving chemotherapy along with a drug called Avastin, which cuts the blood supply to cancer cells. Olopade is hoping better drugs will be available in the next two to five years that will help eradicate triple negative cancer cells. In the meantime, she stressed, early detection is the key to recovery, especially for women at highest risk. ""In this country, what we have found was young African-American women have a rate that is higher than young white women, and we don't know if that is because of a gene or other risk factors,"" Olopade said. ""We know that women with a family history of breast cancer who have a BRCA1 mutation are most at risk,"" she said. BRCA1 is a major breast cancer-causing gene that was identified 14 years ago. Olopade said women born with the defective gene have a higher chance of getting breast cancer and at a younger age. Olopade also wants to explore further whether triple negative rates are higher among women who do not breastfeed their children. ""It's that first pregnancy and first breastfeeding that really allows the breast to become fully mature,"" she said. She worried that in general, ""African-Americans are not likely to breastfeed, as they are getting in the work force and returning to work soon after childbirth."" Even with several clues, Olopade acknowledged that researchers still don't know a lot about triple negative breast cancer and more study is needed. She encouraged all young women, no matter what their race, to talk to their doctor about doing a risk assessment for the BRCA1 gene. If there is a family history of the gene mutation, some physicians may tell a woman not wait until she turns 40 to get her first mammogram. ""We begin screening as early at 25,"" Olopade said. ""Many of the women are surviving. They are beating the odds of dying because they know they can do preventive approaches to reduce their risk of dying."" Reed is trying to increase her chances of survival by getting experimental treatment in the clinical trial. She seems to be responding well, but she's realistic. ""There's always the possibility that once this is done, it could be two years and I'm back in treatment again,"" she said. ""It really is a part of my life now. ... I'm a survivor."" CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","Triple negative breast cancer is rare, aggressive and difficult to treat .

"(CNN) -- The United States hailed a World Trade Organization ruling to open Chinese markets and ease controls on the import of U.S. films, DVDs, music downloads and books. U.S. Trade Rep. Ron Kirk, shown, says WTO's decision will ""help pave the way toward more open trade."" ""Today, a WTO panel handed a significant victory to America's creative industries,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said Wednesday. ""These findings are an important step toward ensuring market access for legitimate U.S. products in the Chinese market, as well as ensuring market access for U.S. exporters and distributors of those products."" In its ruling, the WTO said China violates free-trade rules by requiring importers to channel media products such as movies, books and music through state-owned companies, rather than giving them direct access to Chinese markets. China denied the charges in the ruling. ""The country has always fulfilled its obligations set by WTO on issues related to publication products market entrance permission,"" Yao Jian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, said Thursday. ""China will carefully evaluate the decision. ... Possibilities for China to issue an appeal on its concerned points cannot be ruled out."" The U.S. trade representative's office said the ruling could put an end to China's discriminatory trade practices. ""This decision promises to level the playing field for American companies working to distribute high-quality entertainment products in China, so that legitimate American products can get to market and beat out the pirates,"" Kirk said. ""To me, that is a clear win. We believe that this report will help pave the way toward more open trade between China and America."" In recent years, U.S. officials have pressed Chinese officials for help in controlling the counterfeiting of U.S. products and the illegal copying and distribution of copyrighted U.S. products, including movies, music and software. Counterfeit products are estimated to cost U.S. companies billions of dollars in lost revenue. Though senior U.S. law enforcement officials have expressed optimism, China remains a haven for pirated U.S. products.","China violates free-trade rules by impeding direct access to markets, WTO says .

"(CNN)  -- Late last month, Michelle Russell somberly walked on a Maui beach in Hawaii to mark her daughter Sarah Skiba's 20th birthday. Sarah Skiba visited her father, Paul Skiba, every other weekend. For Russell, who last saw Sarah more than a decade ago, when she was just 9 years old, some images will never fade with the passage of time. Russell especially recalls the cold Friday morning in February 1999 when she dropped Sarah off at a bus stop in Westminster, Colorado, for her ride to school. ""She loved to go to school,"" Russell said, remembering that Sarah ran for the bus and slipped on ice. ""She skinned her wrist at the bottom of her hand, and she was crying,"" Russell said. ""I had a first aid kit and gave her a Band-Aid."" After school that day, Sarah's father, Paul Skiba, met Sarah to spend the weekend together, a visitation arrangement in place since Russell and Skiba divorced several years earlier. ""Her father picked her up at 3:30 p.m.,"" Russell said. ""She visited her father every other weekend."" On Sunday, Sarah joined her father -- who owned a moving company -- and his employee Lorenzo Chivers as they went to a moving job.  Watch a report about the case » . ""We know they had two moving jobs that day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon,"" said Thornton Police Department Sgt. Pat Long, the original investigator on the case. The second job was for a man who lived in Morrison, Colorado. The girl, her father and Chivers left Morrison between 5 and 5:30 p.m. to return the moving truck to the Westminster parking lot where Skiba stored his vehicles, Long says. On the way, a 12-year-old relative of Paul Skiba's girlfriend, Theresa Donovan, received a call from Sarah. The girl said they were on their way to return the truck and would then come home. But Sarah and her father never made it back to the house he and Donovan shared. Michelle Russell later called police, who initially thought it was a parental abduction, even though Chivers was also missing. ""It was almost three weeks after that that I became involved,"" Long said. ""I think we lost some key evidence during the initial time that passed at the scene."" Paul Skiba's family and friends went to his truck storage lot one week after the girl and the two men went missing and grew suspicious when they found what they believed were two bullet holes in the exteriors of Skiba's moving trucks, Long said. They also noticed that Skiba's only functioning truck was not parked quite the way he would have done it himself. ""Paul was adamant that the moving truck always be parked in a certain position, and the way it was found was pulled nose-in and not back-in,"" Long said. ""Everyone knows he was anal about the way that truck was parked."" Suspected ambush . Long said he thinks there was an attempt to disguise the scene to make it appear that the victims had come back to the lot and left. Investigators from the Thornton Police Department CSI, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and the Westminster Police Department confirmed that bullets had, in fact, pierced Skiba's trucks. They also identified blood spatter on the two trucks and blood inside the cab of the truck used in the move. Hair attached to a piece of scalp was found on the hood of Skiba's moving truck, and additional hair was on the truck's fender. DNA tests revealed that blood on the ground belonged to Paul and Sarah Skiba. The piece of scalp belonged to Paul. The hair was Sarah's. ""The pool of blood on the ground looked like motor oil that had spilled,"" Long said. Authorities believe that the three were ambushed and killed when they returned the truck to the lot. Police think their bodies were put in the back of Skiba's moving truck, driven to another location and dumped. Chivers may have been forcibly taken from the lot and then murdered or killed at the lot in a manner that would have produced no evidence, according to police. No bodies were ever found, leaving police to suspect that Chivers was also a victim. ""We did have a witness who saw the truck come back to the lot,"" Long said. The truck's loading ramp, moving blankets and straps were also missing. Chivers' and Skiba's personal cars, which they had left at the lot during their Sunday moving jobs, were parked at separate apartment complexes across Denver. Investigators were never able to make a direct link between the victims and those buildings. Skiba was the likely target, they say, and Sarah and Chivers were bystanders. Police have interviewed as many as 80 people, but no arrests have been made. ""In my opinion, I believe we know or we have a strong feeling who is involved in the murders,"" Long said, declining to say more or disclose the possible motive. A tragic anniversary . Meanwhile, Russell has been doing her part to help solve the tragic mystery. ""I've done air, water and land searches, door-to-door searches, you name it,"" she said. She has also raised $50,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Sarah's disappearance and apparent murder. ""This being the 10-year anniversary, we just really wanted to get a lot of focus on this case again and find my daughter and what has happened to her,"" Russell said. On the beach, Russell did things she knew her daughter would enjoy. She even brought cupcakes. ""We went for a walk, drove around. ... I was on my own, but I was with her,"" Russell said. ""It's pretty sad when the guest of honor is nowhere to be found."" In her short time, Sarah celebrated life with sports, learning and music. ""Sarah sang as soon as she got up each morning, as well as at the dinner table, in the bathroom and to pet her dogs,'' Russell said. ' 'They were like her siblings,'' she added, explaining that Sarah was an only child. ""Someone took her away from me unjustly. I'm not going to sleep until I know why."" Anyone with more information is asked to call the Westminster Police Department at (303) 658-2400.","Sarah Skiba and father went missing in 1999, along with employee Lorenzo Chivers .

Hillary Clinton meets with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan on Friday to discuss North Korea. Speaking to ABC's ""This Week,"" Clinton also said the president has answered the central question she raised about him when she was his chief rival for the Democratic nomination last year. In her famous ""3 a.m."" ad, she questioned whether Obama was the right candidate to handle a middle-of-the-night international crisis. ""Has the president answered it for you?"" host George Stephanopoulos asked. ""Absolutely,"" Clinton replied. ""And, you know, the president, in his public actions and demeanor, and certainly in private with me and with the national security team, has been strong, thoughtful, decisive, I think he is doing a terrific job. And it's an honor to serve with him."" The former senator from New York and former first lady revealed details of how she came to accept the role.  Watch analysts dissect the Clinton-Obama relationship » . ""I never had any dream, let alone inkling, that I would end up in President Obama's cabinet,"" she said. ""When I left the presidential race after getting some sleep and taking some deep breaths, I immediately went to work for him in the general election. ... And I was looking forward to going back to the Senate and, frankly, going back to my life and representing New York, which I love. And I had no idea that he had a different plan in mind."" When her name was mentioned in the media as a possible member of Obama's cabinet, Clinton said, she found the idea ""absurd."" ""And then when he called and asked me to come see him, and we had our first conversation, I said, 'You know, I really don't think I'm the person to do this, I want to go back to my life. I really feel like I owe it to the people of New York.' And I gave him a bunch of other names of people who I thought would be great secretaries of state."" But Obama ""was quite persistent and very persuasive,"" Clinton said. She added, ""Ultimately, it came down to my feeling that, number one, when your president asks you to do something for your country, you really need a good reason not to do it. Number two, if I had won and I had asked him to please help me serve our country, I would have hoped he would say yes. And finally, I looked around our world and I thought, you know, we are in just so many deep holes that everybody had better grab a shovel and start digging out."" Some analysts have raised questions about how much power Clinton actually has in the administration, given that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have done a great deal of international outreach themselves. The president has also appointed special envoys to focus on several key regions. But Clinton said she wanted the envoys appointed ""because we were inheriting so many hot spot problems that I knew you could never have one person possibly address all of that."" One of the biggest is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Clinton and the president have called on Israel to halt construction at settlements in the West Bank. Asked whether there is any room for compromise on that issue, Clinton said the administration would not ""prejudge the effort."" She said the administration is committed to Israel's security. ""We see historical, demographic, political, technological trends that are very troubling as to Israel's future. At the same time, there is a legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people that needs to be addressed."" On the nuclear standoff with Iran, Clinton said a diplomatic process in which U.S. representatives sit down with Iran's authorized representatives would give ""us information and insight that we don't have. ... We don't have any really clear sense as to what it is they are seeking."" Clinton also addressed the growing tensions surrounding North Korea, and what she called its ""very provocative and belligerent behavior"" with recent tests of missile and nuclear technology. ""One of the positive developments,"" she said, is that ""it has actually brought the [other] members of [the] six-party process -- Japan, South Korea, China, Russia, the United States -- much closer together"" in how they view the challenge. She said there may be additional U.N. sanctions against North Korea. Several lawmakers have asked the president to put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism. ""We're going to look at it,"" Clinton said. ""There's a process for it. Obviously we would want to see recent evidence of their support for international terrorism."" She emphasized that North Korea's detention of two U.S. journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, is separate from the political issues. ""It is a humanitarian issue and the girls should be let go,"" Clinton said.","Clinton says she was looking forward to going back to Senate after the election .

"(CNN)  -- The Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday it's considering tighter restrictions on propofol, a drug reportedly found after Michael Jackson's death in the Holmby Hills, California, mansion he rented. The Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday it's considering tighter restrictions on propofol. ""We were petitioned and have been been looking into it for the past two years,"" said DEA spokesman Rusty Payne, who added in response to a question that the inquiry had not been affected by the singer's death of cardiac arrest on June 25. The agency is looking at designating the sedative as a ""scheduled"" drug, which would tighten restrictions on the its distribution and use. Payne said he could not divulge anything related to the Jackson investigation, ""but I can tell you that researchers making the decision about propofol would typically be interested in any information that would help them answer questions about the effects of propofol and its potential harm to the user."" Propofol, known by the trade name of Diprivan, is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a powerful anesthetic and sedative. Payne said concern about the drug's potential for abuse led to the petition. But, he added, ""as far as we know, this is not something that's been highly abused."" Payne said he did not know who had sought the change, adding, ""Typically we would not make that public."" The process required to get a drug scheduled is a lengthy one, involving a number of agencies, he said. ""Lots of experts weigh in on questions such as potential for abuse, pharmacological effects, history and current patterns abuse,"" he said. Nutritionist Cherilyn Lee has said Jackson pleaded for the drug as a sleep aid, despite being told of its potentially harmful effects. And sources close to Jackson told CNN that the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and ""bring him back up"" during a world tour in the mid-1990s. The Associated Press and The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, have reported that police found Diprivan among Jackson's medicines. Officials have said that the exact cause of death and whether drug use may have been involved will not be determined until after toxicology tests are completed, which could be several weeks. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory, saying two lots of a generic version of the drug had tested positive for endotoxin, a contaminant. The drug maker, Teva Pharmaceuticals, voluntarily recalled the lots. No fatalities were reported. A Teva spokeswoman said the DEA had contacted the drug maker ""about a specific lot number, and that lot number is not from the two we are recalling."" Spokeswoman Denise Bradley would not say whether the contact was related to the Jackson investigation. A DEA spokesman said he could not comment on any ongoing investigation. In a written statement issued this month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists said it ""unequivocally maintains that Diprivan, or its generic name propofol, is a drug meant only for use in a medical setting by professionals trained in the provision of general anesthesia. ""Though the drug is often used for procedures requiring sedation, patients can have extremely variable responses to the drug and some patients can become completely anesthetized, including losing the ability to breathe,"" the statement continued. ""Diprivan should never be used outside of a controlled and monitored medical setting. Use of the drug should be directly supervised by a physician trained in anesthesia and qualified to provide physiologic rescue should too much drug be given,"" the statement said.","Propofol, generic name of Diprivan, reportedly found in Michael Jackson's home .

"(CNN) -- Luci Baines Johnson was just 16 years old when she approached her father, President Johnson, with what she considered a reasonable request. Luci Baines Johnson, left, and her older sister, Lynda Bird, pose inside the White House in 1963. ""I asked my father if we could have the Beatles come to play at the White House,"" she recalled. ""I was very excited about it."" His response? A decisive no, ""without even any moment of trying to soften the blow,"" Johnson said in a recent phone interview. The president thought the move would be viewed as self-serving. His daughter, however, saw it as a chance to honor ""a great talent"" and strengthen ties between the United States and Great Britain -- not to mention a golden opportunity for her and her friends. ""I could see how different sets of folks could have either perspective. And I suspect my father could see that too,"" she said. Luci Baines Johnson learned quickly of the scrutiny that came from being a first daughter. Her family moved into the White House in 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Johnson was catapulted into the exclusive fraternity of White House families and embraced what she describes as a role she landed simply by chance. That fraternity has most recently expanded to include President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia. ""I was an eyewitness to history, over and over, during my father's five years in the White House. And I wasn't elected to that option. I had no qualifications that provided me that privilege except an accident of birth,"" she said.  See famous first kids who grew up in the White House » . Johnson speaks fondly of the opportunity she was afforded to dine with kings and queens, meet the movers and shakers of her time, engage with the body of America and hold a front-row seat to history. While most of her memories fall into two categories -- ""the fond personal memories"" and ""the fond memories of public privilege"" -- there's one in particular that was a combination of both. ""My 17th birthday, I received a handwritten note from my father, the only handwritten note I have, telling me how much he loves me and how much he has delighted in having me as his daughter for all those 17 years,"" she said. The note was dated noon, July 2, 1964. Six hours later, in the East Room of the White House, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination based on race or gender in public places, schools and places of employment. ""Can you imagine ever receiving a more momentous, glorious, exciting, thrilling birthday present that lasted forever and ever than something like that, that would change the world for all time and make it a much more decent place? That took place on my birthday,"" she said. Life in the White House, however, came at a cost. Johnson and the first children before and after her will always have to ""pay a big price in terms of personal time,"" she said. More than 45 years after she moved into the White House, she still receives requests for interviews about the time she spent there. But the public's interest in first daughters is nothing new. Fanny Hayes, for example, who was about the same age as Malia when she moved into the White House in 1877, was followed by the media until the day she died. ""She was an American celebrity,"" said presidential historian Doug Wead. While the interest in first daughters has stayed steady, the pressure on the children has intensified, said Wead, author of ""All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families."" ""It's like the Miss America contest -- it's a real dilemma for the daughter of a president. She's supposed to be gracious. She's mocked and ridiculed if she isn't pretty,"" he said. When Chelsea Clinton was just 13 years old, for example, she was ridiculed in a 1993 ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch that declared her ""not a babe."" Actor Mike Myers later apologized, and the skit was cut from replays of the show. Amy Carter, who was 9 when she moved into the White House, was also mocked for her appearance and for her poor manners, after she pulled out a book during a state dinner. Her parents enrolled her in public school, illuminating the already bright spotlight on her. An infamous photograph of her first day at school shows the young girl with her head hanging low, carrying a Snoopy book bag and surrounded by a swarm of paparazzi. To this date, no other presidential children have attended public school. But other presidential children have taken on power roles in their fathers' administrations. Anna Roosevelt, for example, was a ""super aide"" to Franklin D. Roosevelt during his last year in office, Wead said, describing her as a combination of a personal secretary and chief of staff, not to mention popular in the public eye. And Alice Roosevelt, a fashion icon who was known to have quite the rebellious streak, also played a pivotal role for her father, Theodore Roosevelt. She went on an around-the-world junket for the purposes of American foreign policy -- a move that diverted attention from her father's efforts to bring about a peace treaty in the Russo-Japanese War, Wead said. The president later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on various peace treaties. Under the administration that followed, William Taft's daughter became one of the unsung heroes of women's rights, Wead said. Taft credited his daughter, Helen, for helping to change his mind about women's suffrage. But for all presidential children, Wead said, there remains a lifelong battle of seeking approval from their fathers while struggling to carve their own identities. Many presidential daughters have gone on to author books about their time in White House, in what Wead describes as an attempt to restore their fathers' reputations. ""It's like sitting in front of a big window ... and seeing a billboard with misspelled words on it. It's just irritating,"" he said. ""And the writing of a book, if it doesn't change history, it is a purifying experience for the child."" Susan Ford Bales once told the San Francisco Chronicle that while in the White House, ""I kept thinking, I want to be normal. But I can't be normal. .... Everyone was watching. It was like living out loud."" But Ford also cashed in on some of the perks of her high-profile position and took Alice Roosevelt's advice to ""have one hell of a good time."" Ford roller-skated through the White House, held her prom in the East Room and scored VIP treatment at concerts -- including a backstage pass to see Rod Stewart. (That move ignited the public's interest in her, sparking rumors that she and Stewart were engaged.) Johnson said that some of the best advice she received while in the White House was to just recognize that she couldn't change things or make the attention go away. ""There are inevitably going to be moments when you feel like the pressures of the goldfish bowl seem unfair or more than you can bear, but so are the opportunities to learn, to understand, to grow, to love, to make friends, to witness,"" she said. ""I describe it as the best of times and sometimes the worst of times, but whatever the times, it was a time of extraordinary privilege.""","Luci Johnson describes being a first daughter as an ""extraordinary privilege""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Thirty-eight years ago, Joseph McGinty Nichol was a boy in Kalamazoo, Michigan, playing with toy robots. Many of the robots in ""Terminator Salvation"" are real machines, which increased realism, the cast says. Today ""McG,"" as he is better known, builds and blows up real robots. The prominent filmmaker is the driving force behind one of the season's summer blockbusters, ""Terminator Salvation,"" which is filled with very expensive and very explosive robots. The choice to use real robots when possible, instead of CGI (computer generated images), was deliberate, McG said. According to the director and the film's stars, the decision to use real machines was a testament to the growing sophistication of the moviegoing public, whom they believe can ""feel"" the difference between actors standing in front of a green screen versus actors interacting with the real thing. It was also done in honor of the legendary special effects supervisor, four-time Oscar winner Stan Winston (""Jurassic Park,"" the other ""Terminator"" films), who passed away during filming last year.  Watch the robots in action » . The director and three of his cast members -- Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard and Anton Yelchin -- took a time out with CNN to explain why gravity and singed eyebrows both played a role in ""Terminator Salvation."" Bryce Dallas Howard: That was something that was really important to McG ...  when an audience member sees this film, that they can actually feel what's occurring. I think that audiences are very savvy now. We can feel when something is CGI and that's no disrespect to CGI -- we couldn't do this movie without it -- but, whenever possible, in the tradition of Sam Winston, he wanted to build the robots. So a lot of what you see is real. McG: And if you drop something, we've spent our whole lives watching physics in play, and if you say, just have the CGI do that, people can tell something's off, and it releases you from being involved in the picture. So, we built all the robots, we built all the sets, we blew them up for real, a great many of us lost our eyebrows! Christian Bale: It was kind of comical at times because something that's meant to be so intimidating was actually surrounded by five guys with these kind of puppet rods I had to blank out or I would start laughing. But, the end result is something really formidable and you know, really iconic in movie history. Anton Yelchin: Now I'm obsessed with the robots! I'm so [annoyed] that this guy or whoever it is that's in charge of it wouldn't let me have one!","""Terminator Salvation"" filmmakers decide to use many real robots .

"(CNN) -- The pastor of a non-denominational church in Argyle, Texas, passed around the collection plate to his congregants earlier this year -- and asked them to take money from it. Donations at the Cross Timbers Community Church had slumped because of the economic downturn. Pastor Toby Slough thought that his congregants had to be hurting, too. His gesture, instead, was met with an unexpected response: The church had its highest offering ever. It was a eureka moment for Slough: Give away money to those who need it, knowing his church members will help fill the need. ""In these economic times, we can't be so into church business that we forget what our business is, and that is to help people,"" Slough told CNN television affiliate KDAF in Dallas-Forth Worth, Texas. In the past two months, the 9-year-old church has done just that: handed out a half-million dollars to members and non-members who are struggling.  Watch pastor on rip off concerns » . ""We've taken $200,000 and spread it out to organizations -- four local, two missions that are feeding and clothing people in these tough times,"" Slough said. ""We've paid utility bills for members of our church that are unemployed or under-employed."" His favorite giveaway came three weeks ago. The church gave 1,400 families $50 each and told them to hand it out to someone else. One of the recipients was Katie Lewis. ""I've been alone so long. Just to be thought of and to be remembered, to be welcomed -- it's amazing,"" she said, crying. Church members are pleasantly surprised. ""You don't hear about a church giving money away,"" Amy Sullivan said. Slough said he is not concerned if people try to take advantage of the church's generosity. ""I told my church a couple weeks ago, if I'm not being taken advantage of, I'm not being like Jesus,"" he said. The church has now formed a group to look into the best ways to give out money. And, Slough said, it plans on doing so as long as there is a need in the community.","Economy led to diminished donations at the Cross Timbers Community Church .

"BELGRADE, Montana (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday took his push for a health care overhaul to traditionally conservative Montana, saying a bill to extend coverage to the uninsured while helping those already with coverage will pass this year. President Obama discusses his health care plans Friday at a meeting in Belgrade, Montana. However, an influential Democratic representative said the House would only pass a health care bill in January or later, signaling continuing rifts within Obama's party on his domestic priority for 2009. ""We're taking some time to make sure it's done right,"" said Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania. ""I don't know that we'll get something done before January, and even then we may not get it done. We're going to do it right when it's finally done."" Obama told a largely supportive Montana audience at his second of three town hall meetings this week that fixing the health care system requires improving health insurance practices and reducing the costs of treatment. He sought questions from skeptics of his proposed health care overhaul, seeking to confront some misconceptions fueled by opponents Democrats say are undermining the debate. One man who identified himself as a proud National Rifle Association supporter and believer in the Constitution asked how the government would pay to expand health insurance coverage to 46 million uninsured people. ""You can't tell us how you're going to pay for this,"" said the questioner, Randy Rathie, a welder from Ekalaka, Montana. ""The only way you're going to get the money is to raise our taxes. That's the only way you can do that."" Obama responded with his oft-repeated explanation that two-thirds of the cost of overhauling health care -- estimated at about $900 billion over 10 years -- would come from eliminating waste and improving efficiency in the current system, which includes the government-run Medicare and Medicaid programs for the elderly and impoverished. The rest would have to come from new revenue, he agreed with the questioner, and he called for reducing the amount of deductions that people making more than $250,000 a year can make on their income taxes. ""If we did that alone, just that change alone ... that would raise enough to pay for health care reform,"" Obama said, noting that would meet his election campaign pledge to avoid any tax increase on people earning less than $250,000 a year. However, Obama said some taxes would have to be raised, and the crowd applauded when he said he believes people with more money, like himself, ought to pay a heavier burden. ""We've got to get over this notion that we can have something for nothing,"" Obama said. ""That's how we got into this deficit and this debt in the first place."" In reference to emotional and heated debate at some other town hall meetings across the country in recent weeks, Obama told Rathie, ""I appreciate your question, the respectful way you asked it, and by the way, I also believe in the Constitution."" Afterward, Rathie said he was impressed by Obama's performance but remained skeptical. ""I don't think he knows where that money's going to come from,"" he said. ""If he does, he's not saying."" Obama noted there is more work to be done, with Congress seeking to merge at least four bills, along with a possible compromise agreement being negotiated by Democratic Sen. Max Baucus and five other members of his Senate Finance Committee, into a single bill in September. Another questioner chosen when Obama asked for a skeptic identified himself as an insurance provider who wanted to know why Obama and Democrats are vilifying the insurance industry in the health care debate. Earlier in the meeting, Obama described what he called discriminatory practices by insurance companies that dropped coverage of people who became sick or refused to cover those with pre-existing medical conditions. Obama noted some insurance companies are contributing to the reform debate, but said others are spending millions of dollars to try to defeat any health care legislation. For a health care overhaul to work for everyone, he said, it has to ensure all Americans are covered so that insurance companies have incentive to participate. They won't be able to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions or ""cherry pick"" healthy people while refusing coverage for sick people, Obama said, so increasing the total numbers covered will be the enticement. On Saturday, Obama will hold another town hall meeting in Grand Junction, Colorado, before vacationing in some national parks with his family next week. In addition, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama will hold ""some events not yet announced"" in coming days. While Obama has said consensus can be reached on health care reform, contentious town hall meetings held by lawmakers around the country have created a different impression. The White House, and many Democrats in Congress, hope that by building support in the West, the president can start to turn the tide. Though the region is largely Republican, Obama made some inroads in the latest election. He won in Colorado and lost by just a slim margin in Montana. However, Murtha's comments in Bentleyville, Pennsylvania, to CNN affiliate WJPA signaled continuing divisions among House Democrats over the scope and pace of health care legislation. ""We said to the speaker [House Speaker Nancy Pelosi], the leadership, let's not rush this thing,"" Murtha said. ""Let's do it right, so we'll have a uniquely American plan, if the thing passes."" Obama's town hall events are just part of a larger Democratic strategy for winning support in the region. The Democratic National Committee began a TV ad this week promoting the president's health care plan. A committee spokesman said the ad will run on national cable as well as on local cable in New Hampshire, Montana, Colorado and the District of Columbia. The group Families USA, which supports the president's plan, also launched a campaign Thursday that includes an ad running in a dozen states -- among them Montana and Colorado. But groups opposed to the president's plan have their own campaigns. One voter in Livingston, Montana, not far from where the president spoke in Belgrade, summarized the kinds of concerns that she and many others in the region have. ""I believe that there is a health care crisis, I really do,"" Sonja McDonald, who voted for Obama in 2008, told CNN's Ed Henry on Thursday. ""Do I believe that the government needs to be more involved? No!"" Henry met McDonald at a clinic that gets half its funding from taxpayers. ""The government being involved is fine,"" McDonald said. ""It's just ... when they try and overstep, when they try to say, 'No, this is what needs to be done.' ""","NEW: Rep. John Murtha says bill won't pass before January .

Katy Milane, right, said none of the bridesmaids in her friend's 2007 wedding liked this hot pink dress. It wasn't. Milane and five other bridesmaids wore hot-pink floor-length satin dresses. One wedding guest commented that they looked ""like a row of Pepto Bismol bottles."" ""I don't think any of us were happy with the dresses,"" said Milane. One bridesmaid had to be sewn into her gown when it ripped the day of the wedding. Another left her dress in a Cincinnati, Ohio, hotel room after the festivities had ended. ""We all tried to be very positive about it because the bride really loved them,"" said Milane. ""We would have worn anything to make her happy."" Such is the case at countless weddings.

Kimberlee Norbury of Orland, California, was aghast at the bridesmaid dress her cousin chose for her saloon-themed wedding in July 2006. Norbury and three other bridesmaids were asked to wear ""saloon girl"" dresses purchased at a nearby costume shop. The dresses, complete with lace garters and corset tops, were so short that some of the bridesmaids added fabric to make them longer. Even with the additional fabric, Norbury walked down the aisle with her bouquet strategically placed in front of her. ""Everyone knew what I was doing,"" she said. ""I can laugh now, but I was so horrified."" As soon as the wedding ended, Norbury changed out of the dress. ""I was running for my clothes as fast as I could."" ""Afterwards I did explain that I loved her very much,"" she said. ""That's the only reason I wore that."" Freedom of choice . Chandi Brooks knows how expensive bridesmaid dresses can be. She's been in five weddings -- as a bridesmaid three times and the maid of honor twice -- and has never worn any of the dresses again. According to Conde Nast Bridal Media's American Wedding Study, the average price of a bridesmaid dress in 2005 was $138.20. ""It's money down the drain most of the time,"" Brooks said. That's why she decided to let her bridal party choose their own dresses for her June 2007 wedding. Brooks' attendants picked black dresses that ranged from $20 to $100. The bridesmaids, all different sizes and ages, were pleased and so was the bride. ""I didn't have to shop around and didn't have to hear any griping. Everyone was happy,"" said Brooks. Other brides also are giving their attendants the freedom of choice. Celia Stangerone of Windsor, Connecticut, asked her bridesmaids to pick tea-length lavender dresses. The length and color were the only restrictions she placed -- the shade of lavender, style of dress and type of shoe were up to each individual bridesmaid. Stangarone said she's close to her bridesmaids, which factored into her decision to let them choose their own dresses. ""I knew the type of personalities I was dealing with and I also knew that they were all different sizes and shapes,"" she said. ""I had to let them pick whatever style they felt beautiful in."" The final result was perfect, Stangarone said. Her bridesmaids chose dresses in varying shades of lavender that complimented each attendant's body type and skin tone.

"(CNN) -- The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries has tagged two great white sharks off Cape Cod in an area where shark sightings have been reported, state officials said Sunday. A great white shark is tagged Saturday off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Shark sightings closed nearby beaches. The first tagging Saturday marked the first time a great white shark had been successfully tagged in the Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. coast, the division said in a statement. A second shark was tagged Saturday afternoon, officials said. The taggings took place in the waters near Chatham, Massachusetts, two days after Greg Skomal, shark expert for the Division of Marine Fisheries, reported as many as five large sharks were seen near Monomoy Island, a National Wildlife Refuge off the southern elbow of Cape Cod. The island is about a mile away from Chatham's Lighthouse Beach, a public swimming area. Chatham's beaches were closed to swimmers after the sightings, Skomal said. CNN affiliate WCVB reported that all of Chatham's east-facing beaches were closed after three sharks came within 75 yards of the coastline.  Watch who is making money from sharks » . The beaches will be off-limits to swimmers until the middle of the week, officials told WCVB. After the sightings, Skomal and other biologists set out to identify the species, the division statement said. Skomal identified a great white shark on Friday, and then the two were tagged Saturday. ""The tags, which use satellite-based technology to record where a shark travels, allow scientists to better understand migratory patterns,"" the division statement said. Great white sharks are relatively rare in New England, the division statement said, but have been seen feeding near seal colonies. Massachusetts has recorded only four shark attacks since 1670, two of which were fatal. The last fatal shark attack in Massachusetts happened in 1936. Researchers have also tagged great white sharks off the coast of South Africa.","Taggings of great whites are the first in the Atlantic Ocean, state officials say .

She and both her siblings, a sister and brother, suffer from varying degrees of polio. None of them can walk. Asked how he and his family cope, Khaled chokes up, fighting back tears. ""I am sick of life -- what can I say to you?"" he says after a long pause. One man, Brad Blauser, has vowed to try to make life a little easier for these families by organizing the distribution of wheelchairs, donated and paid for by his charity, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids. He first came to Iraq in 2004 as a civilian contractor. Struck by the abject chaos surrounding him and seeing helpless children scooting along the ground, he pledged to find a way to help.  Watch dads, moms carry kids; tears flow when wheelchairs arrive » . His first step was to consult an Army medic to find out what hospitals really needed. ""He surprised me with his answer about pediatric wheelchairs. We've got so many children out in the city that the ones who can get around are following their friends by dragging themselves around on the ground, which is heartbreaking to see,"" he says. ""I was surprised. It took me aback."" Enlisting the help of generous supporters and an Iraqi humanitarian group Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born in August of 2005. Thirty days later its first 31 chairs were delivered. To date more than 250 Iraqi families have received the wheelchairs. Blauser has partnered with a nonprofit group called Reach Out and Care Wheels, which sells him the chairs at a manufacturing price of about $300. The chairs are made by prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary and ultimately delivered in Iraq by the U.S. military. ""Getting these prisoners involved, it just means the world to them,"" said Andrew Babcock, the executive director of Reach Out and Care Wheels. ""Even the prisoners, I've been there and visited, and they're so excited. They come up with different design ideas and ways to make things better for the kids. They want to know where the chairs are going and what kids we're helping."" Blauser said it's unbelievable to be there when the chairs are delivered. ""The most affecting thing about this whole wheelchairs for children is when the parents realize the gift that is being given to their children and they reach out to hug you."" he said. ""The tears are running from their eyes and they say, 'We never thought that you could do this.' "" Blauser is helped on the Iraqi missions by the civil affairs division of the U.S. military, which helps organize the safe transport of the families to the distribution point and adjustment of the wheelchairs to fit each child. He said it gives ""the troops something when they go home, something good to remember where they know they have contributed, they know they have done a good thing."" Army Sgt. 1st Class Jason Jurack agrees. ""It brings a smile to your face. It really gives a different image to the Army as a whole -- helping people out, putting a smile on local nationals' faces, little kids that need our help."" It's a sentiment that is echoed by Samira Al-Ali, the head of the Iraqi group that finds the children in need. On this day, she tells the soldiers she hopes that this humanitarian act will give them a different image of Iraq, not one of a gun and war, she says. Her words are simple but effective. ""I wish the world would see with their own eyes the children of Iraq and help the children of Iraq, because the children of Iraq have been deprived of everything,"" she said. ""Even a normal child has been deprived of their childhood; a disabled child and their family is dealing with so much more."" The children also show gratitude, even those who can scarcely move. Blauser remembers one boy's father who dressed him in a three-piece suit, with the trousers hanging off his motionless legs. ""He couldn't move his legs or his arms. But when we sat him in his chair, he gave us the thumbs up."" Iraqi parents will go to any lengths to improve the quality of their children's lives. Blauser points to one of his favorite photographs, of a father carrying his son in his arms, an endless desert road behind him. He had carried his son more than 6 miles to get a wheelchair. ""In August 2006 we had a distribution in northern Iraq,"" Blauser remembered. ""We watched him [the father] come forward, and people rushed to take the boy from his arms. And he said, 'No, I've been carrying this child all my life. I can carry him the last 100 yards to receive his wheelchair.' "" E-mail to a friend .

"(LifeWire) -- The TV no longer sits on a moving box, but she's still using filing cabinets as end tables. Desiree Jacobsen graduated from college years ago, so why does her apartment resemble a dorm room? It's hard to save for the finer things when you've had to shell out money to be in five weddings in one year, three times as maid of honor. Some maids of honor have gone deep into debt rather than disappoint a friend who expects a lot. ""I shop at the Salvation Army quite a bit to save money,"" says Jacobsen, 26, a medical editor in Dallas. Being a bride's maid or matron of honor is a distinction many women cherish. But it doesn't come cheap. It can easily cost a woman $1,000 or more for the honor of standing beside the bride on her big day, according to TheKnot.com, the leading wedding Web site. On top of the traditional expenses of wedding attire, transportation and chipping in for a gift from the bridesmaids, maids of honor can wind up hosting bridal showers, bachelorette parties and even the co-ed Jack and Jill party -- often footing the bill entirely. Expectations are reaching bridezilla proportions, a trend Anna Post, spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute and great-great-granddaughter of the etiquette authority, attributes in part to the extensive coverage of celebrity weddings on television and in style magazines.  Watch etiquette tips on attending wedding events » . Many bridesmaids are left torn between maintaining a friendship and breaking the bank. Tough to say no . When Sarah de Maintenon, a 33-year-old real estate agent in Syracuse, New York, agreed to be her best friend's maid of honor two years ago, the economy was good and houses were selling like hot cakes. But the currently slow real-estate market means that money has become tight as the big day -- scheduled for October -- slowly approaches. ""I seriously just didn't know. I thought it was just a bachelorette party,"" says de Maintenon of the events she was expected to throw and attend. Her distress over the destination wedding sent her seeking advice online. The advice she received was simple, but effective: Talk to her friend and be honest about her situation. ""I contemplated telling her I couldn't do it, but I couldn't break her heart,"" she says. ""I was afraid it would cause an argument ... I didn't want to ruin her wedding day."" Jacobsen hasn't skipped a wedding, but she did once skip the pre-wedding bridal portrait, which she would have had to travel out of town to participate in, because she was short on money and vacation time. ""She was upset with me for a little while, but it quickly blew over because I started planning for her bachelorette party."" When feelings get hurt, Jacobsen says, she tries not to take it personally. ""It's usually because of the stress of the wedding."" Etiquette rules vs. reality . Is all this necessary? Are brides asking too much of their friends? Post says that contrary to popular belief, the bridal shower isn't the maid of honor's obligation. Traditionally, a close friend would throw a bridal shower for the bride, and sometimes that person is also the maid of honor. But expenses can be agreed upon in advance and shared by the entire wedding party. And though there may be multiple parties thrown for the happy couple, Post says, the maid of honor is not required to go. ""That's not true,"" claims Kim Bohnert, a 32-year-old teacher in San Francisco. She's served nine stints as maid of honor and considers herself an expert bridesmaid. She insists that the entire bridal party -- especially the maid of honor -- is expected to attend all parties and shell out for a gift each time. ""It definitely adds up,"" says Melissa Bauer, spokesperson for TheKnot.com. Bauer ticks off some of the major expenses: about $300 for a dress, $50 to $200 for shoes, $40 to $60 for accessories, $50 for a shower gift and another $100 for a wedding gift. Then there are the parties. ""The big thing now is destination bachelorette parties,"" Bauer says. ""Some people might do it local, but regardless, you're [often] footing the cost for the bride [to attend]."" The cost of traveling to an out-of-town party can add several hundred dollars to the tab, Bauer notes -- to say nothing of the cost of traveling to the wedding itself. Going for broke . Whether popular wisdom requires such a commitment or not, there's a very real limit to what women can afford. Bohnert agreed to be her cousin's maid of honor, even though she was maxed out on her credit cards, and the many expenses included a $500 Sae Young Vu dress. ""I'm still in debt because of it,"" she says. Ma'ayan Geller, a part-time student and assistant physical therapist in San Francisco, was glad to hear her friend wanted to be sensitive to the financial constraints of her wedding party. But when Geller, one of the bridesmaids, suggested a cheap Las Vegas package for the bachelorette party, the bride gave her the boot, saying she wasn't being serious enough about her commitment to the wedding. ""I had already bought the dress -- close to $300 -- which was a lot for me at the time,"" Geller, 23, remembers. ""I think it could have been done in a better way."" Geller still attended the wedding, partially because all her friends were there and also because she wanted to support the bride, ""although the friendship kind of ended after that."" Making it work . In Post's experience, a wedding is a collaboration, and the wedding party often tries to find a solution that works for everyone. ""When something difficult arises, I've seen brides put on the brakes rather than force something on someone,"" she says. Jeri Kadison, a bridal coach in New York, says communication is key: Detail expectations early, and if something sounds too expensive, compromise and brainstorm other ideas, she advises. ""It's the bride's responsibility to be compassionate and considerate,"" she says. That strategy worked for de Maintenon. She and her bride talk almost every day. Instead of renting a restaurant, they're having a barbeque. Instead of renting a beach house, they're all staying with a girlfriend. It's also OK to say no, Post says. ""You can decline. Just do it early."" De Maintenon recently declined when one of her best friends asked her to be the maid of honor, and her friend wasn't upset. ""She knows that I'll do anything else to help out in any way."" LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A Boston police officer is suing the city after he was suspended for referring to a black Harvard professor as a ""banana-eating jungle monkey"" in an e-mail. Boston police Officer Justin Barrett apologized for his e-mail about Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. ""If I'm charged with a crime I want a chance to answer. I want the chance for a fair hearing,"" Officer Justin Barrett told CNN on Tuesday. Barrett has apologized and denied he is a racist. His lawsuit claims his civil rights have been violated; Barrett's lawyer said the words referring to Henry Louis Gates, Jr. were misinterpreted. ""The choice of words were poor; but they weren't meant to characterize professor Gates as a banana-eating jungle monkey,"" attorney Peter Marano said. ""They were meant in a response to behavior and characterizing the behavior. Not the person as a whole."" Marano said the city had effectively fired Barrett, though he is officially suspended with pay. He said it was fair to hold Barrett to a higher standard than the general public because he is a police officer, but that he was still entitled to express his opinions. ""Being held to a higher standard shouldn't eradicate his right under the First Amendment for free speech. That is part and parcel of the lawsuit,"" the lawyer said. Gates was arrested at his house last month when a neighbor called police after she thought she saw a man trying to break into Gates' home. The man turned out to be Gates himself, who was attempting to free a jammed door. The incident sparked a national debate about race and policing, drawing in President Obama himself. Obama, who is a friend of Gates, said the officer who arrested the professor ""acted stupidly,"" but then withdrew the comment, saying he did not know all the facts when he spoke. He hosted Gates and Sgt. James Crowley for a beer at the White House to calm the tensions. Barrett later sent a mass e-mail about the encounter to other officers and to the Boston Globe newspaper. Barrett was suspended from his military duties as captain in the Army National Guard and placed on administrative leave from the Boston Police Department pending the outcome of a termination hearing. Barrett said he was moved to write the note because he believed a Boston Globe column about Gates' arrest ""seemed like it was biased."" ""It did not show the roles and duties of a police officer and how dangerous it already is without having a debate about people getting in a police officer's face, which should never happen at all."" Asked what led him to choose to use such language, he said, ""I don't know. I couldn't tell you. I have no idea."" He added, in response to a question, that he had never used such language before. Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis denounced the e-mail. Barrett used the ""jungle monkey"" phrase four times, three times referring to Gates and once to the Boston Globe column. He also declared that he was ""not a racist but I am prejudice [sic] toward people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they say is freedom but it is merely attention because you do not get enough of it in your little fear-dwelling circle of on-the-bandwagon followers."" According to a statement from Boston police, Davis took action immediately on learning of Barrett's remarks, stripping the officer of his gun and his badge. Barrett's arrests and investigations will be reviewed for indications of racial bias, Davis said. The department will also look closely at the officers who received or viewed the e-mail.","Officer suspended for referring to black prof as a ""banana-eating jungle monkey""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Supreme Court heard new arguments Wednesday in a dramatic case that started with a movie attacking Hillary Clinton -- but that could have far-reaching implications for U.S. elections. The campaign finance case before the court stems from a film critical of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. ""If you thought you knew everything about Hillary Clinton, wait till you see the movie,"" said an ad last year for ""Hillary: The Movie,"" a scorching attack on the woman then running for president. Citizens United, the conservative group behind the film, promoted it as featuring 40 interviews -- a ""cast to end all casts""-- and promised that if ""you want to hear about the Clinton scandals of the past and present, you have it here! 'Hillary: The Movie' is the first and last word in what the Clintons want America to forget!"" Few Americans ever saw the ad; a federal court ruled that it broke the law on campaign advertising. Citizens United argued that the movie was a documentary, not ""electioneering communication."" As a result, the group argued, it was not subject to campaign finance rules that require disclosure of the movie's financial backers or restrictions on when the film could air. It was financed with a mix of corporate and individual donations. Judges disagreed. Citizens United, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy group, took its case to the Supreme Court. Unusually, the top court did not reach a decision on the case after it was first heard and ordered Wednesday's rare September rehearing to consider more aspects of the case. A ruling is expected in a couple of months. The case hinges on whether corporations can be barred from pouring money into election campaigns or whether they have free-speech rights -- and the right to spend their cash to influence elections, just like individual people do. ""It's about money,"" said Lawrence Noble, former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission and a national expert on campaign spending. ""It's about free speech, and it's about the ability of corporations to influence elections through the direct use of their ... money."" Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 said the courts were right in the first place. ""Allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy,"" he said. ""The little guy would have no role here, because the dominant force in politics -- the dominant force in Washington decision-making -- would become corporations."" But David Bossee of Citizens United doesn't buy that. He argued that groups of people who pool resources, ranging from labor unions to the health industry to advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association, still have the right to free speech. ""I don't believe the federal government should have the right to impede people's entry into the [political] process,"" he said. ""And that's what I believe the Federal Election Commission is doing here: squelch our First Amendment rights."" U.S. courts have consistently ruled that spending money on elections is a form of speech. The case has made for unusual alliances: the American Civil Liberties Union, for example, sides with Citizens United. ""For many free-speech advocates, this is maybe a case of strange bedfellows, but they agree with Citizens United,"" said George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. ""They say, 'If you start to say these types of movies are prohibited speech, it could sweep into things like books.' Indeed, [the first time this case was argued,] the U.S. government said, 'Yes, we could restrict books during these election periods,' "" Turley said. ""That sent a chill through the free-speech community. On the other side, people are saying, 'Yeah, campaign finance [reform] is strangling the democratic process,' "" he said. ""You have two worthy values and very strong values on both sides,"" he said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""There's a great deal at stake,"" he said. ""If they strike down part of the campaign finance laws, it occurs right before the mid-term [elections], and you would see major amounts of money dumped into the campaign."" The court's rare special session marks the debut of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's first Supreme Court nominee. The original narrow focus of the case was on Section 203 of the comprehensive 2002 McCain-Feingold law, which bans the broadcast of ""electioneering communication"" by corporations, unions and advocacy groups if such a broadcast would be aired close to election dates and would identify candidates by name or image. The law also requires an on-screen notice of the groups financing such ads as well as public disclosure of all donors to the sponsoring organizations. But the scope of the case has now expanded significantly, and justices will ask whether they should re-examine important precedents banning direct corporate spending in campaigns. The Clinton movie case could launch a range of as-yet unanswered questions about political speech and government regulation. Since the filmmakers argued that their work was information, not political advocacy, should the government place itself as the ultimate arbiter of what is ""news""? Some media groups say no. "" 'Hillary: The Movie' does not differ, in any relevant respect, from the critiques of presidential candidates produced throughout the entirety of American history,"" said the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in a brief to the high court. And can distinctions be drawn between regulating quickie 30-second or one-minute ""attack ads"" and a 90-minute documentary that could be viewed as an ideological ""infomercial""? ""McCain-Feingold clearly has an impact on every candidate and everyone that raises or spends campaign dollars,"" said Edward Lazarus, author of ""Closed Chambers,"" an inside look at the Supreme Court. ""And the court has mediated that line between trying to allow Congress to protect against electoral corruption but at the same time protect the right of expression of corporations and individuals."" Movie excerpts and the ads can be seen at www.hillarythemovie.com. The case is Citizens United v. FEC (08-205).

"(CNN) -- A Chinese official accused ""Tibetan independence forces"" Tuesday of planning suicide attacks, an allegation that the Tibetan government-in-exile immediately denied. ""To our knowledge the next plan of the Tibet Independence forces is to organize suicide squads to launch violent attacks,"" Wu Heping, spokesman for China's Ministry of Public Security, said at a news conference, according to a translation of his remarks by The Associated Press. ""They claim they fear neither bloodshed nor sacrifice,"" he said. He did not provide details or evidence, and Samdhong Rinpoche, prime minister of Tibet's exiled government, dismissed the accusation. ""We never heard (of) Tibetan independence force, such a group or people. Now, our suspicion is that the PRC (People's Republic of China) might be staging such a violent act in the name of Tibetan people to mislead the world community,"" he said in Dharamsala, India. Dharamsala is the center of the Tibetan community in India, where many Tibetans fled after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 and where the government-in-exile led by the Dalai Lama is based. ""It is our ... suspicion, otherwise there is no ground to claim that some Tibetan people or group is planning to (use) suicide bombers or something like that,"" the Tibetan prime minister said. There was no immediate response from the Chinese government to Rinpoche's suspicion. In the U.S. State Department briefing on Tuesday, department spokesman Tom Casey said the United States did not share China's concern that supporters of the Dalai Lama were plotting suicide attacks. The Dalai Lama is a ""man of peace, there is absolutely no indication that he wants to do anything other than have a dialogue with China to discuss how to deal with some of the serious issues there,"" Casey said. Beijing blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted amid protests for Tibetan independence last month. China has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the demonstrations, which began peacefully on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising. The protests have threatened to throw a shadow on the Summer Olympic Games, being staged in Beijing in August. Tibet's government-in-exile puts the death toll from the protests at about 140, but the Chinese government restrictions make it difficult to confirm that number. Chinese authorities have reported a death toll of 19, and say most of those killed were ""innocent victims"" -- Han Chinese targeted by Tibetans. Protests have spread across the globe with regular demonstrations in Nepal. A ceremonial lighting of the Olympic flame in Greece was also targeted by pro-Tibet activists.  Watch protests in Nepal » . Also on Tuesday, China's official Xinhua news agency reported that the country's foreign ministry urged the Dalai Lama to ""stop all separatist and sabotage activities if he really wants to contact and consult with the central government."" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu spoke in response to a March 28 statement from Dalai Lama. In that statement, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists said he does not seek the separation of Tibet and has no desire to ""sabotage"" the Olympic Games. ""Chinese brothers and sisters, I assure you I have no desire to seek Tibet's separation. Nor do I have any wish to drive a wedge between the Tibetan and Chinese peoples,"" he wrote. Instead, he said, the protesters seek ""meaningful self-rule"" while remaining a part of China. ""Despite my repeated support for the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese authorities, with the intention of creating a rift between the Chinese people and myself, the Chinese authorities assert that I am trying to sabotage the games."" He called on China to called ""to exercise wisdom and to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Tibetan people."" China offered some media organizations -- not including CNN -- a carefully managed tour of Tibet's capital, but ran into a public-relations roadblock when a group of Buddhist monks began screaming protests at a holy shrine.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- One small slice Monday of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's war on drug cartels: two shootouts on the streets of two cities; a man and a woman ambushed in their car; at least four people dead; three soldiers wounded, one of them gravely. Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April. The confrontations between unidentified gunmen and Mexican army and federal police took place in the communities of San Nicolas de los Garza and Escobedo, near the U.S. border in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex news agency said. One of the firefights lasted 45 minutes. At one point, the suspects launched hand grenades at the soldiers. House-to-house searches took two hours and it would be another seven hours before the areas were secured. According to Notimex and news reports from the newspapers Excelsior, El Porvenir, El Nuevo Leon and El Norte, here's what happened: . Around 6 a.m., a military convoy came across a group armed men in several late-model vehicles in San Nicolas de los Garza. Shooting broke out, and the gunplay continued for 45 minutes along several neighboring streets as the suspects tried to get away. The armed men abandoned their cars, blocked one of the streets with a Suburban truck and fled aboard several other vehicles. The confrontation continued for another two hours as soldiers sealed off a city block and searched house-to-house. ""From early on, we could hear the shots and much shouting,"" Excelsior and El Nuevo Leon quoted an unidentified woman as saying. ""We could hear footsteps on the roofs and soldiers yelling to them. There were several explosions; it seems like grenades went off, because we could hear it very loudly twice."" Around 7:45 a.m., the soldiers entered a house where the gunmen had holed up. A grenade went off upstairs. Three gunmen died there, though officials did not say if it was from bullet wounds or the grenade explosion. At the same time, Mexican military and federal police were involved in a shootout with armed men in Escobedo. That confrontation left three soldiers wounded, with one of them clinging to life Monday afternoon. Also nearby, a man and a woman riding in car were ambushed at an intersection by armed men in several cars who surrounded them and drilled their auto with bullets. The woman died on the scene, her body sprawled on the street. The man was wounded but survived. The violent scene in Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas, has become a near-daily experience in Mexico since Calderon took office in December 2006 and launched a war on drug cartels. More than 11,000 people have been killed during that time -- about 1,000 of them police and other authorities.","Two shootouts in two cities near U.S. border in Mexican state of Nuevo Leon .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- DNA testing to try to identify hundreds of bodies buried in a mass grave during World War I will start this week, the British and Australian ministries of defense announced Monday. File photo shows a crane unearthing the mass grave in northern France. The bodies come from Fromelles in northern France, where thousands of British and Australian troops were killed or wounded in a single night in 1916 -- a night the Australian military still considers among the worst in its history. An exploratory dig in May of this year confirmed that there are between 250 and 300 bodies buried at the site. Enough DNA has been recovered from teeth and bones to make full-scale testing worthwhile, the British Ministry of Defence said. Pieces of uniforms including belt buckles and buttons have also been found, which will help with identification, the ministry said. ""Each one of these soldiers will be laid to rest with the dignity they deserve and we owe it to them to do all we can to identify them,"" British Veterans Minister Kevan Jones said in a statement. The DNA testing program will be the largest undertaking to identify individuals killed in combat ever commissioned, the ministry said. The announcement comes only a week after the burial of the last British veteran of World War I still living in the United Kingdom. Harry Patch died July 25 at the age of 111, a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113. So many soldiers died on the night of July 19, 1916, that many were never found, identified, or given a proper burial. Two divisions of Allied infantry had attacked a strongly fortified German position known as the Sugar Loaf. The defenders knew the British and the Australians were coming; the terrain favored the Germans. As the British and the newly arrived Australians charged into battle, the Germans opened fire. By morning, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were dead. About 5,000 others were wounded. There has been speculation for decades that the Germans recovered hundreds of bodies and put them into mass graves, not forgotten, but anonymous. Last year, preliminary digs commissioned by the Australian government located five mass graves near the site of the battle. ""It's the largest military find since the end of the Second World War,"" said a spokesman for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. ""I have been on the commission almost 11 years and it's like nothing I have ever experienced. I have never known anything to have this sort of numbers of possible remains,"" Peter Francis told CNN. The commission is in the middle of a 15-month project to disinter the bodies, attempt to identify them, and rebury them in individual graves in a new cemetery on the site. The resulting graveyard will be the first new one consecrated by the commission for almost 50 years, Francis told CNN by phone. The British and Australian governments have asked people who think their relatives may have died at the site to get in touch, Francis said. The cemetery will be dedicated on July 19, 2010 -- the 94th anniversary of the battle. The bodies of more than 165,000 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the Western Front during the First World War are still missing, the commission says. The commission is a non-profit organization founded in 1917 that commemorates the dead of both world wars from the British Commonwealth.","DNA tests will attempt to identify remains of World War I fallen .

"(CNN)  -- The search continued Tuesday for as many as 67 people missing after a boat carrying about 200 Haitians capsized, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted this crowded boat last week and repatriated its occupants to Haiti. The boat overturned Monday off Turks and Caicos, a British territory about 550 miles southeast of Miami, Florida. Searchers aboard boats and aircraft have rescued 118 passengers and found 15 bodies, said Petty Officer Jennifer Johnson, a Coast Guard spokeswoman, on Tuesday morning. The Coast Guard described the boat's occupants as migrants from Haiti. The overcrowded vessel was believed to have set sail from the Haitian port of Cap Haitien, the Turks and Caicos Sun newspaper reported. The search resumed at dawn Tuesday after being suspended because of darkness Monday night, Johnson said. The Coast Guard is contributing one boat, the 210-foot cutter Valiant, and three aircraft to the search, Johnson said. The aircraft are a Falcon jet out of Miami, an HH-60 helicopter and a slow-flying C-130 cargo plane out of Clearwater, Florida.  Watch Coast Guard rescue Haitians after boat capsizes » . ""If the weather and conditions are right, [the C-130] can fly really low,"" Johnson said. ""It makes a fantastic search aircraft."" Turks and Caicos authorities are using small boats in the search, she said. About 70 people were plucked Monday from a reef near the island group, authorities said. Four other bodies were found, though it was unclear which authorities located them. A nurse at Myrtle Rigby Hospital in the Turks and Caicos said that about 70 people were brought there, including four who had died. Five people were admitted to the hospital, and the others had minor injuries, the nurse said. The Coast Guard said it intercepted another ""grossly overloaded"" boat, with 124 Haitians aboard, late last week in the same region. Those migrants were returned to Cap Haitien on Monday. Overloaded vessels can quickly lose stability and capsize, sending migrants into the water, a Coast Guard release said. CNN's Jim Kavanagh and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","NEW: 15 confirmed dead after boat capsizes; as many as 67 missing .

Martin O'Malley's ""Smart, Green and Growing"" legislative package, aimed at reducing the state's greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020. The pilot program will be evaluated at the end of two years, and officials will determine whether to send goats to other grazing projects on state highways, according to David Buck, a spokesman for the highway administration. The goats are reducing the state's carbon footprint and protecting the area's bog turtles, listed as threatened. In addition, he said, the animals are much cheaper than a mowing program: State costs are about $10,000 for two years, most of that for delivery and veterinary services. But the decision to utilize goats was not an easy one. Other herbivorous (plant-eating) animals were considered. Cows were ruled out because they are too heavy, and their hooves could stomp the small, colorful-shelled bog turtles. Sheep? Well, they just aren't goats. ""Goats were just a viable solution,"" Buck said. ""They do not eat moving things. They will not crush [the turtles] out there."" Maryland is not the first to launch such an initiative. Officials in Hempstead, New York, bought natural grass cutters for a 50-acre park and preserve this year, said Mike Deery, town spokesman. The goats -- Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, Happy and Doc -- were named after dwarves in the fairy tale ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" In Vail, Colorado, officials have introduced 500 weed-eating goats in public areas after residents asked for an alternative to pesticides and chemicals. The initiative costs the town about $500 a day, the National League of Cities said. In Denver, signs touting ""Goats at Work"" alert passers-by to the animals' presence on vacant lots managed by the park system. The goats cost the city about $200 an acre, according to the National League of Cities. Environmental activists hail the measure, calling it innovative and worth implementing. ""Most times you can replace small engines that are sources of greenhouse gases with more natural systems, that's a good thing,"" said Bill Brower of GlobalGiving, a Washington nonprofit organization that describes itself as an online marketplace of grass-roots green projects.","Maryland uses 40 goats to ""mow"" grass along highways .

"(CNN) -- The wife of a man suspected of killing five people in Tennessee and one in Alabama was among the victims found in southern Tennessee, along with her son, father and brother, police said Sunday. Jacob Shaffer was arrested in connection with the slayings of six people in Tennessee, police said. Jacob Shaffer, 30, of Fayetteville, Tennessee, was arrested Saturday after three people were found dead at a home in Fayetteville, 90 miles south of Nashville, Tennessee. Two other people were found at another home on the same street. The three found in one home were Shaffer's wife, Traci Shaffer, 38; her son Devin Brooks, 16; and the youth's friend and neighbor, 16-year-old Robert Berber, according to a statement Sunday from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The two people found at the other home were Traci Shaffer's father, Billy Hall, 57, and her brother Chris Hall, 34, authorities said. Autopsies were being conducted Sunday on the five, and causes of death would be released by medical examiners, the bureau said. A sixth person was found dead at a business about 30 miles away in Huntsville, Alabama, the Tennessee authorities said. The person's name was not released Sunday. Jacob Shaffer was in one of the Fayetteville homes when Lincoln County sheriff's deputies arrived Saturday, authorities said. Police believe the deaths happened either Friday night or Saturday, according to Kristin Helm of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Officials said they believe the deaths were related to a domestic dispute. It was unclear when or how the Huntsville victim died. ""We have no clue yet as to what unfolded there and how it relates to here,"" Huntsville Police Sgt. Mickey Allen said Saturday. Without naming Shaffer, Allen said Tennessee authorities told him a man confessed to a slaying in Huntsville and to five other killings in Fayetteville. Shaffer faces five counts of criminal homicide in the Tennessee deaths, the TBI statement said. He was in the Lincoln County Jail without bond Sunday. CNN's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect's wife and her son, brother and father among the dead, police say .

"(CNN)  -- The day was supposed to be remembered as one filled with happiness. Their daughter, after all, had just turned 2 years old. Instead, Nikki Peterson remembers December 30, 2007 as the day her husband Billy got sick. Billy Anderson's undiagnosed condition has kept him in the hospital for more than a year. Billy Anderson was in fine health until that evening last winter. He woke up in pain and his wife rushed him to the emergency room. Over the next few days, he suffered a number of ailments, from a running fever and hives to swelling joints. Nikki says she knew there was something wrong when Billy was no longer able to walk around the house. ""This is a 6-foot, 240-pound guy who doesn't usually complain about anything,"" she says. The couple, from Baxter Springs, Kansas, made three trips to the emergency room. On their third visit, Nikki refused to go home until doctors agreed to keep Billy in the hospital for further evaluation. Since then, Billy, age 29, has been in and out of intensive care. He's spent time on a ventilator and suffered kidney failure. His body isn't absorbing nutrients, and as a result, his 240-pound frame has been whittled down by 100 pounds.  See photos of Billy and his family » . One year and a battery of tests later, doctors still haven't pinpointed the cause of his condition. CNN's medical show ""Vital Signs"" recently asked viewers to tell their health stories on iReport.com. Nikki and her mom, Vicki Peterson, jumped at the opportunity. Tell your story with iReport.com . They hope their story will reach someone who can help solve Billy's unexplained illness. Doctors have gone through at least 40 possible diagnoses, according to Nikki. ""We've been told that this is 'Billy's Disease,' and that this will be written about in medical journals. We hope somebody has missed a test or overlooked something,"" she says. Billy, a father of two who dreams of opening up his own restaurant one day, appears to have some type of problem with B-cells, according to Nikki. B-cells play a critical role in keeping the immune system healthy. Dr. Jennifer Holter, who has been treating Billy at Oklahoma University Medical Center since the fall of 2008, says several immunologists have reviewed his case but  the underlying reason for his immunodeficiency is still unclear. Early on, doctors thought he had Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease, but that turned out not to be the case. They also haven't been able to identify a typical gene disorder that may be the source. Most immunodeficiency disorders present themselves in childhood. Adult onset that isn't linked to a genetic event is even more uncommon, Dr. Holter says. ""I think when you have close to 25 immunologists look at you and they can't figure out what's causing the problem, you can call that pretty rare,"" she says. The ordeal has taken an emotional toll on the family. ""It's been devastating. It's traumatic for the children to have to watch someone who was once so strong suffer,"" says Nikki. Being uninsured has added financial stress. Billy had just started a new job training to be a kitchen manager when he first got sick. As a result, he didn't have insurance. He was able to apply for Medicaid, but his coverage was canceled once he started receiving disability assistance. Oklahoma University Medical Center has become the family's second home. Nikki has moved to nearby Tulsa in order to be able to spend half of the week by Billy's side. Billy is currently receiving treatment that helps him replace the cells his body isn't making. He's also receiving immunosuppressants to suppress aggravation in his gut. ""This is a very unfortunate situation for a very nice 29-year-old and we will keep offering him the best clinical care we can,"" Dr. Holter says. Billy has cycled through five hospitals in the span of 12 months, and he and Nikki hope their next move will take them East. Billy recently applied for the Undiagnosed Diseases Program at the National Institutes of Health. The program uses a combination of scientific and medical expertise to help patients with mysterious conditions. Nikki, who has started a support group for Billy on Facebook and provides updates on his condition on his MySpace page, says she refuses to give up: ""Billy deserves every opportunity to survive. He's a hard working man who took care of his family.""","iReport.com: Viewers, readers share their health stories .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- When British forces fully withdraw from Iraq on Friday, it will be the second time in a century that Britain will leave this nation with a legacy of war dead. Mechanics prepare a tank ready to shipped back to the UK from Basra. In the Baghdad North Gate War Cemetery rest thousands of British soldiers killed in a protracted military campaign during World War I, after which Britain established an occupying regime in Iraq. In the peak of the latest war that began in 2003, about 46,000 British troops were stationed in and around Iraq. Now, almost all British troops are being pulled out because an agreement that allows them to remain in Iraq expires Friday, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Britain leaves Iraq this time with 179 of its own dead. ""It's been a tough six years, no doubt about that,"" said Jon Wilks, the deputy head of the British mission. ""But I think what we left behind is a solid base on which to build."" The British were based in southern Iraq, primarily in Basra, Iraq's second largest city that sits close to the Persian Gulf. ""We have in many sectors left Basra in a better state than when we arrived in 2003."" Then, after the U.S.-led invasion, Iraqis welcomed British troops. They were hailed as the force that would save the area's predominantly Shiite population from Saddam Hussein's persecution. But the mood turned when liberation was not followed by a quick withdrawal. ""It became the opposite of what we were wishing for,"" said Mustafa Atia, a member of the Basra provincial council."" Hope started to turn to fear. By the end of 2004, extreme Shiite militias were gaining control of Basra. It seemed British forces had been sidelined as the militias enforced their own brand of laws. In September 2007, British troops withdrew completely from Basra and southern Iraq was touted as the coalition forces' success story. But Basra was left reeling. The British-trained Iraqi police had been infiltrated by militiamen; the Iraqi Army struggled to keep them in check. Women bore the brunt of the militia's brutal rule -- executed for ""un-Islamic"" acts like wearing tight jeans and lipstick. Or in the case of one woman, living alone. Sabriya, identified only by her first name for security reasons, recalled her sister's plight. ""They said, 'Why don't you have a husband?'"" Sabriya said. ""They came in at night and put a pillow on her face and shot her in the head."" In March 2008, the Iraqi government launched Operation ""Charge of the Knights"" to battle Basra's lawlessness. The city was flooded with Iraqi soldiers and their U.S. advisers. The British were drawn back into the thick of the fight, their Mastiff and Warrior armored vehicles once again on the streets of the southern port city. ""The situation was awful, mainly because militias controlled the security forces,"" said Iraqi Gen. Aziz Swady, who was dispatched to Basra as part of the operation. ""But after this operation, the citizens started to trust the Iraqi security forces."" Basra began piecing itself back together. On Friday, as the British leave Iraq behind for a second time, they are left to ponder the fragility of Basra's situation -- and their own sacrifices. The question that could linger is: Was it worth it?","In 2003 about 46,000 British troops were stationed in and around Iraq .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Moroccan man wanted for links to the Madrid train bombings in 2004 was brought to Spain from France on Wednesday, a Spanish police statement said. A photograph showing Moroccan-born suspect Said Rehou. The suspect, Said Rehou, 27, born in Casablanca, Morocco, allegedly held indoctrination sessions for Islamic militants at his former Madrid home, the statement said. ""Various individuals who participated in those meetings later were implicated directly or indirectly in the Casablanca attacks of 2003 and the March 11, 2004, attacks in Madrid,"" the statement said. The Madrid train bombings -- coordinated attacks on four morning-rush commuter trains -- killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. Spanish courts have convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the Madrid bombings, along with four Spaniards, the latter for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Seven other prime Islamic suspects killed themselves in an explosion as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb three weeks after the bombings. The Casablanca bombings in May 2003 killed 33 bystanders and 12 suicide bombers. Rehou is wanted in Spain for belonging to a terrorist group, and is thought to have formed part of a cell created in Spain in 2002, with the aim of recruiting fighters to carry out attacks in Morocco, Spain and other countries, the police statement said. The meetings at his home lasted six to eight hours, with the screening of videos that included sermons and scenes promoting holy war, the statement said.","Suspect Said Rehou allegedly held indoctrination sessions .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen claimed his fourth Belgian Formula One Grand Prix victory in five years at Spa to end an astonishing run of 26 races without a win for the 2007 world champion. Kimi Raikkonen celebrates ending his victory drought after winning the Belgian Grand Prix. Raikkonen was hounded all the way for the majority of the race by pole-sitter Giancarlo Fisichella, who gave Force India their first points in F1 after 30 races with a second-place finish. In a chaos-filled race, British duo Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton crashed out on the opening lap in an accident that also accounted for the Toro Rosso of Jaime Alguersuari and Renault's Romain Grosjean. Despite Button failing to score points for the first time this season, the 29-year-old still has a 16-point world championship cushion over Brawn GP team-mate Rubens Barrichello, who was seventh, with Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel is now 19 points down after he came home third. After his 18th career win, Raikkonen told reporters: ""We haven't brought new parts for the last few races as we are looking at next year. But my aim was always still to win a race because we are aiming for third in the (constructors') championship. ""We probably weren't the fastest in terms of lap time, but we were able to keep everybody behind us. Hopefully we can now win more."" The Finn is fifth overall, 38 points behind leader Button and 17.5 adrift of fourth-placed Australian Mark Webber. Fisichella was delighted and disappointed in equal measure as he said: ""It's a great result for us. ""It's a great day but I was quicker than Kimi and I'm a little bit sad because maybe I could have won the race as I was keeping pace with his car."" Vettel believes anything is possible now over the remaining five races as he, teammate Webber and Barrichello continue to reel in Button. ""If you look at the championship it's a good result,"" remarked Vettel. ""We lost too much ground in the first stint because of the guys ahead, but in the second and third the car was fantastic. It was a pleasure to drive. ""We've managed to take points out of the Brawns, so overall a big thank you to the team and to Renault (engine providers) after all the trouble we've gone through recently. ""It shows we are back."" Webber finished out of the points in ninth, with the BMW Sauber pairing of Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld claiming fourth and fifth respectively. Hamilton's McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen was sixth, and Nico Rosberg of Williams took the final points-scoring position in eighth. Raikkonen's teammate Luca Badoer was again last of the 14 drivers who finished the race, with the Italian continuing to struggle as stand-in for the injured Felipe Massa. His future with the Italian marque will be decided by Wednesday, the team said after Sunday's race. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso retired after 26 laps due to a problem with a front wheel on his Renault, having been third at one stage. Toyota's Jarno Trulli, who started second on the grid, also retired after 21 laps after earlier pitting for repairs.","Kimi Raikkonen claims fourth Belgian Formula One Grand Prix victory at Spa .

"(CNN)  -- The death of a spectator overshadowed an intriguing 14th stage of the Tour de France which saw Rinaldo Nocentini desperately cling on to the leader's yellow jersey in cycling's premier event. George Hincapie, front, upstaged his compatriot and former teammate Lance Armstrong to take second place overall. A woman died after being hit by a police motorcycle on Saturday afternoon in Wittelsheim, a village in Alsace in northeastern France which is 40 kilometers from the start of the race's leg from Colmar to Besancon. French police told CNN that two other people were injured and taken to hospital. The Tour released a statement on its official Web site saying the 61-year-old woman was hit when she crossed the road after a group of cyclists passed, then the motorcycle slid and injured two other spectators. A 36-year-old is in hospital with neck pain, and a 61-year-old has a broken leg . The incident marred an eventful day's racing in which George Hincapie leapt up into second place overall, five seconds behind Nocentini, following a 12-man breakaway. The American finished eighth in a group of eight who were all 16 seconds behind stage winner Serguei Ivanov of Russia, and had been ahead of Nocentini until the 143-strong peloton made up time at the end. The Columbia team rider's rise up the standings saw his compatriot and former teammate, seven-time champion Lance Armstrong, drop to fourth place overall. Armstrong was still eight seconds off the lead after finishing 49th, with Astana teammate Alberto Contador six seconds adrift in third following his classification of 37th. Nocentini was relieved to retain first place and was grateful to his AG2R teammates, with Nicolas Roche finishing second after powering past Hayden Roche in the final few hundred meters as Ivanov claimed his second stage victory eight years after his first. ""It was a very difficult day today because we're getting tired from all the effort in the last week,"" the Italian, who finished 45th, told the race's official Web site. ""We had a rider up front so we didn't have to ride but because Hincapie was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. ""Eventually, with 50 kilometers to go, our directeur sportif Vincent Lavenu said, 'Okay, let's go! Let's catch the guys.' Okay this wasn't possible but we had to limit our losses and keep the jersey. ""I told the guys, 'Listen, I don't mind. If you want to go for it and defend the jersey, that's great. But if you don't want to, that's okay. You've already worked so hard over the last few days so it doesn't really matter.' ""Eventually I've kept the lead by just five seconds, so I'm really pleased with how this Tour has gone for me so far. And I'm really grateful for the commitment from my team."" Thor Hushovd extended his lead in the green jersey sprint category as he finished at the head of the peloton in 13th place, while nearest rival Mark Cavendish finished right at the back of it in 154th after the two tussled in the closing stages. The riders will now head back into the mountains through the Swiss Alps for the 207.5km 15th stage from Pontarlier to Verbier, with the climbers expected to come to the fore again just a week ahead of the finish in Paris.","A woman dies after being hit by a police motorcycle during the 14th stage .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Bollywood leading man Akshay Kumar plays a character who basks in the glamorous shadow cast by American stars like Sylvester Stallone and Denise Richards in his latest movie. Akshay Kumar is one of the biggest names in Indian film. In reality, Kumar has no need for such humility. One of the biggest names in Indian film, he's increasingly rubbing shoulders with the global glitterati these days. In ""Kambakkht Ishq,"" he plays a Hollywood stuntman alongside Stallone and Richards, who have cameos in the film. He starred this year with U.S. rapper Snoop Dogg in the film ""Singh is Kinng,"" and he's set to appear in a film alongside Australian pop star Kylie Minogue later in the year. The unstoppable rise of Bollywood and the massive popularity of Indian film beyond its homeland have made stars like Kumar hot property. The poster boy of Indian action films now finds himself at the vanguard of the crossover between the world's two largest movie industries.  Watch Kumar speak to CNN about his upcoming projects » . The Hollywood men in suits have been eyeing the Indian market greedily for some time. While the economic downturn has hit Tinseltown hard, Bollywood is a rising tiger -- the industry was worth $15 billion in 2008 and is projected to grow by 10 percent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. With the notable exception of this year's runaway Oscar hit ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" attempts to make crossover films for both markets have largely failed. The masala mix of genres and exaggerated acting that typifies the Bollywood formula has met limited success in the West. Instead Hollywood studios have begun bankrolling Bollywood productions solely for the Indian market. But the financial traffic is by no means one-way. In the other direction, Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks recently snagged a multi-million dollar film production deal with Reliance Big Entertainment, one of Bollywood's biggest hitters. For Kumar, the strengthening of ties between Hollywood and Bollywood is bringing many opportunities, including the chance to work alongside his childhood hero Stallone. ""Well it was great. It was an honor to work with him,"" he told CNN. In addition to starring in ""Kambakkht Ishq,"" his other major role this year was as an Indian chef who learns martial arts in ""Chandni Chowk Goes to China."" The movie was financed by Warner Brothers. (Warner Brothers, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) The typically flamboyant plot of ""Chandni Chowk"" was loosely inspired by Kumar's own life. Born in Punjab but raised in Delhi, he came to acting late after working as a waiter in Bangkok. While in the Thai capital he learned martial arts, which he taught upon his return to India before becoming a male model. He landed his first movie role in the 1992 Hindi language film ""Deeder"" and has gone on to become one of Bollywood's leading men. He is married to fellow actor Twinkle Khanna. The couple created a buzz in India when they fell foul of the country's notoriously strict obscenity laws in March after Kumar encouraged his wife to undo the top button of his jeans at a fashion show in Mumbai. A complaint was lodged with the police and they were briefly questioned. With more than 80 features to his name, Kumar maintains that a strong work ethic is the reason for his longevity in the movie business. ""I think it's the simplest thing. It's actually hard work and punctuality,"" the 41-year-old told CNN from the London set of his latest movie, a comedy called ""Housefull."" ""Even if you're not a good actor, to be a producer's actor is essential. If you finish your films on time you save money for the producer,"" he noted. His devotion to the job is coupled with a strong sense of family duty. ""I would say my success lies at the feet of my parents because that's been my biggest strength and that's what we Hindus believe,"" he said. ""Every morning before you go to work just touch your parents' feet and go ahead in life. People may not believe it, but I do.""","Bollywood leading man Akshay Kumar has appeared in more than 80 movies .

"(CNN) -- If all goes according to plan, cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October's Ford Ironman World Championship, a grueling triathlon made up of a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a 26.2-mile run. Heart transplant recipient and cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October's Ironman World Championship. And he'll do it with another man's heart pumping in his chest. ""I don't think there's anybody who wouldn't consider me a success story and a survivor,"" Garlett said. His medical issues began in 1989 when he received his first Hodgkin's disease diagnosis as a high school senior. In 1995, during his third battle with the cancer, doctors ceased his chemotherapy treatment when they discovered it had weakened his heart. Two years later, Garlett learned he had secondary leukemia as a result of chemotherapy to treat the Hodgkin's, and three more years of chemotherapy ensued. And after five years on the waiting list, he received a new heart in 2006. Now, the 37-year-old savors his body's capabilities. ""It's kind of like the starving person who all of a sudden finds himself in front of a buffet. And now I've got the buffet. I've got my all-you-can-eat plate, and I'm just loading it up,"" Garlett said. A heart transplant may seem extremely daunting, but Garlett saw it as a more hopeful operation than his years of cancer treatments. ""Going in for chemotherapy, as a patient you know what's happening. Your body is being poisoned and you know that when you come out on the other side of it, you're going to have given up something,"" said Garlett, a sportswriter and motivational speaker living in Marina del Rey, California. ""On the heart transplant, though, it was completely the opposite. I knew that from the day of the transplant on, every day I'd be getting stronger. And they were now doing something that was going to fix me, improve my life."" Garlett, who says he's ""not a klutz"" but ""definitely not a natural athlete,"" trains about 15 hours a week for October's Ironman in Kona, Hawaii. Closer to race time, he expects to spend 20 to 25 hours a week in intense training to achieve his goal of finishing within the 17-hour time limit. Garlett was invited to compete in the elite event because organizers believe he ""demonstrates the Ironman mantra: Anything is possible,"" said Blair LaHaye, director of communications for Ironman. LaHaye said a handful of athletes are invited to take part in the event each year, but their inclusion doesn't reduce the number of slots for those who get in by doing well in qualifying events, or by winning a spot through the Ironman lottery.  Garlett will compete in a half-Ironman or other long-distance event before Kona to validate his selection. The training and competition are demanding enough for competitors without health issues. But being a heart transplant patient comes with the extra challenge of getting the organ to beat at an acceptable rate. ""When the old heart comes out, all the nerves are severed. And when the donor heart comes in, the nerves are not connected,"" explained Dr. Jon Kobashigawa, medical director of the UCLA Heart Transplant Program, where Garlett is a patient. In a person whose heart is intact, ""the brain will tell the heart, 'Let's go, start exercising, let's start beating faster,' "" Kobashigawa said. A donor heart, however, relies on circulating adrenaline in order to get it going. As a result, heart transplant recipients must warm up thoroughly to get their heart pumping properly. The ""denervated"" heart works about 80 to 90 percent as well as a normal heart, Kobashigawa said, ""but through exercise, these patients who do strenuous activities, I believe, do get their exercise capacity almost to the normal range, if not normal."" It's also possible, doctors say, for the donor heart to re-innervate -- or grow nerves onto the donor heart. Following in his footsteps . Garlett is on a trail blazed by Dwight Kroening, the first heart transplant recipient to complete the Ironman, last year in Canada. Kroening, now 49, got a new heart in 1986 after his swelled to about twice its normal size for unknown reasons. He was 26 at the time -- a gym teacher, coach and athlete. At first, running with his students became a struggle. Within days, he couldn't walk up a flight of stairs without stopping to rest. Soon, combing his hair and brushing his teeth became too taxing, he said. When doctors examined him as a candidate for a heart transplant, they told him his heart was working at 8 percent of its normal capacity and he probably had about two months to live. Kroening began exercising a week after the surgery, but soon discovered he was incapable of athletic activities that required sprinting, he said. ""I [told my doctors], there's something wrong here. I'm not able to do these things. And they said, 'Of course not,' "" Kroening said. ""So being me, I was more or less bound and determined to prove that they were wrong, that I could actually train myself to be able to do these things,"" he said. But overcoming those hurdles wasn't easy, even after 22 years of practice. Three-quarters of the way into the Ironman's bicycle leg, Kroening felt ill and fatigued, he said. He questioned whether he would be able to finish. He did, in 15½ hours -- one hour longer than his target.  Watch Kroening compete in the Ironman » . ""When we test [heart transplant recipients] on the treadmill, their peak heart rate is around 140 beats [per minute] and they can maintain that for one minute. ... When Dwight did the Ironman, we recorded his heart rate, and he was able to exercise at a heart rate of 133 beats per minute for 15½ hours,"" said Mark Haykowsky, a professor of rehab medicine at Canada's University of Alberta. Haykowsky studied Kroening for research on exercise habits of heart transplant recipients. Since the Ironman, Kroening has competed in other events, including a marathon and a triathlon. He may compete in another Ironman next year in Arizona, the state where he received his heart transplant. ""I relate [the Ironman] to what I guess would be like childbirth,"" Kroening said. ""In the process, you're thinking, 'I'll never do this again in my whole life. This is absolutely crazy.'

"(CNN) -- Injured Formula One star Felipe Massa is looking forward to taking his first steps towards driving again after passing a series of mental and physical tests in Miami. Felipe Massa has been given the all-clear to begin training as he bids to return to the race track. His team Ferrari reported on its Web site on Tuesday that the Brazilian, who suffered horrific head wounds in Hungary in July, had come through the tests satisfactorily on Monday. ""The checks (which included neurometric, impact and cognitive capacity tests) all had a positive outcome, just like the eye exam: everything is in order for Felipe to get back to racing,"" the statement said. ""Now there has just to be carried out some plastic surgery at the brain box, where the spring at the accident at the Hungaroring hit his helmet. ""The surgery will take place in the upcoming days. After a short convalescence Felipe can then gradually start with physical preparations."" The 28-year-old, who finished second in last year's drivers' world championship, said that he planned to take things slowly following the operation. ""I'm very happy about the results,"" he told www.Ferrari.com before returning home to Sao Paulo. ""After the small surgery, in the next few days I can finally start to go to the gym to get back into shape and drive some tests in karts. ""On the track with a Formula One single-seater? Let's take it step by step. At the moment I'm concentrating on taking up physical activities, which is a great step forward."" Ferrari said Massa was expected to be at 100 percent fitness in time for the 2010 season, but gave no indication whether he would return to racing this year -- he has, however, indicated that he would like to drive at his home Brazilian Grand Prix on October 18. His replacement, test driver Luca Badoer, is not expected to drive at the Italian Grand Prix two weekends away after finishing last in his two races so far. Badoer, who stepped into the breach when F1 legend Michael Schumacher was unable to make a shock return to the sport due to a neck problem, was not allowed to test drive the current Ferrari vehicle during the four-week summer break due to this year's regulations. Veteran Italian Giancarlo Fisichella has been linked with Ferrari after finishing second at the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday, but his team Force India insist that he will race for them at Monza. Highly-rated Polish driver Robert Kubica is also in the running to replace Badoer, with his team BMW Sauber dropping out of F1 at the end of this season. Badoer's results aside, Ferrari have enjoyed a renaissance since Massa's injury, with 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen winning in Belgium to end a personal drought of 26 races and placing third in Valencia.","Injured F1 star Felipe Massa passes series of mental and physical tests .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Dinara Safina battled from a set down to defeat Belarusian teenager Victoria Azarenka at the French Open, but there was no escape for scheduled semifinal opponent Maria Sharapova who suffered a humiliating exit. Sharapova bowed out of the French Open after suffering one of her worst career defeats. Sharapova was thrashed 6-0 6-2 by Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova in her last-eight match on Tuesday while fellow Russian Safina overcame 19-year-old Azarenka 1-6 6-4 6-2. It could have worse for former world number one Sharapova as Cibulkova had a match point to mark her first Grand Slam quarterfinal by dishing out the dreaded double bagel. Sharapova survived and she saved three more match points in the 12th game of the second set before her resistance crumbled completely with a netted forehand. It was her heaviest loss since she went down 6-1 6-1 to Serena Williams in the fourth round in Miami in 2007. Sharapova, playing only her second tournament since a 10-month lay-off because of a shoulder injury, was bidding to reach her second semifinal following a run to the 2007 last four. The Russian star, whose ranking slumped to 104 in the world during her time off the tour, had won both her previous matches against the pint-sized, 20-year-old Cibulkova and both were on clay. But Cibulkova was in complete control, breaking in the first, third and fifth games of the opening set. The Slovakian was then quickly 1-0 ahead before receiving a code violation for taking too long between points. It did not throw her off her stride and she was soon flat out on the dirt surface of Court Suzanne Lenglen in celebration. Safina was given the runaround in the first set and was at one stage being held at 4-4 in the second, but recovered her poise on Philippe Chatrier court. Ninth seed Azarenka had beaten Safina at Indian Wells earlier this year and had also won three titles in 2009, in Brisbane, Memphis and Miami. She played an almost perfect first set in just 23 minutes, but Safina then found the form that had seen her lose just five games in her run to the quarters opening a 4-1 lead in the second. Azarenka fought back to make it 4-4 but Safina rallied again to take the set -- and break in the opening game of the third. World number one Safina, who has yet to win a grand slam, finished the stronger to wrap up victory in an hour and 52 minutes. ""I just didn't take the chances I had,"" said Azarenka. ""Shedefinitely stepped it up and played some good points at key moments, which I have to give her credit for. It's all experience. Hopefully I'll do better next time.""","Dinara Safina battles from set down to beat Victoria Azarenka at French Open .

"DALLAS, Texas (CNN) -- The FBI has seized a two-page, handwritten letter of condolence sent by Jacqueline Kennedy to the widow of Robert F. Kennedy shortly after he was assassinated in 1968. The family contends the letter was stolen. Jacqueline Kennedy sent her sister-in-law a condolence letter in 1968 which is now in the hands of the FBI. ""We're trying to determine who the legal owner is,"" said Mark White, a spokesman for the FBI. ""There's still an ongoing investigation."" The letter's path from the Virginia home of Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, to a locked evidence vault in the Dallas field office of the FBI is described in a six-page affidavit filed last month in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas by Special Agent John Skillestad. It says Max Kennedy, the son of Ethel and Robert, alerted the bureau in July 2006 to the letter's pending auction at Heritage Galleries and Auctioneers Galleries in Dallas. Max Kennedy, who said he is the sole person in charge of his parents' papers, ""stated that he had not given authority to sell, give, or donate any papers of Ethel or Robert Kennedy to anyone,"" the affidavit says. After the gallery pulled the letter from its auction, the FBI traced its provenance to Thomas Nuckols, who told authorities he had found it among the papers left by his father, Russell Thomas Nuckols, a plumber who died in 1999. ""Thomas Nuckols said he was dumbfounded upon discovery of the letter because he had never seen it before and did not know how it came into his father's possession,"" the affidavit says. Nuckols said he contacted the Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, but ""the person on the telephone did not seem too interested in the letter"" and referred him to a Connecticut collector, who bought it for $6,000, the affidavit says. CNN has not been able to reach Nuckols. The letter was then resold to several other collectors, and was at one time valued at as much as $30,000 before it wound up with the Dallas auctioneer, who has cooperated with authorities, the FBI said. Last October, the FBI spoke with Ethel Kennedy, who said she remembers Russell Thomas Nuckols as a plumber who worked at the Kennedy house in Virginia during the 1960s and 1970s, the affidavit says. The 81-year-old widow of the former senator and attorney general said she ""never gave the letter to anyone to keep and under no circumstances would anyone have the authority to transfer ownership of the letter to anyone."" The affidavit concludes that the letter ""is considered as a stolen good."" Once the rightful owner is determined, it will be given to that person, FBI spokesman White said. ""I don't know how long it will take."" Jacqueline Kennedy was the widow of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. In the letter she mentions ""Stas,"" an apparent reference to Stanislas Radziwill, her brother-in-law. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died in 1994. The letter is not dated, but appears to have been written shortly after Robert Kennedy died on June 6, 1968, the victim of an assassin's bullet. The Dallas News printed a copy of the letter, which White confirmed is authentic. It reads: . My Ethel -- . No one in the world could have ever been like you were yesterday -- except maybe Bobby -- We are going home now -- Your phone was busy . You don't want any more callers you must be so tired -- I stayed up till 6:30 last night just thinking -- and praying for you -- and for you in the months ahead -- . I love you so much -- . You know that anything -- Stas will take little Bobby to Africa -- I'll take them around the world + to the moon + back -- anything to help you + them now and always -- . With my deepest deepest love . Jackie .","FBI trying to determine who owns letter written by Jackie Kennedy in 1968 .

"LONDON, England -- ""Ocean Emerald"" is a superyacht with added wow-factor. Her startling appearance has made sure of that and in real life she is every bit as dramatic as she appears in these photographs. ""Ocean Emerald"" is the second time Lord Foster has designed a superyacht. We were among the guests invited to the superyacht's official launching in La Spezia, in northern Italy, when her celebrity designer and his team walked down the red carpet to cast his eyes upon his latest masterpiece. Lord Foster of Thameside is no stranger to eye-catching and dramatic design. His architectural firm Norman Foster + Partners is responsible for iconic London landmarks such as 30 St Mary Axe, better known as the Gherkin, and the Millennium Bridge. Foster is the master of the curved line. Imagine for a moment a photograph of the Gherkin split in two lengthwise and laid flat, recall the sweeping curves of the Millennium Bridge and you will see how he has managed to combine the drama of those two creations into what is arguably the most visually stunning superyacht of the year. Ocean Emerald is not the first of Foster's forays into the world of superyacht design. It was he who drew the lines for the Lürssen-built Izanami, a 58-metre yacht now called Ronin and owned by Larry Ellison. Launched in 1993, she is also a head-turner. Design and external appearance aside, Ocean Emerald is different from every other 41-metre superyacht in that she is not to be the sole property of any one owner. This perhaps is one of the reasons for her radical look as she is designed to appeal to those who are new to the concept of superyacht ownership. Unlike the traditional form of ownership, where one person, sometimes through an anonymous corporation, is the owner of all 64 shares of the yacht, the shares in Ocean Emerald are split either into eight or sixteen parts. These fractions -- one-eighth or one-sixteenth -- of Ocean Emerald have been sold to different individuals by the London-based company YachtPlus. When engaged to design the yacht, the Foster team were initially told to work within the confines of an existing hull designed by yacht builders Intermarine, part of Rodriquez Cantieri Navale. But after discussions, Rodriquez has produced a new 41-metre hull three metres longer than the original concept. Walking around Ocean Emerald, it is clear that Foster has taken all the traditional rules of yacht design, torn them up and started again. The public rooms benefit from abundant natural light, which floods in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, in addition to the copious artificial lights. Coupled with the use of pale-coloured woods, soft furnishings and white high-gloss, wipe-clean surfaces they create a wonderfully bright, modern feel. Unusually for a motor yacht, the natural teak decking extends right the way through from the aft deck to the saloon, ensuring a seamless visual transition between the outside and inside spaces. To join the Ownership Lifestyle Programme will cost an initial payment of €1.875 million. This buys you a one eighth share of the yacht and guarantees 30 nights per year on board -- ten nights peak season in the Mediterranean, ten nights peak season in the Caribbean, and two five-night cultural tours such as sightseeing, shopping, golf, Formula 1, vineyard visits and museums. Each year there will be an annual service charge of €200,000 to cover overheads, including marine and hotel operations, permanent crew, mooring and berthing fees, year-round maintenance and mechanical upkeep, marine and port charges and cruise itineraries management. Lord Foster said: ""With my team we have given a new emphasis to such issues as quality and quantity of space, outdoor terraces, light and views. Our commission is for the total design concept of the fleet, with an eye on beauty, function and luxury, down to the smallest detail. We believe that there is great potential in the concept of luxury cruisers to think afresh such issues as views, light, privacy and the quality of spaces -- both inside and outdoors."" The concept of fractional ownership is fast becoming acknowledged as a logical way forward for those wishing to enjoy high-end luxury products without the massive capital investement required. Foster himself owns one of the shares and is very much looking forward to experiencing what it is like to step into the shoes of a superyacht owner. It may only be for a fraction of the time but it is also, as he so eloquently puts it, only for a fraction of the price. Subscribe to SuperYachtWorld . COPYRIGHT ©  2009 IPC MEDIA LTD.

A woman and child rescued from a ferry accident off the Philippines on Sunday arrive in port. Two people remained unaccounted for from the SuperFerry 9 vessel carrying 968 people, according to the Philippine Coast Guard. It had no dangerous or hazardous cargo on board. The ferry took off from the city of General Santos and was bound for Iloilo City. Survivors and their families were moved to a nearby location, where they were getting medical help and other forms of assistance, the coast guard said. An investigation will be conducted after rescue operations are completed. It was the third major incident involving the SuperFerry 9 in the past three years. No fatalities were reported in the other incidents in 2006 and 2007. Meanwhile, a Panamanian cargo vessel sank off the central coast of the Philippines, though the 20 people on board -- 18 Filipinos and 2 South Koreans -- were rescued, the Philippine Coast Guard said.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A helicopter crashed during takeoff from Kandahar airfield in southern Afghanistan on Sunday, killing 16 people, NATO said. U.S. Marines participate in operation Saturday to push Taliban out of Herati, Afghanistan.

The helicopter was not shot down, ISAF said, adding that the exact cause of the crash was not known. All the dead were civilians, ISAF said. There were an additional five casualties whose condition was not known, according to the military statement.   Watch report on the crash » . The chopper was a Mil Mi-8 helicopter, owned by the Russian air company Vertikal-T, the Russian news agency Interfax said, citing Russia's Federal Air Transportation Agency, Rosaviatsia.

Separately, a U.S. military helicopter made a hard landing in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF said. ISAF denied the helicopter was shot down in Kunar province, but suggested the people on board were injured. ""Personnel on the aircraft were initially treated on site and evacuated to the nearest medical facility for further treatment,"" the ISAF statement said. The two helicopter incidents come a day after a plane crash that killed two airmen on a U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle in eastern Afghanistan early Saturday, the U.S. military said. The two-man fighter went down while it was conducting military operations, Lt. Col. Reid Christopherson, said earlier. He said he was ""confident"" it had not been shot down.

"(CNN) -- When Autumn Preble was a teenager in the 1960s, she spent hours gazing at black-and-white LIFE magazine photographs that documented the journey of Peace Corps volunteers all over the world. George Stouter, 67, is helping build mental health programs in Saint Kitts for his Peace Corps stint. Preble, of Whidbey Island, Washington, wanted to join, but after college came marriage and a child. Now at 58, with her son off to college, she has begun her two-year stint as a Peace Corps volunteer working in the public health sector in Francistown, Botswana, where nearly one in four individuals are infected with HIV. ""I'm getting to experience what it's like to live in another culture, and that has a lot of value to me,"" Preble said from her simple two-bedroom bungalow in Botswana. Preble is known to natives in her community as Masego (Ma say ho), which means ""many gifts."" ""This is the kind of travel that I'm interested in."" Forget the mapped-out cruises or packaged vacations to see the world. A growing number of Americans over 50 are dedicating time in their golden years to volunteering abroad. The decision is becoming more attractive with a sickly national economy sparking more layoffs and early retirement packages. ""The economic crisis is giving them an opportunity to take a break,"" said Vanessa Noel, an associate director in the nonprofit department of Alliance Abroad Group. The Austin, Texas-based company offers work, teaching and volunteer programs to students and graduates in the U.S. and abroad. Noel coordinates volunteer trips abroad that typically last between two and 12 weeks. Inquiries from eager adults over 50 have flooded her office in recent months -- so much so that she is creating new programs this summer to Costa Rica and Ecuador tailored to older volunteers that will last several weeks. ""Life is short, and now they can seize the opportunities out there."" Applications for the Peace Corps from adults over 50 have spiked 44 percent in 2008 compared to 2007, driven largely by the weak economy and a campaign launched in 2007 to lure mature volunteers. All applicants to the Peace Corps -- a federal program created in 1961 that puts Americans overseas in places of need -- must pass background checks and a health test. Married couples are allowed to join together. By the end of 2008, there were 428 Peace Corps volunteers over age 50 in the field in countries all over the world, from South Africa and Romania to the Eastern Caribbean, challenging the traditional image of the 20-something, post-college volunteer.  See the stories of Americans over 50 who have volunteered abroad » . Other nonprofit groups specializing in shorter ""voluntourism"" trips also are seeing a spike in interest. For those unable to leave for the 27 months required by intensive volunteer programs like the Peace Corps, these paid programs last from a week to a year. Cross-Cultural Solutions, a nonprofit in New York that offers volunteer trips to countries like Russia and Peru from one to 12 weeks, experienced more than a 10 percent growth in volunteers over 50 in 2008, compared with 2007, according to company officials. San Francisco, California-based Global Services Corps, a nonprofit that coordinates service trips to Thailand, Tanzania and Cambodia for stays from two weeks to a year, saw a 25 percent jump in information requests from older Americans after the stock market tanked in October. Older volunteers have long donated time to volunteering abroad, perhaps most famously President Jimmy Carter's mother, Lillian Carter, who applied to the Peace Corps at age 68. As global health and economic issues abroad have become more publicized in an increasingly connected world, older Americans venturing overseas hope they can serve some of the poorest communities in the world while improving the tarnished American image abroad. Many older Americans, like Preble, say they are volunteering abroad in response to President John F. Kennedy's inspiring words from their younger years, asking them to serve their country. Now, they finally have the time. ""They have had a pretty lifelong pattern of community activism, so it makes perfect sense that as they approach the retirement years, they will do a lot of volunteering abroad,"" said Linda George, a professor of sociology specializing in aging at Duke University. Some volunteers also say they are motivated by President Obama's call for change. This month, Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which will pour an estimated $6 billion into volunteerism, including programs for older adults and retirees. Mary Hecht, 66, and her husband Norman Hecht, 68, left their cozy home in New Jersey to embark on a one-week trip this month to save the giant tortoises in the Galapagos Islands. In the midst of packing, she said she is excited to stay with a host family and learn more about the native food and culture. ""I think the older you get, the more set in your ways you become,"" said Hecht, who worked in the education sector for most of her career. ""I think the trip will teach me to be flexible and roll with the punches."" While many volunteers over 50 say there are some drawbacks to volunteering later in life -- such as missing their children and grandchildren back at home --there are many advantages, too. Mature volunteers bring with them valuable life and career experiences, and many countries tend to pay more respect to older people. ""The kinds of things they are struggling with in terms of creating programs are exactly the sorts of things I was previously involved with,"" said 67-year-old Peace Corps volunteer George Stouter, who started in Saint Kitts in the West Indies last fall. He consults on mental health initiatives at a local boys hospital, among many other projects. Stouter worked as a psychiatric social worker in Michigan for 35 years. Greg O'Neill, director of the National Academy on an Aging Society, added that Americans are retiring earlier and living longer, which lends more time to volunteering or making a career change. Darlene Grieger, an 81-year-old grandmother from Arizona, says there are no limits with age. In March 2007, she bid farewell to her five children and 14 grandchildren and went on her first volunteer trip to Costa Rica -- thanks to money donated by her family -- where she volunteered at an orphanage for three months. There, younger volunteers on her program usually called her ""grandmom,"" she said, chuckling. Last fall, she jetted off to Thailand for six weeks to work with a women's group. She did find time to do touristy things between her volunteer duties: Before coming back to the states, she flew on her own to Cambodia to catch a glimpse of Angkor Wat, one of the most famous temples in the world. ""I couldn't even imagine just going on a trip,"" said Grieger, who is planning on selling her home so she can continue volunteering abroad. ""That has to be so boring.""","Applications for the Peace Corps from adults over 50 have spiked 44 percent .

"(CNN) -- Philippines Sen. Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino III announced he will run for president Wednesday, a month after the death of his late mother, the popular former President Corazon Aquino. Philippines Senator Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino III announce his candidacy in Manila on September 9. ""I'm accepting the challenge to lead this fight,"" said Noynoy Aquino, the state-run Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported. Aquino, 49, is the only son of Corazon Aquino, who died on August 1, and the late Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino, a senator who opposed dictator Ferdinand Marcos and was assassinated in 1983 on returning home from exile in the United States. Noynoy Aquino said his mother's supporters had urged him to make a run for the presidency in next May's elections. He said he would continue the fight started by his parents to promote democracy in the Philippines. At least one lawmaker was critical of Aquino's run, PNA said. Rep. Pastor Alcover Jr. said the media has deceived the public by presenting Aquino as the man who can save the country. ""We need a hardworking president,"" Alcover said. ""But the problem is, Noynoy has a dismal performance as congressman for nine years and as senator for three years. Do we want more of his laziness?"" President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's term ends in 2010. Under Philippine law, she cannot run again. Arroyo first took office in 2001.

"(CNN) -- Singer Nelly Furtado is trying to cross over in a direction many artists don't ordinarily take. Singer Nelly Furtado says she enjoys diversity in music and broadening her fan base. With ""Mi Plan,"" the Grammy Award-winning singer is taping into a brand new market and fan base, almost a decade after she came to fame in 2000 with the single ""I'm Like a Bird."" While the Canadian-born singer -- whose parents are Portuguese -- has sung in Spanish before, ""Mi Plan"" is the first time she has recorded an entire album in Spanish, a language she said she learned as a teen. It's seems like a natural progression for Furtado, an artist often noted for diversity in her sound. A few years after her breakthrough, Furtado teamed up with superproducer Timbaland for her 2006 album ""Loose,"" a collaboration that gained her scores of hip-hop and R&B fans as well, and spawned hits such as ""Promiscuous"" and ""Say It Right."" ""Mi Plan"" pairs her with a few Spanish-language music artists, including Alex Cuba, Juan Luis Guerra, Julieta Venegas and La Mala Rodriguez, as well as English-language artist Josh Groban. The first single off the album, ""Manos Al Aire,"" made history as it marked the first time a North American artist reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart with a song that was originally written in Spanish, rather than a translated version of an English-language song. Furtado spoke with CNN about her passion for Spanish, why she feels like an artist reborn and the career path she hopes to take. CNN: What was the inspiration for the new album? Nelly Furtado: There were so many inspirations. The language was the biggest inspiration. I've sang so much in Spanish in the past, and also Portuguese. I get a lot of joy in singing in Latin languages. It expresses the Latin side of me.  Watch Furtado talk about her new album » . My parents were born in Portugal and they raised us in Canada. We grew up speaking Portuguese and then I learned Spanish at the age of 14. I love being a multicultural artist, I love being a global artist. [The album] is almost like a literal reflection of that this time in the fact that it's all in Spanish and it's a completely original project written from scratch. CNN: So it's all new? Furtado: Yes. It feels like a rebirth of sorts. It's almost like a parallel world where I get to reinvent myself again as an artist, but in a very whole kind of way. It's been a lot of fun. CNN: You have such a loyal fan base. What do you hope they get from your latest project? Furtado: Just because I have collaborated with so many different people with so many different styles of music that I think my sort of goal or mantra my whole career has been to broaden the minds of my fan base. This album is just an extension of that. I'm an inclusive person and everyone is invited to the fiesta. I'm excited because I am meeting brand new fans for the first time who don't have any of my prior albums. Four albums in, it's a tough job to try to attract new fans and I think that's what I am doing with this new music. CNN: Did you consider it risky to do a Spanish-language album? Furtado: I like to take risks. I live for risk taking and challenges. I just find it so much more exciting and it keeps my job entertaining and interesting. Everyone is looking for that next challenge at work. Everyone wants that extra credential on their business card. If it's easy, it's not fun. CNN: How is performing in Spanish different? Furtado: When I express myself in Spanish or in Portuguese I feel very free. There are a lot of things you can say in a Spanish song that you can't say in an English song, especially from a feminine perspective. As a female, the moment you sing too passionately in English you are kind of labeled as an angry singer. In Spanish that doesn't happen. You can be dramatic as you want and it's accepted. So it's liberating. CNN: There are a lot of Spanish-speaking artists who want to cross over into the English-language market. How does it feel to be doing the reverse? Furtado: I think I'm capitalizing a little bit on the inroads I have already made in the Latin world through working with other established Latin acts. I dabbled in Spanish on my third album. I had two records on there in Spanish and I really enjoyed writing them and playing them live. I'm just going where my heart's at and following the passions. CNN: What's next for you? Furtado: It's interesting because when I got off the road from touring with my third album, ""Loose,"" I was exhausted. I tried to write some songs in English and no inspiration really came to me. Then I started writing songs in Spanish and it started flowing, so this album has been like a medicine of sorts. I'm so excited about music now. I can't wait to put out another project in English and further Spanish albums as well as Portuguese. The list is never-ending.","Nelly Furtado's new album is sung completely in Spanish .

"(CNN)  -- The U.S. Coast Guard Sunday continues its search for a missing sailor whose five Texas A&M University crew mates were hoisted out of the Gulf of Mexico earlier in the day after their sailboat capsized. Members of the Texas A&M Offshore Sailing Team are shown in this photo from the team's Web site. The survivors -- four university students and a safety officer -- told the Coast Guard they were forced off their sailboat after it took on water and capsized. ""The flooding was so fast that the thing flipped over,"" USGS Capt. William Diehl told CNN. The missing sailor has been identified by the university as Roger Stone, the vessel's second safety officer. The sailboat, named Cynthia Woods, was one of about two dozen boats heading from Galveston, Texas, to Veracruz, Mexico, for the annual Veracruz Regatta race, which began on Friday. Diehl said the boat was well-stocked with safety equipment -- including emergency radio beacons, life rafts and ring buoys -- but the crew could only manage to find four life jackets after the boat tipped over. ""The survivors told us that [when] they went into the water, they had four life jackets among the five, and they huddled together and they exchanged the life jacket among them so that they could stay afloat,"" Diehl said. Communication with the boat was lost about midnight Friday, and the boat missed its 8 a.m. radio check the next morning, the Coast Guard reported. A sailboat matching the description of the missing 38-foot boat was found overturned about 5:15 p.m. Saturday, authorities said. The five survivors were found several hours later, lifted to safety by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter around 1 a.m. and taken to University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston for treatment. A Coast Guard spokeswoman could not say exactly where the survivors were rescued, but said the search was focused on an area about 10 miles south of Matagorda, Texas. Diehl said a Marine Corps C-130, a Coast Guard cutter and a man-of-war naval vessel are searching for the missing crew member. All the mariners were experienced sailors, he said. ""They were very well trained,"" Diehl said. ""Obviously [they were] the more senior cadets at the university here, and they had very experienced safety people on board."" When rescuers retrieved the capsized boat's hull, Diehl said the keel was missing. ""That's the part that keeps the sailboat balanced in the water,"" he said. ""And from talking to the survivors this morning, that's where the flooding started for them."" The 725-mile Veracruz regatta began on Friday and boats are expected to arrive in Veracruz on Wednesday and Thursday.","Coast Guard rescues five sailors reported missing; search continues for sixth sailor .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 14 people were killed and dozens more were wounded in explosions across Iraq on Saturday, officials said. A woman adjusts a memorial of plastic flowers this week at the bombed Foreign Affairs Ministry building. Nine police officers were killed and 19 wounded in a suicide bombing north of Baghdad on Saturday morning, local officials said. The incident occurred in the Salaheddin province town of al-Shirqat. Local police said the suspected bomber had been driving a minivan near the outer checkpoint of a police base. The bomber detonated when police opened fire, police said. Twenty shops and dozens of cars were damaged. Later in the evening, a motorcycle rigged with explosives detonated outside a busy coffee shop in a southeastern Baghdad district called New Baghdad, killing two and wounding 13 others, according to the Ministry of Interior. The attack occurred about 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) as people had gathered to break their fast for Islam's holy month of Ramadan. In other violence Saturday, at least three people were killed and 40 wounded when a roadside bomb detonated in a marketplace in northern Iraq, an Interior Ministry official said. The bomb detonated in the town of Sinjar, a predominantly Yazidi town west of Mosul near the Syrian border. Yazidis are a minority group mainly concentrated in Iraq's north and have been often targeted by insurgents. The deadliest attack since the start of the war was in August 2007, when coordinated truck bombs hit Yazidi villages, killing more than 500 and wounding hundreds. Despite the improved security situation across the country, there has been a spike in attacks in recent weeks. Last week, two massive suicide truck bombs hit the foreign and finance ministries in Baghdad, killing at least 100 people and wounding hundreds more. The attacks come at a time when Iraqi security forces have come under a lot of criticism after they took control of security in cities and towns after the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces two months ago. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Nine police officers killed, 19 hurt in suicide attack in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson ended a trip to the Ivory Coast on Friday, after he spoke to leaders from the nation's political parties and was honored as a prince by a tribe in the West African nation. Jesse Jackson says ceremony to name him a prince of the Agni people was ""very exciting."" Jackson said he met with President Laurent Gbagbo and leading members of two opposition parties, Henri Konan Bedie and Alassane Ouattara. Bedie is a former president of the nation and Ouattara is a former prime minister. Jackson said his mission was not to endorse a candidate, ""but a process."" ""I wanted the three of them to agree ... [to] campaign vigorously ... not to create divisive language, to each agree to support the winner, [and] end the [U.N.] sanctions,"" he said. ""I think there's a common agreement on these points. This country has so much to offer the world and Africa."" The United Nations imposed sanctions on the nation in 2004, among them, a ban on arms and diamond trades, a travel ban and asset freezes for some individuals. The sanctions, renewed last year, are in effect until October 29. Earlier in Jackson's trip, Amon N'Douffou V, king of the Krindjabo kingdom, named Jackson a prince of the Agni people, news reports said. Jackson said it was a ""very exciting ceremony."" Jackson's wife, Jacqueline, suffered a broken leg during the trip when a stage she and her husband were on collapsed, Jackson told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We had excellent medical care,"" the pastor said, adding that the collapse was ""not the fault of the organizers,"" but that too many people had gathered on the stage. Official news agency Agence Ivoirienne de Presse reported that the stage collapse occurred in a sports complex in Yopougon, north of Abidjan. A doctor was to accompany them on their Friday night flight back to the United States, Jackson said. The coming elections in the Ivory Coast are being closely watched by U.N. officials. In a July 30 statement, the U.N. Security Council said ""any postponement of the elections of 29 November would be inconsistent with a credible process"" and with a peace agreement that had followed an armed rebellion in 2002 that had divided the country in two. The Security Council said it would review progress toward elections before October 15. In March, U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said the ""United States believes that long-delayed presidential elections are still technically possible in 2009 and calls on all parties to take every step necessary to ensure that credible elections go forward as promised."" The statement said more than 5.7 million people had been enrolled as voters on a ""preliminary basis.""","Coming elections in the Ivory Coast are being closely watched by U.N. officials .

"(CNN) -- The box office fright flick ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" earned $23 million and a second-place ranking the first weekend of its release, satiating the moviegoer appetite for psychological thrills. Carmen Reed's family lived in a former funeral home.  Their stories inspired ""The Haunting in Connecticut."" But what is entertainment for many was reportedly true life for Carmen Reed, who insists on using her maiden name to protect her children and grandchildren. Reed, her husband and four children rented an old colonial home in Southington, Connecticut, in the mid-1980s in order to be close to a hospital where her 13-year-old son was receiving cancer treatment. Soon after, two nieces also joined them in the house that they learned had once been a funeral home. It wasn't long before that son began telling stories about noises he'd heard and visions he'd seen, including the one of the ""tall, thin man with long jet-black hair"" whom the boy said he saw every night, Reed said. ""I was the biggest skeptic of all,"" she explained. ""I put my son in a mental hospital because I didn't believe him.""  Watch Reed talk about life in a haunted house » . Reed sat down with CNN to talk about the spooky stories that later became her own and how what her family experienced inspired a blockbuster film. CNN: Tell me more about sending your son to a mental institution, where he arrived in a straitjacket and where you say he stayed for 45 days. Why did you do this, and what happened next? Carmen Reed: At first I thought it was his cancer treatment. ... I took him to a psychologist, but he got darker and darker. And this one time, he got so bad, he attacked my niece. ... An ambulance came and took him to a mental hospital. ... He was saying, ""Mom, don't leave me! It's going to come after you now."" And it did. CNN: You mentioned seeing a hand that grasped your niece and that mop water would turn a deep, dark red. What are some other things you saw or heard? Reed: Mattresses would breathe. They had a pulse. ... There was the normal banging on walls, but it always came in threes. ... There was a deep, gravelly voice. CNN: And yet you stayed for two years! If what you were experiencing didn't drive you to move away, what did? Reed: I couldn't go to the grocery store without people telling me their ghost stories. I was usually there for three hours. CNN: You talk about how you read from the Bible in an attempt to drive away demons. How did your experiences in this home influence your faith? Reed: I've learned that most people just believe in this physical world. Some people question if there is a God or angels or demons. I don't need to question that. I found that answer in this house. CNN: Are you still haunted by your experiences in that home? Reed: I do dream about it, and I remember things, but one of the biggest mottos I have is ""Be not afraid."" When people are afraid to go somewhere, I'll go into the deepest, darkest part of it because I know I'm not alone. CNN: You've consulted on this new film and are writing a book about your story. Why do you insist on using your maiden name? Reed: To protect my children. ... My daughter was more scarred by the publicity than she was by the house. And I have 11 grandchildren, and I want to protect them. CNN: What lesson do you hope people will take away from the film and the increased exposure to what you experienced in that Connecticut home? Reed: Leave the occult alone. You think you can control it, but it's going to backfire on you.","Big-screen thriller ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" is based on true story .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Army ground commanders in Afghanistan say they need help, fast. That's not a request for more troops, but a request from commanders who say the current camouflage uniform is not blending well in the diverse countryside. U.S. Army commanders in Afghanistan say the current uniform does not blend well in the countryside. In response, the Army later this month will field-test two new camouflage color schemes and patterns on about 1,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, where the terrain is extremely varied. Commanders have had problems there because of the numerous changes in environments a soldier can move in and out of in a short period of time -- from woodland to desert to alpine, and to rocky and snowy mountain tops. The current uniform, known as the Army Combat Uniform or ACU, has lighter shades of green and tan, which some commanders have complained does not blend well if soldiers need to stay motionless on a mission, as snipers or reconnaissance troops must. The effort by the Army was recently accelerated, according to Army officials, after U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, told the Army he had a number of complaints from soldiers in Afghanistan who said the current camouflage pattern was not effective in the mountainous regions. Two yet-to-be-identified battalions -- a battalion has about 500 troops -- will test the two patterns, with initial results being turned into Army researchers by the end of October. While deployed, all 1,000 soldiers will have their regularly issued ACUs. In addition, one battalion will also get one of the new camouflage uniforms with a test pattern known as ""MultiCam."" The pattern is made up of numerous blobs of white, brown, tan, black and greens for a more woodland look, and is already being worn by snipers and special operations forces. The other brigade will test a similar pattern to the ACU, called the Universal Cammo Pattern-Delta or ""UCP-Delta."" While the pattern is the same, a series of ""digitized"" blocks of green and tan, the test uniform adds what he Army calls ""coyote brown"" and a slight color darkening all around to the greens and tans. The look is also designed to blend in the woods. Both battalions will be based in eastern Afghanistan where the terrain is the most rugged and diverse, Army officials said. The Army hopes to have the field input and a decision on what pattern is best by the end of January 2010 and the fielding of the new uniform as early as June 2010. Troops will still keep the existing ACU, and commanders will be able to decide mission by mission what the soldiers should wear, according to Army officials. The testing is part of the Army's long-term development of a permanent alternative to the current ACU, according to Army officials.","Commanders say current uniform doesn't blend well in Afghanistan's countryside .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- One year after the collapse of banking stalwart Lehman Brothers, the administrator of its European business says the full impact on creditors may not be known until 2010. One year ago cameras caught shocked Lehman Brothers' employees leaving the building with boxes. Tony Lomas, a partner for PricewaterhouseCoopers, has been sorting through the financial remains of the banking giant's European division since last September, when it became clear the bank would file for bankruptcy. He says administrators are still some months from finalizing the total amount owed to Lehman's creditors. ""That will come at some point, maybe in the course of calendar 2010,"" Lomas said. ""But up until that point we won't know the quantum of claims are. We have very complex trading relationships with a very large proportion of our counterparties. And we've got six thousand or so live counterparties out there.""  Watch the full interview with Tony Lomas » . Within a week of Lehman's collapse, Lomas sold Lehman's equity trading business to Nomura. The deal saw about half of Lehman's 5,000 employees in Europe move over to the Japanese investment bank. The agreement didn't include Lehman's trading positions, the infrastructure, the intellectual property, or the building. ""One of the big reasons why we retained the infrastructure here was because we knew we were going to be dependent on it for many years to come because of the complexity of what we were unraveling,"" Lomas said. Some 400 to 500 Lehman's staff still work in the London office for its administrators, poring through trading records and unwinding complex financial positions. ""We expect a significant number of those people to be with us for a reasonably significant time to work through all this,"" Lomas said. Among those who lost their jobs from Lehman Brothers, some such as former employee Caroline White, have turned their backs on the financial sector. White has since forged a new career in fashion and plans to unveil her first piece on Tuesday night. The former banker hasn't put her last career completely behind her. Her collection includes a laptop bag with the Lehman's logo. ""I themed it with a Lehman's theme because I think its quite appropriate. I wanted to show where I have come from, and where I am going,"" the designer said. The future is less clear for the London-based administrators who say their job will not be done for several years. ""This could well take more than 10 years to resolve, all the issues,"" Lomas said. ""By that time, it will outdate me."" He is confident creditors will receive some of their money. In the past year the administrators have recouped $9 billion dollars in cash, most of which has been invested in government-backed securities. ""Our priority is to keep it safe and make sure we don't lose it,"" Lomas said. One year on, he said the job hasn't become any easier. ""Reflecting back on the astonishment if you like of being appointed administrator here in the UK and contemplating what lay ahead of us, I don't think I underestimated or understated the complexity of the task. It has proved to be every bit of that."" ""There remains a very significant amount of complex still work to do,"" he added. CNN's Jim Boulden contributed to this report .","Lehman administrator in Europe says significant amount of work still to do .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- African governments have stopped importing Chinese dairy products as the crisis which has seen more than 52,000 Chinese children poisoned by melamine-tainted goods spreads. Burundi, Gabon and Tanzania have joined governments closer to China -- including Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia -- in banning Chinese dairy products. At least 11 countries have banned imports. The precautions come as the number of affected children in China continues to swell. Four babies have died from melamine-tainted infant formula and more than 52,000 children have fallen ill, Chinese authorities say. ""I think we will see more cases, but it is, of course, impossible to predict how many cases there finally will be,"" said Hans Troedsson, the the World Health Organization's China representative. ""We have to remember that China is a large country with a population of 1.3 billion people. However, of course, 40- to 50,000 children are affected as reported now. It's a staggering figure, but where we will end up is too early yet to say."" On Monday, China's top quality control official, Li Changjiang, resigned as a result of the scandal, which has seen the arrest of at least 18 people. Two brothers arrested last week on charges of selling contaminated milk could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper. The raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down and the chemical melamine was added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said.  Watch CNN visit the company at the center of the scandal » . Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Beijing hospitals and a supermarket to show his concern. China's Health Ministry said about 13,000 children were hospitalized, while another 40,000 had undergone outpatient treatment. ""What we need to do now is to ensure that nothing like this happens in the future, not only in dairy products, but in all foods,"" he said. ""Manufacturers and owners of dairy companies should show more morality and social responsibility in these cases. They are heartless, so we have to create strict law and legislation. I'm sorry.""  Watch how Beijing is under pressure over public safety » . The repercussions from the scandal were felt as far away as Africa. Burundi imports milk products from two suspect Chinese companies and the government has set up a commission to investigate how much tainted product could remain on store shelves, officials said. ""For the moment, nobody knows if the milk is being sold on the Burundi market,"" Noel Nkurunziza, president of a Burundi consumer association known as ABUCO, is quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper and other publications. In Asia, Singapore announced a recall of all Chinese milk products on Tuesday. The head of Indonesia's Food Safety Watch said she was instituting a temporary ban of all milk imports from China, although contaminated milk has not been found in the country. In issuing its recall of milk products, Singapore had already suspended the import and sale of milk and dairy products from China on Friday, after it said it has found traces of melamine in three Chinese-made dairy products. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said ""White Rabbit Creamy Candy"" was ordered off of shelves after tests showed it was contaminated. White Rabbit is among the best-known candy brands in China and one of the few exported widely. The United States is among 40 nations that import the candy, a man in the administrative office of the Shanghai-based company told CNN Monday. Earlier, Singapore's agri-food agency said it found melamine in two other milk-based Chinese imports: the Yili brand ""Choice Dairy Fruit Bar Yoghurt Flavored Ice Confection"" and the Dutch Lady brand of strawberry-flavored milk. In Bangladesh, three Chinese powdered milk brands -- Sanlu, Suncare and Yashili -- have been taken off shelves and all milk powder imports at Bangladeshi ports will be inspected. Bangladeshi TV showed the country's Rapid Action Battalion climbing over a fence to raid a storage facility believed to contain tainted milk. In Malaysia, Health Minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai announced that import of Chinese milk products had been stopped. In addition to banning imports, thousands of tons of tainted milk powder have been recalled. In the Philippines Monday, the country's Bureau of Food and Drugs banned the distribution and selling of two brands of imported Chinese milk that could possibly be tainted, the Philippines News Agency reported. The milk brands were Yili and China Mengniu Diary Company, the agency reported. One of the implicated Chinese plants is operated by a subsidiary of the Marudai Food Co. in Japan. Marudai said it was recalling five types of products from the plant, would halt operations there for one month, and will send employees to the subsidiary to examine quality controls. The factory will be shut down through October 19. Even some countries that don't import Chinese dairy products, such as Malaysia and Brunei, have banned milk products from China. In Hong Kong, concerned parents have swamped hospitals. A 3-year-old Hong Kong girl was reported this weekend as the first case outside of mainland China. The girl was treated for kidney stones at Princess Margaret Hospital and released, Hong Kong's government Web site reported. Her condition is being monitored.  Watch the public outcry faced by the Chinese government » . A second child, a 4-year-old boy, had similar renal symptoms, the government reported Monday. The boy, a Hong Kong native, had consumed milk products contaminated with melamine and was diagnosed with a kidney stone in mainland China, the Department of Health said. He was treated at Princess Margaret on Monday and was in stable condition. The hospital said Monday it has provided medical consultation to 63 people who might have consumed contaminated milk products.

"(CNN)  -- Water pressure is restored and it is now safe to drink in a Baltimore suburb where a huge water main burst, sending torrents of muddy water coursing over neighborhood streets and down highway ramps, officials said. Muddy water envelops the community of Dundalk, Maryland, on Friday. Many were left without power. ""A bad situation is well in hand,"" Baltimore County chief executive Jim Smith said during a press conference Saturday morning. Crews were still at work inspecting homes and clearing water from flooded basements, he said, ""but the danger is over, the crisis is over."" A prestressed concrete water pipe burst late Friday afternoon under a road in the suburban Baltimore community of Dundalk. The 72-inch-wide main was shut about two hours after it ruptured, Smith said. No injuries were reported, Smith said, and knee-high to chest-high water had been reduced to 4 inches. Resident David Johnson said he felt helpless as he stood outside his house and watched the dirty brown water creep up his lawn and approach his front door. It stopped, inches away, and his basement stayed dry. The worst part now is the sewage smell, he said. Local public works officials said at least 39 basements in the area were flooded.  See water main break damage » . Shannon Woerner was at home in nearby Essex, Maryland, when he heard the news about the water main break and the call for boats. He loaded his kayak in his truck and headed to the scene. ""I just wanted to see if I could help,"" he said. Woerner said he delivered car keys and other items across flooded streets to people who couldn't get to their homes. Mike Pell, 34, watched the water slowly recede after the main was shut. Water covered the wheels of his pickup. ""My basement's done,"" he said, pointing to his shoulder to show the height of the water inside. He and his fiancee had a bedroom in the basement. ""All of our clothes are ruined,"" he said. He managed to get his two children, ages 2 and 3, to a dry area on the first floor of the house. ""Now I wonder who's gonna pay for this. We don't have flood insurance; this area doesn't flood,"" Pell said, shaking his head. Samantha Hansley, 21, could only watch from a dry hill and wonder if her truck would survive the flood. It sat in 2 feet of water a block away. Hansley and her boyfriend had been driving out of the floodwaters when they stopped to try to help some stranded drivers. ""Our truck just died,"" she said. A manager at the Box and Save grocery store about a block away from the break said the entire parking lot was flooded. Cathy Geisler said customers were still in the store Friday afternoon when police arrived to tell everyone except for essential personnel to evacuate. ""We were still doing business, then the electricity went out and we escorted everyone out of the store,"" Geisler said. Aerial video from CNN affiliates WMAR and WBAL showed a collapsed roadway covered by torrents of water. Entire neighborhoods had flooded streets, and some residents were evacuated, authorities said. Eric Braughman, who lives on one of the flooded streets, said he had ""thought something was up"" with the water Thursday when his faucets discharged orange-brown water. ""My wife didn't give the baby a bath because it didn't look safe,"" Braughman said. Nearly 1,000 customers were without power, according to Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.'s Web site. The main break is part of a larger issue with failing infrastructure in many U.S. cities, said Kurt Kocher, a spokesman for Baltimore's Department of Public Works. Kocher cited two other huge main breaks in the Maryland and Washington area that were started from the same type of pipe that burst in Friday's incident. ""This is a national infrastructure crisis,"" Kocher said. CNN's Alec Miran in Dundalk, Maryland, contributed to this report.","Water is safe to drink; pressure has been restored .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Kanye West called Taylor Swift with a ""very sincere"" apology Tuesday for interrupting her acceptance speech at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, Swift said. Kanye West called Taylor Swift to apologize for hijacking her speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West phoned Swift following her appearance on ABC's ""The View"" Tuesday, her publicist said. Swift talked about it in a radio interview with ABC. ""Kanye did call me and he was very sincere in his apology,"" she said. ""And I accepted that apology."" The apology came the morning after West, in an interview with Jay Leno, appeared to blame the pain of his mother's death two years ago for his ""rude"" behavior. The rapper told Leno he would now ""take some time off"" to think about how he will ""make it through the rest of this life."" West's appearance on the prime-time premiere of ""The Jay Leno Show"" capped a 24-hour period that began Sunday evening with him strolling down the red carpet at New York's Radio City Music Hall while gulping from a bottle of cognac. The low-light came about an hour later, when West jumped onstage and grabbed the microphone from Swift as she accepted the Best Female Video award. West declared that Beyonce Knowles should have won. West appeared sober and humble when he spoke on Leno's Los Angeles stage Monday, an appearance that was originally to be just musical.  Watch West give an emotional interview to Leno » . ""I immediately knew in this situation that it was wrong,"" West told Leno. ""And it wasn't a spectacle, you know. It was actually someone's emotions, you know, that I stepped on and it was very, it was just, it was rude, period."" When Leno asked West what his mother would have thought of his behavior, he fell silent for more than a dozen seconds and appeared near tears. Leno pressed him again. ""Would she be disappointed in this? Would she give you a lecture?"" West gave a rambling, emotional answer: . ""Yeah, you know, obviously, you know, I deal with hurt and, you know, so many, you know, celebrities, they never take the time off, and I've never taken the time off to really, you know, I just, music after music and tour after tour on tour, and I'm just ashamed that my hurt caused someone else's hurt."" West said he wasn't trying to justify his behavior, ""because I was just in the wrong. That's clear."" ""But I need to, after this, just to take some time off and analyze how I'm going to, you know, make it through rest of this life, how I'm going to improve,"" he said. ""Because, I am a celebrity and that's something I have to deal with."" He said he would like to personally apologize to Swift, a 19-year-old pop-country singer. ""And if there's anything I can do to help Taylor in the future or help anyone, I want to live this thing. It's hard sometimes, so."" After his four-minute talk with Leno, West joined fellow hip-hop superstars Jay-Z and Rihanna to perform ""Run This Town,"" a song they recorded together. The timing of West's antics came at a good time for Leno, who embarked on a new era of his career Monday. After 17 years of hosting ""The Tonight Show,"" Leno debuted his 10 p.m. weeknight talk show on NBC. Apologies from celebrities behaving badly have boosted Leno's ratings. In 1995, Leno enjoyed a ratings-grabbing moment when he asked actor Hugh Grant, ""What the hell were you thinking?"" Grant had been arrested two weeks earlier for public lewd conduct with a Hollywood hooker. When Grant told Leno ""I did a bad thing,"" it gave Leno's ""Tonight Show"" a viewership bump that has been credited with solidifying his lead over rival David Letterman in the late-night ratings war. This is just the kind of ""immediacy"" Leno was talking about in a call with reporters last week. ""The idea here is that we'll tape a new, fresh show every single day, talking about the events that happened that day that night,"" Leno said. Jerry Seinfeld also appeared on Leno's premiere Monday.","Kanye West reaches out to Taylor Swift to apologize .

"Sunny Hostin is a legal analyst on CNN's ""American Morning."" Hollywood private eye Anthony Pellicano represented himself at his federal trial. The jury's still out. NEW YORK (CNN) -- There's a courthouse adage: A person who represents himself has a fool for a client. When a defendant utters those tragic words, ""I'm going to represent myself,"" judges blanch, attorneys snicker, and even the court reporters grimace. I've been on the opposite side of those who have chosen to represent themselves. It wasn't pleasant. Since 1975, when the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment ""grants to the accused personally the right to make his own defense,"" many defendants have decided to take the law literally into their own hands. The most recent self-represented ""client"" is Anthony Pellicano, the Hollywood private investigator who's been on trial for 78 counts lodged against him and two co-defendants. Pellicano's jury has been out for a week, so it's not yet clear whether the outcome of his case will follow the conventional wisdom. The 64-year-old celebrity sleuth is accused of leading a criminal enterprise that raked in more than $2 million by illegally spying, allegedly using wiretaps and law enforcement databases, on Hollywood's rich and famous. He then dished the dirt to their rivals. If convicted of leading a criminal conspiracy, known as a RICO charge, he could spend up 20 years to life in prison. RICO, by the way, stands for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It's the law the Justice Department used to bring down the mob. Prosecutors have to prove that Pellicano and his co-defendants ran a corrupt enterprise that profited from information they obtained illegally. U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer granted Pellicano's request to represent himself, but she wasn't too happy about it. ""If the U.S. Supreme Court didn't require me to let defendants represent themselves, I wouldn't do it,"" she said. Even without a law degree, Pellicano seemed to realize that getting the jury to acquit him of the conspiracy charge was important. During his 15-minute closing argument, he denied he led a criminal enterprise and insisted that he acted as a ""lone ranger"" while gathering information for his clients. He also told the jurors that he shared no information with colleagues as he conducted investigations and allowed others to learn only what he wanted them to know. ""There was no criminal enterprise or conspiracy. Mr. Pellicano alone is responsible. That is the simple truth,"" he said, referring to himself in the third person. But unlike a seasoned attorney, he failed to address the evidence against him, including illegally taped conversations. Instead, he bragged about his career, while wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, saying of himself, again in the third person: ""Perhaps his business card should read, 'I deliver,' because he did it over and over again."" Courtroom observers said his ""cross-examination"" often consisted of little more than settling old scores. So is Pellicano a fool, or absolutely brilliant? Well, if history is our teacher, he would do better if he had a lawyer, even a bad one. If you have a bad lawyer and you get convicted, you can always argue on appeal that your lawyer was ineffective and get a new trial. The following self-appointed lawyers learned the hard way that they had fools for clients: . In fact, I can't think of a defendant who represented himself or herself as well, or better, than a lawyer. So maybe I'm biased, but lawyers are trained professionals. We're trained in the art of trial war. Let us do our jobs.","Private eye Anthony Pellicano chose to represent himself at his trial .

"Editor's Note: This story details how two members of the CNN Special Investigations Unit reported a story about controversial plans to spend $31 million to enhance two remote crossings on the border between the United States and Canada. The road to the border was so quiet it was safe for Drew Griffin to sit in the middle of it. SCOBEY, Montana (CNN) -- We were driving through some of the most remote country in the United States, chasing a story that seemed hard to believe. The Department of Homeland Security had announced it was spending $31 million to enhance and upgrade two remote border crossings -- just 12 miles apart -- on the border between Montana and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The spending was lauded by Montana's two senators, even though only an average of 22 cars a day traveled through these border posts. We hopped a plane from Atlanta, Georgia, to Billings, Montana, and then headed to Scobey and Whitetail. The six-hour drive took us through some of this nation's most beautiful country into the high plains of the Missouri River Region. It was a drive punctuated with glimpses of cows and antelopes, but few people. In fact, Burl Bowler, editor of the Daniels County Leader newspaper, which serves the border towns, advised us where to stop for gas en route, so we wouldn't run out and then really be in trouble. Besides seeing a part of the country where Lt. Col. George Custer took his last stand, there was the added benefit (sorry CNN management) of having no phone or Blackberry access. In that respect, it was a peaceful drive. When we got to Scobey, the few people we encountered couldn't have been nicer. Everyone we passed stopped, said hello, or waved. But encountering people was the problem -- and in fact, the story: We just didn't encounter that many. Certainly not at the border, where we stood and even sat in the middle of the road to show viewers how few people travel to and from Canada here.  Watch just how quiet the border crossing was » . The Scobey border crossing itself seemed perfectly adequate. But the Department of Homeland Security had warned its agents not to allow us inside, so we don't know what the interior is like. If we came in, we would be too disruptive, one government spokesman had informed us. In Scobey, that claim seemed a little far-fetched, since there wasn't anything going on here -- disruptive or otherwise. On the Canadian side, farmer Marc Chabot, a U.S. citizen whose family has farmed the area on both sides of the border for generations, said he was grateful for the money his senators -- Democrats Max Baucus and Jon Tester -- steered to northeast Montana. But, he said, like others in the community, he gasped when he learned of the plan to spend $31 million expanding two border crossings that are rarely used. ""It would be wiser spent on something more useful to the public generally,"" he told us, adding that come winter, the average of 20 cars crossing a day in Scobey drops to almost none. Editor Burl Bowler told us the area could certainly use stimulus money for jobs, but not at the border. We asked both Bowler and Chabot about the possibility of terrorists creeping across the frontier. Both said that after the attacks of September 11, 2001, everyone needed to be more mindful of the porous border. But Chabot said the government had the area fairly well covered. ""Trust me, they know we are here right now,"" he said. And a massive new building costing more than $15 million in Scobey, Montana, wasn't exactly a deterrence to someone set on harming the United States, he added. Chabot joked that any stranger in the area certainly would not be a stranger long, since everyone knew everyone -- a point echoed by Bowler, who pointed out that while he hadn't told many people that CNN was coming to town, everyone seemed to know it anyway. In Whitetail, it was even quieter. The town has grain elevators and a post office. Bureau of Transportation statistics show only about two people a day cross the border there, and the agents' building seemed in good shape, save for maybe needing a paint job. The DHS planned to spend $15 million on the outpost. That would buy a lot more paint than the building seemed to need. So why did these two areas get so much money? Locals and critics suspect politics might have played a role. Baucus is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; Tester is on the Senate's Homeland Security Committee. Both took credit for convincing the DHS to give these towns millions for border crossings, bragging in a joint press release that they pressured the agency. ""This is good news for all of Montana and especially communities across the northern tier,"" Baucus said in the statement. Tester said the spending would ""pay off for generations to come by creating new jobs and opportunity that will benefit all of Montana."" As late as Wednesday, his spokesman reiterated Tester's support of the spending, saying that it would seal security gaps on the border. So, the nagging question: Did politics, rather than security, guide the DHS? Especially when a border town like Laredo, Texas, which sees 66,000 crossings a day, was getting not one dime of the $400 million in DHS border stimulus funds. Montana, in total, was to receive $77 million. In an interview Wednesday with CNN, Trent Frazier, the director of port modernization for the Department of Homeland Security, denied that politics played any role. ""We feel that these ports, like all ports of entry, are a vital part of the network of security that we have established across the border apparatus that we employ across the borders, and the investments we are going to do along these borders are a critical step in ensuring we can perform our mission,"" Frazier said. But if Frazier did not believe politics factored in the decisions, it appeared to play a big role by Wednesday afternoon. Fellow Democrat Sen. Byron Dorgan, from the neighboring state of North Dakota, sent out a news release urging DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to suspend the stimulus program. He said that spending the money on such remote ports -- including the nine in his state -- was ""just nuts."" Dorgan said the plan ""just defied common sense."" Within hours, Napolitano announced she was ordering a 30-day review to see if the money was being spent appropriately. In her letter to Dorgan, Napolitano said 39 of the 43 Custom and Border Protection posts were located in the northern United States. She said most of the Southern ports were owned by the General Services Administration, and the money directed by Congress was earmarked for the Custom and Border Protection properties and required to be spent within 24 months. ""Nonetheless,"" she wrote, ""in order to ensure even further transparency in this process, I am ordering a 30 day review"" of all port construction decisions by officials who did not make the initial allocation decisions. So, for now, if you want to travel to Canada through Scobey or Whitetail, the agents who inspect your vehicles will be using the buildings now in place -- and according to the locals, you will be adequately served.","DHS planned to spend $31 million to upgrade remote border crossings .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- Thousands gathered in the Cuban capital on Sunday to pay their respects to one of Cuba's few remaining original revolutionaries, Juan Almeida, who according to state media died of a heart attack Friday evening. Cubans wait Sunday at Havana's Revolution Plaza to pay respects to deceased Cuban revolutionary Juan Almeida. A single column of people stretched around Havana's Revolution Square in a well-coordinated show of solidarity and remembrance during what state media reported as a national day of mourning. President Raul Castro and other top government officials were reportedly on hand, though elder brother and former Communist leader Fidel Castro -- not seen in public since abdominal surgery in 2006 -- did not make an appearance. Almeida, 82, fought alongside Fidel Castro and was among only a handful of surviving Cuban leaders who still bore the title ""Commander of the Revolution."" Watch as Cubans remember Juan Almeida » . Widely admired among Cuban nationals, Almeida participated in the failed attacks on the Moncada army barracks in 1953. He was aboard the famed yacht ""Granma,"" that carried the small group of Cuban rebels who would later topple U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. A vice president and member of the Communist government Central Committee, Almeida was among only a few black leaders in top government posts. ""This shows how we're all participants in our revolution and there is nothing that sets you apart,"" said Havana resident Fernando, who declined to give his last name. ""Not color, nor religion,"" he added. Almeida's death underscores the mortality of an aging cast of Cuba's revolutionary leaders. Widespread speculation surrounding the health of Fidel Castro grew in 2006 after he underwent abdominal surgery and later ceded the presidency to his younger brother, Raul. The elder Castro recently surfaced in a series of photos and video looking healthier, though he has not appeared in public in over three years.","Cuban revolutionary Juan Almeida died of a heart attack Friday evening .

"(CNN) -- Rielle Hunter, the woman at the center of the John Edwards sex scandal, has been known variously as a spiritual seeker, an aspiring actress, a party girl and a political operative, according to media reports. A video image shows Rielle Hunter arriving at the federal courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, on August 6. Last year, after months of denials, Edwards admitted having an affair with Hunter while he was campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2006. Edwards' campaign paid Hunter $114,000 to make a series of short webisode videos about his presidential campaign, and she traveled extensively with the candidate's entourage. Edwards denies that he is the father of a baby Hunter bore in February 2008, saying the affair was over before she became pregnant. Former Edwards aide Andrew Young claimed the baby was his. But Young later said that the former senator is the father and that his paternity claim had been made at Edwards' request. Hunter has not said who the father is.  Watch Hunter and baby arrive at federal court » . ""Rielle is the black sheep of the family. We were all raised the same way. She chose a different path,"" Hunter's sister, Roxanne Marshall, told People magazine in August 2008. Hunter, born Lisa Druck in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was known for her partying ways as a young adult in New York, novelist Jay McInerney told People. He said Hunter, whom he dated for a while, and her friends inspired his book ""Story of My Life."" After moving to Los Angeles, California, in 1991, she married Alexander Hunter III, according to the Raleigh (North Carolina) News & Observer. They divorced in 2000.  Watch how a scandal might not wreck a career » . Hunter explored New Age spiritualism. She called her co-stars in the play ""Savage in Limbo"" together and burned herbs in the theater ""to clear the space of bad spirits and bring in the good ones,"" actress Elizabeth Dennehy told People. ""But it was all meaningful and earnest."" Hunter changed her first name to Rielle in 1994 because ""it just came to her,"" publicist Pigeon O'Brien, a longtime acquaintance, told People. The movie Web site imdb.com lists Hunter under several names, as a writer, producer and actress, having appeared on screen in four films. She's the co-founder of Midline Groove Productions, a New Jersey-based production company. Hunter told the television show ""Extra"" that she met Edwards by chance in 2006 when she was 42. ""It was a random meeting. He was in a business meeting in New York, and I was in the same place,"" she said. Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, related to talk show host Oprah Winfrey how her husband described the beginning of the affair. ""She was standing in front of the hotel and said to him, 'You are so hot.' I can't deliver it, because I don't know how to deliver such lines,"" she told Winfrey. ""But 'You are so hot' are the words she said to him."" The tabloid National Enquirer first reported in October 2007 that Edwards had engaged in an affair, but he denied it for months. He finally acknowledged the liaison in an August 2008 interview with ABC's ""Nightline"" as the Enquirer's reporting gained momentum, including the publication of a photo the tabloid said showed Edwards holding the baby. Hunter has shunned publicity since the affair became public. She spent an entire day in August at the federal courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina. A federal grand jury is investigating payments to Hunter's production company, but officials would not say whether the grand jury was meeting on the day of Hunter's visit to the courthouse. Since the birth of her daughter, according to ABC, Hunter has assumed aliases and resided in various expensive homes in North Carolina and, more recently, in Santa Barbara, California. Edwards has denied giving any money to Hunter for anything other than her campaign work. Fred Baron, the finance chairman for the Edwards presidential campaign, told ABC that he used his personal resources to help Hunter move out of North Carolina and did not tell Edwards about the assistance, which consisted of access to jets, homes, cars and cash.","Rielle Hunter was party girl who became spiritual, acquaintances say .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A giant oil-trading company is offering to pay thousands of Africans a settlement after a contractor illegally dumped toxic waste in West Africa three years ago. Parents say their child's body is covered in lesions as a result of toxic waste dumped in Ivory Coast in 2006. The United Nations says the 2006 dumping in Ivory Coast killed 15 people and sickened about 100,000 others. Trafigura is offering $1,536 (or 950 British pounds) per person to settle a lawsuit stemming from the dumping of 500 tons of toxic waste off Ivory Coast, or Cote d'Ivoire, a company spokeswoman said Monday. The law firm representing the claimants has said in the past it represents up to 30,000 people, making the settlement potentially worth about $46 million. A judge still must approve the deal before it becomes final. The Trafigura spokeswoman, Alex Nelless of the public relations firm Bell Pottinger, said she did not know if a court date had been set. The Dutch-based company does not admit liability in the settlement and aggressively fought the suit. It threatened to sue media outlets, including the BBC, for its reporting of the case. The British law firm representing the victims Monday refused to comment on any aspect of the case or to confirm the existence of a settlement. Nisha Patel, a spokeswoman for Leigh Day and Co. in London, said she did not know when the firm would be able to comment. Trafigura also sued Leigh Day for libel, a suit that Trafigura said had been ""resolved."" Last week, the United Nations said that Trafigura caused death and injury when the cargo ship Probo Koala dumped 500 tons of toxic waste belonging to the company at sites around Abidjan, Ivory Coast's largest city. ""According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 people were hospitalized and over 100,000 others, complaining of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes, sought medical treatment after the incident,"" said the report released Wednesday by Okechukwu Ibeanu, an unpaid investigator for the Geneva, Switzerland-based U.N. Human Rights Council. The areas where the toxic waste was dumped still have not been decontaminated and continue to threaten residents' health, Ibeanu said last month. Many people, he said, report headaches, skin lesions, digestive difficulties and nose, throat and lung problems, according to a U.N. statement. Trafigura rejects the U.N. findings and said the investigator ignored repeated offers to see the results of the company's own studies. It said 20 experts it had hired did not find a link between ""exposure to the chemicals released from the slops [toxic waste] and deaths, miscarriages, stillbirths, birth defects, loss of visual acuity or other serious and chronic injuries."" It admits that a contractor dumped the toxic waste but denies responsibility. ""It remains Trafigura's position that it did not foresee, and could not have foreseen, the reprehensible acts of Compagnie Tommy in dumping the slops in and around Abidjan in August and September 2006, and that Compagnie Tommy acted entirely independently of, and without any authority from, Trafigura,"" the company said in a statement Saturday. ""Nevertheless, Trafigura regrets that this incident occurred and is pleased that the matter has now been resolved,"" it said. Trafigura said the statement was being issued jointly with Leigh Day and that a court had ordered the law firm to publish the statement on its Web site. CNN could not find the statement on Leigh Day's site, and the firm's spokeswoman declined to say if it was there. ""While we certainly do not accept legal liability, Trafigura regrets the Probo Koala incident and in particular the distress that it caused the local population,"" company director Eric de Turckheim said in a statement. Trafigura says on its Web site that it has ""access to approximately $17 billion in credit facilities and investments ... around the world of more than $1 billion.""","U.N. says 2006 dumping in Ivory Coast killed 15 people, sickened about 100,000 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown publicly apologized for assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna, in a video statement posted on his personal Web site Monday. Chris Brown, shown here at his June 22 court appearance, has publicly apologized in a video posted Monday. ""I have told Rihanna countless times, and I'm telling you today, that I'm truly, truly sorry in that I wasn't able to handle the situation both differently and better,"" Brown said. ""What I did was unacceptable, 100 percent. I can only ask and pray that you forgive me. Please."" Brown, 20, was arrested after an early morning argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February. He admitted guilt to a felony assault charge in June in a plea deal under which he will serve five years of probation and do about 1,400 hours of ""labor-oriented service."" Sentencing is set for August 5. A publicist for Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, has not responded to CNN requests for comment on the apology.  Watch Brown ask for forgiveness » . Brown, in the two-minute video, said he had wanted to ""publicly express my deepest regret and accept full responsibility"" since February, but he remained silent on the advice of his defense lawyer. ""Although I will do some interviews and answer some questions in the future, I felt it was time you heard directly from me that I am sorry,"" he said. ""I have tried to live my life in a way which can make those around me proud of me, and until recently, I think I was doing a pretty good job,"" Brown said. ""I wish I had the chance to relive those few moments again, but unfortunately I can't. I cannot go into what happened, and most importantly, I'm not going to sit here and make any excuses."" The incident began when Rihanna, who was riding in the sports car driven by Brown, found a text message on his cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with,"" according to a sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews. ""A verbal argument ensued,"" followed by the physical attack, the statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched Rihanna numerous times and put her in a headlock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to beat her and kill her, according to the statement, and he bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, ""Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away,"" the statement said. ""A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order."" At the end of his statement, the detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. ""I take great pride in me being able to exercise self-control, and what I did was inexcusable,"" Brown said in his video apology. ""I am very sad and very ashamed of what I've done. My mother and my spiritual teachers have taught me way better than that."" Brown, who lost several product endorsements after his arrest, said he realizes he has ""truly been blessed"" and he intends ""to live my life so that I am truly worthy of the term 'role model.' "" ""As many of you know, I grew up in a home where there was domestic violence, and I saw firsthand what uncontrolled rage can do,"" he said. ""I have sought and I am continuing to seek help to ensure that what occurred in February can never happen again. And as I sit here today, I can tell you that I will do everything in my power to make sure that it never happens again. And I promise that.""

"PINE VALLEY, California (CNN) -- Dozens of America's greatest military heroes are gathered in Chicago, Illinois, possibly the last large gathering of living Medal of Honor recipients. John Finn, 100, at his California ranch, said he was just a dutiful soldier. That ""hero stuff is a bunch crap,"" he said. Among the men with light blue ribbons holding a star around their necks signifying uncommon bravery, will be John Finn. Finn, who received the nation's highest medal for valor for his actions during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, turned 100 this summer, the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient. Finn was stationed at Kanoehe Bay Naval Air Station, where the Japanese struck five minutes before attacking Pearl Harbor, across southeast Oahu Island from Kanoehe Bay. Finn recalled how a neighbor was the first to alert him, when she knocked on his door saying, ""They want you down at the squadron right away!"" Finn saw the first Japanese plane before his car even reached his hangar. ""I put that old car of mine in second gear and wound it up getting down to the hangar where I could be where my guns and ammunition were,"" Finn said. One of the first things he did was take control of a machine gun from his squadron's painter. ""I said, 'Alex, let me take that gun,' "" Finn explained. ""I knew that I had more experience firing a machine gun than a painter."" ""I got that gun and I started shooting at Jap planes,"" Finn said in the salty language not uncommon among veterans of that long-ago war. But Finn's machine gun was right out in the open, nothing protecting him from the attacking pilots. ""I was out there shooting the Jap planes and just every so often I was a target for some,"" Finn said. ""They were Japanese fighter plane pilots. I can remember seeing, in some cases, I could see their faces.""  Watch John Finn's give his account of his actions on December 7, 1941 » . He was wounded in the head, the arm, the hand and the foot, but Finn fought on, a one-man counterattack to the surprise air raid that pulled America into World War II. Finn talked to CNN at his ranch in the desert east of San Diego, California. He surrounds himself with reminders of his life -- his entire life, not just that one infamous day out of 100 years. There are pictures of his wife, Alice, who married him before Pearl Harbor and was by his side until 1998. The hillside outside his home is covered with old cars, old trucks and even an old military ambulance. But the first thing one notices when visiting Finn's ranch is the sign at the road, with a painting of his medal next to his name. The citation for his Medal of Honor tells that part of his story: . ""He continued to man this gun and to return the enemy's fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal safety. It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention. Following first-aid treatment, although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great difficulty, he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised the rearming of returning planes,"" the citation stated. With Japanese still attacking, getting his wounds treated wasn't a priority, Finn said. ""Medical help comes later. If you're busy shooting a machine gun or a rifle or a pistol or doing anything, you can't worry about getting medical attention,"" he explained. Less than a year later, Finn, out of the hospital and recovered from his wounds, was back on duty with the Navy in Hawaii. Adm. Chester Nimitz presented Finn with the Medal of Honor for his bravery, joining the ranks of the men, and one woman, recognized with the nation's highest award for heroism. These days most medals are awarded at the White House, but with the war heating up, such a long trip was out of the question. In fact, his first visit to the White House came in the spring when President Obama invited him for a visit. Back at his ranch, Finn bristled when asked about being called a ""hero."" ""That damned hero stuff is a bunch crap, I guess. Well, it is one thing that I think any man that is in that, you gotta be in that position,"" Finn said. ""You gotta understand that there's all kinds of heroes, but they never get a chance to be in a hero's position."" Fewer than 100 men who have received the Medal of Honor are alive today. More than half of them are expected in Chicago this week for the annual Congressional Medal of Honor Society Convention. But because they are all veterans of World War II, Korea or Vietnam, their ranks are shrinking every year. The men from more recent conflicts, like Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, were all awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. And this week, while many of those living recipients gather in Chicago, Obama will present the latest Medal of Honor at the White House to a soldier who fought and died heroically in Afghanistan.","In Pearl Harbor attack, John Finn was wounded in head and limbs but fought on .

"(CNN) -- Park Ji-Sung made history this year when the Manchester United midfielder became the first Korean to appear in the final of the European Champions League. Manchester United's Park Ji-Sung in action for his club. The 28-year-old finished on the losing side in May, after Alex Ferguson's team were beaten 2-0 by Spain's Barcelona on the night, but for Park, his inclusion in the starting eleven represented a significant achievement. CNN will be traveling to the Red Devils' training ground on September 21 to speak to Park about his life, and we're giving you the chance to question the man himself. What do you want to ask Park Ji-Sung? When it comes to Asian football, there's no bigger star than Park Ji-Sung.

Yet when he signed for Manchester United from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, some unfairly thought that it was a mere sop, a marketing tool for Manchester United to sell more replica shirts.  Check out CNN's Park Ji-Sung gallery. » . But Ferguson has had other ideas, picking Park for some of United's most important games. ""He has developed his tactical and technical ability and he has become a very important player for us,"" Ferguson told a press conference during United's summer tour of Korea. ""He has had a fantastic career with us."" That career has seen him earn a Champions League winner's medal, numerous Premier League titles and a fourth place finish at the 2002 World Cup finals. If anything this year has been his best yet. Following last season's English Premier League title, and a start in this year's Champions League final, he led South Korea to the 2010 World Cup finals, scoring a late goal against Iran to secure their automatic qualification for South Africa. To confirm his status, he has just signed a two-year extension at United. And now CNN are offering you the chance to put your questions to arguably Asia's greatest player.

"(CNN)  -- A legally insane killer who escaped in Washington state during a field trip to a fair was recaptured Sunday, the Spokane County Sheriff's Department said. Authorities combed Washington state for Phillip Paul, a killer who escaped Thursday during a field trip. Phillip Paul, who was on the run for three days, had been planning the break for ""at least the last several months,"" Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich said at a news conference. Paul was recaptured at about 4 p.m. PT in Goldendale, Washington, sheriff's Sgt. Dave Reagan said. Goldendale is about 250 miles from the site of Paul's escape from a county fair in Spokane County, Washington. Police received a tip Saturday afternoon that Paul was dropped off by a person he managed to dupe into giving him a ride to Goldendale, Knezovich said. Police spotted him hiding in a wooded area about 100 yards from the drop-off point Sunday and eventually arrested him while he was trying to hitch another ride, Knezovich said. Sheriff's officials told CNN affiliate KREM-TV that Paul also escaped briefly in 1991 and assaulted a law enforcement officer. That same officer was involved in arresting Paul on Sunday, Reagan said. Paul, 47, escaped at around noon Thursday. Though Paul had been confined in a mental institution because of a murder confession, he was allowed to go on the trip to the county fair. Paul had packed all his personal belongings in a large backpack before leaving on the trip, which the sheriff said should have been a sign that Paul was ""about ready to do something this drastic."" Paul was committed to Eastern State Hospital after admitting he strangled and slit the throat of community activist Ruth Motley in 1987, KREM-TV reported. According to court documents obtained by KREM, Paul believed Motley was a witch and killed her in response to voices in his head. He subsequently burned a deer carcass as a sacrifice, according to the documents. Paul's escape Thursday prompted a massive manhunt and brought criticism from many, including state government officials and police. ""There was an extreme amount of anger throughout the law enforcement community that this event even took place,"" Knezovich said. ""This is a situation, in my opinion, that should have never happened."" Knezovich also complained that hospital officials had not reported Paul's escape for two hours, which he said also hindered the investigation. A review of the policy that allows patients to take trips has been launched, said Susan Dreyfus, secretary of the Washington's Department of Social and Health Services. Dreyfus said she was concerned about Paul's escape and another recent brief escape by a patient at a different local mental facility.","Phillip Paul recaptured Sunday in Goldendale, Washington, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- On a recent Southwest Airlines flight, a man dropped his pants and exposed himself to the female passenger sitting next to him, then punched her, according to an FBI affidavit. The plane was in midair, and the naked man reportedly grew angrier, screaming uncontrollably and shaking his fist in the air. In August, a man on Southwest Airlines exposed himself and punched a fellow passenger, an FBI affidavit says. The man had gone ""berserk,"" said James Scanlon, a 52-year-old passenger who witnessed the August incident. ""He was jeopardizing my safety on that airplane. I was afraid he would rush the cockpit or try to jump out."" Laws prohibiting interference with flight crews and attendants on aircraft have been on the books for decades. But since the September 11, 2001, attacks, federal officials and airlines have clamped down on misconduct, imposing bigger fines and stricter punishments for passengers who behave badly. ""Now people are more hyper-vigilant on what occurs on aircrafts,"" said Ron Koziol, assistant section chief for the FBI's violent crimes unit, who calls airplanes a ""high-risk"" environment. ""The U.S. government is more aware of what can occur on an aircraft, and [officials] don't want those issues causing the plane to be in an unsafe environment."" The FBI reports an average of 80 incidents aboard aircraft each year. The man on the Southwest fight, Darius Chappill, was charged in U.S. District Court in Oakland, California with interference with a flight crew and accused of exposing himself. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine. The Federal Aviation Administration, which handles unruly incidents deemed to be civil violations, has reported more than 900 cases over the past five years. In 2000, a series of incidents in which passengers verbally harassed and hit crew members prompted the FAA to boost the civil penalty fine for interfering with a crew member from a maximum of $1,100 to $25,000. The FBI usually handles more serious cases of abuse or dangerous behavior. The FAA numbers don't reflect all the cases of inappropriate behavior, said Les Dorr, a spokesman for the agency. Crew members are used to experiencing the wrath of passengers who are frustrated by delays and missing baggage. Sometimes, these incidents aren't severe enough to be reported to government officials. Many confrontations occur when a flight attendant refuses to serve an intoxicated passenger another alcoholic beverage, according to flight attendants. When the temper tantrums get physical, airline officials may resort to plastic handcuffs and restraining tape. On a Frontier Airlines flight in July 2007, passenger Tamera Freeman was seen physically abusing her children, who were crying, according to court documents. The court records show that when the flight attendant refused to serve her alcohol, Freeman threw her drink at the attendant. Crew members subsequently taped Freeman into her seat, and she spent three months in jail for the incident. Passengers who fail to comply with standard airline policies -- such as staying seated when the seat-belt sign is on or turning off electronics when the plane is landing  -- also spark confrontation, airline attendants said. Christina Szele, a New York passenger onboard JetBlue Airways in 2008, decided to smoke in her seat last summer despite the no-smoking law implemented on U.S. flights in 1990. Court documents revealed that when flight attendants asked Szele to stop, she began to yell obscenities and racial slurs. The flight was diverted to Denver, Colorado. Szele later was sentenced in U.S. District Court in Denver to serve five years' probation for interference with a JetBlue flight crew member. Szele was ordered to participate in anger management and drug and alcohol abuse treatment as well as fined nearly $8,000. Tim Smith, an American Airlines spokesman, reported a slight decrease in the number of incidents of misconduct this year compared with last year. The number of unruly passenger incidents tracked by the FAA also has dipped since 2004. The punishment for unruly behavior can be severe. In addition to federal charges, fines and jail time, passengers who are prosecuted may be liable for paying to divert a flight to an unscheduled airport, which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Depending on the offense, the unruly passenger may be banned from the airline permanently. But some passengers said they believe the airlines and government are reacting too harshly. ""You can't have a dispute on board an airline with the flight crew period,"" said Charles Slepian, CEO of Foreseeable Risk Analysis Center Inc., a security consulting group. ""In some instances, it's a good thing. But others will say it is a violation of my First Amendment rights."" Several airlines require their attendants to take courses on how to defuse confrontations and calm passengers who make belligerent threats. ""We have all accepted that when we chose this career path our job is to be a safety professional,"" said Kelly Skyles, national safety and security coordinator for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, an organization that represents attendants at American Airlines. ""I'm the eyes, ears and nose of the aircraft to report everything to the cockpit. The service part, that's just a bonus of our job."" Diana Fairechild, an aviation consultant and flight attendant for two decades, said flying conditions have become more strenuous. Few airlines serve meals on domestic flights, and snacks and drinks are carefully rationed. The seating space is smaller, leaving passengers feeling crunched. There are more delays, fees and less fresh oxygen on board, she said, which can trigger angry behavior.  Fairechild said she has seen the quality of customer service dwindle since September 11 as some crew members have shorter tempers in dealing with passengers who disobey the law. ""Listening helps,"" Fairechild said on the skills she used to deal with rowdy passengers. ""Patience. Just being heard makes a big difference.""","FAA reports more than 900 cases of unruly behavior on planes over past five years .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- The bodies of 152 people killed in a fiery plane crash in Iran Wednesday have been returned to their families, an Iranian state broadcaster reported Sunday. An Iranian Armenian woman places flower at crash site. Ahmad Majidi, the head of the special working group investigating the Caspian Airlines crash, also said a Russian team had arrived in Iran to help study the crash of the Russian-made plane, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting said. The plane went down in a field near the city of Qavzin Wednesday, killing all 168 people on board and leaving a huge smoldering crater. Majidi did not say what had happened to the 16 bodies that have not been handed over. The plane's flight data recorders have been recovered and are being studied by Iranian and Russian experts, IRIB said. Fragments of the plane are also being examined to help determine the cause of the crash, Majidi said. The plane ""disintegrated into pieces,"" said Col. Masood Jafari Nasab, security commander of Qazvin.  See a map of the crash location » . Video of the crash site showed a huge crater in the earth scattered with charred pieces of the plane and tattered passports.  Watch as the flight data recorders are recovered » . ""The aircraft all of a sudden fell out of the sky and exploded on impact, where you see the crater,"" a witness told Iran's government-backed Press TV from the crash site. Ten members of the country's youth judo team were aboard the plane, several sources including Press TV reported. The government-backed network said the dead included eight athletes and two coaches. It was at least the fifth major airline accident in the world this year, following crashes of planes flown by Colgan Air, Turkish Airlines, Air France and Yemenia Airways. A US Airways pilot managed to land his plane safely on the Hudson river in New York City in January, with no major injuries, after the plane lost power. But aviation safety expert John Wiley said there was no reason to fear air travel in general, and no one airline or aircraft is particularly dangerous. Caspian Airlines Flight 7908 -- a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M plane -- went down near the village of Jannatabad near Qazvin at 11:33 a.m. (2:03 a.m. ET) Wednesday, Press TV reported. Conversations between the pilot and the ground were normal and did not indicate any technical problems, the network's Web site reported, citing the managing director of Iran's airport authority without naming him. The Tupolev 154 is essentially banned in the West because it does not comply with European noise and pollution regulations, but it has a safer-than-average accident record, Wiley said. Wednesday's crash is the first on record for Caspian Airlines, which was founded in 1993, he added. The plane crashed 16 minutes after takeoff, said the newspaper Hamshari, quoting a spokesman from Iran's civil aviation organization. That would have put the flight in one of the safest stages of travel, according to International Air Transport Association data. Only about 5 percent of accidents take place during the phase called en-route climb, 16 to 20 minutes into a flight, when a plane climbs to cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. About half of accidents take place during landing.","Bodies of 152 people killed in plane crash in Iran returned to their families .

"(CNN) -- Why leave home when you can send out a sexy, stylish robot version of yourself to do anything you tell it? In ""Surrogates,"" lifelike robots take the place of humans in day-to-day life. That's the world of ""Surrogates,"" a film starring Bruce Willis that opens Friday. Willis plays an FBI agent who investigates the first murder to occur in years in a world where no one worries about crime or pain, because their robots self-heal with a quick reboot. Far-fetched science fiction? Sure. But scientists and the movie's makers say the technology might not be as far away as most people think. Armies use remote-controlled robots to attack enemies and destroy land mines. Emerging technology for the disabled allows users to operate robotic limbs and control computer cursors without touching a keyboard. And emerging ""telepresence"" technology is letting people see, hear and, increasingly, walk, talk and gesture using human-sized robots a world away. ""There are a lot of real-world components to this,"" said robotics expert and author Daniel H. Wilson, whose books like ""Where's My Jet Pack?"" and ""How to Survive a Robot Uprising"" explore the intersections between science fiction and real science. ""Clearly, there are not fully functional humanoid robots ... but there are a lot of components to telepresence that already exist."" ""Surrogates"" director Jonathan Mostow, whose film credits include 2003's ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" said he was drawn to the concept of surrogate robots as an extension of current technology. And, he said, as he met with scientists, he became convinced that something approaching the concept could one day be a reality. ""To me, it's not even a question of the technology. Technology always catches up,"" he said. ""The question is, is some universal human urge being met by this invention? It seems to me we have a fundamental human desire to be lazy, to sort of not have to do things in person and to do it remotely. ""That began with the telegraph and the telephone and has morphed into the Internet."" The first steps down the road are being taken at Anybots, a Mountain View, California, company founded in 2001 by Trevor Blackwell. The company offers, for about $30,000, a 5-foot-tall, 35-pound robot that allows the user to remotely travel, see, hear and talk. It hopes to release its latest version of the robot at a more affordable price. The robot's vaguely humanoid curves, roughly adult height and ability to move around using technology similar to that of the Segway are important steps up from current teleconferencing technology, Blackwell said. Anybots in the development phase are being designed to run, jump and climb stairs, and they come equipped with fully articulated hands designed to perform increasingly human-like tasks. Blackwell said he's not sure the technology will ever advance to the level imagined in ""Surrogates"" -- but that may have as much to do with desire as ability. ""I don't know if we'll ever get quite to that level, of being that realistic,"" he said. ""Most of the time, you're not trying to fool people; you're just trying to make something human enough so people can relate to it."" Wilson, who said he appreciates ""Surrogates"" because it avoids sci-fi's traditional ""man vs. machine"" dynamic, also imagines social reasons for not pursuing such technology. ""Would humans stand in line at the grocery store behind a robot? Would I let my children play outside if I knew there were robots outside walking dogs?"" he said. It's more realistic, Wilson said, that a humanoid robot could be created to remotely perform tasks that would be too dangerous for the machine's operator to do. although NASA employs robots in space, the highly technical work often required for space walks still requires a human touch -- at least for now. Plus, he said, making robots that look and act like us would help them function better, he said. ""Another major reason to create humanoid robots is, they can use all of our tools,"" Wilson said. ""Human beings have taken large chunks of the planet and completely transformed the environment to support our embodiment. Doorways are a certain width all over the world because human beings are about the same size. All our tools are similar because we've all got hands and thumbs."" For Mostow, the movie also reflects technological advances that, for better or worse, exist as the world of online networking continues to grow. ""You can do your shopping. You can get your news. You can let everyone know what you're up to,"" he said. ""For those who telecommute, you don't even have to put your clothes on to go to work. ""This idea basically just takes that to its logical conclusion.""","In ""Surrogates"" sexy, stylish robots live life for their owners .

"(CNN) -- Two Florida school administrators face contempt charges and possible prison time for saying a prayer at a school luncheon. Pace High School enacted a decree in January banning officials from promoting religion at school events. Frank Lay, principal of Pace High School, and Athletic Director Robert Freeman are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of Santa Rosa County schools from endorsing religion. They face a non-jury trial September 17 before U.S. District Judge Casey Rodgers. The statute under which they are charged carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in prison, subject to sentencing guidelines. Attorneys defending Lay and Freeman call it outrageous that the two are being prosecuted for ""a simple prayer."" But the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit led to the consent decree, maintains that students have a right to be free from administrators foisting their religious beliefs on them. Still, an ACLU representative said the organization never suggested that people should go to jail for violating the decree.  Watch why lawyer thinks men did nothing wrong » . The ACLU filed suit last year against the district on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that ""school officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events,"" according to an ACLU statement. Both parties approved the consent decree put in place January 9, under which district and school officials are ""permanently prohibited from promoting, advancing, endorsing, participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events,"" the ACLU said. Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization. In addition, the court required that all district employees receive a copy. On January 28, ""Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new fieldhouse at Pace High School,"" according to court documents. ""Freeman complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event. It appears this was a school-sponsored event attended by students, faculty and community members."" Attorneys from Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group helping defend Lay and Freeman, said in a written statement that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project, all ""consenting adults."" In a February 4 letter to district Superintendent Tim Wyrosdick in which Lay acknowledged the incident, he said that although past football booster club members ""and other adults associated with the school system"" were at the luncheon, culinary class students were in charge of food preparation and serving. Lay wrote that he asked Freeman to bless the food ""for the adults. ... I take full responsibility for this action. My actions were overt and not meant to circumvent any court order or constitutional mandate."" In response, Wyrosdick noted in a letter to Lay that in a meeting, the principal had admitted that ""you are, and were at the date of this incident, aware of the court injunction and aware that this type of action is not permissible under the injunction."" Wyrosdick recounted telling Lay that the prayer was not appropriate. ""This note is to share with you written instructions to avoid this type of action,"" the superintendent said. Both letters are in the public court file. ""It is a sad day in America when school officials are criminally prosecuted for a prayer over a meal,"" said Mathew Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel and dean of the law school at Liberty University, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. ""It is outrageous and an offense to the First Amendment to punish a school official for a simple prayer."" Liberty Counsel said it is challenging the consent decree, maintaining that it ""unconstitutionally infringes on the rights of teachers, administrators and students."" The ACLU, according to the Liberty Counsel statement, has begun ""to go against individual employees."" The organization said that neither man ""willfully violated any orders of the court."" ""We're not going after individuals,"" said Glenn Katon, director of the Religious Freedom Project for the ACLU of Florida. ""We're just trying to make sure that school employees comply with the court order."" The ACLU did not request the criminal contempt charges against Lay and Freeman, he said; the judge initiated them after seeing a reference to the incident in a motion. And the ACLU is not involved in the criminal proceedings, he said. ""We certainly never suggested that anyone go to jail,"" Katon said. Lay is not facing jail time for praying, he said, but for violating a court order. ""The moral of this story is, for us, this is about the students' right to be free from teachers and school administrators thrusting upon the students their religious beliefs,"" Katon said. ""They keep talking about the religious rights of the administrators, but the administrators and the principals don't have any right to trumpet their religious beliefs in a school setting."" Neither Lay nor Freeman has been placed on leave, according to the school district. Pace is about 10 miles north of Pensacola, Florida.","Attorneys: It's troubling that officials are being prosecuted for ""simple prayer""

"Editor's note: John M. McCardell Jr., president emeritus at Middlebury College, is founder and president of Choose Responsibility, a nonprofit organization that seeks to engage the public in debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age. John McCardell says the 21-year-old drinking age isn't preventing widespread binge drinking. (CNN) -- One year ago, a group of college and university presidents and chancellors, eventually totaling 135, issued a statement that garnered national attention. The ""Amethyst Initiative"" put a debate proposition before the public -- ""Resolved: That the 21-year-old drinking age is not working."" It offered, in much the way a grand jury performs its duties, sufficient evidence for putting the proposition to the test. It invited informed and dispassionate public debate and committed the signatory institutions to encouraging that debate. And it called on elected officials not to continue assuming that, after 25 years, the status quo could not be challenged, even improved. One year later, the drinking age debate continues, and new research reinforces the presidential impulse. Just this summer a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry revealed that, among college-age males, binge drinking is unchanged from its levels of 1979; that among non-college women it has increased by 20 percent; and that among college women it has increased by 40 percent. Remarkably, the counterintuitive conclusion drawn by the investigators, and accepted uncritically by the media, including editorials in The New York Times and The Washington Post is that the study proves that raising the drinking age to 21 has been a success. More recently, a study of binge drinking published in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced that ""despite efforts at prevention, the prevalence of binge drinking among college students is continuing to rise, and so are the harms associated with it."" Worse still, a related study has shown that habits formed at 18 die hard: ""For each year studied, a greater percentage of 21- to 24-year-olds [those who were of course once 18, 19 and 20] engaged in binge drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol."" Yet, in the face of mounting evidence that those young adults age 18 to 20 toward whom the drinking age law has been directed are routinely -- indeed in life- and health-threatening ways -- violating it, there remains a belief in the land that a minimum drinking age of 21 has been a ""success."" And elected officials are periodically reminded of a provision in the 1984 law that continues to stifle any serious public debate in our country's state legislative chambers: Any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its annual federal highway appropriation. But it's not 1984 anymore. This statement may seem obvious, but not necessarily. In 1984 Congress passed and the president signed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act. The Act, which raised the drinking age to 21 under threat of highway fund withholding, sought to address the problem of drunken driving fatalities. And indeed, that problem was serious. States that lowered their ages during the 1970s and did nothing else to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol witnessed an alarming increase in alcohol-related traffic fatalities. It was as though the driving age were lowered but no drivers education were provided. The results were predictable. Now, 25 years later, we are in a much different, and better, place. Thanks to the effective public advocacy of organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, we are far more aware of the risks of drinking and driving. Automobiles are much safer. Seatbelts and airbags are mandatory. The ""designated driver"" is now a part of our vocabulary. And more and more states are mandating ignition interlocks for first-time DUI offenders, perhaps the most effective way to get drunken drivers off the road. And the statistics are encouraging. Alcohol-related fatalities have declined over the last 25 years. Better still, they have declined in all age groups, though the greatest number of deaths occurs at age 21, followed by 22 and 23. We are well on the way to solving a problem that vexed us 25 years ago. The problem today is different. The problem today is reckless, goal-oriented alcohol consumption that all too often takes place in clandestine locations, where enforcement has proven frustratingly difficult. Alcohol consumption among young adults is not taking place in public places or public view or in the presence of other adults who might help model responsible behavior. But we know it is taking place. If not in public, then where? The college presidents who signed the Amethyst Initiative know where. It happens in ""pre-gaming"" sessions in locked dorm rooms where students take multiple shots of hard alcohol in rapid succession, before going to a social event where alcohol is not served. It happens in off-campus apartments beyond college boundaries and thus beyond the presidents' authority; and it happens in remote fields to which young adults must drive. And the Amethyst presidents know the deadly result: Of the 5,000 lives lost to alcohol each year by those under 21, more than 60 percent are lost OFF the roadways, according to the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. The principal problem of 2009 is not drunken driving. The principal problem of 2009 is clandestine binge drinking. That is why the Amethyst presidents believe a public debate is so urgent. The law does not say drink responsibly or drink in moderation. It says don't drink. To those affected by it, those who in the eyes of the law are, in every other respect legal adults, it is Prohibition. And it is incomprehensible. The principal impediment to public debate is the 10 percent highway penalty. That penalty should be waived for those states that choose to try something different, which may turn out to be something better. But merely adjusting the age -- up or down -- is not really the way to make a change. We should prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol in the same way we prepare them to operate a motor vehicle: by first educating and then licensing, and permitting them to exercise the full privileges of adulthood so long as they demonstrate their ability to observe the law. Licensing would work like drivers education -- it would involve a permit, perhaps graduated, allowing the holder the privilege of purchasing, possessing and consuming alcohol, as each state determined, so long as the holder had passed an alcohol education course and observed the alcohol laws of the issuing state. Most of the rest of the world has come out in a different place on the drinking age. The United States is one of only four countries -- the others are Indonesia, Mongolia and Palau -- with an age as high as 21. All others either have no minimum age or have a lower age, generally 18, with some at 16. Young adults know that. And, in their heart of hearts, they also know that a law perceived as unjust, a law routinely violated, can over time breed disrespect for law in general. Slowly but surely we may be seeing a change in attitude. This summer, Dr. Morris Chafetz, a distinguished psychiatrist, a member of the presidential commission that recommended raising the drinking age, and the founder of the National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse admitted that supporting the higher drinking age is ""the most regrettable decision of my entire professional career."" This remarkable statement did not receive the attention it merited. Alcohol is a reality in the lives of young adults. We can either try to change the reality -- which has been our principal focus since 1984, by imposing Prohibition on young adults 18 to 20 -- or we can create the safest possible environment for the reality. A drinking age minimum of 21 has not changed the reality. It's time to try something different. It's not 1984 anymore. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John M. McCardell Jr.","John McCardell: 135 college officers joined in questioning 21 as drinking age .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S. military bombed about 300 tons of poppy seeds in a dusty field in southern Afghanistan Tuesday in a dramatic show of force designed to break up the Taliban's connection to heroin. The U.S. military bombed about 300 tons of poppy seeds in a dusty field in southern Afghanistan Tuesday. The air strike occurred mid-day in Helmand province and was observed by CNN's Ivan Watson, who is embedded with the U.S. Marines operating in that province. The military dropped a series of 1,000-pound bombs from planes on the mounds of poppy seeds and then followed with strikes from helicopters. Tony Wayne, with the U.S. State Department, said the strikes on poppy seeds, that can be used to make opium and heroin, is part of a strategy shift for the military to stop the Taliban and other insurgents from profiting from drugs.  Watch U.S. military bomb poppy seeds » . ""There is a nexus that needs to be broken between the insurgents and the drug traffickers,"" Wayne said. ""Also, it is part of winning the hearts and minds of the population because in some cases they are intimidated into growing poppies."" In a bid to encourage Afghan farmers to swap out their poppy plants for wheat crops the U.S. Agency for International Development has been offering them seeds, fertilizers and improved irrigation. Observers have noticed a significant decline in the opium trade in Afghanistan, with the number of poppy-free provinces increasing from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008, according to a U.N. report released last year. Opium cultivation in the country, which has 34 provinces, dropped by about 20 percent in a year, the U.N. reported in August. ""It's a challenge to deliver assistance in a war zone -- you can hear fighter jets flying above us right now,"" said Rory Donohoe, a USAID development officer. ""At the end of the day, what we found is successful is that we work in areas that we can work,"" he told CNN in a recent interview in Helmand province. ""We come to places like this demonstration farm where Afghans can come here to a safe environment, get training, pick up seeds and fertilizer, then go back to districts of their own.""  Watch Afghans speak about the change in their farming practices » . Many of Afghanistan's northern and eastern provinces have already benefited from USAID alternative farming programs, which have doled out more than $22 million to nearly 210,000 Afghans to build or repair 435 miles (700 kilometers) of roads and some 2,050 miles (3,300 kilometers) of irrigation and drainage canals. Giving Afghan farmers improved access to markets and improved irrigation is successfully weaning them away from poppy production, according to officials at USAID. Over the years, opium and heroin -- both derivatives of the poppy -- have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, most notably the Taliban movement that once ruled Afghanistan. ""If you can just help the people of Afghanistan in this way, the fighting will go away,"" said Abdul Qadir, a farmer in Lashkar Gah. ""The Taliban and other enemies of the country will also disappear."" Atia Abawi contributed to this report .","U.S. bombs poppy seeds in bid to break up Taliban's connection to heroin .

"(CNN) -- Honduras suspended diplomatic relations with Argentina on Tuesday in retaliation for having its ambassador expelled from Argentina last week. Riot police stand in front of marchers supporting ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on Tuesday. The move stems from tensions between the two countries over a June 28 military-led coup in which Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya was replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. When Honduran Ambassador Carmen Eleonora Ortez Williams, who had been appointed by Zelaya, did not protest the coup, Argentina took exception. Most countries in the world -- as well as the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the European Union -- have denounced the coup and demanded that Zelaya be restored to power. Those nations still consider Zelaya president and do not recognize any officials from Micheletti's government or any functionaries who support him. Argentina asked Ortez to leave last week ""for supporting the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti."" On Tuesday, Honduras suspended relations with Argentina and asked the South American nation's diplomats to leave within 72 hours. Honduras' relations with Argentina will be ""channeled"" though the Argentine embassy in Israel, said a release issued in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. ""With regards to Argentine personnel stationed in Tegucigalpa and who are finishing their functions in Honduras, they will be granted, based on the principle of strictest reciprocity, the same treatment, time and facilities that was conceded to Honduran functionaries accredited in Argentina,"" the Honduran release said. The Honduran political crisis stems from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution, despite the country's congress having outlawed the vote and the supreme court having ruled it illegal. Zelaya vowed to hold the vote anyway but was ousted before the voting started. The congress named Micheletti provisional president shortly after Zelaya was detained by the military and sent into exile. Micheletti said Zelaya was not overthrown in a coup, but rather removed from power through constitutional means.","Honduras takes action after its ambassador is expelled from Argentina .

"ASHLAND, Ohio (CNN)  -- An Ohio bakery shut down in October is bustling again, with 60 eager employees who had expected a Christmas on the unemployment rolls. Cookie production has resumed and some workers are back on the job at the Archway factory in Ashland, Ohio. Some 300 workers lost their jobs when the Archway cookie factory in Ashland, Ohio, was suddenly closed by the private equity firm that owned it. The workers also were left without benefits like health insurance. But then Lance Inc., a Charlotte, North Carolina-based snack food company, purchased Archway at a bankruptcy auction. And last week 60 workers were asked to return immediately, with perhaps more coming back in the months ahead. Kathy Sexton, a worker at the bakery, had been preparing her children for a very modest holiday.  Watch the holiday brighten for workers » . ""They said they understood,"" Sexton recalls. ""They said, 'That's all right, Mom.' You always want to give them more, but ... I didn't think I would be able to."" Now she can. Tiny Ashland has been  struggling. Ohio has lost 200,000 jobs over the past eight years. The recent presidential campaign saw both candidates visiting frequently. The outlook in Ashland became especially bleak when the Archway plant closed. Workers at the bakery said they felt betrayed when Archway at first said there would be more work in a day or two, but then changed the locks. Rita Devan remembers. ""They just kept taking and taking until there was nothing left to take,"" Devan says, ""and they didn't care that they were putting 300 people out of work."" Things are different now. When it promised to reopen the bakery, Lance gave all 300 former Archway workers a $1,500 prepaid debit card. ""I was crying,"" Devan says of the gift. ""I am like, 'What are these people doing? They don't know me. They don't know us. They don't know any of the Archway people. And they are giving each and every one of us $1,500.' "" Sexton -- the woman who'd been preparing her kids for a meager holiday -- says of the $1,500 gift: ""It was awesome. My first thought was, 'I can give my kids a Christmas.' "" David Singer, CEO of Lance, says the gift cards were a way of letting Ashland know the new owners are different. ""We wouldn't do it willy-nilly,"" Singer says. ""We do want to make money. But this is the pool of folks that we intend to hire. We just wanted to let them know who we were."" The 60 workers rehired so far are earning their previous salary and retained their seniority. They also were provided health insurance from day one. The bakery now produces Lance cookies that are sold to big chains like Target and Wal-Mart. But production of Archway cookies is scheduled to resume soon. Lance has told the employees that it hopes to have the plant fully operational by the end of 2009 -- that is, five lines of cookies being produced simultaneously. The new owners say that if new orders keep flowing in, more jobs will follow. Terry Mowry is another worker rehired by Lance. He says what has happened is hard to describe: ""You just saw life being breathed right back into the face of these people."" And Devan says with a laugh: ""I walked into the garage last night, and my husband says, 'You actually smell like a cookie again.' "" ""He said, 'Boy, I missed that smell.'

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A British couple convicted for having sex on a public beach in Dubai will not face jail after a judge suspended their prison sentences, their lawyer said Tuesday. File image of one of the co-accused -- Vince Acors -- arriving at court in Dubai in September. The couple, Michelle Palmer and Vincent Acors, had faced a three-month sentence, but they were freed on bail in October pending an appeal. Hassan Mattar, one of their lawyers, said he was trying to get permission for Palmer -- who worked in Dubai -- to stay in the United Arab Emirates, and for Acors to travel back to Britain. Acors had been on a business trip to Dubai when he was arrested. The United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, is home to thousands of expatriates and is among the most moderate Gulf states. Still, the oil-rich kingdom adheres to certain Islamic rules. Palmer and Acors were arrested on a public beach shortly after midnight on July 5. Police charged them with illicit relations, public indecency, and public intoxication. A court found them guilty in October and fined them 1,000 dirhams ($367) for the charge of public indecency. Both denied they had intercourse. And during the trial, Mattar argued that the public prosecutor failed to produce corroborative evidence against his clients on the first two charges, though he said both tested positive for liquor. More than a million British visitors traveled to the UAE in 2006, and more than 100,000 British nationals live there, according to the British Foreign Office. The country is in the midst of a building boom to position itself as one of the world's premier tourist destinations. It is already home to the world's largest mall, the world's largest tower, and -- despite being in the Middle East -- the largest indoor snow park in the world. -- CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","The couple, Michelle Palmer and Vincent Acors, faced three-month sentence .

"(CNN)  -- Inspectors have found ""nothing unusual"" in the rest of Southwest Airlines' fleet of 737-300s after a football-sized hole in one of the jets forced an emergency landing, an airline spokeswoman said Tuesday. The breach in the aircraft's fuselage caused a loss of cabin pressure. No passengers were injured. The airline inspected its roughly 200 Boeing 737-300s overnight following the incident that forced Southwest Flight 2294 to make an emergency landing in Charleston, West Virginia. A sudden drop in cabin pressure caused the jet's oxygen masks to deploy, but there were no injuries among the 126 passengers or the five-member crew. Marilee McInnis, a Southwest spokeswoman, said the jets were inspected during non-operational hours overnight, and the cause of the incident remained unknown Tuesday morning. The airline is working closely with the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the matter, she said. Flight 2294 was at 34,000 feet, en route from Nashville, Tennessee, to Baltimore, Maryland, when the incident happened, McInnis said.  See map of flight path » . ""About 45 minutes into the flight, there was a loud pop. No one really knew what it was,"" passenger Steve Hall told CNN Radio.  Watch as passenger describes watching the hole form » . The plane landed in Charleston at 5:10 p.m. after the crew reported the sudden drop in cabin pressure, which caused the jet's oxygen masks to deploy. ""We were seated about two rows back from the wing, and four rows back you heard this loud rush and your ears popped, and you could tell that part of the inside was trying to pull out,"" passenger Sheryl Bryant told CNN affiliate WBAL-TV upon arriving in Baltimore aboard a replacement plane. ""And it was crazy -- the oxygen masks dropped,"" she continued. She put her mask on her face, then helped her 4- and 6-year-old children with theirs, she said. Bryant tried to stay calm and reassure her children, she said.  Watch Bryant's account of acting brave » . ""My kids and I, we prayed, and then we said, you know, life will be fine,"" she said. Bryant praised the flight crew and ground personnel for keeping passengers informed and for giving clear instructions. ""We have a tremendous talent represented in the pilots and the flight crew,"" another passenger, Pastor Alvin Kibble, told WBAL-TV. ""I think we need to value them far more than perhaps what we do. It's very easy for us to begin to take things for granted."" The damaged aircraft was still parked at Charleston's Yeager Airport on Tuesday, when NTSB officials arrived to inspect the plane, airport spokesman Brian Belcher said. A complete inspection could take one to two days, and investigators are expected to interview the passengers and crew as well, he said. The airline is ""doing things"" for the affected passengers on Monday's flight, but McInnis would not say whether they would receive refunds. Both the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident, FAA spokeswoman Holly Baker said. ""There is no responsible way to speculate as to a cause at this point,"" Southwest said in a statement Monday night. ""We have safety procedures in place, and they were followed in this instance to get all passengers and crew safely on the ground,"" the airline said. ""Reports we have are that our passengers were calm and that our pilots and flight attendants did a great job getting the aircraft on the ground safely.""
