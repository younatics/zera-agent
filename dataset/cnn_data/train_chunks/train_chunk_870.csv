"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Teenagers are not supposed to do this kind of thing any more. In tennis, we hear, everyone has to wait until their early-to-mid-twenties to properly develop their talent. The ages of the top-ranked players back that argument up. But try telling it to Nick Kyrgios, the 19-year-old painter and decorator’s son from Australia’s unfashionable capital of Canberra, after he blitzed Rafael Nadal on his Centre Court debut. The old arena has probably not seen a statement like that since Boris Becker’s extraordinary breakthrough in 1985, when the 17-year-old terrified the life out of his elders and betters. Upstage: Nick Kyrgios celebrates beating Rafael Nadal in the tournament's biggest shock . Adios: Nadal waves goodbye after being beaten by the younger man in the fourth round . Perhaps a more recent comparison is a 19-year-old Roger Federer beating Pete Sampras at this same fourth-round stage in 2001. The emerging Swiss was by then already ranked 15 in the world, although Sampras’s Wimbledon pedigree was more substantial than Nadal’s. This had a similar mark of nerveless youth, of someone unrestrained by understanding the potential scale of the achievement. It was certainly a more sensational result than its only statistical rival of the past 25 years, world No 1 Jim Courier’s 1992 ousting by the Russian journeyman Andrei Olhovskiy, who then languished at 193. There is more of a premium these days on core strength and stamina, which is why the era of the wunderkind is meant to be over, and why so many players are enjoying their career highs in their late twenties, even early thirties. Eyes on the prize: Kyrgios will need to show more focus than other Australian teen-wonders to succeed . Kyrgios has rendered that irrelevant with his golden arm, so quick and loose he makes that of compatriot Mitchell Johnson seem like the limb of a medium pace trundler. Australian tennis will celebrate the arrival of Kyrgios. Once the cradle of champions, the game there in recent years has been on life support compared to the old glory days. Bernard Tomic has been little but trouble since making the Wimbledon quarter-final at 18 in 2011, and Sam Stosur’s US Open triumph the same year has also proved to be a false dawn. Another Aussie teenager, Thanasi Kokkinakis, is reckoned to be of a similar potential to Kyrgios. Feeling the heat: Nadal's grass court reputation has been damaged by several upsets in recent years . Potential: Kyrgios was world junior number one before turning professional last year . As for Nadal, he will welcome the extended three-week gap next year between Roland Garros and Wimbledon. His two grass court Grand Slam titles are becoming buried under a mound of upsets on the surface. As he gets older and the body becomes less co-operative, his Paris exertions are proving too much to recover from.","19-year-old beat world number one at Wimbledon .

Rod Laver, watching what he describes as ‘a completely different sport’ to the one he once played with distinction, believes that Novak Djokovic remains the favourite for the title this year. 'I saw a lot of his match against Tsonga on Monday, he is just so tough and consistent off the ground,' says the 75-year-old Australian legend. No 1: Novak Djokovic (above) is Rod Laver's favourite to win this year's Wimbledon . 'His serve also seems to me to have more on it than it did last year, so he is the guy I would pick, although any of the top four could do it.' Laver is eagerly anticipating Wednesday’s quarter-final between Andy Murray and Grigor Dimitrov, but reckons the improvements in the Murray game from the past two years will probably see him through. 'Before he joined up with Ivan Lendl he was patting the ball back too much, but Andy listened and now he is taking it to his opponents more. I would still like to see him at the net more than he is. 'I think Grigor is going to be a great player, he has all the shots. But if Murray isn’t making any errors, that’s going to create a lot of pressure.' Changes: Laver believes tennis is 'a completely different sport' to the one he once played . While Laver has the Centre Court equivalent named after him at the Australian Open, he is happy sitting in the members’ seats at the All England Club, and occasionally the Royal Box. He was among the many who noticed Ilie Nastase sitting there on Monday decked out in uniform. 'Was it a military outfit or something?' asks the famously mild-mannered Laver, who in his new autobiography singled out Nastase as one of the very players he struggled to get along with. 'Ilie has never seemed to care if he is hurting other people, he has that way about him. He thinks it’s all funny. He would get angry and do things to denigrate the crowd or be rude to women umpires. I ended up asking not to have to play against him when I played exhibitions or veterans’ matches.' Laver went on long enough at the highest level to be reaching the last eight of big tour events at 37, and on that basis believes that Roger Federer has ‘maybe two years’ left at the top. Yet he concedes that the game he played is so utterly different to the one he watches now, however much he still enjoys it. Rivalry: Ilie Nastase (pictured) 'never seemed to care if he is hurting people' according to Laver . 'It’s so much tougher these days, when I was playing tournaments in England sometimes my first-round opponent would be a county player, not the quality they have to face now. 'The biggest difference is the rackets and strings. I always get asked how I would fare against today’s top players but it’s impossible to say because of that. 'Only if I had played with a composite racket from the age of eight or ten could you try and judge it. Someone like Nadal, he gets so much spin on the ball it’s almost impossible for him to overhit. Back in the day: Laver was ranked as world No 1 for seven consecutive years . 'I was five feet eight and a half and Ken Rosewall was five feet seven. If I played John Isner now, his kick serve into the advantage court would be going four feet over my head. 'I regret that the small man is now excluded from becoming a top player unless they have something very special about them, but I do think the modern game is great to watch. 'I also think the top four players in this era are of the highest quality we have seen. There was myself, Rosewall and Hoad for a time in the sixties but the depth is not the same.' *Rod Laver: An Autobiography is published by Allen & Unwin, £16.99 .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . One of the many appealing things about Grigor Dimitrov is the complete lack of world weariness about him. He looks ahead to Wednesday's lip-smacking quarter-final against Andy Murray with a disarming idealism that could only come from a youthful challenger and it can only whet the appetite further. ‘That’s the beauty of tennis, it’s basically a gladiator battle. It’s two people, one of them is going to come out and win,’ he said yesterday. ‘What a great way to do that kind of thing. A quarter-final match out on Centre Court, what more can you ask for?’ Scroll down for video... Gladiator: Grigor Dimitrov is ready to do battle with Andy Murray in the quarter-finals on Centre Court . Best of frenemies: Grigor Dimitrov and Andy Murray share a good friendship off court . And what’s not to like about the life of Grigor Dimitrov? Owner of a supreme natural talent, champion at Queen’s 10 days ago, boyfriend of Maria Sharapova, an open personality and considered handsome — he is the Goldenballs of men’s tennis. Whether he is quite ready to take down the defending champion is open to question but he is ready to give it a go. ‘I am here to bring my goodies!’ is how he put it. One thing this will not be is a grudge match. The two camps are so close that, in the week before Wimbledon, a 200metre race was held between Dimitrov’s coach Roger Rasheed and Murray’s fitness trainer Jez Green. Murray holds Rasheed in such high regard that he nearly hired him as his coach before the appointment of Ivan Lendl and it is easy to see why in the progress that the 23-year-old Bulgarian has made. As a tennis player Dimitrov has gone from boy to man in 12 months and doubtless there has been some positive influence from Sharapova, the ultimate pro. Dimitrov does not want to play up the Sharapova angle but acknowledges that some of her attitude has rubbed off. ‘There is no competition between us, not at all. We are at different stages. She has had an incredible career so far and has won a lot of incredible titles. I am just starting,’ he said. ‘I think  we can both learn things from each other. She is the best example of an athlete and player with her work ethic. Even before I knew her and all that, I thought she was the best.’ No more Baby Fed: Grigor Dimitrov has grown from boy to man on tour this year .

Had Rasheed been available now, Murray might well have called him again but in the event he has made the innovative choice of Amelie Mauresmo as coach, with every match now a sterner test than the last. Mauresmo spoke on Tuesday for the first time in the tournament, as uncomfortable with the spotlight’s glare as Dimitrov appears to be relishing it. Yet she has enjoyed the work with Murray, who has played sublimely well so far this fortnight. ‘We are getting to know each other much better and entering more the phase where we can tease each other, we can go a little bit more into details because I’m getting to know his game much better so it is developing the way it is supposed to,’ she said. Jokes: Amelie Mauresmo's relationship with Murray has reached the stage where they can tease each other .

There is a difference for sure, a huge difference between men’s and women’s tennis. I noticed it, I lived it as a player. I see it around.’ While the intention has always been for this to be a long-term arrangement, she did not want to project into the future yet. ‘Now I am in the moment, it is good fun, it is going well. We will see if it goes further or not. Regardless if it does, it is a great experience.’ Same again please! Andy Murray has not dropped as set on the way to the defence of his Wimbledon title . This time last year Murray had come through serenely, only to nearly come unstuck against Spain’s Fernando Verdasco before coming back from two sets down. Dimitrov is so confident that he would surely punish such a slip-up Wednesday. Like it was for the Spaniard, this is something of a free hit for Dimitrov. He knows there will be lots of future opportunities, while Murray is aware that the time to win again is now.","Grigor Dimitrov faces Andy Murray in the Wimbledon quarter-finals .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Roger Federer’s tone was polite but firm as he came off court on Thursday night and discussed the eternal irritant of the time players take between points. No names were mentioned, but he made it clear he feels umpires need to be more consistent in applying the rule which says that, at Grand Slams, only 20 seconds should be taken from one rally ending to another beginning. Lukas Rosol had complained about the leisurely pace of play from Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard is the player most associated with an issue that refuses to go away. It is only one of three areas in which players are breaking or stretching the regulations, and tennis officialdom is usually too weak to clamp down. Irritated: Roger Federer believes umpires need to clamp down on players taking too much time between points . The others are toilet breaks taken between sets — a spurious practice  now out of control — and grunting or yelping, which is not only a turn-off for audiences but sometimes a contravention of the general ‘hindrance’ rule. The application of regulations can be confusing. Smash your racket — an inanimate object — in frustration and you get fined. At Wimbledon, wearing an item of clothing that is not white is almost a hanging offence. Yet do something that is contrary to the letter or the spirit of the rules which gives you an edge and nobody does much about it. Let’s revisit what Federer said at this year’s Australian Open after losing to Nadal in the semi-final. ‘I’m not complaining much about the time but I’ve played him 33 times and he’s got two point penalties,’ said Federer. ‘We should all be judged the same way, not just a guy on Court 16 who you can give a time violation to just because you can. On Centre Court they’re always going to be afraid to take those decisions. I don’t want to complain all the time. I just hope they do their job correctly.’ He clearly feels that, on this issue, some are more equal than others. A recent, high-profile instance came in the women’s French Open final, where Maria Sharapova continually stalled her less experienced opponent Simona Halep. Waiting game: Rafael Nadal has a habit of taking his time while between points . Rules: Players are not allowed to do anything that causes a ¿hindrance¿ to their opponents . Only after two hours and 24 minutes did umpire Kader Nouni summon up the courage to issue a warning. Grunting or yelping is a greyer area, as some players — men and women — subconsciously resort to this when under extreme pressure. Yet there are those who use it as an established technique. Serbian Bojana Jovanovski, who hollers a lingering cry of something like ‘Ajjar!’ every time she hits the ball, is the worst offender. Opponents do not like to complain as they fear showing weakness, yet this practice is surely a ‘hindrance’ to the large majority of players. Hurry it up: Lukas Rosol (above) complained about the leisurely pace of play Nadal on Thursday . Time between points: 20 seconds allowed at Grand Slams, 25 seconds on regular tour events. Serial offenders include: Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic,  Maria Sharapova. Solution: Introduce a hard and fast 25-second rule across the whole sport backed by a shot clock if necessary, with umpire discretion after long rallies. Grunting/yelping: Players are not allowed to do anything that causes a ‘hindrance’ to their opponents. Serial offenders include: Bojana Jovanovski, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka, Carlos Berlocq. Solution: Declare that, from 18 months hence, making a repeat noise on every shot is outlawed. Spurious comfort breaks: Visiting the toilet is allowed for genuine need, but is now nothing more than a commonplace tactic. Serial offenders: Too many to mention. Solution: Allow three bathroom breaks per season and thereafter charge donations to tour charities for each break taken. Jo Durie, Britain’s former world No 5, chuckled on Friday when asked about loo breaks, which most players assume as a right should they need to compose themselves or stall an opponent’s momentum. ‘I never once needed to go and I can’t remember other players doing it, either,’ she said. How about this as a solution — allow players three bathroom breaks per season and after that ask them to contribute $3,000 to charity every time they ‘need’ to go.","Roger Federer has discussed the irritation of players taking too much time between points .

The cheerful American Alison Riske joked that David Beckham watching her getting thrashed by Maria Sharapova meant that she was actually ‘half winning’, although the scoreline told a different story. Before what is now the traditional Saturday Royal Box audience of sporting aristocrats she went down 6-3 6-0 to the No 5 seed, who will be fancying her chances of another Wimbledon title on the 10th anniversary of her first. Although Sharapova admitted she was unaware who Sachin Tendulkar was in the privileged seats above her on Centre Court, Beckham is very familiar. They have much in common, being among the most commercially savvy high profile athletes of the modern age. Winner: Maria Sharapova beat Alison Riske in straight sets to reach the Wimbledon fourth round . Determined look: Sharapova was in impressive form beating Riske 6-3 6-0 on Centre Court . ‘I’ve actually met him a couple times at different events in L.A. and in London,’ she said. ‘He’s a great guy. Besides being an incredible football player, there is so much that he’s done in his career, having a family, maintaining so many things off the court. Really nice person to chat to. 'We’re not best buddies or anything, but it’s nice to be able to say hello and congratulate each other on achievements we’ve had in our careers and so on.’ Beckham would doubtless admire Sharapova’s idea of opening a sweet shop in Wimbledon Village for the duration of the tournament, and he shares with her an ability to compartmentalise the different aspects of sporting and business life. She enjoyed competing in front of others who have achieved in sport, even if she did not recognise many of them: ‘I always feel like I really understand them and actually get star struck more when I’m around athletes that have done incredible things in their careers, rather than maybe musicians.’ More on her mind is facing her next opponent, either Germany’s number nine seed Angelique Kerber and last year’s surprise semi-finalist, Kirsten Flipkens of Holland. It is one of tennis’s stranger facts of recent times that, having won it as a 17 year-old, Sharapova has never added to her tally of SW19 triumphs while managing two Grand Slams at the French Open on what used to be her weakest surface of clay. She is now looking to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2002 to pulling off the French Open and Wimbledon double in the same year. Hit and hope: American Riske was powerless to stop Sharapova who reeled off eleven games in a row . Golden girl: Sharapova is bidding to win back-to-back grand slams following her French Open triumph in May . The chances of her pulling that off rose slightly as she enjoyed a straightforward progression into the last 16 while her rivals had the tedium of sitting it out in the locker room waiting for the rain to subside. The Russian had the roof to thank for that, and she will not have been unhappy to have been in the temporarily sealed bubble anyway. Shutting out the elements is good for her game as there is less to interfere with her sometimes unreliable serve, which was in good working order. It will need to stay that way, as she is in what is very much the most difficult portion of the draw, full of potential threats. Faced with world number 44 Riske she got off to a slow start and was broken in the very first game, reviving memories of 12 months ago when she was bundled out of the second round here. ‘She has had some good results on grass, so I knew it was going to be a challenge,’ reflected Sharapova afterwards. Ultimately, though, it was a procession, as from 1-3 down she reeled off the next 11 games, accompanied by her trademark shriek that echoed around thanks to the roof. Riske was overmatched against this 2014 version of Sharapova that moves much better than the old one used to do. Coupled with the determination that has not been curtailed by so many millions in the bank, you could even see her going all the way next week.

Spanish sporting connections will loom large for Andy Murray on Friday afternoon as he faces Roberto Bautista Agut on the latest stage of his Wimbledon odyssey. Not only will the defending champion tackle the country’s fourth-ranked player to try to make the last 16, but Murray has also revealed that he has invested in the new film about the life of Spanish icon Seve Ballesteros, which is released on Friday. The 27-year-old Scot, whose fortune is estimated at around £40million, has used some of that cash to back the biopic of the great golfer, partly for sentimental reasons (and doubtless for some tax efficiency): ‘I normally try to invest in something that interests me a little bit. I watched a lot of golf when I was younger,’ he said. Next up: Andy Murray takes on Roberto Bautista Agut on Friday afternoon . ‘I remember going to the tournament at Glen-eagles, which was near us. I know my dad was a massive Ballesteros fan – he loved watching him and used to talk about him a lot when we were growing up. I get asked about a number of investment opportunities and that was something to me that made sense.’ Murray’s attempts at playing golf, never that wholehearted, have ground to a halt for now, as have his days of being a bandit: ‘I stopped playing when I started having back problems. 'When I used to play for money, I always used to play off 16, everyone got p****d off when I was playing against them. I have never lost a game of golf for money. I don’t know what my handicap was exactly but that is what I used to play off. Fan: Murray invested in the new film about the life of Seve Ballesteros (above) ‘My brother Jamie got down to three when he was 16 or 17. He doesn’t play too much now.’ Murray will be far more preoccupied with tackling the world No 23 as he returns to Centre Court in his usual primetime slot of late afternoon. Bautista Agut has bloomed curiously late in his mid-20s from being an unknown journeyman to entering the top 30, and he presents a danger as he comes in having won last week’s ATP Tour event on grass in Holland. The seven-match winning streak has seen him beat useful grass-court players such as Nicolas Mahut and Benjamin Becker, and his game is more suited to the surface than many Spaniards. In form: Bautista Agut is currently on a seven-match winning streak . He will not hold too many surprises for Murray, as the pair know each other from training spells in Valencia, where they have attended La Liga matches together. In fact both had the chance to choose football over tennis when younger. ‘I was a striker at Villarreal and while nobody from my time at the club really made it, I know a lot of the players there just now,’ said Bautista Agut. ‘I made the right choice when I opted to become a tennis player although I think I would have more chance of beating Andy at football. ‘We practice quite a lot together and we always talk about football rather than tennis.’ Practice: Bautista Agut and Murray (above) know each other well from training spells .","Andy Murray faces Roberto Bautista Agut at Wimbledon on Friday .

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Everton may have smashed their transfer record to sign striker Romelu Lukaku but manager Roberto Martinez insists the fee is irrelevant if the player fulfils his potential. The Belgium international landed on Merseyside for a flying visit from his homeland on Wednesday to finalise a five-year contract after a £28million deal - believed to be a £25million fee with subsequent add-ons - was agreed with Chelsea. Everton's previous record was the £15million paid to Standard Liege in 2006 for midfielder Marouane Fellaini, who moved on to Manchester United last summer for £28million. Permanent home: Romelu Lukaku has joined Everton from Chelsea for £28m, having spent last season on loan at Goodison Park . You must deliver: Manager Roberto Martinez has called upon Lukaku to justify his transfer fee, a club record, and fulfil his potential . Martinez stressed, however, the player will not carry that burden into the dressing room. 'Rom is vitally important but his transfer fee will not count for anything in terms of him developing and having an important role in the side,' said the Spaniard. 'This dressing room has got a special feeling and it is not about how much you pay for players to come in, it is about selecting the players to be in there. 'We really needed Rom at the club and that is where the chairman (Bill Kenwright) and the board have been exceptional and I do think it is a key moment at our club. 'I am looking at that number nine position - and I am probably biased - but he is potentially the best choice in world football. 'In years to come you will see him develop into someone special but nothing changes for Rom. 'He needs to enjoy his football, have the same standards he had and I am excited to see how far Rom can take us and how far we can take Rom. Familiar surroundings: Lukaku spent last season on loan at Everton, scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances . Hot shot: Lukaku celebrates scoring against Newcastle United at St James' Park last season . 'That is the partnership we can see here. 'It is true this moment in Rom's career is very significant because he is very ambitious, he wants to be successful and win things and wants to develop to the top of his potential. 'That is what we want to be as a team, so it is a perfect fit.' Lukaku said he is comfortable with the transfer fee and intends to provide the goals, having scored 16 in 33 appearances on loan at Goodison Park last season, to help fire the club into the Champions League. Asked how long it could be until the Toffees were playing alongside Europe's elite the Belgian said: 'If we continue to develop like we did last season very soon. 'I wanted to stay in the Premier League because it is the most attractive league in the world and also the best. 'For me it was easy to stay here and help the team reach that level. Not wanted: Jose Mourinho took the decision to sell Lukaku, believing that Chelsea had sufficient attacking options for the season ahead . 'I think the club wants to make a statement and I want to help the club to make a statement in this league. 'I don't put myself under pressure and just want to help my team-mates make this team as good as possible.' Martinez is still keen to add more signings, having already secured another loan player Gareth Barry on a permanent deal and also brought in £4million midfielder Muhamed Besic. However, he may now have to rely on loan signings - the Toffees have been linked with a temporary deal for Chelsea's Christian Atsu - having used most of his transfer budget to secure Lukaku. Incoming: Gareth Barry (centre), who was on loan at Everton from Manchester City, has also made his contract permanent . 'I said before we signed Rom we need three attacking players and that has not changed,' said the Everton boss. 'I always said money shouldn't be the difference between being able to challenge or not. 'It excites me when I see the side we have. Maybe some have the excuse of having to have a certain amount of money to challenge for titles but I don't look at it that way.'","Everton smashed their transfer record to bring the Belgian striker to Goodison Park .

So Murray will take his place in this afternoon’s third round singles but no Brit has really come close to joining him, although Watson and Naomi Broady made a stab at it by winning a match. The Channel Islander spoke from a position of strength when she concurred with the opinion offered by outgoing Lawn Tennis Association coach Julien Hofferlin  that one cause of the failure is that some British players are spoiled. She did not spare the coaches, either. ‘I understand where he’s coming from.  I see it with some players more than others,’ said Watson. ‘We are a strong, rich federation, so I can see that people would say that, whether we were doing well or not. 'You see that with those rich federations. I see some (players) not working week in, week out — kind of choosing when they want to work.   I think the coaches let them slip, let them get away with it. ‘Nothing is said if they just don’t want to play that week or don’t want to give it enough.  I don’t think it’s all the players —  it’s coaches, too.  But if a player wants to make it, it’s up to them. For example, I see (GB youngster) Katy Dunn.  I did an off-season training camp with her and every single day she worked hard. Then I’ve done it with others and I saw a very different story.’ Roar of success: Heather Watson battled back to win the second set against Kerber on Thursday . 22 - Watson won just 22 per cent of points on her second serve, a large reason that she lost. Kerber won 35 per cent — not good but enough to seal the win. There have actually been worse Wimbledons than this for Great Britain as, believe it or not, for four out of the previous seven years only two or less players got through the first round. The nadir was 2010, when Murray stood alone after an unprecedented first-round cull. These are utterly embarrassing statistics when taking into account the fact that these brilliantly- managed Championships have, for the past 20 years, pumped money into the British game like a Saudi oil refinery gushes petro- dollars. At present, the figure is around £35 million per year flowing into the Lawn Tennis Association’s coffers, yet it becomes a national event if someone other than Murray makes the second week, as the sadly absent Laura Robson managed last year. Perhaps the most worrying aspect is that next week’s junior event will offer little in the way of optimism for any sustained upturn in the mid-term — although the likes of Watson, Robson (if she recovers from a devilish injury) and teenager Kyle Edmund show that where there is life, there is hope. Marching on: Angelique Kerber proved too strong for a plucky Heather Watson in their second-round game . It is not just at Wimbledon that this has been a dispiriting few weeks for the British game. Watson won three matches at Eastbourne but there has otherwise been  little to show for the copious wildcards handed out this whole grass court season. The Wimbledon hierarchy are known to be as frustrated as anyone about this. Next year, there is no  certainty  they will accept the LTA’s recommendations that players ranked below 250 will get a privileged entry worth a minimum £27,000 each. Fortunately, there are signs of enlightenment in some areas from the governing body’s relatively new leadership team of Canadian Michael Downey and chairman David Gregson. They are right to place a clearer focus on grass-roots participation and there are already signs of an upturn in that area. 36 - John Isner beat Jarkko Nieminen 19-17 in the second-longest tiebreak in Wimbledon history . 3 - Rafa Nadal goes for a third French Open-Wimbledon double . 49 minutes - Serena Williams beat Chanelle Scheepers 6-1, 6-1 in the day’s shortest match . 42 - Unforced errors by Heather Watson . 143 - Jiri Vesely hit the fastest serve so far v Gael Monfils . 12 - Lukasz Kubot hit 12 double faults against Dusan Lajovic  — and won . 233 minutes - Nick Kyrgios beat Richard Gasquet  in the longest match . 100k - Tomas Berdych’s Twitter followers . VIDEO Wimbledon: Day 4 review . However, there are no indications that officials are prepared to take the radical course of action necessary at the elite end of the game. This would involve the LTA removing itself as much as possible from the process and placing more responsibility on individuals to develop their own careers. Elaborate talent identification schemes are clearly not working, and too often you see players handed around like a bag of sweets to centrally-employed coaches and getting caught up in internal politics. A fundamental rethink is required and the LTA’s main board, made up largely of well-meaning amateurs, simply have to get to grips with this. Watson, schooled at the IMG/Bollettieri Academy in Florida, knows how to put up a fight but she could not hold back the tide of 26 break points against her serve — nine of which were taken.  Kerber, a tricky southpaw, is a phenomenal retriever around the back court. Although Watson played a high quality, aggressive second set she could not maintain the necessary level to put a hardened opponent under pressure. The consolation is that her ranking is heading in the right direction from its current standing of 60 and, with few points to defend for the rest of this year, it is only a matter of time before she rejoins the world’s top 50. Not this time: The No 9 seed proved too strong for the young Briton .","British No 1 loses 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 to German No 9 seed .

"By . Lydia Warren . Two-month-old conjoined twins have passed away in their home after their parents made the agonizing decision not to risk separating them. Andrew and Garrett Stancombe, who were born on April 10, had been receiving hospice care at their home in Indiana, Pennsylvania, about 45 miles north of Pittsburgh, before they died on June 24. The boys, who were conjoined at the chest and shared a heart and a liver, were born to Michelle Van Horne and Kody Stancombe, who also have a 22-month-old son, Riley. Van Horne told the Indiana Gazette that she had returned to work for the first time last Monday when she learned that the boys were struggling to breathe. Scroll down for video . Missed: Conjoined twins Andrew and Garrett Stancombe have passed away 76 days after they were born . Stancombe and a nurse kept them comfortable and Michelle returned home, but the boys passed away the following day at 4am. They contacted relatives before sharing the heartbreaking news on Facebook just after midnight. 'Our . precious little boys have gone up to heaven,' Van Horne wrote. 'We . thank everyone who followed every step with the boys and have shown . their support.' She added: 'We’re happy in . knowing we had these special little boys with us. And . now… they may be gone but in a way we know they’re not gone from us.'

Doctors had given them just a 25 per cent chance of living more than a day, but the baby boys battled on. As . the twins shared organs, their parents decided not to risk operating on . them and accepted that it might mean the boys would eventually leave . them. 'They’ll continue to fight until it’s . their time,' Van Horne told WPXI. 'We will love them and cherish them until that moment and . continue even after.' In those early days, she was overjoyed to see them 'doing everything a normal infant would do. That's why . we see them as our miracle babies'. Together: The boys, pictured shortly after they returned home in April, took a turn for the worst last Monday when they struggled to breathe and passed away early the next morning . The babies battled on until their 76th day. Their funeral has been set for Thursday evening, following visitation at the Rairigh-Bence Funeral Home in Indiana. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, conjoined twins occur one in every 200,000 births, and their survival is anything but assured. Approximately 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and . about 35 per cent survive only one day.

"By . David Kent . Jose Mourinho is determined to put right the wrongs of last season by putting his squad through double training sessions at their pre-season camp in Austria. The Chelsea boss has been whipping his side - including new signings Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis - into shape as the new Premier League season drawing ever closer. Mourinho spent long periods of last season bemoaning his lack of a 'real striker' - but this pre-season he is putting in the hours to get exactly what he wants.

Now, Mourinho looks to be giving Costa the same treatment in the hope the addition of a proven goalscorer can help Chelsea go two marks better in the Premier League and the Champions League. In the second session of their Austrian training camp, Mourinho was often spotted having a word in Costa's ear, pointing out where he wanted to be and explaining his tactics.

"By . Tom Kelly . Grinning broadly as he strolls through a high-security psychiatric hospital, these pictures appear to show that honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani may soon stand trial. Dressed in shorts, trainers and a sweatshirt and clutching a bottle of water, the 34-year old Briton appeared to share a joke with staff in the Valkenberg hospital in Cape Town. He is believed to be flanked by a guard and a nurse who is helping to treat him for mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Murder suspect Shrien Dewani may soon stand trial as he was seen smiling and joking in the grounds of a Cape Town psychiatric hospital . Dewani has been at the hospital since being extradited from Britain last month accused of masterminding the murder of his wife, Anni, during their honeymoon in South Africa in November 2010. He takes a daily half hour walk with the same pair along the hospital’s perimeter fence which gives him spectacular views of Cape Town’s Table Mountain. One onlooker said: ‘If you didn’t know who they were, they looked like three relaxed ordinary blokes.’ Dewani seemed in very different spirits than his last public appearance earlier this month when he stared forward, emotionless, in a black suit and tie as he stood in the dock at a five minute pre-trial hearing in the Western Cape’s High Court. The court heard Dewani’s mental condition has improved to the extent that he could soon face trial. Improving: Dewani, who was extradited last month, has been treated at Valkenberg hospital since his arrival, and a judge has ordered for him to be in care for another month, when hopefully a trial date will be set . Psychiatric care: The 34-year-old British businessman appeared to share a joke with a member of staff at the hospital as he went for a walk in the grounds . Communication issues: Dewani's lawyer says that although he is cooperating, they only have access to him for 30 minutes at a time, during which Dewani struggles to concentrate . On trial: Shrien Dewan is accused of masterminding the murder of his wife, Anni, during their honeymoon in South Africa in November 2010 . His lawyer, Francois van Zyl, said that Dewani ‘has been fully co-operative and his condition has improved’ since he was returned to South Africa last month. But he added: 'We have been told not to consult with him for more than 30 minutes at a time and even that has proved frustrating because of his lack of ability to concentrate.’ Judge President John Hlophe agreed that Dewani  should continue to be treated at Valkenberg until next month, when it is hoped a trial date will be set. If he is not deemed fit to be tried within 18 months of arrival, South African officials have agreed he can return to Britain. Dewani, from Bristol, denies employing a gang of local criminals to pretend to hijack the taxi he and his wife were travelling in as it passed through a notoriously dangerous township outside Cape Town. Looking better: Dewani's mental health appears to have significantly improved since he started his High Court battle against his extradition in 2011 . Swedish-born Anni Dewani was just 28, when she was murdered in Cape Town, South Africa,  allegedly by a gang of local criminals hired by her new husband to fake a carjacking . The gang let the taxi’s South African driver and Dewani out unharmed before driving to a remote part of a neighbouring township and shooting his 28-year-old bride in the neck, it is alleged. Dewani was arrested in connection with the crime after he returned home to Britain and fought a long battle against extradition to South Africa claiming he should not be forced from the UK to face trial until he had recovered from mental health problems. Four men he allegedly recruited into his plot had confessed their involvement and pointed the finger of blame at him. Dewani’s family have said in a statement that he was ‘committed to proving [his] innocence’. His wife’s family have said they have endured a ‘nightmare’ since her death will not be at peace until he stands trial and they find out what happened to her.","Shrien Dewani smiling and joking in grounds of Cape Town hospital .

"By . Mike Dawes . Eden Hazard knows it's time to live up to his name at the World Cup and that spells bad news for the USA who face Belgium in the Manoel Barradas Stadium. As the Belgium side trained in the stadium on Monday, the Chelsea playmaker is aware his country is counting on a match-long display of Hazard dazzle in the crucial last 16 clash on Tuesday. 'In this World Cup, I have yet to play a great match, even if I had good moves which were decisive,' Hazard acknowledged. Hazard (left) looked in relaxed mood as he did tricks in training on Monday . Belgium captain Vincent Kompany could again having missed the last group game with a groin injury . VIDEO All Star XI: Vincent Kompany . And the instructions from coach Marc Wilmots for Tuesday's game are clear because he expects Hazard 'to take charge of the match' and 'impose himself as a leader.' Unlike the players who have confirmed their star status at the World Cup, like Neymar for Brazil and Messi for Argentina, Hazard is still finding his range. Within Europe he is one of the half dozen best creative players, but at the World Cup so far he hasn't consistently delivered on that potential. Belgium has escaped with two victories in the games Hazard was starting, each time with the playmaker providing decisive assists. In both games, he was playing below par until those big moments. Marouane Fellaini might have been a flop at Manchester United last season but he is an integral part of the Belgium side . Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois prepares to face the USA on Tuesday . 'They are asking me to be decisive, and it has been tough,' Hazard said. The responsibility falling on the 23-year-old Chelsea playmaker could be even bigger on Tuesday if Vincent Kompany, captain and undisputed leader of team, is still sidelined with an injured groin. 'A lot is asked from a guy who has already given us a lot,' said Wilmots, even though the coach himself has publicly said more was expected from Hazard. 'I am sure that we will see a great Eden Hazard who will be decisive again,' midfielder Axel Witsel said. Time and again in group play, Hazard's creativity was stifled by defensive lineups which contained him until they were too fatigued. VIDEO USA will see a better Eden - Hazard . Hazard has struggled to make a major impact in Brazil so far . 'It was tough to express myself,' Hazard said. 'There was very little space against teams that defended fully.' He expects it to change on Tuesday because unlike the group matches, teams have to come looking for a goal to go through. 'If they want to go through, they will have to move up field because we defend well,' Hazard said. 'And I hope it will open space so I can show a very good Eden.' Given space, his first-touch football, feints and pinpoint passing has disarmed some of the best defenses in the world. And don't underestimate the quality of his freekicks. 'I hope they will commit fouls because it will bring freekicks,' said Hazard. He is also coming off more than a week of good rest, disregarding five minutes of play against South Korea, while the U.S. defenders are coming off a tough game against Germany last Thursday. Belgium coach Marc Wilmots has said he thinks Kompany will be fit . U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann knows all too well what he is up against. 'You have to have a special eye on him. You have to double cover everything that goes out, you have to shift tremendously,' Klinsmann said Monday. Compounding the difficulties for the U.S. defense should be the inclusion of creative midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who has been close to Hazard all through Belgium's youth ranks. He also was rested for the final group game, when Belgium already had qualified. On the eve of the game, Wilmots announced that Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen had not recovered fully from a right hamstring injury in time to be ready for Tuesday's match. If Belgium advances into Saturday's quarterfinal in Brasilia, he's likely to be available. Kompany did train with the group on the eve of the game, but it was unclear how the injury reacted to the training session. Wilmots said he expected Marouane Fellaini to recover from calf soreness to be available for the U.S. game.

"By . Bianca London . A mother, who wanted to create an extravagant cake for her daughter's fourth birthday, went all out - by baking a four foot tall Peppa Pig cake. Devoted Maria Young spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George. She got builder husband Wayne to make a wooden frame and then covered it in sponge, icing and Rice Krispies. It's life size! Brooke Young's mother Maria, created the extravagant Peppa Pig themed cake for Brooke's fourth birthday . The end result was a cake taller than daughter Brooke, which at five and a half stone, weighed as much as a ten year-old and was enough to feed 700 people. But thrifty Maria, 30, says it cost her just £100 after she took advantage of as many multi-buy offers as she could find. She melted 17 bags of marshmallow into almost 12 boxes of Rice Krispies to create the legs and head, which alone weighed in excess of 15lbs. Quite a mouthful: Maria's hard work resulted in a cake weighing five and a half stone . Good effort! Maria, 30, spent four days creating the 133,000-calorie treat to look like piglet George . She then baked five 12-inch vanilla sponge cakes, using 4lbs of flour, 4lbs of sugar, 4lbs of butter and three dozen large eggs. She covered the big cake in almost 9lbs of buttercream, using 3lbs of butter and 6lbs of icing sugar. Finally the whole thing was coated in 28lbs of icing made from 22lbs of fondant, 4lbs of icing sugar and 4lbs of butter - and six full bottles of food dye. Brooke, her sister Emily, eight, and brother Logan, nine, helped put the cake together in the lounge of their home in Dorking, Surrey. Hungry? Maria's masterpiece was enough to feed 700 people . Calorific: Doctors recommend girls aged four need 1200 calories every day, meaning the huge cake contains enough calories to feed little Brooke for more than 110 days . Enough to go around: Maria cut 40 portions of cake at the party and she says it barely made a dent . It was unveiled on Tuesday night at daughter Brooke's fourth birthday party in front of dozens of stunned family and friends. Maria said: 'I'm so proud of this cake. It took absolutely ages, but that's what Brooke wanted. 'I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and said she wanted a super tall George cake. 'I'm surprised she didn't want Peppa, but I didn't want to argue - making trousers out of icing is much easier than making a dress.' She added: 'The party was brilliant, everyone was talking about the cake. We must have cut out about 40 portions of the cake, and it barely made a dent. Chuffed: Brooke Young blows out the candles on her amazing birthday cake, created by her mother in four days . Slow and steady: The gigantic cake took Maria four days to construct . Prepared to share: Maria says that any leftover cake will be taken to local food banks . 'All my children have taken about 30 more servings each to school for their classmates, and Wayne took about ten big slabs to work for his mates. 'But even after all that, we've still got well over half of it left. I'm going to speak to my local food bank and ask if I can donate some cake to them.' Maria, who has no formal baking training, is planning on setting up her own bakery, specialising in massive cakes. Earlier this year for Emily's birthday, Maria made a My Little Pony cake containing 250,000 calories. She said: 'George was much more difficult than the pony cake, because it involved a lot more sculpting and precision work. 'After the pony, I vowed to never go baking mad again, but when Brooke asked for a special cake like her sister's, I just couldn't say no.'

"By . James Rush . A toddler could need plastic surgery after burning his hand on a piece of public art. Vittorio Mochi, who is 23 months old, suffered a serious burn after placing the palm of his hand on the metal sculpture which had got hot in the sunshine. He was taken to hospital by his mother Virginia Mochi where he was given morphine as his blistered skin was surgically removed. Vittorio Mochi, who is 23 months old, (pictured, left, with his mother Virginia) suffered a serious burn after placing the palm of his hand (right) on the metal sculpture which had got hot in the sunshine . In the week since he has had to return to hospital twice to have his dressings changed and undergone a preliminary examination from a plastic surgeon. The accident took place in Portishead, North Somerset, where the large metal sculpture forms part of a public art trail around the marina development. Children often climb on the artwork and on her website the artist encourages families to interact with the work. But Ms Mochi, 42, from Thornbury, Gloucestershire, said warnings should be put up that the sculpture can become hot. She said: 'We always walk around Portishead Marina, it is a very popular spot for families. 'Children are always attracted to new things and we walked near to the large metal structure. The accident took place in Portishead, North Somerset, where the large metal sculpture forms part of a public art trail around the marina development . 'Vittorio put his hands on it in the same way you would with a wall and all of a sudden he started to cry. 'I looked at his hand and it had already blistered, the skin had come off and it was very, very nasty. 'There is no warning, nothing that says the surface may be hot. 'At home I am always very sharp with my . children around hot surfaces, but this is something that was unforeseen . and I worry for other families' - Virginia Mochi . 'Young children like to explore and the sculpture looks like it is part of a children’s playground as it sits on the same tarmac. I have seen children playing there. 'The pictures on the artist’s website even show children and families playing in and around the structure. I think it is very dangerous.' Ms Mochi went on to say: 'It’s very hard because Vittorio is so young and those are the parts of the hands you use to explore at that stage. This has been a very bad experience. 'At home I am always very sharp with my children around hot surfaces, but this is something that was unforeseen and I worry for other families.'

"By . Emma Innes . When people have green poo it can suggest their food is being digested too quickly . When it comes to toilet habits, everyone is different. But, there are rules that hold true for everyone. Now, a comprehensive guide to poo colours has been drawn up and it can reveal a lot about your health. Faeces can be any shade from brown to green and be considered normal. But, there are other colours that can indicate a serious problem, Gizmodo reports. GREEN STOOLS . Green stools can be caused by many things – they often suggest food is being digested too quickly, but can also be caused by eating a lot of vegetables or green food dye. In other cases, they can be caused by sensitivity to Anise oil or be a side effect of taking iron supplements. White poo is caused by a shortage of bile which can result from a bile duct blockage. For example, a gallstone can block the bile duct causing white stools. This will also cause stomach pain, dark urine and jaundice. YELLOW STOOLS . Yellow faeces can be produced and often is also greasy and smells of sour eggs. This occurs when there is a lot of fat in the poo that has not been metabolised. The can be a sign of coeliac disease and anyone with this symptom is advised to visit their doctor. BLACK STOOLS . Many factors can cause poo to be black. It can result from consuming liquorice or Guinness and can also be triggered by taking iron supplements. However, having black poo can also be a sign of something more sinister. It can be suggestive of bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and this can be triggered by a tumour or an ulcer. If the blackness is caused by bleeding, the poo is often also tar-like and will smell foul. Black poo can indicate that there is bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract and this can be caused by a tumour or an ulcer . Another possible sign of health problems is bright red faeces. OTHER COLOURS . Producing red poo is quite common and can be caused by consuming beetroot, tomatoes and cranberries. But, it can also be a sign of bleeding lower down in the intestinal tract or of haemorrhoids. Hard as this might be to believe, people can also produce silver stools. Unfortunately, this is a sign of very bad intestinal health. It can suggest a blockage in the bile duct and bleeding in the upper part of the intestines. This is because when white poo caused by a lack of bile mixes with blood, it becomes silver. As a result, it is recommended that anyone who notices their poo turn silver heads straight to hospital.","Green poo can be caused by food being digested too fast .

"By . Richard  Shears . The problems that have blighted the search for flight MH370 continued today when the only ship left searching the Indian Ocean was forced to return to port because of a technical problem. After authorities agreed that searchers had been looking in the wrong part of the ocean off the west coast of Australia, only the Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen was left to continue the mission to find the jet. But today the vessel was heading for port in Australia after it suffered a defect to its multibeam echosounder, Australia's Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre said in a statement. The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is expected to continue for at least the next 12 months, with Deputy prime minister Warren Truss declaring Australia is 'committed to the search' 'The journey is expected to take a . couple of days,' it said, an announcement that added to weeks of . frustration in the search for the plane, which vanished on March 8 with . 239 passengers and crew. The . Chinese vessel was conducting a bathymetric survey - or mapping of the . ocean floor - to help experts determine how to carry out the next stage . of the search on the previously unmapped ocean seabed. As well as this task, the crew were also looking for any signs of the aircraft such as debris or an oil slick. The . search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern . Indian Ocean will continue for up to another year despite recent . setbacks. A new  area of up . to 800 kilometres long and 70 kilometres wide is expected to be selected . for the new search zone. The Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen, has . already begun mapping the new ocean floor and is expected to continue . for the next three months. A Chinese survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor, expected to continue for the next three months . The . data collected by the ship, which is conducting a bathymetric survey, . will determine if new search equipment can be safely towed to the area's . sea floor to search for the airline which went missing on March 8 . carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. It . will also help determine water depths, enabling selection of scanning . technology that will be needed for a fresh underwater search. The . previous two-month-long search for the airline drew doubts from US Navy . sources earlier this week when the acoustic 'pings', which were at the . centre of the search, were no longer believed to be coming from the . aircraft's black box. The . Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre confirmed that the previous search . area was being abandoned on Thursday, and discounted as the resting . place of the missing airline. 'The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the . search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered . complete and in its professional judgment, the area can now be . discounted as the final resting place of MH370,' the Joint Agency . Co-ordination Centre said. The Cinese ship Haixun 01 (pictured) and a Malaysian vessel, Bunga Mas 6,  are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing . In an interview with the ABC on Friday however, Deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, confirmed that the search would continue despite the revelations. 'We remain as a nation committed to the search, we remain determined to do everything we possibly can to find this aircraft,' he said. 'It's our responsibility to the families of those who are involved, but also to assure the safety of the flying public into the future.' With the departure of Ocean Shield on Friday, the new search for the aircraft or any debris is anticipated to begin in August and take up to 12 months. Possible rings of location: These areas were determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between MH370 and an Inmarsat satellite . The Ocean Shield departed the previous search area on Friday after it was revealed that the acoustic 'pings' whose data the search was based off, were unlikely to have been coming from the plane's black-box . A contracted survey vessel is set to join the Chinese ship which is currently surveying the area alongside another Chinese ship Haixun 01 and a Malaysian vessel Bunga Mas 6 which are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing. Satellite, radar and and aircraft performance data also continue to be reviewed separately to determine where the plane was most likely to have hit the water. Seven of the so called 'handshake' signals sent by the plane to an Inmarsat satellite will be reanalyzed, as they are now determined to be the best indication of the planes final location points. The Inmarsat control room. The British satellite firm's data, which contains signals sent by MH370 will be reanalyzed . Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777, some 1,600km off Australia's northwest coast . The discovery of the pings on April 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough, leading  Australian search authorities to narrow the search for the jet to some 1,600 km off Australia's northwest coast. But according to Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders. He believes the pings instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. Speaking to CNN, Mr Dean said: ‘Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator.’ 850 square kilometres of the ocean floor were scoured in search of the airline, but no sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history. Authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.","Only Chinese vessel left looking for the plane suffered malfunction .

"By . Alex Greig . A Delta Airlines flight from Baltimore-Washington International Airport bound for Salt Lake City had to be diverted Friday night after a female passenger allegedly made sexual advances towards a fellow passenger. The woman was reportedly intoxicated and became enraged when her advances were rebuffed. The woman had to be handcuffed by airline staff until the plane could land at Minneapolis-Saint Paul and police could remove her from the plane. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Subdued: The woman was quiet as she was led from the plan after becoming unruly mid-air . A fellow passenger recorded two videos of the incident. In the first, expletive-filled recording, the woman can repeatedly be heard saying she will 'f***ing kill' the seatmate who rejected her advances and warning airline staff not to touch her. 'Hey, lady! Over there! I need help, this guy is holding me!' she implores a fellow passenger. The woman continues ranting as the pilot apologizes to passengers of the PA and explains that the plane will be making an unscheduled stop to remove the unruly passenger. 'Release me!': The woman can be seen at the back of the plane arguing with airline staff as they keep her in her seat . Write caption here . According to the Salt Lake City Tribune, Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport confirmed the woman was 'very intoxicated' and was 'grabbing at passengers' on the plane. The passenger who uploaded videos of the incident to YouTube said the woman 'had a few drinks' and made sexual advances to a male passenger. His refusal made her angry, she said, and the woman tried to 'raise her fist' to hit him. The woman, who hasn't been named, could face federal charges for causing a disturbance while the plane was in flight. Final destination: The woman never mad it to Salt Lake City with her fellow travelers; instead she was removed from the flight by police and taken to a medical center . Consequences: The woman may face federal charges for causing a disturbance in mid-air . The second video shows the woman, now much subdued, being led from the plane by police in Minneapolis. After she was removed at about 8pm, the 737 aircraft and its 132 passengers continued on to Salt Lake City, reports Fox 13. It landed an hour and a half late. The woman was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center. Hogan has said Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport will not press charges, but the FBI and TSA are investigating the incident and may prosecute.","A flight from Baltimore-Washington airport made an unscheduled stop at Minneapolis-Saint Paul so that police could remove an unruly passenger .

"By . Bianca London . As a celebrity-obsessed culture, there is immense pressure on women to look good and females are forced to compare themselves to stars with perfect bodies. A flabby stomach was the biggest concern for both men and women - with three quarters admitting they are carrying 2lbs of unwanted fat . But it has now been revealed that seven in ten women are so anxious about the way they look they fret about their weight three times a day, with a staggering 80 per cent of Brits saying they're depressed by the appearance of their own body. The study found actress Cameron Diaz's legs, reality star Kim Kardashian's bottom, model Gisele Bundchen's flat stomach and singer Jessica Simpson's bust are considered to be 'ideal'. And the desire to look the same appears to be having a serious impact on the way women look at themselves. But it's not just women who are concerned about piling on the pounds. The research by hotel chain Travelodge also revealed 61 per cent of men fret about their body three times a day. Many . desired athletic legs like David Beckham, the bottom of heartthrob . actor Channing Tatum and the abs like Mark Wahlberg and Matthew . McConaughey. A flabby stomach was the biggest . concern for both men and women - with three quarters admitting they are . carrying 2lbs of unwanted fat. Legs were the second biggest worry for women, followed by their bottoms, arms and hips. And . eight out of ten said their lives would improve considerably if they . felt happy about their body, with over a third saying it would boost . their sex drive. The second biggest concern for men was their arms, followed by shoulders, legs and bottoms. Travelodge spokeswoman Shakila Ahmed said: ""We are living in a celebrity obsessed culture where image is everything. Cameron Diaz has the ideal legs, according to the study . Gisele Bundchen's flat stomach has women green with envy . Kim Kardashian has the bottom that women rival . 'And now more women and men are feeling more self conscious about their appearance. 'Stars like Cameron Diaz and Kim Kardashian as well David Beckham are thought to have the ""perfect"" figure. 'Many Brits feel the pressure to look just as good and it's having a huge impact on their lives. 'It's staggering that such a large proportion of men and women find themselves worrying about their weight every day. 'And it's worrying that as many as 80 per cent are actually depressed by the appearance of their bodies.' Research also found 57 per cent of Brits find it hard to exercise while away from home. And a further 40 per cent said a break means they struggle to resume their fitness regimes once they return home. Most of us don't have the luxury of have a portable personal trainer with us like the celebrities do when they are on-the-go or traveling abroad. David Beckham's legs are what men desire most . Men voted Matthew McConaughey abs as the best . It was Channing Tatum's bottom that won the votes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 15:01 EST, 1 December 2011 . Herman Cain has said he will make a decision about whether to continue his White House bid over the next few days - and it depends on what his wife says. Cain, whose bid has been blighted with accusations of sexual harassment, said the decision depends on how much more his wife Gloria, whom he hasn't seen since his latest accuser surfaced, can bear. A top-tier candidate just weeks ago, Cain says he'll decide in the next 'few days' whether to abandon his White House bid, but not before he meets Gloria tomorrow. Scroll down for video . Back on the trail: Herman Cain was campaigning in New Hampshire today, meeting with the editorial board of the Manchester Union Leader newspaper . Final say: Herman Cain's wife Gloria has supported her husband, but he said the accusations are taking an emotional toll on her. His decision on whether he will stay in the presidential race now hinges on what she says . 'It has had a very damaging effect on her emotionally, because of the way some of the story has been presented,' he said of his wife of 43 years during an interview with Fox. 'She gets upset when she sees the implications and the distortions by some people in the media.' The former businessman added he cannot be certain there will not be another allegation. 'I can’t sit here and say, after . working in the business for 40 years, that someone else may not come up . with another trumped-up charge,' he said. 'This is about bring down . Herman Cain.' The disclosure came after he ripped into his critics yesterday for their 'character assassination' during three campaign stops in Ohio. He said: 'They want you to believe that with enough character assassination on me that I will drop out.’ His comments drew a chorus of 'boos' and shouts of 'No' from the crowd. He gave no indication to the audience that he was considering abandoning his bid despite telling staff that he would make a decision in the next few days about whether to continue it. 'We are reassessing as we speak. Reassessment means reevaluation,' Cain told reporters after a well-received speech to roughly 150 people in a hotel meeting room. Cain received a standing ovation . after he spoke about what a 'Cain administration' would do. And he said . that while some people predicted that the room would be empty, 'I don't . see any empty seats.' Campaign in doubt: A presidential frontrunner just weeks ago, Cain says he'll decide in the next 'few days' whether to abandon his White House bid, but not before he meets with his wife Gloria tomorrow . Not without a fight: Herman Cain vowed during campaign stops in Ohio today that he will not be pushed out of the race by 'character assassination' by his critics . 'It's . been a groundswell of positive support,' Cain insisted to reporters . later, even as some backers in early voting states of Iowa and New . Hampshire who had stuck by him after decade-old allegations of sexual . harassment surfaced several weeks ago now indicated they were abandoning . him. Also yesterday, the woman who claims she had a 'very casual affair' with Herman Cain insisted that their relationship was not 'sex for cash' - and said she does not believe the former Godfather's Pizza CEO is fit to be president. Ginger . White stood by her allegations of a 13-year relationship in a TV . interview this morning, despite Cain's denials. She called the . relationship an 'on and off' affair. Ms . White told ABC's Good Morning America that a letter sent by Cain to his . fundraisers Tuesday night - in which he called the Atlanta woman . 'troubled' - is 'very disappointing'. Sticking to her story: Ginger White stood by her assertion in an interview on Wednesday - despite Cain's denials - calling the relationship an 'on and off' affair . Should I stay or should I go? Herman Cain says he needs to weigh up whether accusations that he had an extramarital relationship will create too much of a cloud in the minds of potential supporters . Elaborating on her claims of an affair, White said: ""This was not a consistent love affair that went on every day for the last 14 years. So he is correct when he made that statement.' But Ms White also said Cain gave her gifts and money consistently over the last few years, although she claimed the relationship wasn't a matter of 'sex for cash.' She claimed she didn't want to profit from the Herman Cain scandal, but Sharon Bialek may now want to reconsider. Sharon Bialek, the first woman to go public with sexual harassment accusations against the Republican presidential candidate, faces eviction from her rented townhouse in a Chicago suburb, authorities said on today. Cook County Sheriff's deputies served a court summons on Tuesday evening on Bialek's Glenview, Illinois, home due to nonpayment of $7,500 in back rent. The owner of the home has begun eviction proceedings, a sheriff's spokesman said. Bialek, a single mother who identified herself as a registered Republican, was not home when deputies arrived. Her 13-year-old son signed the court summons, which was witnessed by her brother-in-law, the spokesman said. Once a front-runner in the race to challenge President Obama in 2012, Cain denied Bialek's November 7 accusations. As far as providing further proof of her story, she said: ‘You really don't enter into something like that holding on to receipts, holding onto gifts or notes or anything like that.' According to Ms White, she took several trips with Cain, even attending a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas. When asked if she believes Cain should drop out of the race, Ms White said: 'That’s something that he has to look himself in the mirror and ask himself. 'Last night, I slept very well telling the truth. I'm not sure what's going on in his head right now but it’s unfortunate that any of this is going on.' Meanwhile, Cain's campaign manager has dismissed reports the embattled presidential contender is planning to withdraw from the race. The Republican businessman dramatically revealed to senior staffers yesterday he is 'reassessing' his campaign amid allegations of a 13-year extra-marital affair - the latest in a series of cheating accusations. However, Cain’s campaign manager, Mark Block, said the word was . meant to imply a 'strategic reassessment' and 'not a reassessment of . withdrawing' from the race. As ABC News reports, Mr Block said in an interview yesterday evening there is 'no way he's dropping out'. Coming forward: Ms White, an Atlanta businesswoman, she was only coming forward because she was afraid someone would tell her story first . He began defending himself before the . allegations even surfaced. He broke the news himself on CNN that Ms . White would make claims against him. As well as an alleged relationship with Ginger White, Mr Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by four other women: . Cain's . lawyer said in a statement: 'This appears to be an accusation of . private, alleged consensual conduct between adults - a subject matter . which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public.' The statement, however, does not explicitly deny the affair. In an interview with Fox 5 in Atlanta on Monday, Ms White said she was only coming forward because she was . afraid someone would tell her story before she herself could. 'I'm not proud,' she said. 'I did not want to do this. I did not.' As proof of the lengthy relationship, Ms White offered her mobile phone, which has Mr Cain's private number. Ms . White also showed mobile phone records dating back four months that . have 61 phone calls and text messages to or from Mr Cain as early as . 4.26am and as late as 7.52pm. 'He made it very intriguing,' Ms White . told FOX 5. 'It was fun. It was something that took me away from my . humdrum life at the time. And it was exciting.' Going on: Mr Cain said he knew the woman as a friend but did not have an inappropriate relationship with her . Mr . Cain has been accused of sexual harassment by four other women, two of . whom have come forward publicly with their allegations. However, . to this point, the only accusations were about inappropriate advances . or comments. Ms White is claiming that he cheated on his wife for more than a . decade . 'It was pretty . simple. It wasn't complicated,' she told the TV station. 'I was aware . that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very . inappropriate situation, relationship.' Mr Cain has been married to his wife Gloria since 1968. Both have vehemently denied allegations of sexual harassment. And Mr Cain's denial of the new allegations were similarly complete. 'I . just wanted to give you a heads up and your audience a heads up, ""Here . we go again,""' he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Situation Room. 'Here we go again': Herman Cain went on TV to deny the allegations that he had an affair... before they fully emerged . The Georgia native said he knew Ms White as an 'acquaintance who I thought was a friend.' He denied having an affair, instead saying he tried to help her with financial problems. Cain also deflected criticism and said the allegations were part of an extended conspiracy to keep him out of office. Ms White said the two met in . Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s when Mr Cain was the president . of the National Restaurant Association. That night, she says, Mr Cain took her out for drinks and then invited her up to his hotel room.'I'd . like to see you again. You are beautiful to me, and I would love for us . to continue this friendship,' Ms White claims Mr Cain told her. From . then, he paid for her to fly to his speaking engagements across the . country, where he put her up in fancy hotels and restaurants like the . Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons.

Anger: Gemma Dowler said: 'Ordinary people have suffered terribly from journalists' In a video released following the phone hacking verdicts, Miss Dowler said her family had remained silent to ensure the defendants got a fair trial. ‘But now that it’s over, I want to speak out about what I think should happen next to make sure that something good comes out of these terrible events,’ she said. ‘Ordinary people have suffered terribly from journalists who recklessly intruded into private grief.’ She described Ipso, the new watchdog backed by most of the industry, as meaningless, adding: ‘This is just the newspapers looking after themselves.’ The decision not to vet Andy Coulson to the highest level when he entered government was taken by top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood. Coulson received only a basic security check when he moved from his Opposition role at the Tory party headquarters into Downing Street as director of communications in May 2010. But he was not required to undergo ‘developed vetting’ which would have meant answering searching questions about his private life and time at the News of the World and The Sun. Civil servant Sir Jeremy was Downing Street’s permanent secretary, responsible for decisions on staff security screening. He took the view that full vetting was not required for Coulson, even though it had been for his predecessors. In November 2010 he changed his mind – but Coulson resigned in January 2011 before the developed vetting process was complete. News of the World proprietor Rupert Murdoch apologised to the Dowler family and they were given £2million in an agreed compensation settlement, with a further £1million to a charity in Milly’s memory. But the most shocking allegation made in the Guardian newspaper – that an employee of the now defunct tabloid deliberately deleted messages on  her phone to make room for more, giving her family false hope she was alive – turned out to be untrue. Speaking on the video at a press conference organised by Hacked Off, which campaigns for state-imposed press regulation, Miss Dowler said: ‘There are other, equally worrying, problems. Most important and damaging of all is the incestuous relationship between our top politicians and the Press. ‘For example Tony Blair, the prime minister when Milly disappeared, didn’t phone us when he heard that Milly’s phone had been hacked. But when he heard that the police were investigating (former News of the World editor) Rebekah Brooks, he phoned her to offer his support. ‘Three long years have passed since my meeting with David Cameron and the other party leaders. ‘We were pleased that he was prepared to initiate the Leveson Inquiry into Press ethics. However, I have not forgotten the promises that were made.’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘His response ... will firstly be to acknowledge the pain, suffering and distress that victims have suffered.’ Murder victim: The family of Milly Dowler (pictured) received a payout, though the claim which forced the closure of the News of the World - that journalists deleted voicemails on her phone - turned out not to be true . ■ Kate Middleton’s mother Carole was the victim of phone hacking, it was reported yesterday. Mrs Middleton, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of York were all targeted by hackers at the News of the World, the BBC claimed.","Murdered schoolgirl's sister called on PM to keep vows on press regulation .

"By . Stephen Wright . British police are to hunt for the ‘Mr Bigs’ running Romanian gangs that are now behind more than 90 per cent of cashpoint thefts in this country, the Mail can reveal. Officers will work with their Romanian counterparts to target the gangsters orchestrating the crimes which are netting an estimated £40 million a year. New figures reveal a sharp rise in the crimes by Romanian gangs and there are fears this will rise further with a new wave of immigrants expected to arrive in the UK from January. British police are working with Romanian officials to track down the masterminds behind £40million worth of cashpoint fraud per year in the UK (file picture) In the first six months of this year, fraud from ‘skimmed’ or ‘cloned’ cards rose 15 per cent to £23.2 million, compared to £20.2 million the same period in 2012. UK cash machine fraud also rose by 11 per cent (corr) to £16.2 million in the first half of 2013, compared to £14.6 million in the first six months of 2012. Earlier this year it emerged that the number of thefts related to ATMs has trebled. There were some 7,572 cash machine card thefts in the first four months of the year, up from 2,553 during the same period in 2012. Police intelligence suggests 92 per cent are linked to Romanian immigrants already in the UK. The losses suffered as a result of ATM thefts run into many millions of pounds, sources said. The Mail can reveal a major operation involving British and Romanian police is under way to identify the gangs behind the crime wave. UK detectives believe several ‘top level’ gangsters, based in Romania, are orchestrating the misery being inflicted on UK card users. Techniques such as skimming involve putting a reader over the card slot then collecting data as the card enters the machine . Senior Home Office figures are said to be ‘nervous’ about the crime surge. Detectives fear some criminals will be among the Romanians who will be entitled to settle in the UK when border controls are dropped in the New Year. They will join scores of Romanian thieves and fraudsters already established here and who now, according to well-placed sources, dominate certain categories of card crime. A spokesman for the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit at City of London Police told the Mail yesterday that the £23.2million losses in counterfeit fraud includes all fraud perpetrated as a result of UK cards being copied. Much of this fraud takes place in countries outside the UK that have not fully implemented chip and PIN, he said. The £16.2million lost through UK cash machine fraud is where the compromised card is used at a UK cash machine irrespective of how the card is compromised and so includes use of lost/stolen cards, counterfeit cards and cards ‘intercepted in transit’, he added. The spokesman added: ‘Overall levels of card fraud have dropped by 29% since a peak in 2008. With the introduction of enhanced security features, such as Chip & PIN, criminals have resorted to deception thefts. 'These basic techniques include shoulder-surfing and distraction thefts at ATMs - resulting in an increase in incidents at cash machines - which our unit is tackling head on.’ Asked to comment on reports that Romanian criminals are responsible for more than 90 per cent of ATM thefts, he said: ‘That figure relates to police intelligence from 2010, however the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit remains focussed on the involvement of Romanian criminal gangs in ATM crime, amongst other threats to the payment industry from organised crime.’ The latest annual figures show that, in 2012, the top five countries for fraudulent activity on UK issued cards were USA (£23.4m), France (£7.9m), Luxembourg (£6.9m), Italy (£5.4m) and Ireland (£5.2m). The DCPCU spokesman said officers are currently working on an 18 month project which is funded in the main by the European Commission and will be focusing on Romanian organised criminality targeting the UK payments industry. ‘For operational reasons there are no further details we can release at this time,’ he said. The Mail has learned that officers have identified a number of ‘Mr Bigs’ in the Romanian city of Bacau. A source said: ‘They are very clever criminals who have made vast sums of money out of card crime in the UK, but who are difficult to pin down.’ Gang members working for the crime barons will typically crowd customers withdrawing cash to read their four-digit PIN, then distract them to steal the card. In some cases they install a simple metal sleeve in the slot which means the card is not returned to the user. Someone reads the PIN over the victim’s shoulder and then, when they have moved away, retrieves the card. Once the thieves have the card and PIN they can go on a shopping spree or use a hole in the wall machine to empty their victim’s account. Another technique, shoulder surfing, involves distracting a user while another person takes their details (posed by models) Last month Scotland Yard revealed that policemen from Romania and Poland are being drafted in to help British forces combat an Eastern European crime wave. Met chiefs have recruited the officers, who have flown to the capital for a two-year ‘tour of duty’ to help identify and deport overseas offenders. The special squad, comprising eight detectives from Romania and three officers from Poland, will join the Met on raids, interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database. The unprecedented move comes after it emerged last year that 28 per cent of the 300,000 suspects the Metropolitan Police arrests each year were foreign nationals, with Poles and Romanians at the top of the list. More than 27,000 Romanian citizens have been held for serious offences in London in the past five years, including ten for murder, 142 for rape and 666 for other sex offences. The number of Romanians arrested is second only to that of Poles, 34,905 of whom have been detained since 2008, including 84 for murder. Police hope that the new unit will disrupt major organised criminal networks including the fraud gangs originating from Bacau. Last month it was revealed that fraud losses on UK credit and debit cards have risen by 17pc in a year as criminals, struggling against improving technology, turn to new forms of “low-tech” scams. Some £216.1 million worth of card frauds were committed in the first six months of this year, according to Financial Fraud Action UK, which prevents crime on behalf of the financial services industry. The total cost of fraud on debit and credit cards leapt 14 per cent last year, by £47 million to £388 million. Fraud is expected to top £400 million this year. In 2008 Romanian fraudster Adu Bunu, was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million. Police found photographs that showed his young son rolling around in a mountain of stolen cash.","British and Romanian police are working to bring down cashpoint fraud .

"By . Chris Irvine . More than 650,000 passengers pass through Penn Station every day, making it by far the busiest in the U.S. So when one Amtrak train bound for Washington pulled away from the station on Saturday at 3pm, it was somewhat of a surprise that it managed to forget all of its passengers. The Acela Express 2253 departed as passengers were waiting at a completely different platform after being given the wrong information. The driver apparently left without getting permission from the station. Feeling a bit light: The Acela Express (file picture) departed with no passengers while everyone was waiting on another platform . When they realised what had happened, passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration. ‘You don’t see railroads lose trains very often but @Amtrak has lost their Acela Express at Pennsylvania Station New York,’ wrote Ira Socol. Another, Michael Yu, wrote: ‘Thanks @Amtrak, missing a wedding cause Acela 2253 left NYC without boarding any passengers.’ Keli Goff wrote: 'This has got to be a first. The @Amtrak #acela FORGOT to pick up ANY passengers for the 3pm departing NYC. BRAVO @amtrak #greatcustomersvc.' She followed that up with: 'Well @amtrak offered free pizza so there's that. As one guy said ""I'd prefer a working train.""' Damien Miano, 60, from Chelsea, told the New York Daily News: ‘They literally sent us to the wrong platform, and the conductor took off without any passengers. ‘The right hand didn’t know what the left hand was doing. It was just so bizarre.’ He added that when the passengers returned to the main level of the station, they were met by an Amtrak manager who explained the situation and then handed out bags of Doritos. They were also fed pizza. Eventually, the majority of passengers jumped on to a train more than two hours later. Kimerly Woods, a spokesman for Amtrak, told the Daily News: ‘We’re investigating why the train left the station before all passengers could board.’ As of Monday, there was no further explanation on Amtrak’s Twitter account, even though passengers were asking for a refund. More than 650,000 passengers pass through Penn Station on a daily basis, making it the busiest in North America .","Passengers take to Twitter to vent fury at mix-up .

"By . Daniel Martin . Boris Johnson will throw down the gauntlet to David Cameron – by warning that Brussels will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull Britain out of the EU. In a major speech this week, the London mayor will back a report concluding that a British exit from the European Union would be better for the country than staying in an unreformed institution. The study, by the Mayor’s economic adviser, banker Gerard Lyons, says that leaving the EU is ‘definitely a viable option’ and comes a ‘very close second’ to staying in a successfully reformed Union. Mayor of London Boris Johnson will back a report concluding that a British exit from the European Union would be better for the country than staying in an unreformed institution . Mr Johnson is expected to say that the UK should ‘not be frightened’ of leaving the EU – a stark contrast to the position of the Prime Minister, who has always said he wants Britain to stay in. It comes amid growing speculation that the London mayor, and possible future Tory leadership challenger, will announce plans to return as an MP next year. Mr Cameron has pledged a referendum on EU membership by 2017, following Brussels reforms including a crackdown on benefit tourism. But the Mayor is understood to believe that Mr Cameron’s strategy will not guarantee success. A source close to Mr Johnson told the Sunday Times that he believes Mr Cameron must be ‘bold’ in his demands in the renegotiation of the UK’s EU membership he has promised if Conservatives win next year’s general election. Mr Johnson is understood to believe that the best way of achieving this is by showing he has ‘no fear’ of departure if the talks fail to deliver. ‘Boris favours a renegotiation in which we stay in and complete the common market,’ the source said. ‘He believes that is achievable by being bold about that renegotiation and not having that fear about leaving. If voters say that’s not enough and we leave, the longer-term aspects of that are not as damaging as people might imagine.’ Mr Johnson is expected to endorse a list of eight demands for reform proposed by Mr Lyons which go beyond what the Prime Minister has publicly set out. It is believed that the Lyons Report finds that London’s GDP of £350billion – around a fifth of the UK economy – can be expected to grow to £640billion by 2034 if Britain stays in a reformed EU which allows a new orientation towards trade with growing markets in the rest of the world. It would still expand to £614billion if the UK quit Brussels to pursue its own trade-friendly policies. However, if Britain stayed in an unreformed EU, London’s GDP could be expected to grow to just £495billion over the same period. And leaving the EU but failing to adopt a more outward-looking trade policy would limit it to £430billion. Mr Cameron has pledged a referendum on EU membership by 2017, following Brussels reforms . Mr Lyons said: ‘The best economic scenario for Britain over the next 20 years is to be in a significantly reformed European Union. ‘But if, as an alternative, the UK leaves the EU on good terms, while adopting sensible outward-looking trading policies, that comes a very close second.’ He added: ‘Britain can only achieve meaningful EU reform if it’s serious about leaving. Our detailed study shows it’s definitely a viable option for the UK to be outside the EU.’ Mr Cameron has said he hopes to be able to recommend voters opt to stay in the EU in the in/out referendum he has promised for 2017, following the planned renegotiation. Mr Johnson’s expected comments are likely to increase pressure on him to make clear to EU counterparts that he is ready to recommend withdrawal if the renegotiation fails to deliver the reforms he wants. Matthew Elliott, of the pro-reform group Business for Britain, said: ‘Failure to change the damaging status quo of our relationship with the EU poses a huge threat to British business and in particular Britain’s financial services. ‘The mayor is absolutely right that we should seek serious reforms of our relationship with the EU, but also that we should not be afraid of the prospect of Britain leaving a stagnant EU. ‘As Business for Britain research has shown, the City faces huge and growing threats from the eurozone. We need a robust strategy to bring back powers to the UK and make the EU more competitive, but this will only be possible if Britain is serious about leaving if the EU fails to reform.’","Mayor of London will give a major speech this week advising Mr Cameron .

"By . Associated Press . Walmart will relaunch its website that will see them personalize shopping for each customer, in a bid to take on Amazon. Walmart is rolling out a feature that will enable its website to show shoppers more products that they may like, based on previous purchases. It will also customize Walmart's home page for each shopper based on the customer's location, local weather and the customer's search and purchase history. The increased personalization is part of a . series of changes to improve the online shopping experience of its . customers that are rolling out now and over the next few months. This undated image provided by Wal-Mart, shows the website that will enable it to personalize the online shopping experience for each customer. Wal-Mart is rolling out a feature that will enable its website to show shoppers more products that they may like, based on their previous purchases . The retailer is looking to boost its business online when its U.S. discount division has seen disappointing sales. Walmart Stores Inc.'s e-commerce sales increased by 30 per cent to over $10 billion in its fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. By comparison, Walmart's U.S. discount division has had five straight quarters of sales declines at stores opened at least a year. Walmart sees big growth opportunity in the online business: Online sales are only a fraction of the $473 billion Walmart generated in overall annual revenue, dwarfed by Amazon's $60.9 billion in annual sales. Bricks and mortar retailers like Walmart have seen benefits in personalizing their websits for customers. For Walmart (pictured here is a store in Alcoa), its discount division has had five straight quarters of sales declines . The move to personalize websites for shoppers has become a top priority for traditional brick-retailers like Walmart as they play catch up with Amazon, the online king that pioneered customizing content for shoppers. Retailers increasingly are trying to use their reams of customer data they get from mobile devices and computers to personalize their websites and ultimately, boost sales. Other retailers, including the home-improvement chain Home Depot and office-supplies retailer Staples, have been working to personalize the online shopping experience. In fact, a quarter of customers who visit Home Depot's home page see product recommendations that are based on recent purchase or browser history, according to the company. Retailers have seen benefits in personalizing their websites for customers, as well as other efforts to improve the online shopping experience. Overall, Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Mulpuru said that changes in customization can help lift a retailer's online sales in the mid-single digits. It's good to be king: Amazon has long pioneered customizing content for its shoppers . Walmart said that customers have responded well to improvements it has made to its website in the past two years, including quadrupling the assortment of items it offers online to 8 million. For example, when Walmart updated its search tool, it saw a 20 per cent increase in shoppers completing a purchase after searching for a product using the new search engine. Among the other changes, Walmart has redesigned the site to cater to tablets as well as other devices. That means that the content and images are now adjusted to the size of the screen. So shoppers will see more columns of products on bigger screens. Shoppers will see other improvements. Walmart.com will be testing a quicker online checkout process over the next couple of months. That means customers will view one page instead of six before clicking on the 'buy' button. And the company will be able to update Web pages within minutes instead of days.","Shoppers will be shown products they may like based on purchases .

"By . Press Association . Most wanted: Martin Evans, 52, has been arrested in Johannesburg . One of Britain's most wanted men has been arrested in South Africa after three years on the run, the National Crime Agency has confirmed. Convicted drug trafficker and fraudster Martin Evans, 52, from Swansea was apprehended at a housing complex in the Midrand area of Johannesburg on Saturday night. The 52-year-old had been on the run since 2011, when he absconded while on temporary licence six years into a 21-year sentence for conspiracy to supply cocaine and fraudulent trading. Evans was jailed in 2006 after he was found guilty of  leading an organised crime group supplying cocaine, MDMA and ecstasy between 1999 and 2001. Officials said investigators from the NCA alerted Interpol that Evans was in South Africa. That resulted in intelligence-led surveillance operations being conducted by the South African Police Service. These operations led to Evans being tracked down to the housing complex where officers swooped as he was getting out of his car. Hank Cole, head of international operations for the NCA, said: ‘The exceptional level of collaboration and intelligence sharing with the South African Police Service led to the capture of Evans. ‘This arrest shows the NCA and its partners will pursue fugitives wherever they are in the world. They can run but they can't hide. We have the capability to track them down and bring them to justice.’ General Riah Phiyega, South Africa National Police Commissioner, added: ‘Both the Crime Intelligence and Interpol teams worked tirelessly to honour the request of our British counterparts and we applaud them for this.’ British High Commissioner to South Africa Judith Macgregor said the arrest was testimony to the ‘close working relationship between the UK and South Africa’ on security issues including tackling drug trafficking, organised and fiscal crime. Evans - a former Young Businessperson of the Year - had previously given the authorities the slip while waiting to stand trial for fraud. Back band bars: The 52-year-old from Swansea had been on the run since 2011, when he absconded while on temporary licence six years into a 21-year sentence for conspiracy to supply cocaine and fraudulent trading . Days before he was to face justice for swindling 115 investors out of their savings in a £900,000 ostrich farm scam, he fled to Spain. While trying to evade capture for that offence, he went on to lead an international gang smuggling ecstasy and cocaine worth at least £3 million into Britain. He was later convicted of drug trafficking but released on temporary licence - before making off again. Tracking down Evans was a global operation - given his previous links to the United States, the Netherlands and the Caribbean. As part of Operation Zygos in 2012, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) said it believed the disgraced Pontarddulais businessman was among a group of British fugitives hiding in Cyprus. Lord Ashcroft, founder and Chair of Crimestoppers, said the organisation was ‘extremely relieved’ to hear of Evans' arrest . He added: ‘There are now eight individuals remaining (in the Operation Zygos probe), thought to be evading justice overseas and I have every confidence we will succeed in finding them’. Evans will appear at Pretoria Regional Court tomorrow for an extradition hearing.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Just one fizzy drink a day can damage a teenager's ability to remember information, a study has found . Just one fizzy drink a day can damage teenagers' memory, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of Southern California found the sugar-laden drinks can affect people's ability to learn. As well as causing obesity, the drinks have also been blamed for making youngsters more violent. Now, experiments have found their impair the brain's activity, and aptitude for remembering information. Dr Scott Kanoski, of the University of Southern California, said: 'It is no secret refined carbohydrates, particularly when consumed in soft drinks and other beverages, can lead to metabolic disturbances. 'However, our findings reveal that consuming sugar-sweetened drinks is also interfering with our brain’s ability to function normally and remember critical information about our environment, at least when consumed in excess before adulthood.' In the study, both adult and adolescent rats were given daily access to sweetened beverages that mirrored high fructose corn syrup or sucrose sugar concentrations found in common soft drinks. The adults performed normally in tests of cognitive function after a month. But when consumption occurred during adolescence, the rats performed poorly in tests of learning and memory capability. In addition to causing memory impairment, adolescent sugar sweetened beverage consumption also produced inflammation in the hippocampus, an area of the brain that controls many learning and memory functions. Dr Kanoski, who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behaviour in Seattle, added: 'The hippocampus is such a critical brain region for memory function. 'In many ways this region is a canary in the coal mine, as it is particularly sensitive to insult by various environmental factors, including eating foods that are high in saturated fat and processed sugar.' There is no recommended number of soft and fizzy drinks that children can have. But the NHS advises, as part of a healthy balanced diet, it is important they do not have too many, especially between meals. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey found soft drinks were the largest contributor to sugar intake for children aged four to 18 years, with four to 10-year-olds getting 16 per cent of their’s from them, with the figure rising to 29 per cent for older children. In the U.S., research has revealed children and teenagers drink three times more soft drinks than their parents did 20 years ago. Scientists at the University of Southern California found sugary drinks interferes with the brain's ability to function normally, remember critical information, especially when consumed in excess before adulthood .","Study at University of Southern California found sugar-laden drinks can affect young people's ability to learn .

"By . Rehema Figueiredo . Former Victoria's Secret Angel Miranda Kerr might be blessed with supermodel looks but over half of British women don't believe her claim that she takes 15 minutes to get ready and leave the house in the morning. The busy mum of one (son Flynn is three years old), who also runs her own company, wrote recently in her blog: 'I usually have very little time in the mornings, especially with a toddler, so with these simple skin and beauty steps I can get out the door in 15 minutes.' Kerr's daily regime starts with a glass of warm water with the juice of half an organic lemon followed by dry body brushing, which she describes as an 'integral'. Scroll down for videos . No way!: Most women don't believe that Miranda Kerr, 31,  takes 15 minutes to go from bedhead to glamazon . In a survey carried out by Escentual.com, a quarter of women said it would take them 15 minutes to have a shower, let alone put on a full face of make-up, which for Miranda Kerr involves applying tinted day cream, concealer, three coats of mascara and lip balm. The supermodel does seem to have something in common with the average woman, saying that she multi-tasks in the shower by cleansing her face and body with  Kora Organics Foaming Cleanser and Essential Body Wash, part of her own line of organic beauty products. A third of the women who responded to the survey said that they would finish applying their make-up on their commute to work if they were in a rush. Out of 1,000 women who took part in the research most said that Kerr's routine would take them at least 40 minutes from start to finish and nearly half don't believe that supermodels need less time to get ready. A third of respondents said they would never leave the house after just a quarter of an hour of preparation, however busy they were. Fresh: The supermodel's day time look is always immaculate as she freshens up during the day using a mist . Escentual Beauty Editor Emma Leslie said: 'We found that most women would like to have around 45 minutes to get ready for the day so that they felt confident to face the world. 'But it’s fair to say that supermodels like Miranda Kerr may not need quite as much time to look beautiful.' Kerr did admit to freshening up throughout the day, carrying a mist in her handbag to keep her skin hydrated and always looks immaculate so perhaps she wasn't stretching the truth after all. 124160 . 97315 . 68058 . 88399 . 120675 . 29908 . 26866 . 117952 . 26866 . 22779 . 30070 . 62648 . 43120 . 59049 . 78972 . 39892 . 42240 . 77920 . 45837 . 68894 . 237536 . 90442 .","Miranda's morning routine involves dry brushing before a shower .

"By . Steve Doughty . Every home in the country will have to cope with compulsory rubbish recycling schemes by next year, according to papers released by ministers yesterday. Instructions prepared for councils have revealed a move to bring in separate collections of paper, metal, plastic and glass in order to meet recycling targets set by Brussels. This will mean that many homes will need more bins and any local councils which have clung to traditional weekly bin rounds – there are thought to be around 100 in England and Wales – will have to establish compulsory recycling systems. Ministers have laid out plans for all  households to have multiple recycling systems for glass, paper and metal . Although some of the materials can be collected in the same bins, documents prepared by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) explain that this can rarely be done for glass – and claim that in other cases separate bins will often prove ‘necessary’. The push for multi-bin rubbish collection systems follows new figures which show that the amount of household refuse successfully sent for recycling is now going down rather than up. The statistics, which were released yesterday by Defra, show that in September last year the recycling rate of waste from households was 43.9 per cent – down from 44.1 per cent the year before. A spokesman for Defra said: ‘We are working to ensure we meet an EU target to recycle 50 per cent of household waste. Figures show recycling in the UK has gone down rather than up despite aims to recycle 50 per cent of waste . ‘Everyone has a role to play and we want local authorities working with waste management companies to make it as easy for people to recycle as possible.’ But Doretta Cocks, a spokesman for the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections, said: ‘The Government has been going in the wrong direction. They are going to struggle to meet the target. ‘People are resentful. A lot of people don’t bother to recycle properly now. They say that if the council isn’t bothered to collect the rubbish once a week, then I’m not bothered about recycling properly.’","Ministers have laid out plans for households to have multiple bins .

An earlier version of this article wrongly said that Brussels had set a target of 50% of waste to be recycled per home. In fact, as the sub-heading now makes clear, the target is for 50% of the total amount of waste to be recycled."

Core customers for bargain stores and major retailers like Wal-Mart have been among the hardest hit by the recession and its aftermath because of job instability. Family Dollar has struggled and has attempted to reinvigorate sales by lowering prices on almost 1,000 basic items. It's cut some jobs and shuttered underperforming stores. The company had been conducting a strategic review since the winter, and investor Carl Icahn urged Family Dollar last month to put itself up for sale. Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser said Monday that the deal will give Dollar Tree more than 13,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada. That is nearly three times as many stores as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., though Wal-Mart's square footage is still greater. The combined Dollar Tree-Family Dollar chain will have sales of more than $18 billion and Sasser says that the transaction will create a more diverse company with an enhanced geographic reach.

"By . Daniel Mills . The President of the Business Council of Australia, Catherine Livingstone, said some students are better off with a trade . School leavers should consider going into trades rather than university as a deregulated fee system threatens to almost double the cost of a degree. That's the view of Business Council of Australia President Catherine Livingstone, who said there are 'too many people' already enrolled in universities in Australia and more should learn skills for the workforce. Universities will set their own fees from 2016, making tertiary education unaffordable for some. Prof Livingstone said the introduction of deregulated system could see more people undertake vocational education training as they weigh up the benefits and costs of various types of education. 'I would say there are too many people going to university and not enough going through the VET system,' Ms Livingstone told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I just think some students would be better off with vocation and skill training and having work experience.' Vocational Education Trade providers such as TAFE could offer substantial benefits to some school leavers . Her comments, made before a Group of Eight universities meeting at the National Press Club last week, come after education experts predicted back in June that the Federal Government's changes to higher education could force the cost of degrees to increase to more than $120,000. The high cost of education could deter people from furthering their studies at university and some have predicted loan repayments will almost double from $6.6 billion this year to $12 billion in 2018. The Treasury Department has modeled its own dire forecast for tertiary graduates, claiming that 65,000 people, or 30 per cent of graduates, will be without a job four months after finishing their studies in 2016. Group of Eight universities chairman Ian Young told the National Press Club last that many elite universities, such as his own Australian National University, would probably enrol fewer students under a deregulated fee system. The University of NSW could be one of Australia's  leading institutions which set their own fees from 2016 . He added that a decline in enrolments would allow them more personalised learning experience for students at research universities, and would free-up positions for high-achieving students and academics to attend regional and suburban universities. Australia's leading research universities typically enrol up to two thirds the number of US universities, because under a capped fee system universities need student numbers to subsidise research programs. Institutions such as ANU, Sydney and Melbourne, can enrol up to 50,000 students whereas Standford, in the US, enrol just 15,000. Education Minister Christopher Pyne has justified fee deregulation by pointing out there will still be benefits to having a degree. He said graduates will be earning about 75 per cent more than non-graduates - or about $1 million more over their lifetimes, but Greens higher education spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon disagrees. She said: 'It beggars belief the government would introduce these changes when their own department's figures show fewer graduates will be employed.'","Business Council President said more people should consider a trade .

Fijian-born Canterbury Crusaders' winger Nemani Nadolo claims he was called a 'chubby N*****' after the side's nail-biting loss to the Waratahs in Saturday's Super Rugby final. The 120kg winger, who has been described by his coach as a 'hulk of a man,' not only had to deal with the disappointment of the one-point loss but had to swallow the words of an unknown person who he alleged called him an 'UN FIT CHUBBY N****.' 'After all I've done to contribute to tis (sic) lovely city of Christchurch to be called an 'UN FIT CHUBBY N****.' is disappointing. #hurtful' he posted to Twitter in the early hours of Monday morning. The incredibly talented winger, who scored a try in the Crusaders' 30-31 point loss, said it was 'hurtful' he was called 'unfit' for the game after having given much to Christchurch. The Canterbury Crusaders has confirmed it is investigating the source of the comment. Nadolo has not given any indication as to who made the comment, but Crusaders Coach Todd Blackadder told Daily Mail Australia it was made during after-hours celebrations back in Christchurch. Nemani Nadolo responded to a racial taunt by posting the allegations on twitter . 'Nemani was out with the boys at drinks and someone made a really racist slur,' he said. He confirmed Nadolo had never met the person, he called the Christchurch's 'lowest common denominator' and the club wasn't investigating further. 'It is one of those really disappointing things shouldn't tarnish all . 'He did a bloody good job to react.' 'He took it on the chin didn't tell any of the Crusaders team mates.' The first they heard of it was when he tweeted it on social media, he said, and Nadolo has since tweeted to followers to thank them for their support since he publicly airing the comment. 'Thank u 2 all 4 the kind tweets. whatever has been said is said. I'm just blessed 2 b here. not gonna let one person ruin it. #movingon' Since his first tweet, many former union greats backed into his corner and gave their own words of encouragement. Former Auckland Blues player Ben Atiga said he was he was disgusted but ""not surprised"" by the abuse, 'One of my first outings there was quite similar,' while rugby league legend Monty Betham said the comment represented the 'blinded minority'. 'New Zealand loves you. You're the man and started the Crusader resurgence this year.' Nadolo scored a try in the nail-biting loss to the Waratah's and was arguably the best player on the night . The winger made a number of destructive runs down the Waratahs' right edge all night . Nadolo, a Fijian, has captained the national team the Fijian Warriors and spent one Super Rugby season with the Waratahs in 2009. Crusaders' coach Todd Blackadder said at the start of the season he was set to be one of the most exciting players in the 2014 Super Rugby competition, and he didn't disappoint. Nadolo was one of the star performers of the Super Rugby season, scoring 12 tries in 14 matches. 'He is an absolute hulk of a man, yet he can fly down the field like you wouldn't believe for a man that size.'

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . On the ninth night of the XX Commonwealth Games and 329 days after his last competitive run, it came to pass that Usain Bolt made it on to the track. There had been pre-race talk that he might be booed for criticising Glasgow 2014. There was even an aborted campaign urging people to turn their backs on him. No chance. The fans had paid their money to see the greatest foot-racer in history and accorded him the rapture that has accompanied him every long stride of his journey since he redrew the boundaries of human propulsion between the Augusts of 2008 and 2009. He might only have been in a 4x100 metres heat, but the benevolent crowds of families stood up and hollered their approval as he warmed up and waved at them. He smiled a big smile back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Usain Bolt bite back after Gabby Logan's comments . Star attraction: The Glasgow crowd has been waiting to see Usain Bolt in action . Number one: Usain Bolt ran the anchor leg for Jamaica as they qualified for Saturday's final . Too good: Usain Bolt celebrates victory in the 400x100m heats on his debut in Scotland . The predicted shunning was related to unguarded comments he apparently made in The Times, yet which he vehemently denies, slating the leaden skies of Glasgow, and possibly the whole ex-imperial shebang, as ‘a bit s***’. The BBC’s Gabby Logan had waded in, saying the Games were fine with or without their greatest star. And, after Phil Jones of the Beeb had won a gold medal for fawning in the post-race interview, Bolt chided Mrs Logan for her comments. ‘I heard somebody said they are enjoying the Games without Yohan Blake and me,’ he said. ‘Yeah, I’m talking to you. She knows who I am talking to. I’m talking to you Gabby. I’m a fun person. Look at me. I was never worried about the reception I’d get because I know my true people would never say something like that. I always go to every country with an open mind.’ Controversy: Usain Bolt was critical of Gabby Logan for her comments about him . All smiles: Usain Bolt says he is enjoying the games and wasn't worried about the criticism he was getting . Star attraction: All eyes were on Usain Bolt as he led Jamaica to a comfortable victory . A bigger question than his treatment at the hands of a benevolent crowd was whether Bolt would run at all. Some cynics wondered whether he would pose with royals, lark at press conferences, lend his face to a hundred billboards paying him millions, sell the tickets, lend lustre to an event low on world-class stars — and then make his apologies, vaguely citing a sore hamstring or back. Was he ever thinking of that? ‘No, it’s a lie, it’s a lie. I was just looking forward to coming out here and showing the people that I’m here to have fun.’ There were at least two reasons why the chances of his withdrawing receded in the countdown to last night’s heat. One, after the brouhaha about his criticism of the Games, it would have been a PR disaster to scarper. Two, he probably intended running in any event because there was next to nothing to lose. Hampden has staged some great moments in its history. In 1960, the incomparable Real Madrid team beat Eintracht Frankfurt 7-3 in the final of the European Cup. And it would be idle to claim that last night’s action compared with that in terms of sporting quality. Historic moment: Hampden hosted the 1960 European Cup final between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt . Jamaica could well afford to be missing the individual 100m champion, Kemar Bailey-Cole and the 200m silver medallist Jason Livermore. They were up against, among others, Montserrat and the might of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Qualification was virtually assured before the gun went off. Bolt was handed the baton pretty much at the same time as Nigeria’s Mark Jelks. He ran into the lead comfortably, even if he was slightly panting afterwards. He and Jamaica went through to Saturday’s final, of course. But more than that, by merely being here, Bolt provided 40,000-plus people with the chance to sear the sight of his presence into their memories.","Bolt leads Jamaica safely through to Saturday's 4x100m final .

"By . Damien Gayle . Fears are growing that the most lethal form of the Ebola virus can mutate into an airborne pathogen, making the spread of the terrifying disease more difficult to check. It was previously thought the untreatable virus, which causes massive internal bleeding and multiple organ failure, could only be transmitted through contact with infected blood. But now Canadian researchers have carried out experiments showing how monkeys can catch the deadly disease from infected pigs without coming into direct contact. Deadly: The Ebola virus, which causes fever-like . symptoms, usually followed by organ failure and unstoppable bleeding, . and eventually death. New research shows that it could be transmitted through the air . 'Our findings support the hypothesis that airborne transmission may contribute to spread, specifically from pigs to primates, and may need to be considered in assessing transmission from animals to humans in general,' they said. The findings come as scores of people in Uganda were yesterday isolated to prevent the spread of a new Ebola outbreak that has already killed three in the country. Ebola cause fatal haemorrhagic fevers in humans and many other species of non-human primates. It was first reported in 1976 in Congo and is named for the river where it was recognized. There is no cure or vaccine for it. The illness is 'characterised by fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, sore throat, and weakness, followed by diarrhoea, vomiting, and stomach pain,' according to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 'A rash, red eyes, hiccups and internal and external bleeding may be seen in some patients.' The virus is known to be transmitted through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person, or objects that have been contaminated with infected secretions. It is often spread during communal funerals where there has been an outbreak when the bereaved come into contact with an Ebola victim. In some cases, it can trigger organ failure and unstoppable bleeding, killing a previously healthy adult within days. One of the deadliest diseases known, it has killed two-thirds of the roughly 1,850 people who have been diagnosed with it. Experts say this extreme virulence is its weak spot. The virus can be contained because it kills its victims faster than it can spread to new ones. However, if the disease is now airborne it could make containment more difficult. Highly contagious: A Medicins Sans Frontieres team prepares to move eight Ebola patients from a government isolation ward to a newly installed MSF ward in Bundibugyo during a 2007 outbreak . Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg deliberately infected six piglets with the ebola virus and put them in pens where macaque monkeys were housed in wire cages. Within eight days all four monkeys caught the virus through indirect contact, according to the study published in the journal Scientific Reports. Ebola is thought to be introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa, infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found dead or ill in the rainforest. Once infected individuals return to their communities, Ebola spreads through human-to-human transmission resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Health-care workers have frequently been infected and must wear gloves, masks and goggles while treating patients suffering from Ebola. The viral haemorrhagic fever Ebola causes is often characterised by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding, and eventually death. Severe cases require intensive supportive care. No specific treatment or vaccine is yet available for Ebola, although several vaccines are in development. Dr Gary Kobinger from the National Microbiology Laboratory at the Public Health Agency of Canada took part in the study. He told BBC News that they suspect that large droplets of moisture containing the virus were being exhaled with the piglets' breath. 'They can stay in the air, but not long, they don't go far,' he told the broadcaster. 'But they can be absorbed in the airway and this is how the infection starts, and this is what we think, because we saw a lot of evidence in the lungs of the non-human primates that the virus got in that way.' Further work is needed but the findings are worrying as macaques are close genetic relatives to humans, said the researchers. Fruit bats are a known 'reservoir' for the Ebola virus, and people have also contracted the disease after handling infected chimps, gorillas, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines. But this research suggests that wild or domestic pigs could also be a natural host. The latest outbreak of the disease in Uganda - in a district just 40 miles from the capital Kampala - comes roughly a month after the country declared itself Ebola-free following an earlier outbreak in a remote district of western Uganda. The latest Ebola outbreak, officials say, is of the Sudan strain of Ebola and not linked to the previous one, of the Congo variety, which killed at least 16 villagers in July and August in the western district of Kibaale. In addition to the three dead in the latest outbreak, up to 15 are being monitored for signs of the disease, officials said. Ebola is especially feared in Uganda, where multiple outbreaks have occurred over the years, and news of it can cause patients to flee hospitals to avoid infection. In 2000, in one of the world's worst Ebola outbreaks, the disease infected 425 Ugandans and killed more than half of them in the country's north. Another outbreak in 2007 killed 37 people in Bundibugyo, a remote district close to the Congolese border.","Findings come as scores of Ugandans are isolated in latest outbreak .

"By . Nick Enoch . For most people, the threat of bottles, bones and stones gushing into their beds as they sleep is not exactly high. But for one community in Jamaica, it is something they have to deal with every night - along with the risk of being assaulted, raped or even murdered... just for being gay. Such is the life of one group of homeless LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) youths who live in a storm drain (or 'gully') in the country's capital, Kingston - as revealed in a short documentary made by VICE News. Scroll down for video (Warning: contains strong language) Homeless gay and transgender youngsters have made a home for themselves in a mosquito-infested storm drain (or 'gully') in Kingston, Jamaica . The Gully Queens, as they call themselves, have sought refuge in the drains after being forced out from shacks, derelict buildings, and sometimes by their own families . One of the inhabitants washes in the storm drain under a hydrant, from which clean water flows. Homophobia is rife in Jamaica, with 80 per cent of the population harbouring anti-gay sentiment . The Gully Queens, as they call themselves, have sought refuge in the drains after being forced out from shacks, derelict buildings, and sometimes by their own families. Unwilling to hide their sexuality, the sense of community and relative safety the gully provides acts as a welcome sanctuary. For that reason, a hint of optimism pervades the lives of the Gully Queens, who go by such colourful names as Pebbles, Batman, Rihanna and Beyonce. They try to live as dignified a life as possible, given their filthy cockroach/mosquito-infested surroundings: clothes are laid out to dry on the side of the drain; they shower with clean water that gushes from a hydrant; and sleep on makeshift mattresses crafted from pallets and carpets. Unwilling to hide their sexuality, the sense of community and relative safety the gully provides acts as a welcome sanctuary . Khloe, one of the Gully Queens, whose transgendered friend Dwayne Jones was murdered in 2013 . A 'buggery' law still exists in Jamaica, harking back to colonial times, whereby anyone caught having anal sex faces 10 years of hard labour in jail - although homosexuality itself is not illegal . But at night, it can be cold, and there is the constant threat of someone jumping in to attack them. Homophobia is rife in Jamaica, with 80 per cent of the population harbouring anti-gay sentiment. There still exists a 'buggery' law, harking back to colonial times, whereby anyone caught having anal sex faces 10 years of hard labour in jail - although homosexuality itself is not illegal. The film - Young And Gay: Jamaica's Gully Queens - explores how young transgender and homosexual people are leading the fight against the Caribbean island nation's institutionalised homophobia through visibility, community spirit and an outspoken attitude towards their position in society. Violent attacks against the LGBT group are commonplace, with little to no retribution or justice brought against those responsible. Evangelical preachers who promote homophobia attract huge and receptive audiences, while lyrics in popular songs regularly include exhortations to 'kill the batty boys'. The Gully Queens do their best to scrape a living: selling biscuits, weed, alcohol and cigarettes, as well as engaging in sex work . Violent attacks against the LGBT group are commonplace, with little to no retribution or justice brought against those responsible . International advocacy groups often portray Jamaica as the most hostile country in the Western Hemisphere for gays and transgendered people. Between 2009 and 2012, a total of 231 reports were made to J-FLAG (Jamaica Forum of Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays). Gully Queen, Khloe . One of the Gully Queens is Khloe, whose friend Dwayne Jones - a transgender teen - was murdered in July 2013. Dwayne was relentlessly teased in high school for being effeminate until he dropped out. His father not only kicked him out of the house at the age of 14 but also helped jeering neighbours push the youngster from the rough Jamaican slum where he grew up. By the age of 16, the teenager was dead - beaten, stabbed, shot and run over by a car when he showed up at a street party dressed as a woman. His mistake: confiding to a friend that he was attending a 'straight' party as a girl for the first time in his life. 'When I saw Dwayne's body, I started shaking and crying,' Khloe told Associated Press. She was one of three transgendered friends who shared a derelict house with the teenager in the hills above the north coast city of Montego Bay. Like most transgenders and gays in Jamaica, Khloe wouldn't give a full name out of fear. 'It was horrible. It was so, so painful to see him like that.' Most incidents were related to assaults, physical attacks, and displacement from homes and communities. Other incidents included extortion and threats as well as sexual violence, particularly against lesbians and bisexual women. Homophobic attacks sometimes occur in broad daylight, with the footage then shared across social media. The run-up to the 2012 election provided a glimmer of hope for the gay community - when Jamaica's prime minister Portia Simpson Miller aimed to review the buggery law, in a show of support for gay rights - but she has since failed to follow through on her proposals. In the documentary, one Gully Queen resident told VICE News reporter Christo Geoghegan: 'We'll have drama in the gully every day. They even throw acid and chop [people] up.' However, Kingston's police force has its own take on the crisis. Christopher Murdoch, commanding officer of the New Kingston Police, said there were problems with the 'diverse, sexual group' in the gully who 'use the umbrella of the gay community to commit crimes' including 'stealing phones' from passers-by 'by threatening with knives or machetes'. For their part, the Gully Queens do their best to scrape a living: selling biscuits, weed, alcohol and cigarettes, as well as sex work. One resident, Daggering [who sees himself as female], said that when people found out he was gay, he went to live in a squat, where he made many friends. Then one night, someone came in and killed two of his companions by cutting their throats. During the documentary, Daggering is seen celebrating his birthday. One of his friends, Trina Boss Bitch, says, 'I wish she lives to see many, many more.' But as the Gully Queens know only too well: a life can be worth little on the streets of Jamaica.","New VICE News documentary reveals life led by gay and transgender youth in central Kingston .

"By . Darren Boyle . Armed robber Charles Bronson, who was born Michael Gordon Peterson attacked a dozen staff at Full Sutton prison in York . Charles Bronson is to sell off pieces of his artwork to raise money to send his mother on holiday as an apology for attacking 12 prison guards after the FA Cup final, it emerged yesterday. The career criminal, who is a fanatical Tottenham Hotspur fan was outraged after north London rivals Arsenal beat Hull in the FA Cup. The armed robber was especially annoyed as Hull went two goals ahead before being defeated in extra time. In response, Bronson smeared himself in Lurpack butter and attacked a dozen prison officers. Bronson's mother Eira, 85, is said to have been upset by her son's latest rampage in Full Sutton prison in York on May 17 after Arsenal's latest FA Cup success. Now, Bronson, 61, has instructed Ronnie Kray's ex-wife Katie to include several of his own artworks in a sale of gangster memorabilia being auctioned on June 17. The paintings are being sold by JP Humbert auctioneers in Towcester, Northants and are expected to reach at least £5,000. Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert describes the works as 'a peak into the mind of an intelligent man with some issues'. Bronson uses art to explain some of his darkest fantasies and his mental struggles. One picture shows eight books stacked on top of each other each with parts of Bronson’s life named on the spine, with various terrifying faces around it inside a cell. Each painting will have a minimum estimate of between £400-£600. There are a total of ten Charles Bonson related items included in the sale. The 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur fan was outraged by these jubilant scenes following Arsenal's 11th FA Cup victory in Wembley Stadium last month . Bronson, smeared himself in Lurpack butter and attacked a dozen prison officers. Now the 61-year-old Spurs fan wants to sell his artworks, including this one, to send his mother on holiday . Bronson has written to Ronnie Kray's ex-wife Kate to sell ten items of memorabilia including several of his artworks, including this one titled 'A day in the life of life' which has an auction estimate of £400-£600 . According to Mr Humbert: 'Charles Bronson recently had a ‘rumble’ with twelve prison guards. 'In a letter to Kate Kray, he states remorse at upsetting his mother and accordingly, asked if some of his artwork could be included in the sale so as to generate funds to send his mother on holiday. 'The intimate and personal nature of these never-before seen Kray items and Bronson paintings show a real human side to these larger than life personalities. 'Although they are bound to polarise opinions, the lots, much like the individuals, are far from dull. 'It’s almost impossible to say how much they will go for, the market will dictate that, but with his art selling for up to £1,000 a piece in the past there will be a lot of interest. 'We have already had a lot of people phoning up to ask about the pictures. 'They are a peak into the mind of an intelligent man who, well lets say, has had a lot of issues. 'I would put an initial estimate of £400 to £600 but that is a starting estimate. 'There is no reserve on it, and I fully expect us to see a lot of interest in two weeks when it goes on sale. This is a very important and eclectic sale of British social history.' Bronson wants to use the funds generated from the sale to send his mother Eira Peterson on holiday as an apology for his most recent prison rampage . In one of the artworks for sale in the auction, Bronson, 61, calls for Kate Kray to be appointed prime minister and claims to have been 'born insane' He is also selling a handwritten poem entitled Asylum about Ronnie Kray . Bronson, asked Kate Kray, pictured, to include his paintings in a sale of her husband's memorabilia later this month . Bronson was jailed for seven years following a raid on a post office in 1974.  In the past 40 years, he has only been a free man for just four months and nine days. He has spent a total of 36 years in solitary confinement due to his violent outbursts. Much of his artwork relates to violent scenes involving prison offers and have featured in exhibitions around the globe. He has taken hostages in ten different sieges as well as injuring 30 prison officers. He has caused at least £500,000 worth of damages in rooftop protests. In 1999, he was sentenced to life for taking education worker Phil Danielson hostage for 44 hours for criticism of his art.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A wrestling champion used the skills he honed in the ring to subdue a suspected thief he saw leaving his Phoenix home with week. When WWE star Bryan Danielson - known as Daniel Bryan in the ring - saw two men leaving his house on Thursday night he quickly gave chase, and was able to stop one suspect by using a wrestling hold. Danielson is known for his signature Yes hold during World Wrestling Entertainment events, but in this instance he used a 'rear naked choke hold' to stop Cesar Sosa, 22. Scroll down for video . Ready to rumble: Daniel Bryan, during a wrestling contest in Dublin last year, managed to catch a man suspected of breaking into his home Thursday night . According to police, Danielson and his wife, Brianna, were driving into the carport of their Arcadia home when they say a door to the house start to open. Arrested: Cesar Sosos faces burglary charges over the break in . That's when Danielson and his wife -  WWE star Brie Bella - ran inside to check on their dog, Josie. 'I saw the guys running out the back. I chased them. I caught one of them. I kept him until police got there,' Danielson said. Danielson and Sosa  got into a struggle, but the former champ subdued him until officers arrived, Phoenix police sergeant Tommy Thompson said. The second suspect got away. The former champ said he didn't have to apply the Yes! lock to get Sosa to surrender, but he did put him in a rear naked choke hold. 'Unfortunately, he wasn't in very good shape, so it didn't take much,' Danielson said. Sosa was arrested and faces a burglary charge. It was not known if he had an attorney who could be reached for comment. Thompson said Sosa also had a felony warrant for burglary and kidnapping in another case. Danielson, who was returning from the airport, said he was grateful that his neighbors had called 911 to report suspicious activity about 10 minutes before the couple arrived home. 'I got really angry at first. They're actually lucky that I got them instead of Brie, because she probably would have been a little more violent,' he said. Champ: WWE star Daniel Bryan used a wrestling hold to subdue the suspected thief while he waited for police . Protector: Daniel Bryan, with wife and wrestling star Brie Bella, says the couple were concerned that their dog may have been taken . He added that despite being usually mild-mannered, the break in and felt like an invasion and he just reacted angrily to it, Danielson told TMZ. 'Warning others against reacting the same way, Danielson said: 'I'm a little borderline ashamed. It's probably not the best thing to do because you don't know what will happen.' Brianna Danielson said that while her husband chased after the intruders, she found their dog, Josie, hiding in the couple's bathroom. 'We didn't know if they had Josie, too,' she said. They were able to retrieve some of their belongings, including an engraved bracelet that Danielson's father had given him just before he died.

"By . Patricia Shipp . OJ Simpson is not only pining for his freedom, he also longs for the days when he was described as a handsome hunk and not a flabby failure. And he's finally doing something about it. According to a close family friend, the 66-year-old disgraced gridiron great is desperately trying to lose weight, tired of reading published reports that he is old and fat since he appeared at a bail hearing last summer in an effort to have his 2008 armed-robberty conviction overturned. 'OJ has been upset. Everybody keeps talking about how he's gained so much weight and that he looks awful!' the friend explained. Scroll down for video . Cookie monster: Since he appeared at a parole hearing last year, OJ Simpson has packed on the pounds.Tired of people mocking of his considerable girth, he's passing on the sweets to try to get back into shape . Back in the day: OJ cut a handsome figure in the mid-'80's. The top notch athlete had everything going for him until the night wife Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered on June 12, 1994 . He was described as bloated, overweight and struggling to walk with his bad knees. He was tipping the scale at 300 pounds. When the the hearing was over,  OJ was transported from the Las Vegas jail back to his cell in the Lovelock, Nevada Correctional Center where he began reading reports about his case. But after briefly mentioning what happened in court, everyone seemed to focus on his appearance calling him an ugly old fat man who could barely walk. 'OJ was really p***** off because he's used to being called the hunk, handsome or a lady's man so he decided to start getting more exercise and eating less carbs and junk food,' the friend continued. 'At one time OJ was dubbed the 'cookie monster' at Locklock because he would grab as many cookies as he could in the chow hall and he would also try to sneak cookies back to his cell. 'One time he got caught by the guards and they embarrassed him in front of the other inmates. He also loves ice cream sandwiches and would eat three or four at a time. 'OJ would rather eat junk food than what they had for lunch or dinner in the chow hall.' Inmates typically eat hot or cold cereal like oatmeal or Cheerios for breakfast. For lunch they typically get cold sandwiches of bologna or peanut butter with carrots or some oher veggies on the side and there is a rotation burgers, hot dogs and some sort of pasta for dinner. 'The food is terrible but it's better for you than chips and ice cream. OJ through thick and thin: The gridiron star was almost gaunt when he was arrested for wife Nicole's murder in 1994. By 2001, he was living large in Miami. His face was puffy, but he still looked robust . By the time he was convicted of burglary, robbery and kidnapping in 2008, OJ was looking tired an paunchy. But it was at his parole hearing last year that his cookie-and-ice-cream diet took it's true toll in pounds . 'OJ is being careful not to eat the pasta . but he will eat the burgers without the bread. He can also buy canned . vegetables or canned tuna from the commissary and he's doing more of that instead of chips and cookies. He says its not so much that he likes the junk food but rather the horrible food the prison is giving the inmates is the reason he eats chips instead of the green hot dogs. 'I gained weight eating all those canned beans from the commissary but just because I can't get enough fruits and vegetables,' Simpson reportedly said about his weight gain. ""My family's been bugging me to stop with the beans.' 'The truth is OJ has a sweet tooth and loves to eat ice cream outside while he's coaching the baseball team,' the family friend explained, 'and he walked around the prison yard when the weather is nice but if it's cold or raining his sits in his cell watching TV eating junk from the commissary. But now he started walking more frequently ant curbing the treats and he's dropped about 30 pounds, says the friend. 'OJ can't run because his knees are really banged up from years of playing football so he walks around the perimeter of the prison yard for as long as he can before his knees start to ache. 'Sometimes he can walk for about an hour and sometimes it's just 30 minutes and he's not eating as much junk anymore. OJ gets exhausted, he's out there huffing and puffing but when his knees start to hurt he can't do it anymore. 'OJ says sometimes it feels like sharp needles are going through his legs and it's so painful he care barely get back to his cell to lie down.' Home cookin': OJ resides at Locklock, Nevada Correctional Center now, where a friend says he is getting more exercise and eating less carbs and junk. 'The food is terrible' OJ had gained weight eating pasta, cookies, Hostess cakes and ice cream from the commissary and he could get as much as he wanted because women are still sending money to put on his books while still collecting money from his NFL pension, explains the firend. 'OJ is also in the 'pill line' everyday because he has to take meds for his high blood pressure. He's hoping once he gets his weight down his blood pressure will be back to normal. 'He has a lot of health problems but he didn't think about trying to get them under control until everyone started calling him a fat pig. And he was afraid the ladies would stop writing and sending pictures of themselves to him. 'OJ's priorities are still backwards. 'OJ cares more about what women think of him instead of what his children think of him and what he plans to do if he's released on parole in 2017. The friend says is growing a goatee, it's completely white hair, but he's trying a different look hoping to distance himself from the 'old OJ' like that is going to help his image. In 2008, OJ was convicted on charges of burglary, robbery, kidnapping and assault while in possession of a deadly weapon related to a 2007 robbery of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas hotel.  OJ testified he was trying to retrieve those items because they belonged him but the jury rejected that explanation and he was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison. OJ is appealing his case to the Nevada Supreme Court but he's more hopeful he will be released when he is up for his next parole hearing in 2017.","Everyone has been focusing on OJ's appearance since his parole hearing last year, calling him an 'ugly old fat man' who can barely walk .

"By . Julian Robinson . This is the moment one of the bravest animals in Africa showed why it has so much respect - as it battled a whole pride of lions. The plucky honey badger was caught out in the open in the Kwando Concession Park, Botswana, and unluckily became the target for a group of lions. Stranded and weighing just 20lbs the badger decided to fight back against at least four young lions each 15 times its size. Surrounded: A pride of young lions circle the honey badger which, rather than running in the opposite direction, chooses to stand and confront its giant predators out in the open at the Kwando Concession Park . The honey badger's tough hide and surprising strength and ferocity made it a tricky customer for the lions who struggled to deliver the killer bite. Incredibly the pint-sized battler managed to resist the massive predators' attack for more than 30 minutes. Wildlife photographer James Haskins watched as the badger kept the lions at bay and eventually had to leave the scene still seeing the badger fighting back. He said: . 'A scene like this is extremely rare to witness, the lions - all young . lions by the way - tried their best to kill the young honey badger. 'It . was probably their first time to try out their hunting skills on this . animal and try as they might, they could not deliver a killer blow. Refusing to go down quietly, the honey badger does its best to evade the grip of an attacking lion . Last stand: One of the lions eventually manages to clamp its jaws around the tiny frame of the honey badger. But because of its tough hide the animal continues to put up a fight . 'The honey badgers skin is so though that the ions could not suffocate it or pull it apart - something lions certainly don't struggle with other less tenacious victims. 'Half an hour passed with the lions biting, chewing, clawing at the badger - but still the young honey badger just kept growling and fighting. 'We left the scene with the lions still passing around the badger between them - none of them knowing what to do to kill the animal.' Honey badgers are found all over Africa and India and are known for their intelligence and ferocious attitude even when confronted by animals much bigger than them - with documented fights with lions, hyenas and even rhinos. Against all odds: The brave honey badger does its best to wriggle free from the lion's grip in a fight lasting more than 30 minutes . Honey badgers are found all over Africa and India and are known for their intelligence and ferocious attitude even to animals much bigger than them - with documented fights with lions, hyenas and even rhinos . It is a mustelid and bears some similar characteristics to both a badger and the much smaller weasel. In popular culture throughout Africa, the animal - also known as a Ratel - is known for its fighting nature and the South African military have a vehicle named after it . One famous South African honey badger named Stoffel was made famous in the BBC2 documentary Honey Badgers: Masters of Mayhem aired on Good Friday this year. Stoffel repeatedly outfoxed his keepers escaping from his enclosure and even breaking into his owner's house to raid the fridge.","Honey badger caught in the open in Kwando Concessions Park, Botswana .

"By . Andrew Levy . 'Sheer greed': John Mulholland, is published widely in academic journals, billed the NHS for work that was never done . A leading heart expert’s career is in tatters after he was convicted of a million pound fraud against an NHS trust. John Mulholland, who has an international reputation and is published widely in academic journals, billed the NHS for work that was never done. He and several colleagues were employed by Basildon Hospital in Essex, which they jokingly referred to as ‘Bas Vegas’ – a reference to the gambling resort of Las Vegas. But while they were being paid full-time salaries, they were moonlighting at other NHS trusts. Over four years, the fraudsters were overpaid by about £420,000. Private work they did at other hospitals netted a further £700,000. The court heard how the defendants reminded each other in emails about doing ‘face shows’ – turning up to work from time to time to stop other staff becoming suspicious about their whereabouts. They worked as clinical perfusionists – specialists who operate heart and lung machines during procedures including cardiac surgery. Opening the case in May, prosecutor Shaun Collery told jurors: ‘This is in many respects a sad case. ‘It involves one of the perfusion medical teams at Basildon Hospital engaging in a fraud. ‘They provided significant services to the public and were rewarded by a salary but it was not enough. They started to earn more by doing less and engaging in activities which stole from their employer, the public purse and from you.’ Basildon Crown Court heard Mulholland, 41, Ann Clements, 51, and Martin Oliver, 37, all of east London, and Tom Cumberland, 42, of Penge, south-east London, were directors of a private company they set up called London Perfusion Science Ltd (LPS). Each was contracted to work up to 37.5 hours a week for Basildon and Thurrock University NHS Foundation Trust. But between February 2007 and November 2011 they were paid for 14,000 hours they did not work – 45 per cent of the time they claimed for. Instead, they were boosting their incomes at other hospitals. Mulholland, who graduated from Edinburgh University and was chief perfusion scientist at Hammersmith Hospital in west London, submitted false time sheets. Probe: Police were called in by the health service’s fraud investigation department after the fraudsters movements were tracked electronically . When bosses became suspicious they tracked the colleagues’ movements through an electronic security system, which monitors staff entry to the car park and building. Police were then called in by the health service’s fraud investigation department. Six people were subsequently charged with conspiracy to defraud. All denied the offence and two non-directors of LPS were acquitted. The four found guilty on Wednesday will be sentenced next month and face up to ten years in jail. None is employed by Basildon Hospital currently. Speaking after the convictions, Crown Prosecution Service deputy head of fraud Andrew Penhale said: ‘Unlike other private health work, which is legitimately undertaken by senior health professionals with the full knowledge of the NHS, this was fraud, pure and simple. ‘These defendants held respected roles in their profession and exploited the trust and responsibility given to them to dishonestly make money through sheer greed.’ Basildon and Thurrock Trust said the group had ‘cheated the NHS out of scarce resources’. It added: ‘We have now introduced strict controls to try to prevent such fraud occurring again.’","John Mulholland and several colleagues billed for work that was never done .

"By . Bianca London . From the Atkins to the Dukan diet, there have been hundreds of eating programmes over the years promising to aid weight loss. Most recently, the 5:2 diet, . which advocates eating just 500 calories (600 for men) on two . non-consecutive days each week, then normally for the other five, became the diet-de-jour. But now it seems that dieters are taking a step back in time and turning to the flappers for inspiration. As art deco spectacle The Great Gatsby is launched in cinemas the 90-year-old diet technique followed by glamorous 1920s flapper girls is experiencing a resurgence. Blast from the past: The 1920s saw flappers as the feminine ideal and to achieve the look they embarked on The Hay Diet, which is seeing a resurgence . Famous fans: Liz Hurley and Catherine Zeta Jones are followers of The Hay Diet, which is making a comeback from the 1920s when it was first founded . First created in the 1920s by physician William Howard Hay, the Hay Diet was created to achieve the slim, . hip-less, flat-chested look of the dancers. Its principles have stood the test of time and it has garnered much praise by nutrition experts for its far-reaching health benefits as well as its ability to help manage body weight. Unlike faddy crash diets or cleanses, the Hay Diet promotes the idea that it's not so much what you eat, but what you choose to eat with it- artist Man Rey was a notable fan in the 1920s and modern fans include Elizabeth Hurley and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The Hay Diet is based on the principle . of segregating certain food types to maintain a healthy weight and the key to the diet is understanding that some food groups shouldn't be consumed with others. One such mix is carbohydrates and proteins. Whilst following the Hay Diet no one meal should contain both protein and carbohydrates at one sitting. How it works: The Hay Diet is based on the principle of segregating certain food types to maintain a healthy weight and the key to the diet is understanding that some food groups shouldn't be consumed with others, but is it really effective? This is because dieters believe that the body's natural ability to digest food and burn fat is hindered and slowed down by tackling both protein and carbohydrate foods at the same time. In the Hay Diet framework, food is also grouped into two further categories - alkaline and acidic. This is to ensure that ones diet is not too acidic as this is believed to be the cause of health complications such as acid indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). High acidic foods they advise avoided are cranberries, white flour and cheese, which should be replaced by low acidic foods such as spinach, plums and eggs. Foods high in alkaline are lemons, asparagus and mangoes, with bananas, tomatoes and peas being a better option. The diet is also known to have greatly benefitted followers suffering with serious health complications such as allergies, arthritis and diabetes. Creator of newly launched website HayDiet.co.uk Philip Edwards said: 'Several celebrities and health experts have been very vocal about their positive experiences with the Hay Diet. No mixing: Whilst following the Hay Diet no one meal should contain both protein and carbohydrates at one sitting, but some nutritionists say this is 'unfounded' 'It is the perfect method for those who are looking to implement clean, healthy habits to boost their fat-burning abilities and boost their energy levels rather than a get-thin-quick scheme which often fails and leaves dieters with low energy and no significant difference in their weight.' Whilst it counts celebrities as fans, the theory that carbohydrate and protein rich foods should be eaten separately is considered 'unfounded' by some nutritionists who claim it ignores the fact that carbohydrate rich foods all contain significant amounts of protein. 'Eating protein separately from carbohydrates also tends to cause the body to burn the protein as an energy source rather than to build muscle', writes David Bender in A Dictionary of Food and Nutrition. THE GRAPEFRUIT DIET: The Grapefruit diet, also known as the Hollywood Diet and the 18-Day Diet today, saw women consume only 800 calories a day. They would munch on ‘fat-burning’ grapefruits to kick-start their metabolism, believing that if you ate grapefruit with unhealthy foods, it would somehow block fat. THE CHEW-CHEW DIET: Dating back to the Art Nouveau period, Art dealer Horace Fletcher, known as The Great Masticator, advocated a diet technique where you should chew but not swallow your food. He claimed by chewing on a piece of food 25 times but spitting it out would help you lose pounds. THE CIGARETTE DIET: In 1925 doctors prescribed tobacco cigarettes to patients wanting to shed pounds. THE TAPE-WORM DIET: The idea was that if you ingested a tapeworm, it would magically eat up all your food for you.","First created in the 1920s by physician William Howard Hay .

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . Formula One will return to Mexico for the first time in 23 years after it was announced the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez will be included on the 2015 calendar. There have been long-standing reports that F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has been negotiating with those who could put the wheels in motion for a comeback to the Mexico City location and now events company Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento (CIE) have confirmed a five-year deal has been struck. 'It is a fact,' CIE president Alejandro Soberon told a press conference at the Banamex Centre. 'Start your engines, F1 will return to Mexico next year. This is Mexico's time.' Scroll down for video . Last time out: Nigel Mansell darts into the first corner on his way to victory in 1992 . Ecclestone was not present at the announcement but did send a message echoing the comments of Soberon and welcoming Mexico back into the F1 fold. 'After 23 years of absence, I am pleased to confirm that Formula One will be back in Mexico City in 2015,' he said. 'I feel it is the right for F1 for and Mexico and I'm sure it will be to the benefit of both for many years. I look forward to welcoming you all to this global event next year.' The Williams of Nigel Mansell won the 1992 race with the Brit on his way to the drivers' championship, but the F1 fraternity has not returned since. A gap in the calendar, as well as taking logistics into account, means it is likely the race will run back-to-back with the United States Grand Prix held in Austin, Texas - although a concrete date is yet to be decided. Arriba! Sergio Perez has increased the profile of the sport in his homeland . It was confirmed that alterations and improvements will be made to the track, with spectator stands and pit garages also undergoing renovations to comply with FIA regulations. A grand prix around the streets of Azerbaijan capital Baku is also expected to be included from next year, which promises to present a packed season for the teams and drivers - with other races now likely to be unsure of their own respective futures on the calendar. Two drivers who will be hoping to be part of the long-awaited return will be the Mexican pair of Sergio Perez of Force India and Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez who would no doubt help draw a huge crowd, with organisers hoping for 180,000 spectators to attend over the three-day events.

"By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent . and Martin Robinson . Getting better: The Queen walked unaided out of the Marylebone hospital this afternoon after being taken there for treatment . last night . Only a day after being admitted to hospital for the first time in a decade, the Queen was yesterday well enough to go home. And far from spending the next week recuperating, as doctors have suggested, the Mail has learnt that she returned to work straight away. Instead of heading back to Windsor Castle last night, the monarch, who turns 87 next month, insisted on returning to Buckingham Palace to be briefed by her private office staff. She was joined by the 91-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, who had a public engagement at the Royal Thames Yacht Club in Knightsbridge last night. And even though she is expected to return to Windsor Castle at some point this week, she will continue to receive the ‘red boxes’ of official paperwork that follow her wherever she goes. The monarch, who will celebrate the 60th anniversary of her coronation in June, went down with a debilitating case of gastoenteritis on Friday and was advised to rest at Windsor Castle for the weekend. The Queen much prefers the relative informal nature of Windsor to Buckingham Palace and considers it to be her true ‘home’. But on Sunday afternoon, concerned doctors decided she should be taken to King Edward VII hospital for monitoring. And although Buckingham Palace said she would be kept in for two days, her racing green Bentley accompanied by four police outriders unexpectedly arrived outside the central London hospital yesterday lunchtime. The Queen, who had earlier in the day been visited and given the all-clear by her personal physician, Professor John Cunningham, stepped briskly through the front door. Wearing a pillar-box red coat with Queen Victoria’s diamond bow brooch pinned to her left shoulder and her beloved pearls around her neck, the Queen had a sparkle in her eye and a spring in her step. The only possible sign of her treatment was a black glove on her left hand, which might have been to cover the tell-tale signs of an intravenous drip. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . With a handbag over one arm, and clutching a neck scarf and one glove as she prepared to shake the hands of waiting hospital staff, the Queen emerged in good spirits . She left hospital this afternoon after being admitted with symptoms of gastroenteritis 24 hours ago . Despite suffering from debilitating sickness, the 86-year-old refused to allow an ambulance to collect her . This morning she received a visit from her personal physician, Professor John Cunningham, who arrived by scooter. The visit it is believed to have led to her being discharged . It would be entirely routine for him to assess the Queen in this way, in addition to the care she is receiving from the private hospital's own staff . Doctors monitored the Queen very closely before her exit. They were checking that the 86-year-old was properly hydrated and monitoring her pulse and blood pressure . Exit: The smiling Queen left King Edward VII Hospital this afternoon and thanked staff for their care over the past 24 hours . Going home: Despite feeling very poorly over recent days Her Majesty showed she was in good spirits as she left hospital and got into her Bentley (right) After warmly thanking the nursing staff for their care, she sped off without a glance at the waiting cameras. A few minutes later her standard rose at Buckingham Palace, indicating that her first stop was her official London home. A source told the Mail: ‘The Queen will be staying at Buckingham Palace overnight.’ She has cancelled her official . engagements for the rest of the week, including a two-day trip to Rome, . but it is anticipated that she will be well enough to undertake a number . of official engagements scheduled for next week. It was only the fifth occasion in her six- decade reign that the Queen had been taken to hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for acute pregnancy-related sickness in December . Doctors have speculated that the Queen is suffering from norovirus, the winter vomiting bug that closes hundreds of hospital wards every year . Despite being allowed home the Queen's diary for this week would remain suspended, the Palace has confirmed . Her Majesty did - 'reluctantly' -  agree to cancel her engagements for the next week, including a high-profile visit to Rome, which indicates that the stomach bug which struck on Friday has taken its toll . The first is the annual Commonwealth . Observance multi-faith service at Westminster Abbey in London on Monday, . which is followed by a reception held by the Commonwealth . Secretary‑General at Marlborough House. She is also due to attend a service at . the Guards’ Chapel to commemorate the 175th Anniversary of the Soldiers . and Airmen’s Scripture Readers Association on Thursday. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen was in ‘good spirits’. She added: ‘Engagements cancelled or . postponed this week remain so. Next week we’ll have to see, as she has . only just been released from hospital.’ The Queen has been hospitalised on . only a handful of occasions during her six decades on the throne, the . previous time being in December 2003 when she underwent surgery on her . left knee. Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel, the most common symptoms being vomiting and diarrhoea. Visit: Professor John Cunningham, the Queen's physician, leaves King Edward VII hospital on his scooter just before it was announced The Queen was to return home . The Queen was being treated in the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge stayed just three months ago with severe morning sickness. Tragically, a few days after the Duchess was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in central London, a nurse committed suicide after a hoax phone call. Jacintha Saldanha spoke to two DJs from an Australian radio station – who were pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles – asking for an update of the Duchess’s condition and put them through to a nurse on her ward. Hospital pranked: While the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured outside the King Edward VII Hospital, was treated for acute morning sickness it was subjected to a hoax-phone call which was blamed for a nurse's suicide . The 46-year-old was found hanged in her living quarters after a recording of the conversation was broadcast worldwide. Hospital staff have insisted the nurse . was not reprimanded for taking the call, but sources close to the family . claim she was ‘ticked-off’. Senior managers were also accused of . failing to support the devastated nurse after the prank because they . were more concerned about the hospital’s image. Big protection: PC Wallyn and a colleague outside the hospital last night . But the Queen’s admission to the private hospital on Sunday indicates it is still trusted by the Royal Family. The Queen is the hospital’s patron and in December 2003, underwent an operation there to remove torn cartilage from her left knee. A night’s stay reportedly costs £1,000 and each room has an en-suite bathroom and large flat-screen TV. The hospital says it recruits the highest-performing doctors in the country and claims to be so clean there has never been a case of MRSA or C-difficile. The Queen can also take heart that Britain’s tallest policeman is standing guard outside the hospital. At 7ft 2in, Anthony Wallyn, 26, of the Westminster Police Borough Support Unit, was among the officers manning the door. PC Wallyn, who has his uniform custom made and imports his size 17 shoes from America, said he was used to the attention his height attracted. He said: ‘If I work in the West End, I get anywhere between 100 and 500 requests for a photo. It’s like being famous but without the money.’","The Queen taken to King Edward VII Hospital with suspected gastroenteritis .

"By . James Chapman . Ed Miliband’s ‘totally dysfunctional’ leadership tonight comes under extraordinary attack from former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride. In an updated version of his sensational tell-all memoirs, Mr McBride warns Labour has ‘no clear idea’ of who it is trying to appeal to and a ‘great, steaming pile of fudge’ instead of key policies. He says Mr Miliband, with whom he worked for years in the Treasury, has ‘managed to blend the worst of Tony Blair’s “me against the world” isolation with the worst of Gordon Brown’s “they’re out to get me” paranoia.’ Scroll down for video . Savaged: Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, has come under extraordinary attack from former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride, right, whom he accuses of having no idea who his targets are, or policies to tempt them . In an apparent swipe at Ed Balls, another former ally, he says Labour has yet to persuade voters that ‘we’ve learnt our lesson’ by admitting where ‘the last government screwed up’. The shadow Chancellor has resisted all advice to concede Labour’s mistakes during its 13 years in power. Mr McBride concludes: ‘Labour currently has no clear idea who its target audience is, no positive messages to communicate to anyone about why they should vote for the party, no policies which will persuade them, and is being run in a totally dysfunctional way.’ His latest explosive intervention will infuriate his former colleagues, who are this week seeking to shut down leadership speculation by launching a ‘summer offensive’ highlighting the differences between Labour and Conservative policies. Over the weekend, Mr Miliband launched an attempt to turn his ‘weird’ public image on its head, insisting politics should not be ‘an ugly person’s showbiz contest’. Bringing home the bacon: The Labour leader tried to confront his inability to match his camera-friendly rivals, which culminated in the above image of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich . He made a high-risk speech last week in which he tried to confront his apparent inability to match David Cameron’s camera-friendly manner and poise – saying he hoped voters would look beyond ‘photo opportunity’ politics. Opinion polls suggest that Mr Miliband is a drag on his party’s fortunes and is way behind Mr Cameron on most ratings of leadership. Mr McBride, in the paperback edition of Power Trip, his account of his years working for Gordon Brown and eventual downfall, published this week and serialised in the Daily Mail, insists he believes Mr Miliband will go on to win next year’s election. But having pulled his punches in his references to Mr Miliband and Mr Balls in the original version of the book, in the latest chapters he is unsparing about what he sees as their mistakes at the top the Labour Party. He says Mr Miliband’s policy measures, such as a promised energy price freeze and rent controls, are ‘populist enough but rarely stand up to scrutiny’. Mr Balls’s, meanwhile, are so wonkish they ‘go entirely unnoticed in the pub’. ‘If Labour currently has central, underlying messages that it is trying to communicate to the electorate about itself, its policies, and its leader, the best you could say at present is that it’s not quite coming across,’ Mr McBride writes. Learned their lesson? Mr McBride said that shadow chancellor Ed Balls has yet to persuade voters that Labour has learned from the past . Resistance: Miliband and Balls, pictured above, have staunchly resisted calls to apologise for Labour's legacy . ‘If the message is ‘We’re not the Tories or the Lib Dems, and you hate them’, that may work up to a point, but it won’t do much for those people who would happily express their antipathy by voting for UKIP or just staying at home, let alone those who hate Labour as well. 'Even the ‘cost of living’ argument – for which read ""Those Tory toffs haven’t got a clue what your life’s like"" – relies on the electorate accepting that Labour has some better appreciation of those realities.’ Mr McBride says Mr Miliband and Mr Balls ‘badly need to develop and stick to some underlying messages’ that will make people positively want to back Labour next year. ‘The starting point is a simple one: ""We’ve learnt our lesson"". From George Bush to [disgraced RBS boss] Fred Goodwin, admit where the last government screwed up, and explain why next time will be different,’ he urges. ‘That will also give Labour the licence to talk about the many good achievements of its time in office, and to point out that it’s the Tories who are now blindly repeating the mistakes of the past, especially on the economy.’ He warns Mr Miliband that he is still surrounded by many of the same advisers who attempted to address Mr Brown’s ‘image problem’ during his troubled stint as prime minister. Grin and bear it: After his attempt to turn attention away from his 'image problem', Mr Miliband was confronted with cartoons comparing him to Wallace, of Wallace and Gromit fame, by the BBC's Andrew Marr, left . They continually advised Mr Brown to counter the negative perceptions of his character by showing a ‘softer side’, Mr McBride says. ‘Ed’s advisers will tell him to be pictured doing the everyday things that normal people do to show he’s not ‘weird’; they’ll arrange opportunities for him to look all serious and statesmanlike to counter the perception that he’s not Prime Minister material; and conversely, they’ll urge him to crack jokes with Graham Norton or shed tears with Piers Morgan so that we can all begin to see the ‘real Ed’,’ he writes. ‘This will all be a colossal mistake. Not just because it leads to bad photos with bacon sandwiches, but because the blatant artifice of the whole effort risks throwing away the most important commodity any successful modern politician must possess: authenticity.’ Mr McBride advises Mr Miliband to present himself as ‘a Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage-style outsider, the opposite of the carefully-manicured modern politician designed by a committee of PR advisers’. 'Blatant artifice': Mr McBride warned Mr Miliband against taking image advice from Gordon Brown's old team . He also urges the Labour leader to ‘start involving, consulting and using the whole of his team – not just his small circle of like-minded advisers and trusted shadow ministers, but all of his shadow Cabinet, all his most talented backbenchers, and all of the variously talented staff employed by the Labour party, 99 per cent of whom could currently be forgiven for asking themselves: ‘Should we all go home?’’ Mr McBride’s book dominated last year’s Labour party conference, lifting the lid on a toxic culture of spin and feuding at the heart of New Labour. He was forced to resign as Mr Brown’s special adviser in 2009 after he was linked to a plot to smear Tory MPs via an anti-Conservative gossip website. The emails included fabricated slurs about the politicians’ health and private lives.","Labour leader failing to communicate with voters, Damian McBride claims .

"By . Liz Hull . Scroll down for video . The widow of a man who died after waiting almost an hour for an ambulance said yesterday that she was ‘disgusted’ after it emerged that bosses at the trust responsible for the delays had won an award for ‘excellence’. Joyce Pring, 63, said she was ‘astounded’ to see photographs of staff from the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) ‘living it up’ at taxpayers’ expense as they celebrated at the prize ceremony. The award – which was given to the trust despite it repeatedly missing patient targets – was handed over just months after an inquest into the death of her husband of 38 years, Fred. Angry: Fred and Joyce Pring. Mr Pring died at his home, near Mold, after the ambulance turned up late . In heartbreaking testimony, the inquest was told how Mrs Pring, a retired civil servant, made four increasingly desperate 999 calls begging for an ambulance to come and help her 74-year-old husband, eventually telling operators: ‘It’s too late now, he’s gone.’ It later emerged that as Mrs Pring was making her calls, six of the 16 ambulances serving her area had been on mandatory rest breaks, another eight were queuing outside two hospitals to hand over patients, and the remaining two were dealing with other incidents. When the inquest concluded, coroner John Gittins criticised the service and demanded action from the trust to reduce the risks posed by paramedics taking mandatory breaks and delays in dropping off patients at A&E. But within weeks of the hearing, bosses were applying for the GateHouse Award for Excellence in Organisational Development. And, despite consistently failing to meet the Government’s target that ambulances should attend at least 65 per cent of the most serious call-outs within eight minutes, the trust won the Healthcare People Management Association award. Staff attended a ceremony in London earlier this month to pick it up. Pictures from the night show them dancing and celebrating after their win. Mrs Pring, of Mynydd Isa, near Mold, North Wales, said she was ‘astounded’ by the award. ‘It is unbelievable that a trust which, month after month, fails to achieve its targets is actually being rewarded for incompetence,’ she said. ‘They are missing targets and people are dying because of it. ‘I don’t think the general public are aware that they are wasting time putting themselves up for these kind of awards when their performance is so dire – for them to win it beggars belief. ‘What really grates is that they were preparing to submit their application for this award when the inquest was taking place. It makes me so angry, it’s such an insult. I wouldn’t mind if they had made changes outlined after my husband’s inquest and gave themselves some time before applying, but the fact they did this at the time of the inquest is horrifying.’ Staff from the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust celebrate their award in London. The Trust has met the government target in just one month over the past two years . Mrs Pring said she was particularly offended by pictures on social media of WAST staff ‘living it up’ at the awards party. ‘The photo showing the representatives all dressed up enjoying themselves is an insult to the people who are no longer here,’ she added. Mrs Pring complained to her representative in the Welsh Assembly, Tory Mark Isherwood, who described the award as a ‘sick joke’. ‘What the WAST have done is at best insensitive,’ he said. ‘They are missing these targets month on month.’ Figures for May 2014 show that only 54.1 per cent of ambulances in Wales arrived at the scene of a life-threatening category A call within eight minutes – down from 62.5 per cent the previous year. The WAST has met the target in just one month over the past two years. In response to an email of complaint from Mrs Pring to the WAST, a spokesman said: ‘The trust acknowledges that our emergency response times have been consistently below target for some time and recognises we must change this urgently. ‘The trust is working diligently in order to develop our clinical practice. Therefore at each opportunity where our staff have contributed to the trust moving closer to this goal we want to celebrate, recognise and announce our pride in our workforce.’","Fred  Pring, 74, died at his home, near Mold, after ambulance turned up late .

"By . Tim Dahlberg, Ap . Saul Alvarez chased an elusive Erislandy Lara for 12 rounds on Saturday before escaping with a split-decision win for his second straight victory since losing to Floyd Mayweather Jr. Alvarez had all he could handle against Lara, whose constant movement frustrated the Mexican fighter and often caused him to miss wildly with right hands. In the end, Alvarez won on two scorecards, 115-113 and 117-111, to pull out a narrow win. The third judge had Lara ahead 115-113. The victor: Referee Robert Byrd (right) holds aloft the arm of winner Saul Alvarez after the fight . In the ring: Alvarez digs a left to the body of opponent Erislandy Lara during their fight in Las Vegas . Job done: Alvarez turns towards the MGM Grand crowd and celebrates after being declared the winner . Alvarez was favored against Lara, who left his native Cuba to come to the U.S. and fight as a pro. But Lara provided a stiff test in a fight that was up for grabs in the late rounds. Lara raised his hands in victory as the final bell sounded, certain he had done enough to win. A few minutes later, he leaned on the ropes, staring out in disbelief as the decision was announced. Alvarez was a 2-1 favorite but acknowledged before the bout that fighting someone with a style like Lara's was risky. Alvarez could not find Mayweather when he moved in their fight last year, and he had almost as much trouble cornering Lara in a fight where no title was at stake but one that was dangerous for both competitors. Lara was a moving target from the opening bell, going sideways and backward, content to let Alvarez chase him. The strategy worked early on as Alvarez had trouble cutting off the ring and often threw wild right hands that caught nothing but air. On the attack: Alvarez (right) swings at Lara as the Mexican charges forward during the fight . Hitting back: Lara (right) lands a right to the head of Alvarez but goes on to lose the fight on a split decision . By the fourth round, Alvarez (44-1-1) began to have more success finding his elusive opponent. He was relentless in pressuring Lara, who was content to move about the ring, stopping occasionally to throw a right hand followed by a left. The heavily pro-Alvarez crowd of 14,239 at the MGM Grand began growing frustrated with the action midway through the fight, booing Lara for refusing to stand and trade punches with the Mexican favorite. Lara was cut on the right eye in the seventh round by a left uppercut, and spent much of the later rounds wiping blood from his eye. He kept moving, though, and Alvarez kept chasing him, drawing huge roars from the crowd on the few occasions he managed to trap him on the ropes. In the air: Alvarez (right) and Lara (centre) become entangled as referee Byrd calls for the pair to break free . It's all over: Referee Byrd (centre) indicates the end of the final round as Lara (right) holds his arm in the air . Lara (19-2-2) kept frustrating Alvarez through the end of the fight, winning some late rounds as he landed counter left hands after first making Alvarez miss with his right. Lara, who fled Cuba to begin a pro career, came into the fight with only one loss - and it was a disputed one. Most in boxing considered him the equal of Alvarez, though he is relatively unknown compared to the Mexican star who fought Mayweather last year in boxing's richest fight ever. Lara got the fight after calling Alvarez out, despite worries by promoter Oscar De La Hoya that the Cuban's southpaw style would be difficult for Alvarez, who struggled against Mayweather in his only loss. Lara holds a piece of the 154-pound title, though it was not at stake in the fight, which was fought at 155 pounds.","Alvarez was ahead on two scorecards to pull out a narrow win .

"By . Brian Homewood, Reuters . Uruguay midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro was forced to postpone his long-awaited Corinthians debut after injuring himself with a soap dish, while Fred made an uneventful return for Fluminense in the Brazilian championship. Atletico Paranaense scored two bizarre own goals in the last 15 minutes as they lost 3-1 at Atletico Mineiro in another of Sunday's games, bringing respite for Mineiro coach Levir Culpi, who had been insulted by home fans during the second half. Unlucky: Uruguay midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro (left) failed to make his Corinthians debut after injuring his foot . Lodeiro was ruled out of his side's goalless draw at Coritiba when a soap dish fell on his foot while he was having a shower the day before.

VIDEO Fred v Jo highlights . Fred, heavily criticised for his ineffective performances for Brazil in the World Cup, played his first game for Fluminense since the tournament when he came on in the second half of the 2-0 win over Goias at the Maracana. Fluminense fans applauded the centre-forward onto the pitch, although he had little chance to make an impact with his team already two goals ahead. The club are second in the table, four points behind Cruzeiro, who drew 1-1 with Botafogo on Saturday. Mineiro were given a huge helping hand by their opponents Paranaense after their fans had taunted coach  Culpi with chants of 'donkey, donkey' during the second half. Paranaense defender Gil Pereira, under no pressure, sliced the ball into his own net with a complete miskick as he attempted to clear a cross in the 75th minute, then Deived hooked the ball over his own goalkeeper into the goal following a corner. 'This is the fourth time I've been at this club and they've always called me a donkey,' Culpi told reporters. 'We said in the dressing room that I'm a donkey with luck.'

Sven-Goran Eriksson has taken a swipe at Roy Hodgson's England squad by claiming his 2006 team were better prepared to win the World Cup than the 2014 edition are now. England open their campaign against Italy tonight hoping for a strong start in a difficult Group D, which also contains Uruguay. But Eriksson believes Hodgson's men will have had a successful tournament in Brazil if they reach the last-eight. Winners? Sven-Goran Eriksson (right) believes his 2006 England squad was better than Roy Hodgson's . Challenge: Eriksson says that Hodgson's (centre) men will do well to get to the quarters in Brazil . Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: 'I don’t think any team were better than England at the World Cup in Germany (where he led them to the quarter-finals). 'I don’t believe England have the chance to win this time. 'The quarter-finals would be a good achievement.' Following a 0-0 draw with Portugal, England were eliminated 3-1 on penalties eight years ago, with Ballon D'or winner Cristiano Ronaldo scoring the winning spot-kick.

Purvis, who had already won team silver and rings bronze, upgraded to gold on the final day of competition after being the last gymnast to perform on the apparatus. Top trio: Medallists (from left to right) Nile Wilson, Dan Purvis and Max Whitlock pose after the medal ceremony . Champion: Scotland's Purvis put in a brilliant performance to clinch gold ahead of his English rivals . Wilson, who won all-around bronze on Wednesday, punched the air on his dismount after a near faultless performance which looked to have landed him his first individual gold of the Games having competed as a junior as recently as May, where he was crowned junior European all-around champion. However, an even more impressive showing by Southport-based Purvis snatched the medal in a dramatic conclusion, with the roar of home support fully behind the popular gymnast. Whitlock was the first to compete on the apparatus and delivered an icy-cool routine which bested every score in qualifying before team-mate Wilson delivered an even more impressive mark as England held gold and silver medal position straight off the bat.

Canada's Kevin Lytwyn slotted in behind Baines before Australia's Naoya Tsukahara then went fourth with a tally of 14.133.

Briatore is the former Renault team principal forced out of F1 for his involvement in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix 'crashgate' saga, resigning from his post the following September. The Italian has rarely visited the paddock since, but was the name mentioned during a meeting between F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and the team principals during the recent race weekend in Hungary as they sought ways to improve the show given the decline in audiences. Mercedes: The German manufacturer's non-executive chairman says Briatore should not return . Crash-gate: Flavio Briatore resigned from his role in Formula One after becoming embroiled in scandal . Three-time champion Lauda, who currently serves as Mercedes' non-executive chairman, has been left bemused by the links surrounding Briatore. 'Why do we need Flavio?' said Lauda. 'Bernie is the man in charge, and he should stay in charge. We should think together with Bernie as he is the master of what we can improve.' It is understood Ecclestone was initially supportive of the idea, but has seemingly backtracked on the suggestion. Speaking to German publication Auto Motor und Sport, Ecclestone said: 'We do not need Flavio. We can do it ourselves.' Regardless of whether or not Briatore is involved, it is understood F1 is pushing ahead with a plan to set up the 'popularity working group'. CEO: Bernie Ecclestone should remain in charge of Formula One, says Mercedes' Niki Lauda . Renault: Briatore talking to Nelson Piquet when the two both worked for Renault's F1 team . Despite sell-out crowds in Canada, Austria and at Silverstone, the empty grandstands at Hockenheim for the German Grand Prix sent alarm bells ringing. Germany currently boasts a four-time champion in Sebastian Vettel and has Nico Rosberg in a Mercedes leading the world championship, yet just 52,000 showed on race day at a 95,000-capacity venue. It is believed the popularity taskforce is to include Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya. With a meeting also planned with the governing FIA, Ecclestone added: 'We simply want to see if there is the possibility to look at the rules because there has been so much negativity.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Lunch appointment with Max Mosley. Table for 12.30pm. Usual sort of spot: Sloane Square area of Chelsea. The old FIA president's conversation topics were as catholic as usual: judges, whose ranks he half-wished he had joined rather than been lured by motor racing from an early career at the bar; newspaper editors and proprietors, whose journals he has waged war upon; Bernie Ecclestone, his old mucker who finds himself in a spot of bother with the German constabulary. But it was on the subject of Formula One's engine development that he made his most pertinent contribution. In the thick of the action: Lewis Hamilton leads the field on the run down to Turn 1 at the Bahrain Grand Prix . Opinions: Max Mosley met with Jonathan McEvoy . He clearly felt that the sport's current governors might have articulated the need for energy recovery era more forcefully. 'If anybody should be ""blamed"" it's me,' he said wryly of the move to V6 turbos this seasons. 'We were the ones who looked at bringing in the new technology. It was 10 years in the making, and I actually like the noise. 'I wear these things in both my ears (hearing aids) because the noise of the engines went right through me for 40 years or more. It's too late to save my hearing but not for the next generation. The quieter engines are better for families. You can take children to races without fear of their being deafened. 'It is important for Formula One to evolve. Safety was the big challenge of the 20th Century and the environment is the big challenge of the 21st. If that that fact is not understood and embraced, the sport runs the risk of becoming irrelevant. 'Corporate social responsibility is important for car manufacturers, so there is a need to move in this direction so the sport does not lose sponsors and manufacturers. They see how important this technology is in the development of road cars. Over the line: Hamilton celebrates his victory in Bahrain after holding off Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg . 'If there is one thing I feel could have been done better it is how the new regulations, and the reasons behind them, have been explained to the public. An opportunity has been missed.' A few points to consider. First, he turned upside down Ecclestone's argument that louder engines are obviously desirable, saying that quieter power trains are not only a necessary by-product of less energy being expelled through the exhaust but that the tranquillity is desirable in itself. He cited watching the sheer violence of a car going round the swimming pool at Monaco, rather than the high-decibel screech, as the truly jaw-dropping spectacle. I agree that watching from the pit wall at Monaco is one of the greatest sights in all sport, and I stop there every year to take it in. Secondly, he argued that Formula One is not shying away from being the most innovative and startling brand in motor racing by moving to a greener world but actually defining the new frontiers by doing so. Complaint: Luca di Montezemolo has been very outspoken in his criticism of the new Formula One era . Thirdly, he underlined the fact there would only be one or possibly two engine manufacturers left had the move to energy-saving technology not been brought in. Mercedes, for one, said this week they probably would have quit had the move not come about. Renault would have wobbled, too. Despite these and other worthy points to be made for the new regulations, the agenda through the opening months of the season was set by the antis, notably Ferrari's Luca di Montezemolo, Red Bull's world champion Sebastian Vettel and, of couse, Ecclestone. Where was the case for the defence from the sport's governors, as opposed to Mercedes' Niki Lauda and, to an extent, McLaren's Ron Dennis? Their argument was barely presented, certainly not with the force or coherence it could have been.  Instead, the telling rebuttal was delivered, by proxy, through the splendid racing at Bahrain last weekend. But even that evidence, by its nature, failed to make the intellectual case for the revolutionary changes. Another chance to articulate this vision was, I fear, missed this week when the FIA launched its carbon reduction programme. The project was a long time in the planning but was launched with little more than a murmur. The opportunity to join the dots with what is happening in Formula One was wastefully scorned. As for Mosley's views on Ecclestone's longevity, he believes his old friend will survive the bribery charges in Germany. Or was that just loyalty talking? Centre of attention: Bernie Ecclestone will be tried on bribery charges in Munich later this year . Back on the pit wall: McLaren chief Ron Dennis pictured at the Bahrain Grand Prix . The Piranha Club – the name given to Formula One's school of sharp-toothed bosses – should be warned that Mosley has finished his memoirs. I am told that about 10 per cent of the book, which has yet to be given a title, will address his upbringing as the son of Sir Oswald Mosley and Diana Mitford; 25 per cent his campaign to curtail the Press following the News of the World expose into his private life; 65 per cent his experience in and around Formula One. A particularly intrigued piranha will be Ron Dennis, whose designs on a knighthood are unlikely to be helped by another rehearsal of the Spygate scandal, concerning how McLaren came into illicit possession of Ferrari technical data in 2007. Other big fish who could also be wounded by Mosley's scabrous pen are Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo and triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart. The author, during his period as FIA president, derided them respectively as a 'bella figura' and a 'certificated halfwit, dressed up as a 1930s' Music Hall man.' Watch out. If I were a modern-day Lord Hesketh – that is to say richer than I am – I would put some money towards the motor racing career of James Hunt's son, Freddie. With his collar-length blond hair, Freddie looks every inch his world champion father's boy. He also possesses something of the late James's debonair style. So it was one of the pleasures of the week to meet up with Freddie in a London hotel after his return from a spell in Argentina, close to the animals he loves. Up for the cup: James Hunt celebrating victory at the 1977 British Grand Prix . Like father, like son: Freddie Hunt at the Goodwood Festival of Speed last year and, right, during a photo shoot . He told me how he spent New Year crossing the Andes, 15,000 feet up, sometimes holding on to rock faces for dear life, at other times pausing to breathe in the thin air every 10 steps. He managed just over 50 miles in fractionally fewer hours but had to turn back when there were no horses to take him across the water. The cowboys were on a day off. It was New Year, after all. But, his head cleared and straight, he is back in Britain in an attempt to restart his racing career seven years after he began out in Formula Ford. Aged 26, he admits his original aim of Formula One is beyond him, so is now hell-bent on a crack at Le Mans. The road to Le Mans, through lower categories, will likely take five years at best, and plenty of money. So if anyone fancies helping Freddie on his journey, he can be contacted on Twitter, @FreddieHunt76. PS I am willing to publicise other drivers seeking sponsorship, on only two conditions: first, that they are the son of a Formula One world champion and, secondly, they represent some of the panache missing in modern British sport.","Max Mosley says he should be blamed for move to V6 turbos this year .

The Northern Ireland man was ruled unfit to continue after sustaining a bloody gash above his right eye and the contest was sent to the scorecards. Conlan was handed victory by virtue of his stronger first round and McGoldrick said: ""It is not the outcome I would have wanted. 'I would rather have gone the three rounds and lost all three rounds to him, he's a world-class fighter.' England bantamweight Qais Ashfaq booked his place in the bantamweight final against Conlan after easily outpointing Benson Njangiru of Kenya. And Ashfaq insisted he would not change the tactics that have taken him to his first major final because of Conlan's obvious injury. Jumping for joy: Australia's Andrew Moloney (left) celebrates beating Scotland's Reece McFadden (right) Ashfaq said: 'You just have to not take any notice at all and concentrate on the tactics the coach gives you. And I know for a fact that if I perform to those tactics, I'll beat him.' England team-mate Sam Maxwell was forced to settle for a bronze medal after being outpointed by Great Britain squad team-mate Josh Taylor. Maxwell's better first round was not rewarded on the scorecards and Taylor's sharper, back-foot style saw him reach Saturday's light-welterweight final. A gold medal for Taylor in front of his home fans will come in sharp contrast to his early exit from London 2012 but the Prestonpans fighter insisted his Olympic disappointment is in the past. Taylor said: 'I've been dreaming of this moment for four years and I can't wait to win a gold medal in front of the Scottish fans. 'The Olympics have been and gone and I've been looking forward since then. I've put all my losses right and my form has been improving all the time.' Welshman Nathan Thorley was outclassed by Kennedy St Pierre of Mauritius, who won when Thorley's corner threw in the towel midway through the final round.","Adams wins on points to reach the women's flyweight final .

Pub workers, cafe owners and baristas could face an uncertain future after Honda unveiled a talking robot - which can open and serve drinks. Asimo is the world's most advanced 'humanoid robot' with Tokyo-based Honda first starting work on it in 1986. The latest generation Asimo has improved intelligence, enhanced hand dexterity and can run forwards and backwards, climb and descend stairs, hop and even jump. Asimo, which stands for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility, will even recognise the faces and voices of multiple people speaking simultaneously. Using the visual information captured by the two cameras in its head, Asimo can detect the movement of multiple objects, assessing distance and direction. Its human-like hands can open a bottle, pour a drink and carry goods while also expressing sign language. Standing at 4.3 feet (1.3 metres) the gentle-handed robot can also hold a soft paper cup to pour liquid without squashing it. At full pelt, Asimo will run at 5.6mph - an increase of 1.8mph over its predecessor. Scroll down for video .

Then you might want to invest in Yura, a concept from Ukrainian design student Herman Haydin that will make your drink and then fly it to you. The robot drone bartender cap apparently make a healthy cocktail, tea or coffee with accurate numbers of calories for your body. The ambitious design is just one among dozens of finalists in the competition that also includes robot fish that clean your clothes and free-floating fridge bubbles. ‘The main idea in the Yura concept is making custom cocktails or fresh juices for you,’ says Harmin, from the Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture. Once a drink is poured on a flat surface the robot picks the beverage up and flies it to you. Yura, named after a ‘fine barman’ at Harmin’s university, would be in the form of a Parrot AR.Drone. Water and other liquids stored on the robot would be temperature-controlled, so it could be heated or cooled as needed. A logo on the side of the robot would show you how much liquid is inside and also its temperature. The ‘smart brain’ of the robot, which is Wi-Fi enabled, could respond to voice commands. And Yura could also to tell you the number of calories, carbohydrates, fats and proteins in your drink. Ukrainian design student Herman Haydin has revealed his idea for flying robot bartenders (shown). Called Yura the concept is part of the 2014 Electrolux Design Lab contest.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . One in ten adults has never tried vegetables such as leek, celery and kale, according to researchers. Some have even managed to avoid tasting the Christmas dinner staple Brussels sprouts. And it’s not just greens that are getting pushed to the side of our plates. The study also found one in five has never tasted sardines or scampi, while one in ten has never had tuna, salmon or goat’s cheese. Given a miss: Some adults have managed to avoid Christmas dinner staple Brussels sprouts. Researchers said the omission of nutritious foods in the average diet is leading to deficiencies of Omega 3 . The study of 2,000 people, commissioned by supplement producer Seven Seas, found a quarter of people have avoided eating Omega 3-rich mackerel. One fifth of adults refuse to try olives and staggeringly 10 per cent of people had never eaten broccoli as a child. Researchers said the omission of nutritious foods in the average diet is leading to serious deficiencies of Omega 3, a vital fatty acid which helps boost the immune system. A Seven Seas spokesman said: 'It's surprising to see that many staple foods are regularly avoided or haven't been tried. 'No more broccoli': Former President George H. W. Bush famously said he hated the healthy vegetable . ‘It’s hard to keep track and manage our diets day to day to ensure we’re setting ourselves up well, but there is clearly a worrying trend of people avoiding many of the foods that can be of great benefit to health and well-being. ‘The average Western diet does not provide the levels of Omega 3 recommended for health because many people do not eat enough oily fish on a regular basis.’ The study also found six in ten Britons described themselves as a fussy eater, and many said their avoidance of certain foods led to difficulty when eating out. A quarter have never eaten avocado . and one in seven did not try garlic until they were an adult, with . apricots, blueberries, prunes and aubergines all omitted from many a . British diet. Results also showed a fifth of Brits have never tried asparagus and even fewer had tried figs or prunes. And the habit is being passed on to the next generation. More than one  third of parents were worried limited diets were causing themselves and their child to miss out on essential nutrients. Not liking a food as a child or even associating it with school dinners was enough to put one in ten adults off it for life. The most commonly refused foods also included baked beans and black pudding. The . Government advises that a healthy diet should include at least two . portions of fish a week, one of them oily for a boost of Omega 3. Bad habits: More than one  third of parents were worried limited diets were causing their child to miss out on essential nutrients. Associating a food with school dinners was enough to put one in ten adults off it for life . But the Seven Seas report revealed confusion over the recommendations, with a quarter of Britons having no idea what Omega 3 is. Biochemist Professor Gordon Bell, who worked with Seven Seas on the campaign, said: ‘Samples analysed in our laboratory show that people in the UK have an average of about 25 per cent Omega 3 in their Omega 3 blood count.

"By . Liz Hull . For anyone in the public eye, having pearly white teeth has fast become an essential part of a successful celebrity look. TV mogul Simon Cowell, actress Nicole Kidman and singer Cheryl Cole have all confessed to having their teeth polished in the past to ensure they can flash a Hollywood smile. But with cosmetic dentistry treatment costing up to £800 a time, cleaning up discoloured teeth is often out of reach of ordinary folk. Scroll down for video . Hollywood smiles: The X Factor judges Cheryl Cole and Simon Cowell have had teeth whitening treatments . However, all that is about to change after Boots announced they were bringing an affordable, DIY home kit which claims to provide professional standard whitening to the High Street for the first time. The store say they have been inundated with pre-order enquiries for Luster Pro Light – a best-seller in America -  which professes to make teeth up to six shades whiter in just 30 minutes. At £49.99 the kit costs a fraction of cosmetic dentistry, but uses similar laser light technology for professional results. In clinical trials on 240 people, 86 per cent said their teeth were noticeably whiter within 30 minutes. One in eight said their teeth were 50 per cent cleaner after just three uses. DIY: At £49.99 the Pro Light kit costs a fraction of cosmetic dentistry, but uses similar laser light technology for professional results . Unlike other home whitening kits, which rely on teeth trays and whitening strips that can be fiddly and result in uneven bleaching, Luster Pro is the first ever home kit to use the same paint-on bleach and 'blue light' technology favoured by cosmetic dentists. Tried and tested: Denise Silvester, 46, from Bromley, said the product worked for her . Users simply paint the gel, which is a non-peroxide bleach, onto their teeth, before pointing a special 'light gun' at them for two minutes. This heats up the gel to between 30C and 50C and speeds up the whitening process. Manufacturers say the treatment is kinder to gums and eliminates soreness which can sometimes be experienced by users of regular home whitening products. They say the treatment needs to repeated 10 times for the best results. Denise Silvester, 46, from Bromley, Kent, who took part in a trial of Luster Pro, said: 'I've always wanted whiter teeth but I could never justify the price. 'I've tried many whitening toothpastes and systems on the market but nothing really gave me significant results. 'But with the Luster kit the results are incredible. After 30 minutes my teeth were significantly whiter and two weeks on the results are amazing - I would recommend to anyone.' It is due to go on sale in larger Boots stores and online later this month.","Cosmetic dentistry treatments used by the stars can cost up to £800 a time .

"The FDA warns consumers to look out for products that contain two ingredients: benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid . By . Associated Press . Federal health officials are warning consumers who use popular anti-acne treatments about rare but potentially deadly allergic reactions that can cause swelling of the face and difficulty breathing. The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday the problems have been reported with gels, face washes, pads and other products that contain two ingredients: benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. But the agency says it's unclear whether those ingredients trigger the reactions or whether some other combination of ingredients is to blame. Potential problems: The FDA warns that rare but serious allergic reactions could develop when using face washes that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid [Note: The FDA did NOT mention specific products by name] . The over-the-counter treatments are sold as Proactiv, Neutrogena, MaxClarity, Oxy, Aveeno and other brands. For now the agency wants consumers to stop using the products immediately if they experience tightness of the throat, breathing problems, light-headedness or swelling of the eyes, face or lips. Users can test their sensitivity to a new treatment by dabbing a small amount on their skin for three days. If they don't experience a reaction the product can generally be used safely as directed. An FDA analysis uncovered 131 reports of serious allergic reactions with topical acne drugs over the last 44 years. Playing it safe:  The FDA says that consumers should be wary of ingredients included in face washes, gels, and pads by popular brands including Aveeno (left) and Proactiv (right)  [Note: The FDA did not mention specific products by name] . None of the cases were fatal, but 44 percent of people had to be hospitalized. Most of the problems emerged within 24 hours of first using the treatment. Regulators stressed that these hypersensitivity reactions are much more serious than rashes and irritations often seen with skin products. 'There is currently no mention of the possibility of these very . severe allergic reactions on the product labels,' says Mona Khurana, . M.D., a medical officer at FDA.

"By . Sean Poulter . The Tetley tea folk, those bluff northerners who sing the benefits of their round teabags, have suffered a nasty blow after taking on PG Tips and their pyramid bags - and losing. Executives at the company behind the plain speaking popular cartoon characters were furious after their rivals appeared to trash their round teabags in a fun TV commercial. PG Tips and their brand ambassadors, comedian Jonny Vegas and his monkey puppet, suggested that their pyramid tea bags were better at letting the flavour flood out than round ones. Scroll down for video . The Advertising Standards Authority launched an investigation after PG Tips and their brand ambassadors, comedian Jonny Vegas and his monkey puppet (pictured), suggested that their pyramid tea bags were better . Tetley complained to the Advertising Standards Authority after the PG Tips' adverts compared teabags (above) Tetley complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that this attack on their popular product was both unfair and untrue. However, in a ruling published today the watchdog has sided with PG Tips and decided that Tetley and its tea folk were simply wrong. Significantly, it accepted that the PG Tips pyramid bags really are better at releasing the flavour than the round ones promoted by Tetley’s characters in their flat caps. The decision could have serious consequences, for it may be enough to convince the nation’s tea lovers to switch to PG Tips and its superior bags. The ASA said the commercial featured the comedian and the puppet monkey in a kitchen comparing the performance of the PG Tips pyramid bag against a round one. Vegas said: ‘Monkey, you know how you always say, ‘there’s no other tea to beat PG’ … What if you’re lying?’ Research showed the leaves in a pyramid bag had 77 per cent more room to move than in a round one . The monkey then set about proving his point and made two cups of tea, one with a pyramid bag and one with a round bag and stated: ‘PG Tips uses pyramid bags, so if we test one against a regular tea bag ... you’ll see the tea has got more room to move, freeing the great fresh taste for a perfect cuppa.’ Tetley is owned by the Indian company, Tata Global Beverages, which complained the images exaggerated the performance of the PG Tips pyramid bags. It challenged the claim the tea has more room to move so ‘freeing the great fresh taste’ It also argued that the comparison with a round teabag ‘denigrated’ the Tetley brand – even though it was not named - and portrayed it in a negative light. PG Tips, which is owned by Unilever, countered by offering evidence of tests comparing the performance of different bags in hot water after 40 seconds and two minutes of brewing. Both showed a win for the pyramid over round, in terms of colour and strength. Separate research showed the leaves in a pyramid bag had 77per cent more room to move than in a round one. PG Tips insisted the commercial was not meant to be seen as a direct comparison to Tetley because round teabags are also offered by other brands and supermarkets. Backing PG Tips, the ASA said: ‘Unilever provided test results which showed that the infusion of tea, at 40 seconds and two minutes into brewing, was greater when using a pyramid teabag than when using a round teabag. We therefore concluded that the ad did not exaggerate the capability and performance of the advertised product and was not misleading. ‘Unilever provided relevant modelling and measurements to demonstrate that the tea in the pyramid teabag would have more room to move… and that the pyramid teabag had a greater brewing efficiency than the round teabag.’ PG Tips insisted the commercial was not meant to be seen as a direct comparison to Tetley because round teabags are also offered by other brands and supermarkets . Tetley, which is owned by the Indian company Tata Global Beverages, complained the performance of the PG Tips pyramid bags had been exaggerated and challenged the claim the tea has more room to move . The watchdog added: ‘While a large portion of round teabags were owned by Tetley, we considered that consumers would not immediately identify a round teabag as being a Tetley teabag. 'Because we considered that the comparison was not made with an identifiable competitor, we concluded that the ad did not denigrate Tetley.’ A spokesman for PG Tips said: ‘We’re thrilled that the ASA have agreed with what PG Tips fans have known for years, pyramid bags really do make the best cup of tea.’ Tetley had no one was available to comment on the ruling.","Advertising authority found pyramid teabags are better at releasing flavour .

"By . Simon Walters . Ed Miliband risked an own goal last night over claims that he has used a professional voice coach to boost his flagging ratings. The Mail on Sunday has been told that the Labour leader has had lessons in how to sound more appealing and inspiring from television continuity announcer Paul Jamieson, who helps bankers and businessmen get their messages across. The claims come just 24 hours after Mr Miliband said he had no time for ‘politics driven by image,’ declaring: ‘If you want the politician from central casting, it’s just not me, it’s the other guy.’ Scroll down for video . The Mail on Sunday has been told that Ed Miliband has had lessons in how to sound more appealing and inspiring . But while Mr Miliband has publicly derided political photo opportunities, well-placed sources say he has been brushing up his presentational skills with the help of Mr Jamieson, also a respected theatre producer. Mr Jamieson says he uses ‘the sheer physicality of theatrical expression... to help people communicate in ways that are visual, powerful and inspiring’. He claims to ‘unblock’ his clients and ‘harness their physical powers to provide inspiring leadership’ – a boast which may expose Mr Miliband to more jokes, bearing in mind jibes about his ‘nasal’ tone. Shortly after becoming Labour leader, he underwent a nose operation to help with his sleep apnoea, though it does not appear to have improved his voice. Mr Jamieson, whose clients include BP, drugs giant Pfizer, and Deutsche Bank, works for the Corporate Theatre, which helps would-be leaders from all walks of life. Its website declares Mr Jamieson ‘pre-coaches clients and gives new confidence and freedom’. It also explains the organisation is made up of ‘performing artists, political scientists, philosophers, historians and organisational psychologists’. Paul Jamieson says he uses 'the sheer physicality of theatrical expression... to help people communicate in ways that are visual, powerful and inspiring' Its aim is to ‘help people lose their ego and find how to create the energy needed to integrate Doing, Thinking and Being. ‘Leaders are accountable for giving away leadership to the best person for the job in hand. Using a model of Presence, Connection, Authenticity and Courage, we take them on a journey that helps them discover how to realise their ambition.’ It says its methods draw on ‘the great tradition of the mediaeval troubadour and renaissance minstrel, the role of the “singer of tales”, the wandering performer who fuses music, storytelling, drama and the power of words to awaken and unite audiences in many lands’. Successfully used, it can ‘connect clients with the true but hitherto untapped potential within themselves… towards fresh thinking, courageous authenticity, and deeper emotional empathy’. The website gives examples of questions asked by clients, which sound distinctly like the kind of questions Miliband may have been tempted to ask, such as: ‘I want to believe we are doing the right thing. But I’m not sure – and neither is anyone else... is there a way we can be more sure?’ It continues: ‘Our clients come to us because they want to increase the bandwidth of inspirational engagement. Our learning programmes include coaching, seminars, theatrical scenarios, visual group work and practical training, drawing on performing arts, psychology, politics and ethics.’ Asked what was the weirdest voiceover job he had ever done, Mr Jamieson once said: ‘I was the voice of an air conditioner for an air conditioning company and their in-house video. And I was the voiceover for Miss Great Britain.’ Marc Stears, the Labour leader’s Oxford University friend and speechwriter, also works with the Corporate Theatre. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ‘We don’t comment on internal matters.’ Mr Jamieson could not be reached for comment.","Mail on Sunday told Labour leader has had lessons in how to sound more appealing and inspiring from television continuity announcer Paul Jamieson .

Researchers from the University of South Florida in Tampa found at least 50 grave shafts at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida - 19 more than had been identified by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in a 2010 investigation. In total, scientists believe a minimum of 96 children - aged from six to 18 - and two adults died between 1911 and the 1973 at the infamous school, with many of the burials going undocumented. And there could be even more victims: Researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy laws, and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full searches. Scroll down for video . Horrors: Crosses mark graves at a cemetery at Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida. Investigators have said they had found at least 50 graves - 19 more than officially reported - on the grounds . A report released on Monday details the alleged cover-ups by the school, which opened in 1900. It was closed in June 2011 by the Department of Juvenile Justice after a years-long controversy over widespread physical and sexual abuse. The horrifying findings - and expectations of still more to come - raise troubling questions for the now-shuttered school, its staff and the state. Previous investigations and lawsuits . have been brought by the 'White House Boys' - so called because much of . the abuse took place in an 11-room building known as the White House. Scene: Students called themselves the White House Boys as much of the abuse took place in this building . Investigation: Researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites . A group of former students sued the . state in 2010, but their case was dismissed as the statute of . limitations had expired. Other students have written books about their experiences. Following the claims, researchers at the University of South . Florida in Tampa used ground-penetrating radar and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there than previously reported. The largest gravesite is on the northside of the campus, where African-American boys were buried. It is at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses, but researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites. 'We anticipated finding about 25 to 30 . grave shafts,' said Christian Wells, an assistant professor of . anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site. 'But in fact . we found a minimum of 50.' Institution: Dozier was opened as a state reform school in January 1900 for misbehaving boys . Treatment: The boys were allegedly forced into hard labour, while others were beaten, raped or killed . Culture: A memorial or burial service around 1950. More than 20 students' burials were undocumented . In 2009, writer Roger Dean Kiser published The White House Boys - An American Tragedy detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at Dozier School for Boys. He was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12, and suffered brutal, bloody beatings in the infamous White House building. 'Little did I know that America had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole U.S. of A,' he wrote. 'A devil was hiding behind every tree, every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass.' He writes on his website: 'The terrible screams I heard and the brutal beatings I witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever. 'The beatings I suffered are not my horrors today. My horrors are the beatings of crying boys that I had to witness before my own beatings. The horror of knowing that I was next. 'The thick concrete walls and the loud . industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they . were beaten bloody. Some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows . and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from . the buttocks. 'For almost thirty minutes, at age sixty-two, I stood alone in the exact room where I was almost beaten to death. With my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating, I lit a cigarette and I cried without feeling shame.' Dozier's own records show that more than . 50 children were buried on the grounds, while more than 30 other bodies were sent . elsewhere to be buried. But the school failed to record burial locations for . 22 other children who researchers learned died on the site, the Miami Herald reported. Some of the children - and two adults - died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s, while others were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas. In January, the researchers will return to the south of the campus, where the white children lived. They said they expect to find more graves here, with the boys also segregated in death. African-American children at the school were three times more likely to be buried in an unspecified location than the white boys, the report found. 'I didn't realise going in how much of a story of civil rights it was,' Erin Kimmerle, an assistant professor of anthropology at the university, told reporters. Seven boys are believed to have died following escape attempts, according to the report . Among . the children who were overlooked was a white boy named Thomas Curry, . who died of blunt head trauma. Records claimed he died away from the . campus after he escaped. The . school records claim that boys who escaped happened to meet a violent . death, including two who died of gunshot wounds to the chest or head. Former . students of the Dozier School, now aged 60 or older have told horror . stories of how they were beaten as boys, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Discovery: University of South Florida radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses . Ovell . Smith Krell, now 83, said that her brother, Owen Smith, was sent to the . Dozier School for Boys in the spring of 1940, after running away from . home and later stealing and wrecking a car. According to a 2009 letter written by . Mrs Krell, the family never heard from Owen again. She said that her . mother wrote to the school to inquire about her son’s whereabouts, but . was told Owen escaped. The school then said he was caught . and captured by the sheriff’s department. When their father came to . claim his son, he was told that he was sent back to Dozier. It . is unclear what then happened to Owen. Mrs Krell said that she talked . to a former student who said that he saw Owen being taken into what was . known as the White House, a place where boys were disciplined on campus. Victims: Officials said the body of Owen Smith, left, was found decomposing under a house after he ran away. Thomas Varnadoe, far right, died of pneumonia 34 days after his arrival - yet his family said he was healthy . School grounds: Scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves . Ongoing: Researchers will look at a different area in January, where the white boys were buried . She . wrote: ‘When they brought him out, they were carrying him. The boy said . they heard his screams and that he was taken to the infirmary.’ Mrs Krell’s mother continued to write . to the detention centre for months, until the school finally said that . Owen’s badly decomposed body had been found under a house. The school said that he had most likely died of pneumonia and was under the house to try to keep warm. However, the doctor and lawyer living in the house told Mrs Krell that they never heard or smelled anything. Mrs . Krell told CNN that she hopes to give her brother the burial he . deserves. 'I would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in . their cemetery,' she explained. 'I hope I get the chance.'","Dozier School for Boys opened as a reform school in 1900 but was closed in 2011 amid decades-long allegations of physical and sexual abuse .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . For 30 years, tourists have paid money to get a look at two aeroplanes once owned by Elvis Presley at Graceland in Memphis. But by April of next year, the planes named Lisa Marie and Hound Dog II could be gone. Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates Graceland, has notified the planes' owners that they should prepare to remove the jets early next year. The planes, owned by the OKC Partnership in Memphis, have been a tourist attraction since the mid-1980s. On the move?: The Lisa Marie, one of two jets once owned by late singer Elvis Presley, at Graceland . Flying visit: The two planes are a huge tourist attraction for Elvis fans heading to Graceland . OKC Partnership and Graceland agreed to bring them to Graceland, with OKC getting a share of ticket sales at the mansion. In a letter to OKC Partnership's KG Coker, Elvis Presley Enterprises CEO Jack Soden said the company was ending the agreement and asked Coker to remove the planes and restore the site by April 26, 2015. The larger plane, a Convair 880 named Lisa Marie, is like a customised flying limousine, with a large bed, a stereo system, conference room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. It was renovated after Presley bought it from Delta Air Lines. Presley took his first flight on it in November 1975. Tourist attraction: The Hound Dog II plane which was once used by the King of Rock and Roll Elvis Presley . Home sweet home: Elvis poses outside Graceland in 1957 . The smaller jet, a JetStar named the Hound Dog II, was also used by Presley. Coker, 76, says OKC may sell the planes if they're removed from Graceland, but he still hopes to negotiate a deal to keep the planes there. ‘I would love to see the aeroplanes stay where they are forever,’ he said. ‘Millions of fans have toured those airplanes and there's a real connection between fans and those airplanes. Those aeroplanes are part of the Elvis experience.’ Perfectly preserved: The seats inside the Lisa Marie jet are covered in plastic wrapping . KG Coker, whose OKC Partnership owns two airplanes once owned and used by Elvis Presley, stands behind a model of one of the planes in his home in Memphis . Dedicated Elvis fan Paul Fivelson of Algonquin, Illinois, said he expects many fans will be upset to hear the planes may be leaving. ‘The people who come to Memphis for Elvis Week like seeing those planes there because it's just part of the whole aura of what Elvis was about,’ he said. ‘It would be kind of blasphemous to take them away, and I think there are probably a lot of fans who will feel the same way.’ The disclosure also raises questions about the future use of the site where the airplanes now sit, across the street from Presley's long-time home. Big draw: Thousands of Elvis fans flock to Graceland every year to see the planes . Luxury jet: Inside the Hound Dog II plane, which could be removed from Graceland . Elvis Presley Enterprises declined to comment. In November, New York-based Authentic Brands Group bought Elvis Presley Enterprises and the licensing and merchandising rights for Presley's music and image from CORE Media Group. As part of the deal, Joel Weinshanker, founder of the National Entertainment Collectibles Association, acquired the operating rights to Graceland, which attracts about 500,000 visitors each year. Earlier this year, Elvis Presley Enterprises announced plans to build a 450-room hotel, theatre and restaurant, with a projected opening date of August 2015. Their plan was approved Tuesday by the Memphis City Council. Today, Graceland visitors can buy a ticket that includes a tour of Presley's home-turned-museum and the interior of the two airplanes. At one point, after the planes were sold following the singer's death, the Lisa Marie was owned by Raymond Zimmerman, owner of the Service Merchandise chain, according to Coker. The Hound Dog II was in the hands of Hustler head Larry Flynt for a time, Coker said. OKC Partnership eventually bought the planes and the Lisa Marie was installed at Graceland in 1984. The Hound Dog II came later.","Jets were both owned and used by the King during his heyday .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Warning: Mark Carney yesterday said a rise in the base rate was on the way, despite the risk that it could push the country back into a recession . Household debt is a ‘major risk’ to the economy and could tip Britain back into recession when interest rates rise, the Bank of England’s governor declared yesterday. Mark Carney said that many families are in ‘a vulnerable position’ having overstretched themselves to get onto, or move up, the housing ladder. Any large rise in mortgage or loan rates would mean less money being spent in shops – reversing the economy’s upward trend. But in a stark warning to borrowers, he added that despite the risks, the first increase since 2007 is on the way. Mr Carney said the housing market could spiral out of control if interest rates are left too low for too long. ‘The UK economy is starting to head back to normal,’ said the Canadian in a speech in Glasgow. ‘As the economy normalises, Bank Rate will need to start to rise.’ Mr Carney repeated his message that the central bank plans that any rises in interest rates will be ‘gradual and limited’ to cushion the blow for highly-indebted borrowers. But he warned that if rates rise more quickly than expected it could ‘tip the economy into recession’ because people cut back spending elsewhere to pay their mortgages. ‘It is the prospects for household indebtedness that concern us,’ said Mr Carney. ‘History shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens. ‘If a lot of people are highly indebted, that could tip the economy into recession. Since we start from a vulnerable position we need to be especially careful.’ Mr Carney said that with household debt worth 140 per cent of disposable income, rates will stay ‘materially lower’ than the 5 per cent average seen before the financial crisis. He warned that this level of debt is ‘a major risk’ to economic stability. A report published today says dealing with ‘the household debt hangover’ must be a priority as the ‘holiday period’ of low borrowing costs ends. The Resolution Foundation think-tank warns that the number of mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could balloon from 1.1million today to 2.3million by 2018. The number of households in ‘debt peril’ – meaning they are spending more than half of their income on debt repayments – could increase from 600,000 to 1.1million. 'Household indebtedness concerns us': Mr Carney listens as he is introduced before speaking at the Commonwealth Games Business Conference in Glasgow, Scotland,  yesterday . Rates have been frozen at an emergency low of 0.5 per cent since the depths of ‘the Great Recession’ in March 2009. But the UK is now the fastest growing advanced economy in the world and jobs are being created at a record pace. This has led many observers to believe that interest rates will rise to 0.75 per cent later this year or early next year before reaching 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 2017. That would push up mortgage costs for millions –although it would be welcomed by savers who have lost out since the financial crisis. Issuing a warning on the housing market, Mr Carney said: ‘The Bank is well aware that a prolonged period of historically low interest rates could encourage other risks to develop. In the UK, the biggest risks are associated with the housing market.’ He was recently accused of behaving like ‘an unreliable boyfriend’ over his apparent changes of heart on when rates will rise. Yesterday he refused to be drawn on exactly when the first rise will come.","The Canadian Bank of England governor warns that a rate rise is on the way .

"By . Sarah Dean . A national memorial service for victims of the MH17 disaster will be held in Melbourne on August 7, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. The multi-faith service will be held at St Patrick's Cathedral. 'I hope many members of the public will attend to support the families of the victims,' Mr Abbott told Fairfax Radio on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced an official memorial for the Australian victims of MH17 . Nearly 300 people, including 37 Australian citizens and permanent residents, died when a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine two weeks ago. The service was being held in Melbourne because 16 of the victims came from Victoria, Mr Abbott said. On the day of the service, flags on all Australian government buildings, here and overseas, will be flown at half-mast. Arrangements have been made for an outside broadcast in anticipation of large crowds. Among the large Victorian death toll was Shaliza Dewal, 45, and her Dutch husband Hans Van Den Hende. The Malaysian-Dutch couple were travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with their three children, Piers, 15, Marnix, 12, and daughter Margaux, 8 but never made it home.

Australian and Dutch police investigators were forced to abandon the search for remains again on Wednesday because of fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist fighters. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said claims investigators are being deterred from the MH17 crash site by land mines are 'utterly despicable'. Ms Bishop said she is aware of reports that Ukrainian rebels have been laying land mines on roads through to the crash site of the downed flight in eastern Ukraine. The claims were reportedly by made a Ukrainian military spokesman. Julie Bishop said claims investigators are being deterred from the MH17 crash site by land mines are 'utterly despicable'.

'I don't know if those reports are confirmed,' she told ABC radio on Thursday. 'If that is true, it is utterly despicable.' Ms Bishop said new information suggesting remains of up to 80 bodies were still on the site has made the joint team even more resolute and desperate to gain access. 'It's heartbreaking, it's so distressing. 'We have the team in place, we have the experts ready to work, and we can't get to the site.' The foreign minister is concerned that Russia could be actively undermining the access process. The Ukrainian government had been offering strong support for a humanitarian corridor and ceasefire.

'We sent out a team in advance and they get halfway down the road ... sometimes three quarters of the way ... and then the shelling starts. 'Whilst I can't point the finger at who starts the shelling, we get absolute assurances from the Ukraine government that it's not them.'

"By . David Kent . Brendan Rodgers has hailed the talents of Mario Balotelli ahead of Liverpool's clash with AC Milan in North Carolina. The Anfield boss is in the market for a new striker after the proposed £8.5million deal to sign Queens Park Rangers' Loic Remy collapsed due to a failed medical. And Rodgers says he's a fan of the controversial Italy international, who has been heavily linked with a return to the Premier League this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Balotelli do the ironing while reading 'I am Zlatan' Star striker: Brendan Rodgers admits he is a big fan of the talented AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli . Focused: Balotelli is reportedly keen on a Premier League switch this summer . 'Balotelli is a big talent,' Rodgers said. 'I saw that in this time at Inter Milan as a young player and obviously going to Manchester City when we had a real close eye on him there. 'He's got all the qualities. He's 6ft 3ins, he's quick, his touch is terrific and he can score goals. 'He went back to Italy to play and he's still so young. If his focus is right, his concentration is right and he leads the lifestyle of a top player then he can play for any team in the world.' Liverpool face Milan at Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium on Saturday night knowing victory will secure their place in Monday's final of the International Champions Cup in Miami. Selfie time: Balotelli has 'all the qualities', according to the Liverpool boss . Rodgers' side have already beaten Olympiacos and Manchester City in the tournament and one major plus has been the form of defender Sebastian Coates. The Uruguayan centre-back missed most of last season with a serious knee injury but is now back to full fitness and has impressed in the States. 'Seb is a player who played in the team when I first came into the club and then was out of the team,' Rodgers said. 'He was very unfortunate to have had a bad injury which put him out for a while, but he went away on loan, got himself fit and he's come back and done really well in pre-season. 'He's a real good guy as well, a humble man, never cries about not playing and accepts as a professional he won't play in every game . On the way back: Rodgers says Sebastian Coates could have a future at the club . Technique: The boss said Coates is excellent on the deck considering his height . 'He's a big boy but he can play football. He has a lovely touch, lovely technique but he can pass the ball and he can be aggressive. 'The question is whether he gets enough games that will satisfy his own personal needs because he's a talent. 'He's done well in the games and we'll see what the rest of the summer holds for him.' As well as searching for more firepower, Liverpool are working on deals to sign Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno and Atletico Madrid right-back Javier Manquillo. However, Rodgers wouldn't be drawn on the club's transfer activity. 'We won't have too much business to be done but we still have a few areas we want to strengthen,' he said. Private: Rodgers wouldn't be drawn on moves for Alberto Moreno (above) and Javier Manquillo (below) 'It's just purely on the back of us having a really thin squad last season, we were very short and it was incredible what we achieved last year. 'We need to make sure we have the freshness so there's still one or two areas to look at. 'There is no point mentioning numbers or positions, we want to strengthen a couple of positions and if we can do that I'll be really happy. 'This trip has been a great chance to come away, improve fitness levels and reintroduce some of the tactics into the team. 'The new players have settled in quickly. That's a great credit not just to just them but to the team. There's no egos here and the spirit in the team is very strong.","Rodgers says Balotelli is a 'big talent' but isn't drawn on transfers .

"By . Kelly Strange . A woman gave birth to her first child two-and-a-half years after her husband died of cancer, fulfilling his dying wish. Beating odds of 100 to one, Karen Steer conceived her daughter using sperm harvested from her husband, John, when he was dying of the disease. Just days after he succumbed to lung cancer, Mrs Steer, 41, learned her first attempt at IVF had failed. But determined to fulfill her promise to make her husband a father, the widow vowed to keep trying. Karen Steer gave birth to a daughter, Johren, right, in May, two years after her husband John, left, died after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in 2010 . Mrs Steer said the birth of Johren - whose name is a combination of both her parents' names - fulfilled her promise to her dying husband, as she vowed to make him a father . The 41-year-old conceived on her fourth and final attempt, giving birth to a baby girl in May. She said: ‘ I’m so glad I kept my promise to John. 'When he died to felt like I had lost him forever, but now thanks to our baby it feels like I have a part of him back. ‘I cannot tell you how lucky I feel. When they placed her on my chest I fell in love immediately. 'She looked so much like her father with her mop of black hair and dark brown eyes.’ Mrs Steer and her farm manager husband had been together for 18 years when he was diagnosed with inoperable cancer in 2010. Doctors told them he had between just two and six months to live. Mrs Steer, a postwoman in Swindon, Wiltshire, said: ‘ We thought we had all the time in the world to get married and have a family. ‘It was too much to take in.’ While Mr Steer battled treatment to try and extend his life, his wife began fertility treatment to try and conceive their longed-for child.

'When she smiles her whole face smiles and I know John is with us' - Karen Steer . Before embarking on her fourth round of IVF she was warned there was just a one in 100 chance of success due to her age and egg quality. She said: ‘I knew in my heart it would probably be my last attempt. I just had a strong feeling that I should try again.’ Recalling the moment she realised she was expecting, Mrs Steer said she took her husband's ashes to the bathroom while taking the pregnancy test. She said: ‘ I just started to laugh and looked over at John’s ashes, I couldn’t believe we had done it.’ Mrs Steer named her daughter Johren - a combination of both their forenames.

"By . Fiona Locke . Naomi Laver (with husband Aaron) has a condition which means her joints dislocate on a daily basis, meaning she has to force them back into place . A woman dubbed 'sparrow legs' has to piece her body back together each day because a rare condition means her joints constantly dislocate. As a child, Naomi Laver's legs would bend backwards, she would be told off for not standing up properly and fell victim to the playground bullies making fun of her condition. For years doctors dismissed her mother's complaints, passing it off as growing pains. But at the age of 16, after being referred to an orthopaedic consultant, Ms Laver was diagnosed with Benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome. The rare disorder causes joint laxity, which results in limbs bending the wrong way leaving joints prone to dislocation. After repeated visits to the doctors, Ms Laver's condition deteriorated when her knees started dislocating. The 22-year-old, said: ‘At first it was around once a week. 'But it got worse and soon my knees were dislocating every day and I needed crutches. ‘Each time they’d make a loud clicking noise. I’d be at school or out and about. ‘At first I was scared but I learned to pop my joints back into place. Only sometimes I couldn’t do it and I’d end up in hospital. ‘One time I was out in town with friends and it happened. Everyone laughed, it was mortifying.’ Ms Laver, from Barton-Upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, refused to leave the house for fear of being mocked. Finally at the age of 16 she was referred to an orthopaedic consultant. Tests followed, including X-rays, reflex and mobility tests, to assess joint laxity. It was then specialists diagnosed Ms Laver with the rare syndrome. The condition is often hereditary and tends to affect more women than men. Ms Laver, said: ‘I was told there was nothing they could do, I’d have to live with it. ‘But at least it was a diagnosis, I hadn’t imagined it.’ As time wore on her condition grew worse. When she was 18, Ms Laver had an operation on one of her knees to try and fix the joint, but surgery did not work. The 22-year-old has suffered chronic pain as a result of her bendy legs since she was a child. Her condition prompted bullies to call her 'sparrow legs' At the age of 16 Ms Laver was diagnosed with benign hypermobility joint syndrome, which causes joint laxity and leaves joints prone to dislocation. When she was 18 she had surgery to try and treat her knee, pictured, but the procedure failed to ease her pain . Joint hypermobility means some or all of a person's joints have an unusually large range of movement. People with hypermobility are particularly supple and able to move their limbs into positions others find impossible. Many people with hypermobile joints do not have any problems or need treatment. However, joint hypermobility can sometimes cause unpleasant symptoms, such as: . It can cause extreme tiredness and long-term pain. The condition is often hereditary, and is linked to changes in a protein called collagen. Collagen is found throughout the body – for example, in skin and ligaments. If collagen is weaker than it should be, tissues in the body will be fragile. This can make ligaments and joints particularly loose and stretchy. There are estimates that up to 3 in 10 people may be affected to some degree. Source: NHS Choices . It was then, the condition began to affect other parts of Ms Laver's body. ‘I started dislocating all my joints, my shoulders, elbows, ankles, toes, hands, even my jaw,' Ms Laver said. 'It would happen several times a day. I didn’t know from one moment to the next which part of me would pop out of place. ‘Every time I moved something would go - and with it came a loud clicking sound. ‘I’d often wake in the morning and have to put various parts of myself back together again. ‘The pain was intense. I was prescribed different painkillers but I was in agony.’ Walking became difficult, leaving Ms Laver almost house bound. ‘With the body of a 100-year-old, what future did I have? By last summer I even needed a wheelchair to get around,' she said. It was around the same time, that she met Aaron, 21, through a friend. ‘He was loving, caring, my condition didn’t faze him,' said Naomi. ‘We grew close, fell in love. And after a few months he asked me if I’d marry him.’ She said yes - but vowed not to go down the aisle in her wheelchair. ‘Mustering . all my strength, and ignoring the loud clicking under my wedding dress, I . made it up the aisle to where Aaron was waiting,' she said. ‘It was the happiest moment of my life. And I held it together until my legs gave way at the reception. ‘But . each day is still a struggle, my legs are getting bendier by the day . and I have to choose what I want to dislocate - my legs by walking a few . steps or my arms by using my wheelchair. 'And I have to put myself back together again when I wake in the mornings.' Ms . Laver has just been referred to a hospital in Bath for specialist . physiotherapy treatment once a month which doctors are confident will . help with her condition by strengthening surrounding muscles to ease . pressure on her joints. The 22-year-old said: 'I started dislocating all my joints, my shoulders, elbows, ankles, toes, hands, even my jaw. Every time I moved something would go - and with it came a loud clicking sound.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Imagine looking up from delicately nibbling your starter of crispy deer lichen to find someone staring in the window at your plate. It's hardly surprising that a steady swarm of voyeuristic food tourists descended on a certain restaurant in Copenhagen to check out its menu - if only to watch what people were eating - Noma is consistently voted the 'best restaurant in the world' after all. But some diners found the fact that hundreds of tourists were congregating outside the restaurant so disconcerting its founders decided to take action to stop persistent oglers. NOW try looking in! The gardens spread around the outside of the building act as a deterrent to gawpers . Don't worry, we can still look at the menu: Swarms of food tourists used to congregate outside Noma before the gardens were created . Chef and co-owner René Redzepi commissioned a team of Danish architects to create a garden to reflect the adventurous and delicate modern Nordic cuisine within. However this week it was revealed that the Nordic garden completed at the end of last year had been created to - politely - deter persistent oglers. With an eclectic menu offering dishes such as a cod roe sandwich made up of a 'razor thin slice of wild duck skin and fresh vinegar-dusted herbs on rippled toast' and 'sliced chips of dehydrated scallops on a bed of watercress, beech nuts and squid ink' the exterior had t to be interesting too. Rocky terrain: The lumps and bumps in the grass and a rocky Nordic design make the garden an effective obstacle . Accordingly the rocky garden cut into the concrete harbour that surrounds the 18th-century warehouse in which Noma is housed, is an interesting, rugged landscape of evergreen plants from Scandinavia and lava stones from Iceland. 'René Redzepi was not interested in putting up a red rope in front of the restaurant,"" says POLYFORM partner Thomas Kock, who worked on the project. 'He didn't want to exclude the curious minds but rather create a buffer zone around the restaurant, which gave visitors the experience of Noma and in this way included them.' The restaurant has not only redefined . contemporary Nordic cuisine, but been named best in the world four times . in the last five years, and holds two Michelin stars.","Noma in Copenhagen consistently voted 'best restaurant in the world'

"By . John Hutchinson . The Goodwood Festival of Speed is a joyous celebration of all things fast and furious. Yet for one parent yesterday, things were far from fun when their six month-old baby became trapped in their car. Step forward the 'fourth emergency service,' the AA, who proved to live up to their tagline. Fourth emergency service: The AA, pictured either side of founder of the Festival of Speed Lord March, left, and Chris Jansen, right,  rescued a baby trapped in a car . The company are official partners of this year's Festival, and as such offered members of the public free membership for the opening day on Wednesday. And almost immediately they were forced into action to prevent what could have turned into a precarious situation. At the Goodwood Hotel, the baby became trapped inside a 2012 Ford C-Max, with the keys in the vehicle. [related] . The . fire brigade were called by the hotel staff, but people panicked as the . car was in direct sunlight and temperatures were rising. But . AA man Jamie Walls, 38, who has been on patrol since he was 19, was on . hand to rescue the situation, arriving within minutes and forcing entry . into the vehicle and handing over the baby to a very emotional parent. The Festival of Speed is the largest motoring garden party in the world, and was founded in 1993 by Lord March. Held in the immaculate grounds of Goodwood House, this annual Hillclimb event is a true celebration of motor sport. This year's theme is ‘Addicted to Winning – The Unbeatable Champions of Motor Sport’, celebrating the legendary drivers and riders, teams and manufacturers, who have swept all before them in their sport. Visitors can expect to see cars and motorbikes from over 100 years of worldwide motor racing history climb the hill. The fire brigade arrived shortly after, blue lights flashing, but the situation had been resolved, and their job became to merely sign off what could have become a desperate situation. The hotel staff were extremely impressed by the AA's rescue mission. And it will be a feather in the cap for the organisation, with the fourth emergency service beating the third. The man with the plan Walls said: 'There was a big crowd around the car and it was scorching. I shouted at onlookers to cover the car from the heat and they took a material banner from the hotel and put it over the car. 'I spotted the keys in a big bunch on the front seat. I managed to force in a rod but it was a tricky and delicate move as I had to turn the keys over and then just managed to press the remote with my rods. 'To load cheers the door unlocked and I recovered the baby girl. I had heard sirens in the background but just got on with my job and got the baby out in minutes. 'The crowd just continued to cheer me as the fire engine arrived. They was lots of banter about the fourth emergency service but to me it is just part of my brilliant job.' Edmund King, AA president, added: 'Yesterday was a momentous day for the AA. We became a Public Company (PLC) for the first time in our 109 history and flagged off that event at the start of the Festival of Speed (see picture). 'But perhaps more importantly our hero patrols continued doing what they are best at in the world – rescuing vulnerable people. 'It was a good job we offered to rescue anyone in need at Goodwood as panic was setting in near the Goodwood hotel when a six-month old baby was locked in her car. A crowd had gathered around the frantic parents as the temperatures rose.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The discovery of the remains of Richard III in a council car park in Leicester in 2012 has seen the number of visitors to the county soaring. The number of tourists flocking to Leicestershire rose from 28.7 million to 29.5 million, according to  tourist chiefs for the county. In addition the turnover of leisure businesses such as hotels and visitor attractions shot up by 6.2 per cent from £1.39 billion in 2012 to £1.48 billion in 2013, and with a new Richard III visitor centre opening next month and a planned reburial of the king next year, the increase is expected to continue. 'My kingdom for a horse:'  Visitor numbers have soared in Leicestershire, where the remains of Richard III were discovered . Leicestershire's tourism industry is growing much faster than in other East Midlands counties where the average growth was just 3.1 per cent, said Martin Peters, chief executive of Leicester Shire Promotions. The new Richard III Centre will open on July 26 in the old Leicester Grammar School building at St Martin’s Place, which is being transformed into the new exhibition. The Victorian Gothic building has been renovated . to create two floors of exhibition space and a new covered area will . allow visitors access to the original grave site in which Richard's . remains were discovered in August 2012. The . centre, entitled ‘King Richard III: Dynasty, Death and . Discovery,' will guide visitors through the dramatic story of the king's . life, brutal death and the fascinating story of his rediscovery. It . will be told through state-of-the-art interactive displays and . demonstrations and colourful hands-on exhibits. Now is the carpark of our discontent: Archaeologists found the skeleton of Richard III during a dig in a council carpark in 2012 . Archaeologists at the University of Leicester led the exhumation of the remains, which will form the centrepiece of the exhibition opening next month . Other notable features include a new courtyard garden, glass entrance hall and cafe. The exhibition will also include a glass balcony that will use technology to show visitors how the modern day view compares with that of the city in the Middle Ages. Richard III's body received an unceremonious burial and the original tomb is believed to have been destroyed during the Reformation, with the remains being lost for more than five centuries. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was undertaken on a city council car park in Leicester using ground-penetrating radar on the site once occupied by Greyfriars. The University of Leicester confirmed in February 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of Richard III. The scientists concluded it was the remains of the King who had died in 1485 using a combination of the radiocarbon dating, a comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and a comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. The public perception of Richard III, shaped by Shakespeare's play about the Plantagenet King, is of a bloodthirsty usurper who left a trail of bodies on the way to the throne. However when the Richard III society showed off the reconstructed face of the last English king to die in battle aged 32, to the public in February 2013, the face was declared too handsome to be that of a cold-blooded killer.","The remains of Richard III were found under a car park in Leicester in 2012 .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Electronic 'ears' have been installed along one of Scotland's most landslide prone train lines, in a UK first. Bosses are hoping the newly installed fibre-optic cables will protect rail tracks, passengers and roads across the country. The pioneering project is being tested on the route below Ben Cruachan, where in 2010 a ScotRail train nearly plunged down a 50ft embankment after hitting a fallen boulder. It involves cables being buried just below the surface on either side of the single-track line for six miles between near Falls of Cruachan and Loch Awe stations. The 'ears' are set to be trialled on the line that saw the Falls of Cruachan derailment back in 2010 . Derailed: The accident was caused when a train hit a boulder on the track . Network Scotland said the 'distributed acoustic sensing' (Das) scheme can warn of trees falling on tracks, and landslides on roads. And the system is sensitive enough to distinguish between obstacles falling and on the line and other noises such as trains, deers and hailstones. Alan Ross, director of route asset management said: 'Rockfalls and landslips are one of the railway's longest standing risks and we are always looking at ways we can use technology. 'The new acoustic monitoring technology on trial offers us a potential solution to a problem which has affected the West Highland lines since they were built by the Victorians. 'If successful, this new system will help us provide an even safer and more reliable railway on a line vital to both local communities it serves and to Scotland's tourist trade.' They are a modern-day replacement for a Victorian rockfall warning system in the steep-sided Pass of Brander on the Glasgow Oban line. A tripwire system built by engineer John Anderson in 1882, in which falling rocks trigger line-slide signals, failed to detect the boulder which derailed a train in 2010. In 2012, a ScotRail train hit debris from a nearby landslide, one of two incidents in Scotland the same day. Three weeks prior to that, a freight locomotive crashed down a hillside near Corrour in the Highlands after hitting landslide debris. Hopeful: Bosses are hoping the newly installed fibre-optic cables will protect rail tracks, passengers and roads across the country . Painful memory: It is hoped the technology can bring even more piece of mind to commuters . A ScotRail spokeswoman said: 'We are aware Network Rail has begun trials of a new acoustic system. 'We welcome this initiative as, if successful, it will aid in the delivery of a more reliable, consistent and safe railway.' The Office of Rail Regulation has previously instructed Network Rail to improve its assessment of landslide risks to speed up its response to incidents. A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'The regulator supports Network Rail's work to develop, and introduce, new technology for monitoring the condition of its infrastructure. 'That is why we approved £95 million for the implementation of remote condition testing for earthworks, signalling equipment, level crossings and other assets over the next five years.' Network Rail Scotland hopes the new technology will offer a cheaper alternative to maintaining the tripwire system and other anti-landslide measures such as netting slopes and removing rocks, which often require line closures.","'Ears' on the track will give passengers greater piece of mind .

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . George Groves is likening himself to a naughty boy in the back seat of a car annoying to distraction the driver, who in this metaphorical case is Carl Froch. This is a cute analogy for their roles in the build up to the slugfest to be played out at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night to the guttural sound-track of an expectant 80,000, the largest boxing crowd in post-war Britain. It is also another amusing sample of the witty, intelligent mind games which Groves has been bringing to the ring’s biggest Battles of Britain since Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank went at it in the early Nineties. VIDEO: Froch: My boxing legacy is on the line in for Groves rematch . Glove story: Carl Froch with his wife Rachael and his children as he prepares to face George Groves at Wembley . King of the ring: Froch works out among his adoring fans at Nottingham's Broadmarsh shopping centre . Backseat driver: Groves says he will try to annoy Froch 'like a petulant kid in the back seat of the car' pre-fight . Froch, however, would argue that it is not as relevant as for their contentious first fight in November. ‘George irritated me then,’ says the world super-middleweight champion. ’I’m cool now.’ And the consensus is that a less emotional, more relaxed Froch has won the latest verbal punch-up with Groves, that eyeball to eyeball confrontation in a television studio which should help raise the pay-per-view TV sales as Sky high as the live gate. Five months ago it was the other way around as Groves got under the skin of the world super-middleweight champion. That time the Cobra rose from the canvas to win with a stoppage rendered controversial by the haste with which referee Howard Foster intervened. Will it be a complete reversal of fortunes this time? Lose the slanging match, win the fight? Saint George says so, predicting a third round KO. Froch insists that the Londoner who is nearly 10 years his junior missed his chance the first time. Curiously, Groves was left dumb-struck in front of the Sky cameras when asked for examples to substantiate his allegation that Froch has lied about their rivalry. Now he has found his voice again, to poke fun at Froch’s hiring of a sports shrink. The 26-year-old Groves is back to his more familiar, articulate self when he says: ‘Carl has spent a lot time coaching himself not to lose his rag. That’s taxing. He’s like a father with a petulant kid in the back seat of the car. ‘That’s me. He has to keep turning round to tell me to behave myself. That’s wearing for him. I’m still getting on his nerves. Confident mood: Froch says he will be 'amazed' if he doesn't knock out Groves at Wembley on Saturday . Confident: Froch poses in front of the crowd prior to a work-out . ‘He’s getting help trying to control himself but it’s not a psychologist he needs. It’s a psychiatrist.’ Froch has turned to Manchester United’s mind coach Chris Marshall to help him concentrate on fighting, not feuding. He says: ‘I was guilty of letting George’s nonsense get to me first time out. ‘I just wanted to flatten him. I needed to remind myself that it’s called boxing, not street-fighting. If an expert can be of assistance with that, why not? ‘All the top sportsmen in the world use sports science now.’ Froch staged a Bank Holiday Monday work-out in front of his home-town faithful in a Nottingham shopping centre. He appeared as calm as during the televised exchanges with Groves, when he told his challenger: ‘I will be astonished if I don’t knock you out on Saturday.’ Great shakes: Froch trained in front of an adoring Bank Holiday crowd in his home city . Groves, who is predicting a third-round stoppage of his own, is using the title of that programme - Behind the Ropes – to argue his case. He says: ‘Carl feels like he’s cracked it but rope is the right word for all this. Give Carl enough and he’ll hang himself.’ To which Froch responds: ‘I hope he really does come out rushing to beat me inside three rounds. That will help me stop him sooner rather than later.’ The animosity between the pair is rooted in Froch’s perception that Groves does not show sufficient respect to a six-year champion going into his 12th straight world title fight against the best super-middleweights on the planet. Groves says: ‘I respect what he’s achieved in his career but that doesn’t stop me believing I’m better than him now.’ Their TV debate ended with a handshake-cum-shoving match. Best of enemies: There is a mutual dislike between Froch (left) and Groves but they don't 'hate' each other . It is a rich part of boxing culture that even the fiercest of opponents embrace each other once the fight has been won and lost. Evander Holyfield, for example, has forgiven Mike Tyson for infamously biting off a chunk of his ear and they get on well now. Can Froch and Groves ever be friends, no matter what happens on Saturday night? First time round: Froch beat Groves after a stoppage in the ninth but it was one hell of a fight . Froch: ‘I don’t hate anyone. Not George or anyone else. But I don’t have to like him.’ Groves: ‘I’ve never had a lasting problem with anyone I’ve fought. We don’t have to end up friends but I wouldn’t want to go through life feuding with anybody.’ Perhaps they will just have to settle for becoming the best of enemies. Froch-Groves II will be televised live on Sky Sports Box Office on Saturday night, at £16.95. The IBF have approved Paul Butler’s fight with Stuart Hall on Saturday week as an official challenge for their world bantamweight title. Thus Newcastle will play host to a duel between one of the hottest young prospects on the boxing scene and a man with one of the most intriguing back stories in the ring. Butler, of Ellesmere Port, is the unbeaten super-flyweight champion of Britain and the Commonwealth and so sure of his exciting ability that he is not only moving up a division but happy to take on Darlington’s Hall in his native North East. Hall has found redemption in boxing from a booze and drug-fuelled life in the bars of Ibiza. Duel: Paul Butler (left) and Stuart Hall during the head-to-head photocall in Liverpool . He reached out heroically for unexpected world championship fame when promoter Dennis Hobson bank-rolled his successful battle with Vusi Malinga for the vacant IBF title. Hall kept the title in his first defence, which ended in a technical draw when another British rival Martin Ward sustained an eye-cut. As a 34-year-old late-comer to prominence, Hall’s determination to stay in the limelight has been fanned by the precocious 25-year-old Butler’s predictions of victory. Hall says: ‘I can’t wait to shut him up.’ Hall-Butler will be televised live on BoxNation on Saturday, July 7.

"By . Katy Winter . Kate Middleton was today voted most stylish British celebrity following her recent royal tour of Australia and New Zealand. And she should thank the Queen, who reportedly counselled Kate on her look for the three-week trip, advising her to embrace longer hemlines and a more sophisticated style. The Duchess, who garnered 21 per cent of the total vote, beat supermodel and fashionista Kate Moss, who scored a measly 4 per cent and A-Lister Emma Watson on 5 per cent. The Queen reportedly instructed the naturally stylish Kate to embrace lower hemlines and a more regal look for the tour of Australia and New Zealand . Kate seems to have inspired British women, with many now feeling that knee-length skirts are a better and more sophisticated option . And it looks like the Queen’s style . influence is extending beyond royal circles, with a third of women (33 . per cent) admitting they’re now more inclined to invest in longer-length . skirts. The majority (9 in 10 women) now agree this look is far classier and would actually make them feel more confident (65 per cent). Interestingly the younger generation is keenest on Kate's sophisticated look, with 18-24 year olds (18 per cent) most eager to replicate Kate’s wardrobe. Furthermore, almost three-quarters of men (72 per cent) deem a knee-length skirt a classier look, preferring their partners to wear longer skirts. However, two-thirds (64 per cent) of males admit short skirts are more likely to grab their attention. The Duchess has even manage to beat fashion icon Kate Moss following her string of hit outfits on tour . Over half (57 per cent) of men also admitted to judging whether or not a woman is ‘wife material’ by the clothes she wears. And Kate Middleton isn’t the only one to bow to the pressure of grandparents and in-laws. Over half of women (51 per cent) say they dress more conservatively when visiting relatives so as not to give a bad impression (48 per cent) and be seen as classy (67 per cent). Commenting on the findings, Nick Chalkley, Head Fashion Buyer at QVC, who commissioned the study, said: 'When it comes to style it’s clear to see the Queen’s opinion reigns supreme. 'Under Her Majesty’s careful guidance, Kate has managed to top the style stakes with more women preferring a longer-length style.' 1. Kate Middleton (21%) 2. Holly Willoughby (13%) 3.

Horrifying: A teenager was brutally gang-raped by five men after being abducted as she walked home from a party (file photo) A teenager was brutally gang-raped by five men after being abducted as she walked home from a party. The 18-year-old girl was grabbed and forced in a car before being driven to a unknown location on Sunday evening in Sydney's Hills district. She was eventually released and went to hospital for treatment. The girl was walking home at  Baulkham Hills at 1am on Sunday when a green sedan stopped next to her near St Michaels Place, reported Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph. The car, with five men inside, asked for directions to a nearby shopping centre. The woman gave directions and continued walking, but she was grabbed from behind by one of the men and forced into the car. She was then driven to an unknown location nearby and sexually assaulted by a number of men. Following the assault, the woman was driven to Waterloo Road at Castle Hill and freed. She was later taken to Westmead Hospital after reporting the terrifying ordeal at home. She was released this morning and is hoping to help police track her attackers.

"By . Associated Press . and Reuters . and Damien Gayle . Two dozen people have been arrested in connection with the mine disaster in Turkey, as relatives today buried the last of its more than 300 victims. General manager Ramazan Dogru and operations manager Akin Celik were among the 24 detained five days after a fire ripped through the mine in Soma, west Turkey, choking and incinerating workers. The disaster has sparked violent protests across Turkey, directed at mine owners accused of ignoring safety for profit, and at Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government, which is seen as too close to industry bosses. Mourners pat down the soil on the graves of the final two workers pulled dead from the mine in Soma, Turkey, where a fire which broke out on Tuesday led to the deaths of more than 300 people . A woman faints as she mourns the miners buried today, as two dozen mine executives were held for questioning as an investigation into the disaster, Turkey's worst in decades, got underway in Soma . A grieving woman holds her face in her hands as she visits the cemetery where some of the 301 people killed after the explosion and fire in the mine which choked workers with carbon monoxide have been buried . But today the mood in the town of Soma was more measured and downbeat, as mourners paid their respects to the last two miners pulled dead from the mine yesterday. As authorities scrabbled to show they were taking the tragedy seriously, prosecutors were today weighing charges of negligence and contributing to the deaths of more than one person, Dogan news agency said. Police had cordoned off the courthouse in Soma this afternoon as a growing crowd of onlookers, journalists and relatives gathered outside, Reuters said. One woman told the agency her engineer husband was among those detained inside and one man, whose engineer brother was being held, said dozens of people had been questioned as part of the probe. Both declined to be named. 'We know that we have lost 301 loved ones, but we have loved ones inside as well,' the man said. The bricked-up mine: Rescuers complained of high levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide inside . The arrests and investigation comes despite the government and company officials repeatedly insisting that the mine was inspected regularly and negligence was not a factor in Tuesday's tragedy. But reacting to widespread public anger, government officials promised to investigate and pledged that any mine officials found to be negligent would be punished. The Milliyet newspaper said Saturday that a preliminary report by a mine safety expert who inspected the Soma mine suggested that smoldering coal caused the mine's roof to collapse. The report said the tunnel's support beams were made of wood, not metal, and the mine had too few carbon monoxide sensors. Company officials have described safety standards as high, noting that the mine contained 50 gas sensors and employees were provided with gas masks. Riot police use water cannons to disperse protesters in Istanbul demonstrating over the accident . At a news conference on Friday, Celik, . one of those now held for questioning, admitted thick smoke from the . underground fire killed many miners who weren't carrying gas masks. Rescue workers entering the mine complained of high levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. 'There . is no negligence,' Celik said. 'I have been doing this job for 20 years . but I have never seen anything like this. We would not want harm to . come to a single fingernail of our workers.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz has added another string to her bow by turning writer and director for a promotional video for her new underwear range with Agent Provocateur. The 39-year-old, who gave birth to her second child this month, designed the L'Agent collection with her younger sister, Monica, 36. While fans of the Spanish actress may be disappointed she doesn't make an appearance in the video herself, she has assembled a host of attractive models to take her place showcasing the lingerie.

"By . Reuters . The number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan may drop well below 10,000 - the minimum demanded by the U.S. military to train Afghan forces - as the longest war in American history winds down, Obama administration officials briefed on the matter say.Since Afghanistan's general election on April 5, White House, State Department and Pentagon officials have resumed discussions on how many American troops should remain after the current U.S.-led coalition ends its mission this year.The decision to consider a small force, possibly less than 5,000 U.S. troops, reflects a belief among White House officials that Afghan security forces have evolved into a robust enough force to contain a still-potent Taliban-led insurgency. The small U.S. force that would remain could focus on counter-terrorism or training operations. U.S. Army soldiers may gradually begin leaving Afghanistan until there are as low as 5,000 soldiers left . That . belief, the officials say, is based partly on Afghanistan's surprisingly . smooth election, which has won international praise for its high . turnout, estimated at 60 percent of 12 million eligible votes, and the . failure of Taliban militants to stage high-profile attacks that day.The Obama administration has been looking at options for a possible residual U.S. force for months.'The . discussion is very much alive,' said one U.S. official who asked not to . be identified. 'They're looking for additional options under 10,000' troops.'There are now . about 33,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, down from 100,000 in 2011, when . troop numbers peaked a decade into a conflict originally intended to . deny al Qaeda sanctuary in Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, . attacks. With . British and other foreign troops scheduled to depart in lock step with . U.S. soldiers, the size of any residual U.S. force could add fuel to a . debate in Washington over whether Taliban-led violence will intensify . amid the vacuum left by Western forces, as some U.S. military officials . expect. Military leaders, . including American General Joe Dunford, who heads U.S. and NATO forces . in Afghanistan, has identified 10,000 soldiers as the minimum needed to . help train and advise Afghan forces fighting the insurgency, arguing a . smaller force would struggle to protect itself. During . a March visit to Washington, Dunford told lawmakers that without . foreign soldiers supporting them, Afghan forces would begin to . deteriorate ""fairly quickly"" in 2015. The Afghan air force, still . several years away from being self-sufficient, will require even more . assistance, he said. A . smaller U.S. force could have other unintended consequences, possibly . discouraging already skeptical lawmakers from fully funding U.S. commitments to help fund Afghan forces. Ever since Afghanistan's smooth April 5 election, officials believe that the Afghan troops may be able to contain the Taliban themselves . At their current size, Afghan . forces will cost at least $5 billion in 2015, a sum far beyond the reach . of the Afghan government. The United States has been widely expected to . be the largest outside funder for those forces. The Taliban and other militants have been weakened by more than 12 years of Afghan and NATO assaults, but they still can obtain supplies and plan attacks from Afghanistan's remote mountain regions and tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan.Some analysts are wary of reducing the U.S. presence to less than 10,000 troops.""If the White House opts to keep a lower number of troops, it will put more pressure on the Afghan forces and run the risk of squandering their recent progress against the Taliban,' said Lisa Curtis, a former CIA analyst and State Department official now with the conservative Heritage Foundation, a think tank in Washington. There are now about 33,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, down from 100,000 in 2011 . A U.S. force significantly below 10,000 might focus almost exclusively on counter-terrorism, tracking militants affiliated with a greatly weakened but resilient al Qaeda insurgency based on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, officials said.Debate over the size of a residual U.S. force follows the failure of the U.S. and Afghan governments to finalize a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) to authorize a U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014, the deadline for U.S. and NATO troops to conclude their fight against the Taliban. 'The longer we go without a BSA, the more challenging it will be to plan and execute any U.S. mission,' said Laura Lucas Magnuson, a White House spokeswoman. 'Furthermore, the longer we go without a BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 U.S. mission will be smaller in scale and ambition.' Results of the recent presidential election may not be known for weeks, or months if runoffs take place. But leading candidates have said they will sign the agreement, which has been on hold because of reservations from current Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In late February, Obama announced that the United States might seek to sign the deal with Karzai's successor and possibly keep troops there after 2014 to train and advise Afghan forces and pursue al Qaeda militants. Some U.S. officials believe Afghan forces will require substantial, hands-on support from foreign troops, in addition to help from the United States.","There are now .

"By . Associated Press . The parents of a six-year-old girl waited almost 24-hours to raise the alarm after their daughter went missing. Washington state sheriff's deputies are now frantically attempting to make up for precious lost time as they search for the first-grader. Janice Paulette Wright was last seen Saturday night when she went to bed at the family home in east Bremerton. However, even on Sunday morning when young Janice was nowhere to be found, did the family become worried. Janice Paulette Wright: Kitsap County sheriff's deputies are searching for Janice, 6, who is missing and was last seen Saturday night, at her home in east Bremerton, Washington . The little girl had apparently left home on previous occasions and wandered around the neighborhood. The parents did not end up calling the police until they became desperate at around 9p.m. on Sunday, . the sheriff's office said. The family felt it was relatively safe because it's a fenced property, said Deputy Scot Wilson. Police said the family became . concerned when they hadn’t heard from Janice by 8:30 p.m. and started . going door to door in the mobile home park. On the hunt: Kitsap County deputies at the mobile home park in Bremerton . When they couldn’t find her, they called 911 at 9:55 p.m. on Sunday. Kitsap . County Sheriff’s deputies arrived at the mobile home park at 10:34 p.m. and requested help from the sheriff’s search and rescue unit.  Central . Kitsap Fire and Rescue responded with a thermal imaging device to help . find the missing girl. A ground search with search and rescue volunteers and K-9 teams began about 1:30 a.m. 'Yes. It is strange. At this point we don't suspect an abduction from the house,' Wilson said. 'Right now the focus is on (search and rescue).' Detectives have started an . investigation.  Investigators said there may have been sightings of . Janice in the mobile home park between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Janice has been entered into the FBI National Crime Information Center as a missing child . The search began about 1:30 a.m. Monday with deputies and volunteers in and around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park, where the girl lives with her parents and six siblings. Searchers have used dogs and heat-sensing equipment. Janice is 3 feet tall, weighs 45 pounds and has black hair. She'll be a first-grader this coming school year. Two other children in the home, an 8-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, were removed from the home by Child Protective Services, Kitsap County deputies said, as they felt conditions in the home jeopardized the safety of the children. The parents have been cooperative, and are not in police custody.","Janice Paulette Wright was last seen by family members on Saturday night at 10 p.m.

"By . Reuters . Justin Alexander Teixera (pictured in his mugshot) has been sentenced to four years probation . A 25-year-old aspiring lawyer from California was sentenced yesterday to up to four years of probation and 16 hours of animal shelter work per month for drunkenly beheading a bird at a Las Vegas hotel in 2012. Justin Alexander Teixeira was visiting Las Vegas with two friends when he cornered the bird, a helmeted guineafowl, before picking it up and ripping off its head. Bystanders saw the incident as they ate breakfast at the Flamingo hotel, said Tess Driver, spokeswoman for the Clark County District Attorney's Office. Teixeira apologized yesterday to the witnesses who saw the incident and the state of Nevada for his behavior. 'It was the worst moment of my life. If there was anything I could do to undo it, I would', she said in a public statement. The case shocked sensibilities even in Las Vegas, a city famous for tolerating outlandish behavior from the visitors its economy relies upon. Picketers demanded justice for the bird at an earlier court appearance by Teixeira, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'There's some weird stuff that goes on down here, but that was a little different,' Driver said. Security video footage caught Teixeira and two Berkley students, Eric Cueller, now 26, and Hazhir Kargaran, now 27, chase the bird in a garden area, wring its neck and discard its body in some nearby rocks. Cueller and Hazir both pleaded guilty last year to reduced misdemeanor charges and served community service sentences. Bystanders saw the incident as they ate breakfast at the Flamingo hotel in Vegas (pictured) as the beheading took place . Teixeira, who has since graduated from law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and passed the written portion of the California Bar Exam, pleaded guilty last year to one felony count of killing another person's animal. As part of the plea agreement, two other felony charges were dropped and he served 190 days in a prison boot camp ahead of his final sentence. Teixeira was also ordered to spend 16 hours each month working unpaid at an animal shelter for the duration of his probation. If he successfully completes his probation, Teixeira will be able to withdraw his plea and have the felony on his record replaced with a gross misdemeanor, Driver said, a distinction that could affect his ability to practice law. Teixeira's lawyer, Michael Pariente, did not immediately return messages seeking comment.","Justin Alexander Teixeira was sentenced to four years probation and will undertake 16 hours of animal shelter work per month .

"By . Reuters . Thousands of bicyclists, many of them stark naked, poured into the streets of Portland, Oregon on Saturday night for the 11th annual World Naked Bike Ride, a protest that promotes bike riding as an alternative to driving cars. Nude cyclists with lights flashing in their tire spokes rang bells as they barreled down avenues lined with cheering spectators, while a naked, apparently pregnant woman rode in a bike trailer. 'This is a party, but it's also a protest,' said Carl Larson, a ride spokesman. 'It is about oil dependence, cycling vulnerability and body image.' Cruising: Thousands of cyclists, most of them fully of partially nude, poured into the streets of Portland, Oregon on Saturday night for World Naked Bike Ride . Cyclists showed up in Normandale Park an hour before the ride, shedding garments according to the ride theme 'as bare as you dare'.

"By . Joel Christie . A former Twitter employee who was fired from the social media giant has filed a lawsuit against the company for age discrimination and wrongful termination. Peter H. Taylor, 57, was in charge of managing the expansion and operation of Twitter's data centers. However in a lawsuit filed last week in San Francisco Superior Court, he claims he was terminated from the job without notice, despite acting 'in an exemplary manner', reported SF Gate. Taylor's supervisor had given Taylor 'at least one critical mark' about his age, according to the lawsuit. A former Twitter employee, Peter H. Taylor, 57, says the social media giant engaged in age discrimination, and wrongfully terminated him. Pictured here is the site's headquarters in San Francisco, California . His contract was terminated September 23, 2013. 'Defendants replaced plaintiff with several employees in their 20's and 30's,' the lawsuit says. The lawsuit also alleges Twitter discriminated against Taylor for a disability in addition to his age. Taylor had surgery to remove kidney stones and he believes this affected the decision to have him fired. He is seeking unspecified damages. A Twitter spokesman says the case is without merit. 'We will vigorously defend ourselves against it,' the spokesman said. Ageism is not new to Silicon Valley. In 2007, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg controversially said during a Stanford University speech: 'Young people are just smarter.' SF Weekly reports this is not the first time a major Silicon Valley tech company has been sued for age discrimination. In 2004, 54-year-old Brian Reid filed a suit against Facebook, claiming the company discriminates against employees over 40-years-old.","Peter H.

"By . Michael Zennie . A new companion of disgraced NBA owner Donald Sterling has been revealed to be the 'BFF for life' of his former mistress, V. Stiviano. Raquel Lee is a self-proclaimed 'mother, model, actress, designer and entrepreneur.' She claims tangential connections to several celebrities - including that Rob Kardashian once babysat her nephew and that she worked as a 'red carpet designer' for Destiny Child's Michelle Williams and reality starlet Tila Tequila. She was pictured earlier this month as one of four new girlfriends who 80-year-old Sterling took with him on vacation to Desert Springs, California, Radar Online claims. New boo? Raquel Lee posted several photos from the same resort where Donald Sterling was pictured earlier this month . Miss Lee was one of four women pictured with the 80-year-old billionaire Sterling as he distanced himself from ex-girlfriend V. Stiviano . 'BFF for life: In October, V. Stiviano and Miss Lee shared a smooch and these loving remarks at a birthday party that Sterling threw for Stiviano . She posted several pictures on Instagram from the places where Sterling was spotted - but made no mention of being with the elderly NBA owner. She did not respond to a request for comment from MailOnline on Wednesday. Sterling cut ties with Stiviano after she released recordings of him making racist comments. Those recordings resulted in international outcry and the NBA banning him from the league for life. Sterling, a billionaire real estate mogul, has also been forced to sell his NBA franchise, the Los Angeles Clippers, for $2billion. Sterling has vehemently denied claims that he's racist. It's thought he was trying to prove a point when he checked into the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California with two women who appeared to be black, including Miss Lee, and two who appeared to be Asian two weeks ago. Brush with fame: Miss Lee posted this picture of her and reality star Rob Kardashian and claimed he babysat her nephew .

Miss Lee claims she 'created red carpet designs' for Michelle Williams of Destiny's Child and reality star Tila Tequila . His longtime wife, Shelly Sterling, was nowhere to be seen. Neither was Stiviano. Miss Lee's new billionaire friend, Sterling, might have come at the expense of an old one - Stiviano. On her Instagram page Miss Lee has posted several pictures of her and 31-year-old Stiviano together - including one red carpet snap in October 2013 in which she writes 'Happy bday #bf (V. Stiviano) love you!' Stiviano replies, 'my BFF for life...' On social media, Miss Lee seems to make it a point to brush up against celebrity. In March, she posted a 'throwback Thursday' photo of her and reality star Rob Kardashian. '#RobbieK he's so nice, he kept my nephew for me one day. And he loved him!' she wrote. In a short 'Beauty of the Week' profile in Jet magazine, she claimed that she 'created Red Carpet designs for Megan Good, Michelle Williams (of Destiny’s Child), and Tila Tequila to name a few,' according to Radar.

"By . Jonathan Block . and Reuters . Miss America has suggested officials at a Pennsylvania high school reconsider their decision to suspend a student for approaching her at a school assembly and asking her to be his prom date, the beauty queen said on Saturday. The disciplinary action taken by school administrators in York against the 18-year-old senior made national headlines, and generated sympathy for the young man on social media. A video of Central York High School senior Patrick Farves approaching 2014 Miss America Nina Davuluri on Thursday at a school assembly was posted on a local newspaper's website.

Administrators . had heard rumors Farves was planning to make the bold gesture of . approaching Davuluri and warned him not to do so, Farves said in a phone . interview on Saturday. 'By that time, my mind was already set,' he said. 'I was already in the zone.' Farves . was given a three-day in-school suspension, which requires him to sit . in a classroom and work alone. He said he now feels bad his stunt . overshadowed efforts by Davuluri - the first-ever Indian-American Miss . America pageant winner - to promote diversity. 'She . was trying to get across a very strong message - about how it's not . about your beliefs or the color of your skin, but who you are,' he said. Although he was warned not to by a staff member, Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America out to the prom during an appearance she made at the school, earning Farves a three-day suspension. Farves, . who said his mother is white and his father is black, also said he . regretted his action because school officials worked hard to organize . the event. While . he has scores of new Twitter followers and Facebook friend requests, . Farves said he remains without a date for his school's May 10 prom. School officials issued a statement on Central York High's Facebook page, defending the decision to suspend Farves. 'It . is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone - even . Miss America - to a school dance,' the statement said. 'However, it is . our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate . those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure . those rules are followed within our schools.'

'At that point in time, it was 10 minutes before the presentation, and I was pretty much set to do it,' he said. 'I was a little pressured. Everybody expected me to do it. I'm the kind of person who, if someone says I won't do something, I'll prove people wrong. I will.' Nina Davuluri, representing New York, reacts after being crowned Miss America on September 15, 2013 in Atlantic City, New Jersey . The school, facing criticism from some who thought the administration went to far, responded on Friday afternoon. 'It is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone — even Miss America — to a school dance,' the statement from the Central York School District reads in part. 'However, it is our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure those rules are followed within our schools. This practice is not uncommon and happens every day, multiple times a day, in schools, businesses and homes across America.' The school district also took offense to the media's reporting of the incident, saying, 'it's as shame that the media wants to frame this story to sell papers and make headlines using a distortion of what actually occurred.' Many students, however, think the administration overreacted, and took to social media to express their feeling, using the hashtag #freepatty on Twitter. 'True diversity is when you don't punish someone for being a little bit different"" @CYStudentUnion tweeted.","Nina Davuluri was at Central York High School in Pennsylvania as part of a diversity event .

"By . Michael Zennie . The Libyan warlord who allegedly led the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, has been captured by Delta Force commandos. Ahmed Abu Khattala was taken off the streets of Benghazi and whisked away to a 'secure location outside of Libya' for interrogation on Sunday, the Washington Post reports. Fox News reports that he is currently en route to the United States aboard a U.S. Navy ship. Once on American soil, he is expected to face trial on terrorism charges in federal court in Washington, D.C. Scroll down for video... Caught: Delta force commandos nabbed Ahmed Abu Khattala, the 42-year-old suspected ringleader in the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack on Sunday after he taunted American officials for months . Khattala is said to be a 'senior leader' of Ansar al-Sharia - the group that U.S. officials believe was behind . the attack that killed four Americans on September 11, 2012 - including . U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. American officials have stopped short of calling him a 'mastermind.' Nearly two years after the deadly assault, he is the first person held to account by American authorities. Khattala, a 42-year-old hardline Muslim leader, has openly taunted U.S. authorities for years, appearing in public in Benghazi for several interviews with American media, including CNN, in August 2013 - days after the Justice Department levied terrorism charges against him. U.S. commandos and the FBI captured Ahmed Abu Khattala, said to be one of the masterminds behind the 2012 consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya . Burned out: The American consulate in Benghazi was burned out and destroyed by the terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. Khattala is the only person so far arrested for the deadly raid . Khattala has remained free to roam his hometown of Beghanzi, despite being indicted by U.S. authorities.  He said he was never questioned by American officials even though he made no attempt to hide. He told the New York Times that he did not plan or participate in the  assault, though he admitted he was there at the end. Witnesses describe seeing him direct the fighters who stormed the gates of the American compound. The raid Sunday was carried out jointly by Delta Force, the U.S. Army's most elite special operations unit, and the FBI after more than a year of planning, the Daily Beast reports. The commandos even went so far as to build a mock-up of Khattala's compound on their base at Fort Bragg, North Carolina - like the Navy's SEAL Team Six did before the Osama bin Laden raid. However, American officials are billing it as a major achievement for the White House. President Barack Obama trumpeted the victory, saying that Khattala will face 'the full weight of American justice.' 'It's important for us to send a message to the world that when Americans are attacked, no matter how long it takes, we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice,' he said before a speech on manufacturing in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. One source told the Post that Khattala's capture is 'a reminder that when the United States says it’s going to hold someone accountable and he will face justice, this is what we mean.' The White House would not comment on why he was captured now - nearly a year after he was indicted. However, the Daily Beast cites a source who suggests that Obama lacked the legal authority to send troops into Libya unilaterally because Khattala didn't have links to al-Qeada. Only recently have investigators found links between him and the terrorists who attacked the United States in 2001. The time, however, is a victory that comes at a bad time for President Obama foreign policy. The return of prisoner of war Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees and the rise of a violent sectarian uprising in Iraq have had Obama on a back footing. National tragedy: Christopher Stevens, who succumbed to smoke inhalation after the attack, was the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979 . Former U.S. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were working as CIA security contractors when they were killed defending from a second wave of the attack . Sean Smith, an IT specialist for the U.S. Foreign Service, was also killed in the attack . Stevens, the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979, died of smoke inhalation after the terrorist attackers set fire to the U.S. compound. Sean Smith, a 34-year-old computer system manager with the U.S. Foreign Service was also killed. Former U.S. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods, who were working as U.S. security contractors for the Central Intelligence Agency, died in the second wave of the attack as they defended the adjacent CIA building after mounting a rescue mission. White House spokesman Jay Carney would not comment on where Khattla would be held as he awaits trial - whether it would be in a federal facility or the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Officials told the Post that he would likely remain on the U.S. Navy ship to be interrogated by military and intelligence agents. Then a 'clean team' would be brought in to give him his Miranda Rights and question him in a manner that could be used at a federal trial. The 2012 Benghazi attack has been a major political liability for the White House and for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Republicans have launched numerous official investigations and alleged that officials botched security at the consulate and ignored Stevens' request for more guards. They also claim Obama Administration officials tried to over up the real motive for the terrorist attack - claiming at the time that it was a riot over an anti-Islamic video - to improve Obama's reelection chances. The House of Representatives recently established a select committee, nearly two years after the incident, to formally review the handling of the run-up to and aftermath of the assault. President Barack Obama: 'With this operation, the United States has once again demonstrated that we will do whatever it takes to see that justice is done when people harm Americans. We will continue our efforts to bring to justice those who were responsible for the Benghazi attacks.' Secretary of State John Kerry: 'This weekend, that work took a dramatic step forward. Ahmed Abu Khatallah, an alleged key leader of the attacks in Benghazi, is now in U.S. custody. He will face a court of law and be held accountable for his actions. This bold action by the superb United States military is a clear reminder to anyone who dares do us harm that they will not escape with impunity.' Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas: 'Khatallah has been openly defying the United States for more than twenty months. Now that he is in custody, the proper authorities should be given ample time to assess what intelligence he may have about ongoing terrorist operations against Americans. Khatallah is a foreign terrorist, captured by our special forces overseas for his violent attack on a U.S. facility. He belongs in Guantanamo and in the military justice system, not in the U.S. civilian court system with the constitutional protections afforded U.S. citizens.' Congressman Ed Royce, Republican of California and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman: 'This is overdue, considering that this individual has made himself available to multiple media outlets in the 19 months since the deaths of four Americans, including the first U.S. Ambassador killed in an attack since 1979. I hope that this capture brings us closer to justice and accountability.  We should right now be getting from him as much intelligence as possible.' Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman: 'I fully support the administration’s efforts to gather intelligence from Abu Khatallah and prosecute him in federal court. Past cases against terrorists like Abu Khatallah have shown that we can obtain intelligence, convict terrorists and lock them away for a very long time. The U.S. criminal justice system has successfully convicted over 500 terrorists since 9/11, and I have full confidence in the ability of our federal courts.'","Ahmed Abu Khattala, 42, was captured Sunday outside Benghazi, Libya, in a joint raid by Special Operations troops and the FBI .

"By . Michael Zennie . Katherine Martinez, 23, was attacked by a smitten admirer after revealing she was pregnant with her boyfriend's baby . A smitten man who tried unsuccessfully for two years to woo a 23-year-old college student stabbed and strangled her to death when he learned that she was pregnant - and that he wasn't the father. Katherine Martinez repeatedly rebuffed Emilio Calderon's romantic advances - even after he started giving her rides to work and class and offered to buy her a car, her family says. The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that Calderon, 29, admitted to becoming enraged when he visited Martinez Sunday at her apartment in Terrytown, Louisiana. Police say he stabbed her three times and then strangled her to death. Her unborn baby died, as well. Martinez's . family says he should have had no expectation that the baby was his - . she never liked him as anything more than a friend. 'They never had sex. They didn't kiss. They never even held hands,' Osmer Batrez, Martinez's friend, told the newspaper. 'They did not have an intimate relationship.' Despite . Martinez's insistence that she and Calderon remain 'just friends,' he . became more persistent. Eventually, he started showing up at Blue Cliff . College, where she took classes, and the restaurant where she worked as a . waitress. Martinez . started blocking him on her social media accounts. Calderon responded . by creating fake usernames to trick Martinez into 'friending' him so he . could keep tabs on her, her family told the Times-Picayune.

"By . Michael Zennie . LeBron James, the NBA's biggest star, is on the market - and the entire sports world is speculating where he might take his talents next. News has leaked today that James is opting out of the final two years of his $42.7million deal with the Miami Heat and has become a free agent - meaning any team in the league could bid to take him on, multiple news outlets are reporting. Opting out does not mean the 29-year-old James has decided to leave the Heat, the team James has led to four-straight NBA finals and two championships. Pundits say it's entirely possible - even likely - that LeBron is simply giving himself a chance to re-negotiate his contract with Miami. This year's team, widely considered the weakest since he moved to Miami in 2010, was mauled by the San Anontio Spurs in the finals - losing four games to one. Some have suggested LeBron may be positioning himself to take a pay cut so that the Heat can bring in new players while staying within the NBA's salary cap. Scroll down for video . Taking his talents elsewhere? Four years after landing at the Heat, LeBrong James opted out of the final two years of his contract and became a free agent - signaling he could be leaving South Beach . Disappointing: James and the Heat made the NBA finals this season, but were thrashed by the San Antonio Spurs, four games to one . James' wife, Savannah, caused much excitement in Ohio when she posted a picture of the couple's hometown of Akron and the message 'The countdown is real!' However, news that LeBron could be moving has set the NBA aflutter, including with speculation that he could be returning to his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers, the hometown team he spurned on national television when he famously announced that he planned to 'take his talents to South Beach.' His wife, high school sweetheart Savannah, recently announced she was pregnant with the couple's third child, a girl. She set tongues wagging in Ohio two days ago when she posted a photo of the couple's hometown of Akron on Instagram and wrote: 'Home sweet home!! The countdown is real! #330.' Many experts say a move back home to Cleveland is a long shot - the team has languished since he left and was unable to attract the kind of talent who could help James win a championship during the seven seasons he was there. The Cavaliers reached the NBA finals only once while Lebron was there, but lost to the Spurs. When LeBron James left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in 2010, he signed a six-year, $110million contract. Here were the top salaries for the 2013-2014 season: . The announcement Tuesday from James' agent Rich Paul has sent shock waves through the NBA. James' moves could potentially reshape the league and turn any team he's on into a potential championship contender. He has already shown a willingness to take less money than he's worth if it means playing on a winning team. In 2010, he signed a six-year, $110million contract with the Heat. His $19.1million salary last season was far from the highest in the NBA  - despite James being regarded the best player in the league. Last season, Kobe Bryant, the aging Los Angeles Lakers superstar, earned $30.4million. The NBA uses salary cap rules. By taking less money than he was likely worth, the Heat could also afford to pay stars Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade, who helped James reach the NBA finals four times in a row. To be sure, James doesn't go wanting. His status as the biggest star in the NBA - and likely the biggest star in all of American sports, allowed him to rake in $39million in endorsement deals last year from the likes of Nike, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Samsung. Only boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr raked in more cash overall in 2013. Grantland's Zach Lowe writes that James could potentially go to any team he wanted. However, he's likely to pick the option that will allow him to continue winning championships. The most likely option, according to Lowe, is that James will stay in Miami - albeit with an augmented contract and assurances from Heat management that the team is committed to . Other top contenders for James' talents are the Chicago Bulls, the Houston Rockets, the Phoenix Suns and the Atlanta Hawks, Lowe says. Returning home? James has maintained his connection to his hometown of Akron with his charity - even after he left the Cleveland Cavaliers for Miami . James and his wife reportedly enjoy living in Miami - but James proved with 'the Decision' that he's willing to uproot in order to in championships . Selecting the Bulls would be a symbolic move. Chicago has been looking to reclaim its glory days ever since the 1990s, when the team won six out of eight championships with Michael Jordan. James, who has been compared to Michael Jordan his entire career, is highly conscious of both his image and his legacy. A return to Cleveland, though an intriguing storyline for James, could be dicey. Many fans are still bitter about 'the Decision,' a 2010 live ESPN broadcast in which James announced on national television that he was leaving his hometown and 'taking his talents to South Beach.'","The 29-year-old superstar is a free agent about opting out of the final two years of his $110million contract with the Heat .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated Press Reporter . Fit of rage: This is the 41-year-old father who is charged with murder for killing the registered sex offender who molested his daughter . An Alabama father has been charged with murder after he gunned down the man who molested his 7-year-old daughter in 2001. Police say the father gunned down Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, at his parents' home in rural Cullman County, Alabama, Sunday night. It capped off a rampage that also saw him drive across the county on his motorcycle and allegedly open fire on his step-daughter's boyfriend outside a gas station. The intended victim got away by running into the store and hiding, Cullman County Chief Deputy Max Barlett  Bartlett said. MailOnline is not naming the suspect to protect the identity of Brooks' victim. Police say they do not know what prompted the shootings - whether he was motivated by the attack on his young daughter 13 years ago or whether a new issue was to blame. Barlett said the father did make a statement to deputies after he was arrested Sunday night, but Barlett said he could not comment on what the man had said. The father and Brooks 'obviously didn't have a whole lot of good blood between them,' but it was unknown whether the shooting was directly linked to the sex abuse case, Bartlett said. 'It is odd. He apparently had a lot of stressors going on in his life,' Bartlett said. The suspect's father told MailOnline he has no idea why he might have waited 13 years to attack Brooks. He said he hadn't heard his son talk about the attack since the trial in 2001 and 2002. Documents show the suspect was a witness . against Brooks in a sexual abuse case involving his daughter in 2001. Police said the girl was 8 at the time, but court records show she was . 7. Shot dead: Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, who was convicted of molesting a 7-year-old girl in 2002, was gunned down at his parents' home . Brooks pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in 2002 and initially was sentenced to five years in prison but later received probation, records show. He finished paying $2,946 in restitution and costs in 2009. Barlett . said Brooks was shot several times at the home of his parents, where he . had been living, shortly after the shooting at the store. The father . apparently rode his motorcycle straight to the house after the first . shooting, Bartlett said, but the reason was unclear. The suspect used a 9mm pistol that he was legally permitted to carry in both shootings. The man also was charged with attempted murder and shooting into an occupied building, Bartlett said. The suspect had been arrested twice before for domestic violence, though the charges were either dismissed or he was found not guilty. Already, some of the man's family members and community members are posting on comment boards that Brooks 'got what he deserved' for the 2001 molestation. Barlett said Brooks has not violated his probation or his sex offender restrictions since his release from prison. 'As it stands right now, the defendant committed a murder. We look at it no different, no matter the history of the victim. Mr Brooks had previously been sentenced and released for his crime,' he said. 'Regardless of any past or pending crimes that he may have committed, this was murder.'","The father, who is not being identified by MailOnline, also shot at his step-daughter's new boyfriend .

"By . Michael Zennie . An aspiring actor has been arrested after posing as a Twilight star and seducing a 14-year-old girl over Facebook then driving to the girl's home in Iowa to pick her up. Police say David LaVera, 33, of San Diego, California, pretended to be Kiowa Gordon, 24 who played a minor character Embry in three of the Twilight Saga films, as he chatted with the teen from the small town of Baxter, Iowa. He then drove to the girl's house and convinced her to get into his car after posing for pictures with her older sister on Tuesday afternoon. David LaVera, 33, (left) was allegedly posing as hunky actor Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played a small role in three of the Twilight Saga films (right) KCCI-TV reports that he had posed as the hunky actor in nearby Newton, Iowa, the night before and was seen bar hopping, signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans.' The victim's sister called their mother to tell them the teen had left with LaVera. The mother, April Roush, called police. LaVera and the teen were spotted on the outskirts of town by one of Ms Roush's friends, who stood in front of his car and demanded the girl come with her. After she was safely out of LaVera's vehicle, he sped away. Sheriff's deputies caught up with him a short time later. The girl's mother, April Roush, said she fears she never would have seen her daughter alive if LaVera hadn't been stopped before he left town with her . In his car, they found two swords and four daggers. Baxter Police Chief Steve Wright told WHO-TV that he fears to think what LaVera's intentions were for the girl. 'This isn’t somebody that just wants to be friends. And typically this is the kind of person that meets a profile of somebody that can be a predator and can be dangerous,' he said. Ms Roush credited her friend who rescued her daughter with saving the girl's life. 'I don't think I would have ever seen my daughter again. And if so, it would have been to bury her,' she told WHO. Ms Roush says she her daughter was so convinced that LaVera was the Twilight star that she still believes Kiowa Gordon was the one who came to pick her up. According to the Internet Movie Database, LaVera has appeared in 13 movies, including  Die Fighting, Fortune 500 Man and a non-speaking role in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.","David LaVera, an aspiring actor from California, allegedly picked the teen girl up from her home in Baxter, Iowa .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . As the former Foreign Secretary he was used to meeting and negotiating with political leaders from around the world. But William Hague found himself with an even trickier engagement when he bumped into a hen party at a sausage and beer festival. Thankfully, as this picture shows, Mr Hague emerged smiling - despite showing some confusion about the L-plate symbols worn by the hens. Former Foreign Secretary found himself with a tricky engagement when he bumped into a hen party at a sausage and beer festival in Bedale, Yorkshire - but appeared to fit in well . Mr Hague, who in recent months has been seen campaigning with the movie star Angelina Jolie, was presenting awards at the Camp Hill Sausage & Beer Festival in Bedale, Yorkshire, on Saturday when the unusual meeting took place. The hen party, who were celebrating with bride-to-be Rhiannan Adamson, were glamping in the area when they approached the unsuspecting Tory politician for a photograph. Afterwards some of her Facebook friends joked about him being mistaken him for a stripper. Victoria Whiteley, a member of the hen party, said: 'We were just sat on the grass at the place we were staying and we heard that there was this sausage and beer festival and then the next thing, William Hague is there presenting awards. 'He was very nice. He was asking questions about the wedding and things and complimented us on the flowers in our hair.' Ms Whiteley revealed that Mr Hague was not aware of the reasons for the L-plates sported by the hen party and needed an explanation. In a more comfortable setting: Mr Hague at The Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane, London, with Lord Parkinson (left) and Lord Ashcroft . William Hague (right) and U.S. actress Angelina Jolie (left) at the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict in London in June . 'It was funny because we had to explain why we had the L-plates on. He didn't understand it,' she added. It's been suggested that the tradition for L-plates arose because soon-to-be-hitched virgin brides would have to learn their way around the bedroom pretty quickly if they planned to keep their new husband. But a more popular line of reasoning is that a bride-to-be is, by definition, not married yet, making her a bit of a 'learner' as far as marriage is concerned - just like a inexperienced driver who's yet to pass their driving test. Mr Hague quit as Foreign Secretary and became Leader of the Commons in a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month. He will leave Parliament at the 2015 general election after 26 years as MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire. After the announcement, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'William Hague has been one of the leading lights of the Conservative Party for a generation, leading the party and serving in two cabinets. 'Not only has he been a first-class foreign secretary - he has also been a close confidant, a wise counsellor and a great friend. 'He will remain as first secretary of state and my de facto political deputy in the run up to the election - and it is great to know that he will be a core part of the team working to ensure an outright Conservative victory.'","Former Foreign Secretary bumped into a hen party in Bedale, Yorkshire .

"By . Peter Rugg . A horrified woman only discovered a man who raped her two decades ago had been released when he was arrested for another rape. A woman who was only 13 years old when she was raped by Essie Billingslea said she was unaware he'd been released . The woman, whose name has not been released to media as she is a victim of sexual assault, was raped by Essie L. Billingslea and two other men at her home in Arlington, Massachusetts, in 1988 when she was only 13 years old. 'Nobody told me anything,' she told the Boston Globe. The Boston Globe reports Bililngslea has been convicted of two other rapes and was being held at a Massachusetts Treatment Center until a Suffolk jury voted 12 to 2 to release him in March 2013. Jurors decided Billingslea was no longer 'sexually dangerous.' The woman only learned days ago that Billingslea has been accused of beating and raping an Arlington woman at knifepoint on Sunday. He has entered not guilty plea on charges of aggravated rape, kidnapping, home invasion, and assault and battery. 'I thought it was horrible,' said the woman, now in her late 30s. 'But I wasn't surprised.' She added that she was not aware of the release of the other two men who assaulted her alongside Billingslea. 'I didn’t know they got out until I saw them walking on the street,' she said. He served nearly two decades for three rapes before being released. Along with the 1988 assault, his convictions include raping an 11-year-old girl in 1986 and attacking another 11-year-old in 1993, who was a friend of his then-girlfriend's daughter. He was sentenced to five years in prison over the 1988 assault and raped the third victim only 18 months after being released. Victims must tell prosecutors at the time of conviction if they wish to be notified of the offender's release. They must also provide changes of address. Judge Roanne Sragow speaks during proceedings for Essie L. Billingslea dangerousness hearing . None of Billingslea's victims asked to be notified of his release, according to the Correction Department. When he was originally convicted in 1989, there was little staff in a still-developing state's victim witness advocacy program and prosecutors were often charged with tracking both witnesses and victims. When Billingslea was near release in 2013, the state argued he continued to meet the criteria for a sexually dangerous person and should remain committed. State law defines a sexually dangerous person as anyone convicted of a sex offense also suffering a mental abnormality or personality disorder which would lead them to commit a sex crime. It could also be someone who shows an inability to control sexual impulses after a conviction. A jury decided Billingslea was not dangerous under state criteria after hearing testimony from two forensic doctors . One forensic psychologist who testified in Billingslea's case said he should remain in treatment but the other said he no longer met the state's criteria. None of his victims testified in his most recent trial. Jurors are asked not to determine guilt or innocence but how likely is the risk of a new assault.","Essie L.

'I really enjoy solving the problems at the Olympiad. I think they're quite interesting.' The year 11 student at Glen Waverley Secondary College, south-east of Melbourne, was among 500 contestants from 103 countries who sat two exams, each consisting of three problems. They were given four and a half hours to solve each paper. Alex, who put in hundreds of hours of practice in the lead up to the competition, says he came out of the exams feeling confident. 'It's hard to be sure about your performance after an exam but I remember feeling quite happy with myself,' he said. The Australian team show off their medals. They are pictured with their tour guide (middle) Alex (right) with Australian media personality Adam Spencer (left) during the Olympiad team's announcement at Parliament House on June 16 .

'He's so intelligent but he doesn't see himself any different from other students,' Ms Erickson said. Ann Ronning, manager of the Australia Mathematics Trust, says  Alex is the 'rock star of mathematics'. 'Australia has been competing in the Olympiad since 1981 but Alex is quite a wonder and we're so thrilled with his results,' Ms Ronning said. 'He went into the competition with the ambition of achieving a perfect score and we thought if anybody can do it, it's Alex.' Ms Ronning says if Alex wins gold next year, he will be placed 11th of the IMO Hall of Fame.

'Phoenix is a bird that is burnt to ashes and rises again and that's obviously symbolic to Turia's story,' he said. 'I've always wanted to create a film that would make a difference in people's lives and Phoenix the documentary is that opportunity. 'While I want to capture Turia's return to surfing, which has been a big part of her upbringing, through this film we also want to give people who've suffered tragedy hope and show them there is light at the end of the tunnel.' Among Turia's many talents she is a mining engineer, the author of 'Everything to live for' and a  motivational speaker.

"By . Mail Online Reporter . A baby girl has been saved from a deadly brain tumor after an insurer which refused to fund surgery at a specialist hospital had a change of heart. Little Savannah Snodgrass's tumor was removed during a six-hour surgery at the renowned Texas Children's Hospital in Houston about two weeks ago. Pediatricians told the eight-month-old's family yesterday that the growth was non-cancerous and she was on the mend. 'We have tears of joy. We are so thrilled,' Savannah's mother, Tessa Snodgrass, told FoxNews.com. 'There is some risk for re-growth and continued epilepsy, but this is the best news we could hear.' Scroll down for video . On the mend: Savannah Snodgrass's brain tumor was removed during a six-hour surgery at the renowned Texas Children's Hospital in Houston about two weeks ago . Elated: Tessa Snodgrass, pictured with her daughter Savannah, said she was relieved to hear her baby's surgery was a success . Snodgrass, a retired Army major, added her daughter will likely need regular MRI tests until she is 20-years-old. Savannah's brain tumor was detected in March when she was three-months-old. She suffered major seizures, at one point being hit by 15 in the space of a single day. The Snodgrass's insurer, Superior HealthPlan, referred Savannah to Texas Children's Hospital for the last four months for her treatment. Specialists . at the hospital then produced a plan for beating the tumor, scheduling several procedures for which, Tessa Snodgrass claims, . her insurers happily paid. However, at the last minute, the insurer refused to cover the final surgery, saying the hospital was outside its 'network'. They instead referred her to another facility in Austin, Texas. The family fought the decision, creating a petition on Change.com that's been signed by more than 1,600 people. Suffering: Little Savannah Snodgrass was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was just three-months-old . The family claimed that Texas Children's hospital had a 90 per cent survival rate for the . operation Savannah was booked for, compared with just 47 per cent for the other facility. 'I was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to Texas Children's all this time,' 38-year-old Tessa Snodgrass told FoxNews.com. 'It's . rare for a tumor to be found in a child this young, it so clearly . called for a neurosurgeon specialized in operating on babies - not just . any surgeon. Would you accept less than a 50-50 survival rate when you can have almost 100 per cent?' Superior HealthPlan insisted that the new provider would be just as good. However earlier this month they reversed their decision, allowing Savannah to undergo surgery at Texas Children's Hospital on July 11. 'Our No. 1 priority has been to deliver the best health outcome for this child, as it is for all of our members,' the company said in a July 11 statement. 'Superior is happy to have identified a solution that ensures that this child receives continued care from the provider established prior to their enrollment with Superior.

"By . Sally Lee . Madison Stewart rarely goes by her real name. She's rather used to being called the 'shark girl'. As her alias suggests, the 20-year-old's lifestyle is anything but ordinary having swum with sharks since the age of seven. Her love for the deep blue sea and the widely feared predators down under has seen her sacrifice her family, friends and school in order to dedicate her life to fight for the deadly creatures. Scroll down for video . Madison Stewart rarely goes by her real name as she's rather used to being called the 'shark girl' Australia's Madison Stewart (pictured) has been swimming with the widely-feature predators since the age of seven . The 20-year-old is an independent film-maker who advocates against the culling of sharks . Madison, who grew up in Byron Bay in northeastern NSW, left school at the age of 14 to dedicate her life to fight for sharks . The shark girl, who grew up in Byron Bay in northeastern NSW, made the life changing decision when she picked up her first underwater camera at the age of 14. 'I began noticing a significant decline in sharks,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Now I'm at a stage of my life where I don't even know if they'll be around when I'm older. 'That's why I left school, left my family, left my friends to be in the water. 'All I had was the ocean in my life.' And while she's evolved into an independent film-maker, hoping to chance attitudes towards sharks in Australia, she's determined set the record straight – she's no activist nor conservationist. 'I'm just an average person doing what they believe in,' Madison said. 'This is not my occupation and you cannot make money doing what I do. 'I do it because I love sharks and if I could quit tomorrow I would but not while bad things are going undocumented in our oceans.' Madison features in a documentary - titled Shark Girl - which was released in June . The shark girl believes there's an increasing gap between fear and understanding of sharks . Madison says education is a way to help prevent a dangerous situation, not killing them . Madison's deep connection with the underwater world is one that she feels with no other being or element in the world. 'I feel totally calm and at home. I'm at peace,' she said. 'Sharks are so very different to other causes in the sense I am not just trying to raise awareness but I am also facing the task of sparking respect and love for a creature demonised since it was first depicted in the media. 'I need people to feel the same way about sharks that I do so they can feel the same pain I do in the face of their destruction.' Now she's quite blasé when it comes to swimming with sharks. 'It's not an adrenalin rush for me because it’s just normal,' Madison said. So far, she's fearlessly swum alongside great whites, hammer heads and tiger sharks. 'They're not harmful animals,' she said. Madison considers the deadly sea predators as her family . Madison says she feels at home and at peace when she's under water . Madison continues her fight against the unethical use of shark products and harvesting of sharks . 'Everyone hates sharks, everyone wants them dead. But they are my family and no one is sticking up for them.' Madison believes this is the underlying issue that needs to be addressed by the Australian government s there's an 'increasing gap between fear and understanding'. 'Things that are legal in our oceans are so unjust,' she said, referring the legal fisheries and culling in Australia. 'Education is a way to help prevent dangerous situation with sharks, not killing them.' At the age of 19, she featured in a film - aptly entitled 'Shark Girl' - which shed light on Australia's shark-meat trade.

"By . Sally Lee . Long Ven, the director of the Underprivileged Children School in Siem Reap, has been charged with arranging for foreign volunteers to sexually abuse teenage students . The legitimacy of orphanages and children's charities in developing countries are in question after an unregistered English language school in Cambodia linked to sexual abuse claims has been deceiving donors in order to raise funds. Long Ven, the director of the Underprivileged Children School in Siem Reap, has been charged with arranging for foreign volunteers to sexually abuse teenage students. The 33-year-old has been receiving donations from those including Australians. He has been charged with procuring children for the purpose of prostitution and could face up to 10 years' behind bars. The nationality of the volunteers, who allegedly abused the students, are unknown. Former Victorian policeman James McCabe, 45, is the Cambodian Children Unit's operations manager helped investigate the case which led to the ultimate arrest of Ven this week. McCabe, who also works for the Cambodian Children's Fund, expects more charges will be laid on Ven. 'This gives us time to go forensically through the roughly 6500 messages on Facebook and the laptop computers and cameras,' he told The Phnom Penh Post. It is believed the alleged victims are two 17-year-old boys who were among nine students found at a raid at Ven's apartment, police said. The 33-year-old director has been receiving donations from those including Australians. He has been charged with procuring children for the purpose of prostitution and could face up to 10 years' behind bars .

The school website lists one of its main goals as ensuring 'that most underprivileged Cambodia children are not denied an opportunity acquiring knowledge'. Ven, also known asn 'Waha', appeals to donors in his first blog post in 2009 by writing: . 'We are making every effort to impart educational knowledge to Cambodian kids in particular and Cambodians in general. So that they will have hope in the future. In order to meet the world's challenges and to be good leaders of tomorrow. And we encourage more volunteers to join us.' He continues to write that the school has dormitories for students living far from home but they face enormous financial challenges and shortages for basic needs such as stationery, clothes and food. 'We request you, to kindly donate generously for this noble cause for the better tomorrow for the kids. So that we may be able to give the hopeless underprivileged children a hopeful and better future in life. Please donate no matter how small it may be.' The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the school includes boarding facilities for foreign volunteers, many of which are donors and gap-year students from Australia. There has been increasing criticism surrounding Cambodia and other developing countries running so-called 'orphan tourism' and 'volunteer tourism'. While most of Cambodia's 600 orphanages are seen to be well-established, it has been reported by welfare groups that in some cases children are kept to look poor in front of tourists. The school has since been closed.","The director of a charity school in Cambodia has been charged with procuring children for the purpose of prostitution .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sally Lee . The evening of 11-year-old Luke Batty's murder remains very clear in the memory of mother Rosie Batty. She recalled the moment her ex-partner Greg Anderson turned up with a 'big smile' at his son's cricket practice in Tyabb, south of Melbourne, on February 12 but soon after she heard a 'very disturbing sound'. 'I ran towards the sound because I didn't understand what it was and I could see Greg kneeling beside Luke and I thought, oh my God, he's done a fast bowl to his head and he's knocked him out and he's really hurt him,' she told the ABC program Four Corners. Scroll down for video . Rosie Batty with her son Luke, who was murdered by his father Greg Anderson on February 12 . Luke was at a cricket pitch in Tyabb, south of Melbourne when he was killed. His father, Anderson, was shot by police at the scene and later died . But it was just before Anderson resisted arrest by police that cricket coach Cameron Colvin, who initially thought the horrific attack was an accident, spoke with Luke's father. 'I asked Greg, how's he doing? And that's when he said, ""yeah, he's okay, he's fine, he's in heaven now"".' That night Anderson murdered his 11-year-old son at a cricket pitch. Anderson was shot by police at the scene and later died. Ms Batty said she found it 'gravely concerning' that police didn't tell her about frightening death threats made by his Luke's father just weeks before he killed their son. Anderson had threatened to kill one of his housemates - asking him if he wanted to die, before suggesting he would cut his head off. The house mate was granted an intervention order and police arrested Anderson. While police contacted Luke's mother about a week before Luke was murdered and asked her if she knew where Anderson was living, she says they failed to tell her about the death threat or a separate intervention order against him.

'You can't help but think that some intervention may have just been enough for him to rethink or maybe enough of a red flag for me to understand what acute danger Luke and I were in,' she said. At this stage, Anderson was only allowed to see Luke in public when he was playing sport after Ms Batty was informed he had been caught viewing child pornography images. 'For some reasons I thought he was safer in an open space with people around,' Ms Batty said. Victoria Police Commissioner Ken Lay said stringent privacy laws limited the amount of information available to potential victims. 'From a victim's perspective, I suspect you'd be very angry if you weren't privy to that sort of information,' he said. However, he said the pending coroner's inquest into Luke's death limited what he could say about his feelings on the issue. 'I hope to be in a position, once the coroner comes back, to be making some public comments about these issues which might better reflect my views on things.'

"By . Helen Nicholson . With its vast indoor platforms, raised glass-panelled walkways and giant, futuristic pillars it is a far cry from the scene that greets India's rail passengers on their current daily commute. The striking image is an artist’s impression of plans by a global engineering and design consultancy to transform New Delhi railway station into an ‘urban icon for a modern, vibrant city’. Arup has been appointed to redevelop the 86 hectares that the station covers and make the site fit for 21st century travel. 'Urban icon': The computer-generated plans for the new station include vast indoor platforms, raised glass-panelled walkways and futuristic, sweeping white pillars . Outdated: The new design is a far cry from the current New Delhi railway station where passengers have to wait outdoors on crowded platforms . The proposed station - which is covered by a white ceiling and dotted with trees - will feature 18 platforms and handle in excess of 500,000 rail passengers per day. The company hopes to completely transform the current overcrowded site, which travellers on TripAdvisor complain is ‘chaotic’, ‘dirty’ and ‘dangerous’. Just last week, the Indian Government announced controversial plans to hike rail fares and freight rates to pay for much-needed investment in the country's loss-making rail network. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told people who were protesting against the fare rises: 'India must decide whether it wants a world-class railway or a ramshackled one.' Arup’s designs were revealed today as part of the consultancy’s Future Of Rail 2050 report in which it outlines its predictions on how technology will change the way we travel in 35 years’ time. The company said it wanted to ‘challenge people’s thinking’ and ‘focus on the forces shaping the future of rail’, including rising passenger numbers and the effects of climate change. Overcrowded and in need of reform: Passengers have described New Delhi station as 'chaotic', 'dirty' and 'dangerous' A ticketless future: Gate-lines in the futuristic stations will be removed and payment processed automatically when the journey is taken . The report includes research into driverless trains and intelligent robots, which would help to build rail infrastructure, along with drones, which would carry out maintenance on rail lines. Swarm robotics - a theory based on behaviour among ant and bee colonies - could see small robots working collaboratively on major railway repair and structural testing. Monitoring drones would enable rail operators to perform advanced maintenance and carry out safe inspection of bridges, tunnels and tracks. Arup claims that the new technology could even eradicate journey delays and track closures. Human staff could also be a thing of the . past with the introduction of automated systems, driverless trains and . ticketless travel. Crumbling infrastructure: The Indian government is set to raise train fares in order to fund much-needed investment in the country's rail network . Stretched to the limit: New Delhi station is one of the busiest in India and many of its trains are overcrowded . Sleek design: The Mercury's extended nose section is described as 'one of the most extreme in the world' and will help the train reach a speed of 360kph . The company - which has also worked on high-speed rail projects in Beijing, Portugal and Brazil – claims driverless trains speed up rail travel because they increase the average train speed. It reported that trains can operate closer together, reducing the time it takes a train to slow down at stations, and increasing reliability. Copenhagen, Paris, Singapore, Dubai and São Paulo all currently operate driverless passenger trains on selected lines, along with London’s Docklands Light Railway (DLR). In addition, tickets could become a thing of the past as Arup predicts travel that is entirely electronic and tracked by wearable devices. Gate-lines in stations will be removed and payment processed automatically when the journey is taken. Rail stations will also be powered by new forms of energy. Electricity will be generated from passengers’ footsteps, which will then provide power to the station, while trains will rely on alternative forms of fuel including liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen and even algae. By 2050 it is thought that hydrogen, or hydrail, could be a primary means of powering trains. Changing how we travel: Arup's designs were revealed as part of the consultancy's Future Of Rail 2050 report . Ambitious: Elon Musk's Hyperloop would see people transported between cities inside aluminium pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,300km per hour . The report imagines a future where train passengers can contact friends, family and colleagues via ""HoloCalls"" - holographic image displays - and train windows will adjust automatically to prevent external glare. Virtual shopping walls – which are already in operation in South Korea and China - will be located in railway stations and even carriages, enabling passengers to purchase products from the wall displays via their mobile devices. The company also revealed how high-speed trains could look in the future, using an artist’s impression of the Mercury train designed by transport consultancy Priestmangoode. The double-decker train features an extended nose section, which the consultancy describes as ‘one of the most extreme in the world’ and will help the train reach a speed of 360kph. New forms of transport could also emerge, including ambitious concepts such as Elon Musk’s Hyperloop. Musk’s design would see people transported between cities inside aluminium pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,300km per hour. Stockng up on the go: Passengers will be able to buy groceries from virtual shopping walls located in railway stations . Arup's global rail leader Colin Stewart said: ‘The global urban population is growing rapidly and, by 2050, around 75 per cent of the world's population will live in cities. ‘This places huge pressure on transport infrastructure and resources, but also creates a significant opportunity for rail, which relies on passenger density to function most effectively. The challenge will lie in juggling the responsibility of providing reliable travel for millions while simultaneously tailoring each journey for the individual. 'However, by rapidly developing technology and taking bold steps to overcome capacity and cost challenges through maximising efficiencies , the rail renaissance can deliver a future where rail is the backbone of our travel system, linking major urban hubs and feeding into multi-modal transport networks for the benefit of the passenger.’ Virtual world: The shopping walls are already in operation in South Korea and China where passengers can buy products from wall displays via mobile devices . Mick Cash, the acting general secretary of transport union the RMT, said: ‘This report and its proposals are just dangerous nonsense straight out of some barmy work of science fiction. ‘The notion of an entirely de-staffed railway with track workers replaced by drones could only have been cooked up by someone miles out of touch with reality.’ He continued: ‘The RMT is discussing our continued fight against axing guards and gate-line staff at our conference in Bristol this week. ‘Any train company thinking of looking at the proposals in today’s report should be warned that they will face stiff industrial and political resistance from the RMT.’","The futuristic design was revealed today as part of Arup's Future Of Rail 2050 report .

The rising cost of living means that retirees looking for a new life abroad could be in for a nasty shock, with the dream of becoming an expat branded 'a luxury' by one specialist company. European destinations are more expensive than ever before and some expat hotspots, such as Canada and New Zealand, are even pricier than living in the UK. New life: The dream of moving abroad to retire is now 'a luxury' according to expat experts . According to the annual Overseas Living Price Index, Britain is still a more expensive place to live than the most popular European retirement hotspots. 1.   Spain - 65.82.   Italy - 77.33.   USA - 77.94.   Turkey - 78.65.   Portugal - 80.86.   France - 89.57.   Cyprus - 95.78.   UK - 1009.   New Zealand - 113.610. Canada - 126.2 . But countries like France and Cyprus are only marginally cheaper and Canada and New Zealand are significantly more expensive. If the UK equals 100 on the index, then Spain is the cheapest destination for expats with a value of 65.8. The cost of living jumps to 77.3 on the scale for the second 'cheapest' country Italy, with the US and Turkey not far behind. Canada is the most expensive at 126.2 on the scale, compared to the UK at 100. There are an estimated 4.7 million UK citizens currently living abroad, with 173,000 in France, 411,000 in Spain and 675,000 in Canada. The price index looks at the costs of basics in each country, such as fuel, utility bills, supermarket shopping, public transport and eating out. For instance Turkey has particularly low prices for everyday groceries like milk and bread and cheap public transport. On the rise: Utilities in France can be higher than in the UK according to experts The Overseas Guides Company . But France charges the most for electricity and gas which, overall, means it is only slightly cheaper to live their than in Britain, said the guide. Portugal has the cheapest beer and is good value when eating out, along with Italy but Italy has high petrol prices. Canada and America charge the most for alcohol, even more than in Britain, but petrol is cheaper.However . public transport costs are high in Canada and New Zealand along with . grocery shopping, while many utility bills are cheaper. Richard Way, editor of Overseas Guides Company - which specialises in buying homes abroad - warned: 'Headlines about the benefits of emigrating to escape the UK's poor economy and job market could be misleading for the average Briton, especially those who fail to do proper research into their preferred destination and costs before leaving. 'A . combination of a weak pound and high cost of living mean that these . days emigrating to some countries can be more of a luxury than an option . for the average British person.' Living . abroad has previously been seen as a cheaper option for many wanting to . sell up and retire, and TV shows like A Place in the Sun have . highlighted popular areas. Home from home: The Foreign Office has also launched a campaign, warning people to investigate the costs of moving abroad . The new information comes just months after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) started a campaign to warn Britons about the hidden financial issues expats can experience abroad. Launching the campaign, FCO Minister . Mark Simmonds explained: 'The appeal of warmer climates and experiencing . different countries and cultures is strong for many British citizens. We want to pave the way for our expatriates to have the best experience . possible when they move abroad. 'Our . consular staff across the world have dealt with a high number of . British expats requiring assistance for financial issues – whether as a . result of a house purchase gone wrong, having inadequate funds to pay . for medical bills or experiencing some other misfortune that has . resulted in financial hardship.' Fresh produce: Countries such as France and Spain are still cheaper for groceries, but other costs can mount up . The FCO staff confirmed it has had to help British expatriates with issues including property disputes, bankruptcy caused by changes in personal circumstances, pension complications and unexpected health issues. A recent FCO report also suggests that high hospitalisation and death rates occur in areas where large numbers of elderly British nationals reside, notably in Europe and South East Asia.","Living abroad 'no longer an option for average Briton' say experts .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Aap . Backpackers who were living in shipping containers and caravans on the industrial complex in Alexandria that was destroyed by fire this morning were paying as little as $80-a-week for their accommodation. One of the 18 tourists who had been staying in the accommodation told The Daily Telegraph that he had been living there for four months and that 15 people shared one toilet. Eigi Tamada, from Japan said the people sleeping in the shipping containers were 'very scared' when the fire broke out. 'Suddenly there was a big bang, then there was smoke, we ran out,' he told The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . The fire broke out at a bus parking facility at about 1.40am on Wednesday and was fast-moving and intense . Firefighters were shocked to find people living in the industrial complex, it is believed they were illegally living in shipping containers . A woman who operated a catering business from the site in Alexandria told the Sydney Morning Herald that her landlord, Masaaki Imaeda, had started renting out an old bus with no wheels and two caravans to foreign nationals two months ago to 'make a quick buck'. She set Imaeda had set up washing machines and other appliances around the complex and put a portaloo in a car wash area. 'It's obscene, now I've lost my business because of his greed. That's it, I'm done,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald. About 70 firefighters were called to the blaze in Alexandria, Sydney, which broke out around 1.40am on Wednesday. The fire started in a building near the squatters' camp but investigators don't think the group, aged in their late teens and early 20s, had anything to do with it starting. Crews were stunned to find 18 people, thought to be from Japan and South Korea, squatting in the containers at the site on Burrows Road. Firefighters thought they had been called to a run-of-the-mill industrial fire but it quickly became a rescue operation when people began running out from the back of the bus parking businesss. The squatters were living in shocking conditions on mattresses in a shipping container, an old mini-bus and a caravan. NSW Fire & Rescue Commissioner Greg Mullins said four people had to be rescued as they were too frightened to move. 'There were 20-metre flames,' he told reporters on Wednesday. 'Had the firefighters not realised they were there, they well could have lost their lives.' 'I'm outraged that there would be something like this in the heart of Sydney,' he said. 'It looks like someone has been taking advantage of these people, maybe they were squatters we don't know yet.' The tourists have since been taken to alternative accommodation, a hotel in the CBD. The owner of the property, who claimed to live on site, spent the morning exploring the smouldering damage alongside detectives. It's understood he knew the backpackers were lodging in his building, as he confirmed the headcount of people for the firefighters. He refused to answer any questions from media about the unusual living arrangements as he got into a car with detectives on Wednesday morning. The fire was brought under control by firefighters in a few hours, the reason for the blaze is not yet known . Four people were rescued and 14 evacuated by firefighters from the fire, which firefighters described as a 'severe threat to life' A man who kept his bus parked on the property said he had no idea backpackers were living on site.'It's a bit of a shock,' said the man, who called himself Sam. Inspector Ron James said the fire was extremely intense and fast-moving and posed a serious risk to life. 'The fire was that intense that the firies had to put their bodies between the fire and the people they were rescuing to get them out,' Insp James said. 'It was very intense. It was that intense vehicles were melting on the other side of the car park.' The blaze started at a neighbouring bus depot and quickly spread next door to a NSW Public Works building. It took about two hours for crews to get the fire under control. No one was injured and firefighters spent the morning putting out spot fires hours. It's not yet known what caused the fire. The Department of Immigration is currently investigating whether the people who were living at the depot have valid visas to be in the country. The City of Sydney is investigating reports of the property being used illegally for accommodation. 'This land on Burrows Road is zoned as a business park. Use for residential purposes or for short term accommodation is illegal,' a City of Sydney spokeswoman told MailOnline. 'The City has received no previous reports or complaints of this kind about the premises. We investigate all reports of unauthorised use of premises for accommodation to prevent dangerous events like this from occurring.' One of the buildings the fire spread to was the 'Stoneyard', a New South Wales Public Works site used for conducting stonemasonry related to the restoration of heritage stone buildings. The damage to the building is currently being investigated. Police from Redfern Local Area Command also attended the blaze and will talk to witnesses about the incident. At this stage are not treating the fire as suspicious. Fire crews are seen mopping up after a fire ripped through a bus and caravan storage depot in an industrial area at Alexandria . Firefighters said the blaze was so intense that it melted cars on the other side of the car park . Police remained on the scene throughout the morning putting out spot fires and monitoring the situation .","Fire broke out in Alexandria at 1.40am in an industrial complex .

"By . Alex Greig . A wild police chase in Washington ended bizarrely when a man crashed a stolen RV into several cars and a home then got out of the vehicle and stripped to his underwear before running into a home and donning female clothing. Snohomish County deputies say 33-year-old James M Johns was spotted driving a motor home that had been reported stolen early Tuesday morning at a Walmart in South Everett. Everett police, Washington State Patrol troopers and Snohomish deputies were all involved in an hour-long chase after repeated attempts to pull Johns over failed. Suspect: James Johns, 33, was arrested after leading police on a wild chase and crashing into cars and homes . Wild chase: The RV was reported stolen Tuesday morning and spotted that afternoon, when a chase involving up to 20 police vehicles ensued . Damage: This car was mangled after Johns hit it with the SUV, setting off a chain reaction of crashes . The . out-of-control driver reportedly swerved into the path of an oncoming . police car, narrowly missing it, and almost hit a jogger and three girls . with a horse. Johns . eventually drove the vehicle to Granite Falls, where it slammed into a . car, which in turn launched another car into the front of Gary Poplin's . home. 'I'm just glad it hit the telephone pole first otherwise I wouldn't have a bedroom,' Poplin told Kiro TV. The . RV didn't stop there. It hit another car and broke through Poplin's . fence before taking out the corner of Juliane Rowell's home and smashing . three more cars. Lucky escape: The driver of one of the vehicles Johns hit was taken to hospital with injuries but police say no one was seriously hurt . Damage: The fence of this home was mowed down by Johns in the RV, and the home was also damaged . Rowell says she was upstairs when the incident happened. 'Then my son started yelling, ""Mom, Mom, you can't believe this:  someone ran into our house!""' she told Kiro TV. After the RV finally came to a stop, witnesses say Johns jumped out and began running, shedding clothing as he went. He ran into a home in his underwear, encountered a group of people inside and demanded they give him clothing to disguise himself from the police. They refused and ran outside before calling the police. Out of control: Johns reportedly hit a car which ran into a telephone pole before hitting Gary Poplin's home . Neighborhood in shock: All in all, five cars and two houses were damaged in Johns's rampage . Deputies were not far away and arrived just moments later. 'He had about 15 or 20 cop cars chasing him,' a witness told KOMO. Deputies removed Johns from the house, reports Kiro TV, where he had managed to don a pair of women's jeans and a women's T-shirt. 'He started putting on girl clothes,' one witness told KOMO. 'And then the cops came and grabbed him and brought him out and he was still wearing the girl clothes.' One motorist was injured in the series of crashes and was taken to hospital. Johns was arrested at the scene.","James Johns, 33, has been arrested in Snohomish County, Washington, after leading police on a wild police chase .

"By . Alex Greig . These are the 'too-short' shorts that caused administrators at a Montreal high school to kick student Lindsey Stocker off campus. Stocker donned the jean shorts To Beaconsfield high school on the first hot day of the season, and was temporarily suspended when she refused to change. The grade 11 girl is seen wearing the controversial shorts for the first time, in pictures published by the Montreal Gazette. 'Too short': These are the denim shorts that got Montreal teen Lindsey Stocker suspended from school . Stocker unwittingly started a revolution by refusing to change out of a pair of shorts, when she was told they were not appropriate for school on May 21. She refused, and instead printed a poster that she plastered over the school, questioning why girls' bodies were the focus of the rules instead of boys' behavior. During . third period on that day, two vice principals entered her classroom and . told everyone to stand up so their outfits could be inspected. 'And . when they came to me after about two rows of looking they stopped and . told me my shorts were too short and I had to change,' Stocker told the National Post. Get shorty: Lindsey Stocker says she was humiliated in front of her class for wearing a pair of shorts on a hot day . 'They continued to tell me would be suspended if I didn't start following the rules. When I told them I didn't understand why I had to change they told me that it doesn't matter - I don't have to understand the rules, I just have to comply by them.' Stocker felt singled out and humiliated in front of her class, but what concerned her more was a set of rules that focused on girls' bodies rather than boys' behavior. So instead of complying with the rules, she went and printed up about 20 posters and stuck them up all over the school. The posters read, 'Don't humiliate her because she's wearing shorts. It's hot outside. Instead of shaming girls for their bodies, teach boys that girls are not sexual objects.' Statement: Although Stocker's poster only remained up for about 10 minutes before teachers took it down, it had the desired effect . Support: Stocker has had strong support on social media and other girls at her high school are wearing shorts to school in solidarity . The posters were taken down by teachers after about 10 minutes, but they live on in social media. Stocker also has won the support and admiration of other girls at school. 'Most people are agreeing with her, women shouldn’t have to cover themselves up completely because we shouldn’t be viewed as sexual objects,' student Sierra Drolet told CJAD News. Lauren Paquay, 15, showed up wearing shorts in support of Stocker. She said the dress code verification - making girls stand up with their arms by their sides to ensure their outfits are fingertip length - is 'humiliating.' School rules: The school district spokesperson says there are dress rules for both girls and boys . 'People are being judged for the way they dress, they have to change because boys look at them. The boys should be the ones who have to learn to treat women better and look at them in a different light,' she told CBC. The chairperson of the Lester B Pearson School Board told CJAD News that Stocker has been suspended for not following the rules. 'The rules are there to help the children learn and prepare them for their future work places, high school is a job for them, they are there to learn to function in society, so it’s important that the rules be followed,' Susanne Stein Day says. 'Girls and boys have rules on dress codes; it is not a girl, boy thing, that’s not the point.' Stocker disagrees. 'I was in violation for showing my legs,' she says. 'And that, point blank, is a problem for me.'","Lindsey Stocker, a grade 11 student at a Montreal high school, was singled out for wearing shorts on May 21 .

"By . Alex Greig . and Associated Press . Authorities say a Cincinnati man died after jumping 30 feet into an old rock quarry at a private park in central Indiana on Thursday. State conservation officers said divers found 30-year-old Ryan Hester’s body in the lake at White Rock Park near St. Paul. Witnesses said that after he and a friend jumped from the 30-foot platform into a 20-foot deep pool, Hester did not resurface. Tragic death: Ryan Hester, pictured with his wife Kelly, drowned after jumping from a 30-foot-high platform into a lake . Rallying: Friends and family are rallying around Kelly Hester and Ryan's young daughter Leighann . Witnesses told investigators that Hester landed awkwardly on a rope marking the landing area. Officer Corey Narrod told The Indianapolis Star that Hester’s body was found in 19 feet of water. An autopsy on Friday showed that Hester drowned. According to the Star, the autopsy revealed no signs of trauma. The final report is still outstanding, pending toxicology results which could take weeks.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Snapchat’s popularity has soared in recent months and a number of firms, including Facebook, have been looking to emulate this status - with limited success. But latest rival Taptalk could finally steal the app's crown after Ashton Kutcher tweeted about it to his 16 million Twitter followers on Sunday. Taptalk sends self-destructing pictures and videos by tapping the screen and each file is sent with user’s location. Snapchat rival Taptalk (pictured) was developed by Berlin-based Onno Faber. Pictures and videos are shared with friends using a tap of the screen, and each file is sent with the user's location. Captions can also be added, and the photos and videos self-destruct after they've been viewed . Although it sounds almost identical to Snapchat, its developers and fans claim its much simpler to use, and could replace text messaging. Taptalk has a photo and video viewer at the top of the screen, and a grid of friends below. Tapping a friend’s face takes a photo with either the front, or rear-facing camera. The image is then sent to the selected friend automatically. Tapping and holding the friend’s face sends the selected contact a video. Captions can be added before tapping the screen, and all files are sent with the user’s location included. Video and photos can be viewed only once before they are deleted. Messages can only be sent to individuals, and not groups - like on Snapchat. Due to it's single-screen design, Taptalk is also said to be much faster and easier to use than its rival. This is because it’s stripped out the timers, profiles and navigation buttons seen on Snapchat. Instead, Taptalk has a photo and video viewer at the top of the screen, and a grid of friends below.

"By . Alex Greig . A Maine mother of twin girls who were brutally assaulted while in the care of her live-in boyfriend says she may never know what happened the night they were injured. Emily Walker left her twin two-year-old daughters and her four-year-old son in the care of David Devine, 25, while she worked on May 11. When she arrived at the mobile home the family shared in Oakland, she found all three children much too quiet. Vicious beating: Police say David Devine caused serious injuries to twin daughters of his girlfriend, including broken arms and legs, shattered elbows and internal injuries . Brooklyn was lying silently on a couch and Maddilyn was on a bean bag chair. 'She was almost unconscious,' Walker told the Press Herald. 'I touched her arm and I knew right there that it was broken.' Maddilyn's arm was broken, and Brooklyn had suffered a broken leg, internal bruising and a shattered elbow. Both girls were bleeding heavily from the nose, reports the Online Sentinel, and Maddilyn was dazed and having trouble breathing. 'It’s probably going to be a mystery that will always bother me for the rest of my life, unfortunately,' Walker told KJ Online. 'No one’s going to get exactly what happened.' Devine told Walker that her son . Wyatt had caused the injuries by hitting the little girls with a plastic . toy bat outside the home. She relayed the information to the dispatcher but even as she spoke she began to doubt the veracity of Devine's story. 'It just didn’t add up,' she told the Press Herald. 'His story started to change and the time frames were off.' Healing: Emily Walker with her two-year-old twins Maddilyn and Brooklyn who were badly injured on May 11 and her four-year-old son Wyatt, who her boyfriend said caused the injuries . The Press Herald reports that investigators found a small bloody handprint on the inside of a closet wall, blood smears on a dresser in the girls’ room, 'blood splatter marks on the wall in the hallway' and more blood near a window inside the home. Police said the nature of the little girls' injuries was so severe that a four-year-old could not have caused them. Twelve days after the attacks, Devine was arrested and charged with assault. He and Walker had planned to marry, and she is pregnant with his child. Walker says he had never been violent or angry with the children before in her presence and he was planning to adopt the children as his own after their marriage. Defenseless: Little Brooklyn wears an ankle-to-waist cast as well as an arm cast and will have to undergo physical therapy to learn to walk again . 'It took me a long time to get used to the idea that he did this,' she told KJ Online. 'In my heart I want to believe it wasn’t him, but I can see that it’s a lie.' The girls are now in the process of a long and painful recovery. Brooklyn has been placed in a cast that extends from her waist to her ankle, as well as a cast on her arm. She is effectively immobilized and will need to learn to walk again with physical therapy. 'She cries in pain for an hour at a time,' Walker said. All three children bear emotional scars that will take longer to heal than the broken bones and internal injuries. Walker says her son Wyatt told her he should have stopped the attack but he was too scared. Devine is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail.","Emily Walker arrived home from work to find her twin two-year-old girls who had been in the care of her live-in boyfriend seriously injured .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The amount you use the web may not only be affecting your sleep and how you communicate, it could also be influencing who you find attractive. Researchers have found that women who spend lots of time online prefer more masculine looking men, while men prefer more feminine, thinner women. The findings suggest that the internet - and most likely media portrayals of certain 'types' - is associated with what people think is attractive. Researchers found that women who spend lots of time online prefer more masculine men, while men with internet access prefer more feminine, thinner women. An ideal couple cited in the study included Russell Crowe (right) and Jennifer Connelly (left) specifically in the 2014 film Noah (pictured) St Andrews University psychologist Carlota Batres, who led the study, said: ‘One possibility for the difference is the level of media exposure. For decades, experts believed women flocked to silent types because of their aloof and mysterious nature - but new research suggests its because the trait is actually an ultimate sign of masculinity. On average, women talk three times as many words each day than men, and their brains are wired to recognise this trait. When a women meets a man who talks a lot, they consider them to be more feminine and less attractive, yet men who use shorter words and speak more concisely were seen as more attractive because they appeared more masculine. Silent types who also have deep voices, such as Hollywood actor George Clooney, were considered the most attractive. 'People with internet access are more exposed to the media, adverts or websites, which promotes the beauty ideals of muscly men and thin feminine women.’ As a recent example, the researchers cited the Hollywood blockbuster movie, Noah, in which the male lead is played by the masculine actor Russell Crowe, and the female lead is played by the feminine, thin Jennifer Connelly. Other masculine men include Hugh Jackman,  while Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is an example of a thin, feminine woman. The research was carried out in El Salvador, where the majority of people (74 per cent) don’t have access to the internet. The study asked participants to choose between pictures of people higher or lower in weight, or higher or lower in masculinity and femininity. Researchers found there was no difference in the preferences of those with access to the internet. Almost exclusively, they preferred the faces that the internet might suggest are more 'attractive'. St Andrews University psychologist Carlota Batres said one possibility for the difference is the level of media exposure. She said people with web access are more exposed to adverts which promote the beauty ideals of muscular men and feminine women.  Russell Crowe is pictured left and Jennifer Connelly is pictured right . Other masculine men include Hugh Jackman (pictured left), while Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (pictured right) is an example of a thin, feminine woman. The study claimed that people with internet access are more exposed to the media, adverts or websites, which promotes the beauty ideals of muscular men and feminine women . However, non-internet users found masculine, heavier women more attractive, such as Gwendoline Christie who plays Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones (pictured). The research was carried out in El Salvador, where the majority of people (74 per cent) don't have access to the internet . However, non-internet users found feminine men and masculine, heavier women more attractive. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found people with internet access were more likely to have a television in their home, which exposed them even further to the media through commercials, television shows, and movies. Researchers attributed these findings to several explanations, including economic circumstances influencing perceived attractiveness. Professor David Perrett, of the Perception Lab at St Andrews University, said: ‘One possibility is that the harshness of the environment may influence face preferences. ‘People without internet in the El . Salvador study had fewer resources - such as no running water - and such . harshness may be responsible for what they find attractive. ‘When . income and access to food is uncertain, heavier women may be better . equipped to survive and reproduce, and therefore preferences for heavier . women could be adaptive. ‘Our . findings are consistent with previous literature that has found that . heavier figures are considered more attractive in poorer and rural . areas.’ The study asked participants to choose between pictures of people higher or lower in weight, or higher or lower in masculinity and femininity. Women without web access found feminine men, such as Harry Styles (pictured left) and Zac Efron (pictured right) more attractive . Professor Batres added: ‘Our findings suggest that existing online studies may provide a distorted perspective of the populations in developing countries. ‘Our data provide evidence that, even within a small country, sub-sectors of the population have different preferences. ‘Future research should take this into account when studies are made in countries where a substantial portion of the population does not have internet access.’","Researchers found women who spend time online prefer masculine men .

"By . Alex Greig . A 16-year-old special needs student has drowned during a class field trip in East Los Angeles to the horror of his mother, who rushed to the boy's side. Field trip tragedy: Erick Ortiz drowned while visiting a recreation park on a school trip . Erick Ortiz was pulled from the deep end of the pool at Atlantic Park by lifeguards on Wednesday afternoon. The Garfield High School student was taken to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later. Witnesses say the victim's mother rushed to his side as lifeguards performed CPR on the boy. 'I . heard screaming and I knew it was the mother because she was screaming . for her son. Why, why did this happen to her son? Who wasn't watching . him?' witness Ana Serrano told NBC. Students were swimming at Atlantic Avenue Park. The small park has gardens and a 50-meter, six-lane swimming pool. 'I saw teachers running toward the boy to see what was wrong and the lifeguard began CPR,' Serrano told NBC. Investigators are unsure if Ortiz jumped into the water or was pushed. Leslie Ortiz, Erick Ortiz's sister, told NBC that her brother had no intention of going in the water. '(Erick) went in with all of his clothes on, you know with his shoes on, this is . not (how) somebody that’s prepared to go swimming goes into the pool, . right? she told NBC. She said her brother had a teaching assistant who was assigned exclusively to his care.'That was his one job, to watch him. Where was he? My brother couldn’t even go to the bathroom alone, the assistant had to go with him,' Leslie Ortiz said. Answers: The Ortiz family wants to know how Erick Ortiz came to be in the water fully clothed and why no one was watching over him . It's not clear where Ortiz's mother was at the time her son went into the water, but Leslie Ortiz says that the teaching assistant phoned the mother to tell her they were attempting to revive her son. 'He went down toward the bottom of the pool, surfaced back up. Appeared to take a breath and then sank back down toward the bottom,' Lieutenant Eddie Hernandez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department told NBC. Attorney Luis Carrillo is representing the family, who want answers as to how Ortiz drowned and why his teaching assistant wasn't watching him. 'The family wants justice, an independent investigation and answers as to why their child was left alone. The family does not want condolences from the LAUSD (Los Angeles Unified School District),' Carillo said. The Ortiz family is accusing the LAUSD of negligence.","Erick Ortiz, 16, drowned during a field trip to Atlantic Park in East Los Angeles .

"By . Alex Greig . and Associated Press . A husband and wife have been found dead of gunshot wounds in their Connecticut home in an apparent murder-suicide. Authorities responded to a report of a shooting at the couple's Bristol home Wednesday morning and found 26-year-old Alexander Ryng and 27-year-old Kyla Ryng dead inside. Police say the Ryngs' three children, ages four, three and 20 months, also were in the home but were unharmed. Heading for divorce: The couple had been married for almost six years by Kyla Ryng had just days before the shootings filed for divorce from Alex Ryng . Family home: The Ryngs' three children were home at the time of the shooting and two of them alerted neighbors that 'something bad' had happened at home . State court records show Kyla Ryng filed for divorce from Alex Ryng on May 30. Five days later, police were called to the home at 73 Henderson St at 7:15am Wednesday by neighbors who were alerted by two of the Ryngs' children that 'something bad' had happened. Police say their preliminary investigation indicated that the deaths may have been a murder-suicide. Kyla Ryng's Facebook page stated that she was a 'Full-time stay at home mommy & wife, and I love it.' Alexander Ryng was a first lieutenant in the Connecticut Army National Guard. According to the Courant, Kyla Ryng said in court documents that the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably.' She requested that the couple's property be divided and that she receive alimony and child support. Domestic violence: The pair had three children aged four, three and 20 months who may have witnessed the killings. They are now being cared for by family members . Mysterious: The couple look happy in snaps posted to their Facebook accounts, and police had not previously been called to their home for domestic disturbances, but Kyla Ryng had filed for divorce just days before her death . She wanted joint custody of the children, but for their primary residence to be with her. According to WFSB, the couple had been married for almost six years. In a press conference late Wednesday afternoon, Bristol police Chief Thomas Grimaldi said Alexander Ryng legally purchased the weapon used in the shooting. High school students waiting for a school bus nearby described hearing a woman screaming and then three bangs followed by a slamming house and then silence. Neighbor Nancy Gagne told the Courant that she saw law enforcement officials and a priest enter the home. 'I'm sick about the kids, what they saw,' she said. The children are now being cared for by family members.","Kyla Ryng, 27, and her 26-year-old husband Alexander Ryng were found dead in their home Wednesday morning .

"By . Mark Prigg . and Jonathan O'Callaghan . It was the DIY project that captured the hearts of space enthusiasts the world over - could a team of scientists really re-gain control of a long-thought dead spacecraft? In late May they wowed us all by making first contact - but now the project has, sadly, come to an end. Tanks on the spacecraft that were once full of nitrogen gas, needed to fire the thrusters, appear to be empty. Scroll down for video . A team of citizen scientists has successfully regained control of the once-thought 'dead' ISEE-3 spacecraft (illustration shown). The team made first contact with the probe in late May and has now fired the thrusters on the vehicle, with a view to flying past the moon on 10 August . ISEE-3 . was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind . streaming toward Earth from a stable orbit point between our planet and . the sun known as the Lagrangian 1, or L1. Monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the . interconnected sun-Earth system, which at its most turbulent can affect . satellites around Earth. In . 1984, it was given a new mission and called the International Cometary . Explorer. In September 1985, it passed through the tail of Comet . Giacobini-Zinner, making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a . comet. It also went on to . fly by Comet Halley in March 1986. From 1991 until 1997, when it was too . far away for reliable communications, this satellite continued to . investigate the sun. Now it's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to Earth in August. Without thrusters, there is no way to push the 36-year-old spacecraft, the International Sun-Earth Explorer-3, or ISEE-3, onto a trajectory to be captured back in Earth orbit. Instead, ISEE-3, which is otherwise in working order, will just fly by. 'Odds are, there is nothing we can do,' Keith Cowing, a leader of the effort, said. 'We think there is a chance that the Nitrogen used as a pressurant for the monopropellant Hydrazine propulsion system may have been depleted,' the team announced on Wednesday, dashing hopes the craft could still have a fruitful life ahead of it. It is believed it will now lose radio contact in around three months as it simply drifts further away from Earth,. The initial burn, which took place a few days ago, involved 11 ‘pulses’ of the spacecraft’s hydrazine thrusters. They also completed the first trajectory change for ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer), with the goal of flying past the moon on 10 August and eventually entering orbit between Earth and the Sun. This had the goal of increasing the ‘spin’ of the spacecraft from 19.16 revolutions per minute to about 19.75, almost exactly what the original mission specifications called for. ‘In other words: bullseye,’ one of the lead scientists, Keith Cowing, writes at Space College. The team of scientists were given . the go-ahead by Nasa to crowd-fund the revival of the seemingly 'dead' spacecraft earlier this year. Contact was last made with the spacecraft, called ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer), in the late 90s. As it approached our planet, scientists had a brief chance to communicate with the 36-year-old probe in an . attempt to bring it back to life - which they managed to do in late May. ‘The ISEE-3 Reboot Project is . pleased to announce that our team has established two-way communication . with the ISEE-3 spacecraft and has begun commanding it to perform . specific functions,’ said Cowing at the time. First contact with ISEE-3 was achieved at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico, which is continuing to be used as a means to communicate with the probe. The . achievement was a collaboration with a number of other organisations . and people including the staff at Arecibo and a team at the Bochum . Observatory in Germany. In . April the ISEE-3 Reboot Project team - made up of the groups Space . College, Skycorp, and SpaceRef - undertook a successful crowd funding . project to raise £74,000 ($125,000) to rescue the probe. Nasa . also officially endorsed the Virginia-based project and signed a space act . agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s-era . craft. This is the first . time Nasa has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the . agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again. 'We . contacted the spacecraft after recreating hardware that was discarded . by Nasa decades ago using command language that was recreated from old . documents that were sitting in former employees' basements,' Cowan told MailOnline. He also revealed how they intended to use the spacecraft for science again, and to involve citizens in it in a way not attempted before. ‘The intrepid ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent . away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind . extending its mission of discovery to study two comets,’ said former Nasa . astronaut John Grunsfeld. ‘We . have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through . this creative effort to recapture the ISEE-3 spacecraft as it zips by . the Earth this summer.’ In . March, amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and . find out its route, raising hopes that the mission could be revived. The mission's original communication hardware no longer exists, so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware. Once proving this was possible, the project is now using the Arecibo Radio Observatory (pictured) in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3 . Launched . in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward . Earth, ISEE-3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981. With remaining fuel and functioning instruments, it then was redirected to observe two comets. Following . the end of that mission, the spacecraft continued in orbit around the . sun. It is now making its closest approach to Earth in more than 30 . years. The goal of the . ISEE-3 Reboot Project is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a . gravitationally stable point between Earth and the sun known as . Lagrangian 1 (L1). Once . safely back in orbit, the next step will be to return the spacecraft to . operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed. ISEE-3's close approach provided optimal conditions to attempt communication. Nasa said it had shared technical data with the amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from ISEE-3. The . mission’s original communication hardware no longer exists, so . controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create . virtual software versions of the original hardware. Having done this, the project is using the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3. New . data resulting from the project will be shared with the science . community and the public, providing a unique tool for teaching students . and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering. The data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36-year old spacecraft.","Virginia-based amateur group successfully fired thrusters on 'dead' probe .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Apple hasn’t confirmed any details about its upcoming handset, dubbed iPhone 6, but that hasn’t stopped knock-offs already hitting the market. Users of Weibo have spotted a number of fake models claiming to be the next-generation device on sites such as China’s Taobao. The hardware appears to match many of the rumours circulating about the phone, but experts believe the software is, instead, a skinned version of Android. Users of Weibo have spotted a number of fake models (pictured) claiming to be the next-generation device on sites such as China's Taobao. The hardware appears to match many of the rumours circulating about the phone, but experts believe the software is instead a skinned version of Android . Reports claim Apple will introduce a new 4.7-inch iPhone alongside a larger 5.5-inch model later this year. The claims are said to have come from sources inside Apple’s supply chain. Apple’s display suppliers, including Sharp and LG, were expected to go into mass production last month. Apple's iPhone 6 is also rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 8.1mm thick. The phones are advertised from around 199 yen, which equates to just £18, or $32. Images of the cloned devices have been posted online by Nowhereelse.fr and placed next to the Samsung Galaxy S III for comparison. Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6, all with a thin, curved device and distinctive white 'bars' across the back. However, a Japanese news agency recently claimed the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen. Nikkei said the leaked pictures all show flaws - such as buttons that do not fit properly, of misaligned screens. They claim this is because the units are unfinished - and that the final version will have polished glass in place of the bars seen in pictures. It was thought Apple would release two devices this year - a 4.7-inch model, and a 5.5-inch phablet-style device. However, analysts believe the firm has hit problems manufacturing the handset's case and screen, and will now only launch the smaller version at an event scheduled for September.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Archaeologists train for years to unearth and identify ancient artefacts, but an ambulance worker from Northumberland has happened upon one at a local car boot sale with no effort at all. Martin Jackson, 50, paid just £3 ($5) for the 4,500-year-old ancient Egyptian wooden maul - a type of hammer - and experts have since valued it closer to £4,000 ($6,800). The maul, which would have been used by craftsmen to create carvings in temples, was among a haul of broken tools at Mr Jackon’s local sale on the quayside at Amble, Northumberland. The maul (pictured) would have been used by craftsmen to carve temples. It was found among a haul of broken tools at a car boot sale in Northumberland. Experts claim the ancient tool is 4,500 years old and was found originally at ancient burial ground Saqqara, south of Cairo . Mr Jackson said the maul was in ‘a shabby condition’, with electrical tape roughly wrapped around the handle, and the seller was originally offering it for sale for £6 ($10). ‘It was one of those days when all the men gather round the hardware stall you get at any car boot sale and rummage through boxes of stuff you would be ashamed to even throw in the bin, like broken screwdrivers and busted hammers,’ said 50-year-old Mr Jackson, who studies ancient symbolism. After removing the tape, Jackson noticed a finely engraved silver band which explained it was an Egyptian maul, and that it had been found at the ancient burial ground Saqqara. It was brought to Ireland in around 1905 by a highly-decorated British officer who is frequently mentioned in dispatches at that time. Ambulance worker Martin Jackson (pictured) paid just £3 ($5) for the ancient Egyptian wooden maul - and experts have since valued it closer to £4,000 ($6,800). Jackson's maul was sent to the Natural History Museum in London where it was compared to one already in its Egyptian collection, and was confirmed as genuine . Saqqara (pictured) is a burial site that is part of a cemetery linked to the ancient Egyptian capital Memphis. It is more than 3.7 miles (6km) long by 1 mile (1.5km) wide. The area of the site contains the burial plots of nobles of the Early Dynastic period, from around 3100BC and 2613 BC .

The . area of the site nearest to Memphis contains early burials of nobles from the Early Dynastic period - around 3100 and 2613 . BC and ther are a total of fifteen Royal pyramids at Saqqara. The earliest Egyptian stone-built pyramid is called the Step Pyramid and it was built by Djoser, a king of the Third Dynasty in around 2686 BC and 2613 BC. Jackson’s maul was sent to the Natural History Museum in London where it was compared to one already in its Egyptian collection, and it was confirmed to be genuine. Jackson said: ‘To hold something which is twice as old as Christianity - that built some of the most ancient temples in the world - feels very special. ‘To feel the ‘sweet spot’ where the mason preferred to rest his thumb, thousands of years ago as he built vast monuments, is quite incredible. ‘I was completely stunned and delighted by its rarity.’ After confirming it is a genuine artefact, experts from Value My Stuff claimed the maul is worth between £2,000 ($3,400) and £4,000 ($6,800). The site's Egyptian expert said: ‘Wooden mallets were used in ancient Egypt in all types of activities, from stone and wood sculpting to boat and furniture building. ‘A preserved wooden item like this from the Egyptian period is extremely rare and over the course of my 25-year career I’ve only ever seen three appear on the market.’ Jackson plans to sell the item to fund more trips to Egypt where he will continue his research into ancient symbols. ‘It is serendipity that I found it and it has come along for a reason,’ Jackson added.

And in so doing they managed to show the most likely walking gait of the animal, which was thought to be only a few millimetres long. Scroll down for animation . More than 400 million years after it became extinct, scientists have recreated one of the planet's earliest predators. Researchers at the University of Manchester and the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin used CGI to recreate the walk of a now extinct ancestor of the spider. Illustration pictured . The study was published in the Journal of Paleontology and carried out by The University of Manchester and the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. The scientists used the fossils - thin slices of rock showing the animal's cross-section - to work out the range of motion in the limbs of this ancient, extinct early relative of the spiders. This arachnid, Palaeocharinus, was part of a spider-like group known as Order (type) Trigonotarbida. These . were spider-like animals that roamed Europe and North America, as well . as Argentina, from around 419 and 290 million years ago. They ranged in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres in body length. Most were predators, and later species were heavily armoured. From this, and comparisons to living arachnids, the researchers used an open source computer graphic program called Blender to create the video showing the animals walking. This particular arachnid was known as . Palaeocharinus of the extinct Order Trigonotarbida that roamed from around 419 and 290 million years ago. 'When it comes to early life on land, long before our ancestors came out of the sea, these early arachnids were top dog of the food chain,' said author Dr Russell Garwood, a palaeontologist in the University of Manchester's School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. 'They are now extinct but, from about 300 to 400 million years ago, seem to have been more widespread than spiders. 'Now we can use the tools of computer graphics to better understand and recreate how they might have moved - all from thin slivers of rock, showing the joints in their legs.' The . scientists used the fossils to work out the range of motion in the limbs of this . ancient, extinct early relative of the spiders. From . this, and comparisons to living arachnids, the researchers used an open . source computer graphic program called Blender to create the video . showing the animals walking in the animation above . These eight-legged creatures were one of the earliest to walk the land, dominating the food chain while the ancestors of humans were still swimming in the primeval swamp. Pictured is an X-ray of the 410 million-year-old arachnid fossil from London's Natural History Museum . Co-author Dr Jason Dunlop, a curator at the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, said: 'These fossils - from a rock called the Rhynie chert - are unusually well-preserved. 'During my PhD I could build up a pretty good idea of their appearance in life. This new study has gone further and shows us how they probably walked. 'For me, what's really exciting here is that scientists themselves can make these animations now, without needing the technical wizardry - and immense costs - of a Jurassic Park-style film. 'When I started working on fossil arachnids we were happy if we could manage a sketch of what they used to look like; now we can view them running across our computer screens.' This work is part of a special collection of papers on three-dimensional visualisation and analysis of fossils published. Dr Garwood added: 'Using open-source software means that this is something anyone could do at home, while allowing us to understand these early land animals better than ever before.' Pictured here are a sequence of images from the video showing how the arachnid walked. 'For me, what's really exciting here is that scientists themselves can make these animations now, without needing the technical wizardry - and immense costs - of a Jurassic Park-style film,' said Dr Dunlop .","Researchers from Manchester and Berlin have brought an arachnid to 'life'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Ever heard your doorbell go, dropped what you're doing rushed downstairs to open the door, only to find it’s an unwanted visitor? That’s a scenario one London-based company hopes will be a thing of the past with their i-Bell technology, a Wi-Fi video doorbell that can connect with your smartphone or tablet. By using a camera and connecting to the internet, the device will let you know who is at your door even if you’re out and about at work, the shops or elsewhere. Scroll down for video . The Wi-Fi enabled i-Bell device lets people see who is at their door through the use of a 1080P camera. This can be synced to a smartphone, tablet or PC across multiple platforms and, when the bell is rung, the homeowner can see who is at their door and speak to them through their phone . To use the i-Bell, which is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign to raise £30,000 ($50,000), it is installed on your door like a normal bell and sits at face level. Size: 110 x 60 x 22mm (3.9 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches) Weight: 320 grams (0.7 pounds) Camera Quality: 1080p HD . Camera field of view: 180° . Wi-Fi enabled: Yes . Battery: Internal rechargeable lithium . Audio: 2 Way audio speaker and microphone . Video: One-way (homeowner to visitor) Other features: Cloud Storage, Voicemail . On the front is a button for visitors to activate the bell, and also a camera at the top. When a visitor presses the button the camera springs to life and calls the device it is synced with, which can be any Android, Apple, Windows and Blackberry smartphone or tablet, and also any PC. You can then choose to 'answer' the call with your chosen device and then speak to the person on their doorstep. If it's a delivery, for example, the visitor could be asked to go drop it with a neighbour. Or if it's a guest but you're out of the house they could be asked to come and meet you somewhere. The camera isn't two-way though, so the visitor won't be able to see you. When it is released later this year, possibly November, the product will retail for £179.50 ($307). The i-Bell uses a 1080p HD camera and communicates with the guest via a built-in speaker and microphone. i-Bell also allows users to screen their visitors, so they can choose whether or not to answer the door to a cold-calling salesman or an unwanted guest on the doorstep. When someone is at the door you can chose to 'answer' the call with your chosen device  (shown) and then speak to the person on their doorstep. If it's a delivery, for example, the visitor could be asked to go drop it with a neighbour. Or if it's a guest but you're out of the house they could be asked to come and meet you . High-security brackets help to keep the gadget safe and secured to the front door, and the i-Bell can be connected to from any synced device anywhere in the world. If you miss a call, the digital doorbell will also be able to take a picture, using the cloud to store images of people calling at your door to be checked later, while it can also record audio in the form of a voicemail. 'There’s nothing quite like i-Bell on the market right now,' said Graham Kershberg, Co-Founder of the company. 'It’s going to revolutionise daily life for a lot of individuals and businesses. 'Arranging deliveries around working hours or getting an unexpected visit from a relative who gets no answer at the door can really disrupt an individual’s plans. 'But now it’s possible to communicate directly with the person ringing the doorbell, let the postman know where to leave a package, or tell Aunt Mabel that you’ll be home as soon as possible without even being on the premises. 'Fun to use and practical, i-Bell makes it possible to answer the door from any corner of the world, whether that’s five minutes down the road on the school run or from a sun lounger overseas on a long awaited holiday.'","London-based company i-Bell has designed a video Wi-Fi doorbell .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Apples are often said to be healthy snack and a good low-calorie food - but could they also be a promising aphrodisiac? That’s the case according to a study that says the fruit can boost sexual pleasure in women. The researchers found a link between enhanced sexual function in healthy women and regular daily apple use. Researchers in Italy have found apples (stock image shown) can boost sexual pleasure. The findings were made as part of a study of 731 Italian women. Each of the women was asked to say how often they consumed apples, with those who ate more reporting higher sexual pleasure . An apple a day could stop you having a heart attack - and may even be as effective as taking a statin, claim Oxford University researchers. They say healthy over-50s who add a daily apple to their diet can benefit as much as those who start taking a tablet. Their study goes some way to proving the proverb coined by the Victorians: ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’ The scientists’ calculations suggest that prescribing an apple a day to everyone aged 50 and over would prevent or delay around 8,500 heart attacks and strokes a year in the UK. The health benefits are similar to giving statins to everyone over 50 who is not already taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. In the study published in Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics they analysed 731 healthy Italian women aged 18 to 43. All of the participants were asked to report on their daily apple consumption and their eating habits. They were then split into two groups, one that ate apples regularly - more than one a day - and another that ate less than one a day. The participants were then also asked to fill out the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The FSFI required them to answer 19 questions about their sexual activities including frequency and overall satisfaction, reports Huffington Post. It was found that eating an apple a day was linked with higher FSFI scores, suggesting it increased their sexual pleasure. Eating more apples apparently increased their lubrication and sexual function, enhancing the experience according to the study. The researchers think the reason for this may be because apples contain phloridzin. This is a compound that is quite similar to the female sex hormone called estradiol, which plays a large role in sexual arousal. ‘This study suggests a potential . relationship between regular daily apple consumption and better . sexuality in our young women population,’ the researchers conclude. The reason for this according to the researchers may be that, like red wine and chocolate (stock image shown), apples contain a compound that boosts sexual arousal, in this case  phloridzi, which is quite similar to the female sex hormone called estradiol that plays a large role in sexual arousal .","Researchers in Italy have found apples can boost sexual pleasure .

"By . Associated Press . and Mailonline Reporter . When a New York City dry cleaners was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy, the only item to survive was Nicole Pagliaro's wedding dress. But her name was lost to owner Hector Pacheco, who reopened after more than a year and in a new location. Mrs Pagliaro had brought the dress to him after her 2012 wedding. When the storm swamped and shuttered the store, on Staten Island's Sand Lane, she assumed it was lost. Found: Nicole Pagliaro, pictured with her husband Michael (left) and dry cleaner Hector Pacheco (right), has been reunited with her wedding dress that she thought had been destroyed by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 . 'Every store [on lower . Sand Lane] was done,' Mrs Pagliaro's husband Michael told the Staten Island Advance. 'When I got home, I showed Nicole the . pictures and she asked, ""What about the dry cleaners?"" When I told her, . she started crying.' In fact, while the dry cleaning store was flooded by fave feet of water, Mrs Pagliaro's dress, which was stored in a secure box, floated to the surface undamaged. The ticket attached was lost though, so Mr Pachecho was unable to track down the gown's owner. Instead, when he reopened a year later in a new location, he displayed the dress in the window. It was not until two weeks ago, that Mrs Pagliaro took a different route to work and spotted the gown in the window of Mr Pacheco's new store. On show: The gown (pictured) was the only garment to survive when Mr Pacheco's store was flooded. The ticket attached to the dress was lost, so when he opened a new store, he used it as a window display . 'We really never drive down this way, and thank God there were no gates on the window,' she said. 'I saw my dress in the window. I knew it was my dress,' adding that she even still had the ticket for it. She says that when she finally went into the shop, on Monday, Mr Pacheco was present. 'He remembered me and gave me a big hug,' she said. Mrs Pagliaro wants her daughter — now 18 months old — to wear the dress on her wedding day.","Nicole Pagliaro, from Staten Island, had sent her gown to a local dry cleaner when Superstorm Sandy hit .

"By . Mailonline Reporter . She ran last year's London Marathon in what appeared to be full make-up, diamond earrings and designer sunglasses. And now Katherine Jenkins, 33, has hit back at the 'women-hating women' who criticised her for her glamorous look. 'I'm not one of those girls. If I see a . girl look nice, I'll tell her. I'm all for supporting other women being . successful. I thought this was really sad,' says the mezzo-soprano in a new interview. Katherine ran in what appeared to be full make-up, diamond earrings and designer sunglasses . 'We trained . for six months and raised £30,000. We trained through the winter. I had . to do a three-and-a-half hour run in the snow one day. 'It . demeans anyone who has ever run a marathon because, believe me, I can . think of better ways to get publicity than putting in all that hard work . to run 26.2 miles. 'I had mascara on, but there was no eye shadow, no . face make-up, no lip gloss. In any case there's no way that you could . have eye shadow on and lip gloss and run for five hours and it's still . there, not a chance,' Jenkins said speaking to the Sunday Telegraph's Seven magazine. She ran the marathon in five and a half hours raising £30,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support. Her father, Selwyn, died of cancer when she was 15. The Welsh singer was also immaculately coiffed for the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon . The Welsh singer, who turn 34 next month, was also immaculately coiffed for the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon in London in October. She appeared to be sporting black eyelash extensions, a hint of eyeshadow and a slick of pink lip gloss for photo calls before and after embarking on the 13.1 mile circuit. But while some have raised an eyebrow at Jenkins' attention to appearance, others have jumped to her defence. Former TOWIE star Amy Childs, 22, who also ran the marathon, said Katherine looked beautiful, and admitted that she too opted for a made-up look. Speaking . on Loose Women the red-head said: 'Katherine Jenkins is absolutely . beautiful. At the end of the race she looked beautiful as well.' 'Every . morning at half 5 me running down Brentwood, Ongar, Pilgrims Hatch, I . had no makeup on. No one would have recognised me, I had no makeup on . but that was me waking up in the morning. 'For . the marathon I thought no I am going to be glam, this is me, I love my . eyelashes, I love being glam, so I did, so I ran glamorous, a guy ran . past me and said 'God Amy how do you look like that!' I was sweating hot . but I still had my lipgloss in my bag. I ran glamorous.' Amy Childs said:'Katherine Jenkins is absolutely beautiful. At the end of the race she looked beautiful as well' Jenkins was awarded a prestigious OBE at Buckingham Palace in March. And the classical-crossover star has even more reason to celebrate after announcing her engagement to distinguished professor, artist and film-maker Andrew Levitas, 36, last month. Speaking about the recent proposal, a source close to Katherine said: . ‘Andrew proposed in the Hamptons at his family home on Tuesday.

"By . James Rush . Meet 'The Dudely Lama', founder of the religion based on the laidback character of the hit Coen Brothers' comedy The Big Lebowski. Inspired by the way of life of The Dude, portrayed in the film by Oscar-winner Jeff Bridges, American Oliver Benjamin, 46, decided to set up the alternative religion of Dudeism. Since he founded the religion in 2005, more than 250,000 followers have become priests, ordained by the Church of the Latter Day Dude, with some even performing wedding ceremonies. Oliver Benjamin, also known as 'The Dudely Lama', has founded a religion based on the laidback character of the hit Coen Brothers' comedy The Big Lebowski . The film is about unemployed slacker Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski and a cast of characters who become embroiled in a kidnap plot after a case of mistaken identity . Since Mr Benjamin founded the religion in 2005, more than 250,000 followers have become priests, ordained by the Church of the Latter Day Dude . Despite facing criticism that it is not serious, Mr Benjamin, a former graphic designer and writer, believes the religion is important. He said: 'I had been a student of religion and spirituality for years but ultimately gave up on my quest. 'It seemed that all the schools of thought I encountered either took everything too seriously or were too irrational. 'I longed for a worldview that both could be looked at rationally without recourse to magical thinking, and also had a sense of humor. 'While watching The Big Lebowski I saw that it contained all the ""good parts"" of everything I had studied. 'The Big Lebowski is like a hologram: it contains the whole world. Parts, anyway.' The religious 'leader', who now lives in Thailand, gave up his job to spread the word of The Dude 'full time' Mr Benjamin said: 'Dudeism is my full time job and I mean ""full time"" very loosely' The film is about unemployed slacker Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski and a cast of characters who become embroiled in a kidnap plot after a case of mistaken identity. It starred Jeff Bridges as The Dude, John Goodman as his best friend Walter, Julianne Moore and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The Coen Brothers' movie grossed more than $40m at the box office worldwide and has a rating of 80 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. On the religion, Mr Benjamin said: 'On a spiritual level we think the benefits are profound. Religion has served to help us deal with our current exile. 'But most of the popular ones are way out of touch and have become corrupted by power structures. 'In short, Dudeism is an open-source attempt to remake religion that fits with modern times, that is based on rationality, and that doesn't just end up becoming a big business and source of division.' Mr Benjamin is pictured with Jeff Dowd, the 64-year-old Hollywood producer who was the inspiration for the character of The Dude . Mr Benjamin is pictured with Phillip Moon, who played Woo, one of the henchmen of Jackie Treehorn, the film's villain, Jon Polito, who played a private eye, and James G. Hoosier, who is an ordained Dudeist Priest and played the bowling partner of Jesus Quintana, portrayed by John Turturro in the film . The religious 'leader', who now lives in Thailand, gave up his job to spread the word of The Dude 'full time'. He said: 'Dudeism is my full time job and I mean ""full time"" very loosely. 'I live in Thailand most of the year so I don't work very hard. It's inexpensive there and I have very cheap taste. 'In short, Dudeism is an open-source . attempt to remake religion that fits with modern times, that is based on . rationality, and that doesn't just end up becoming a big business and . source of division' - Dudeism founder Oliver Benjamin . 'I try to travel a lot. I spent most of the 1990s with a backpack on my back wandering hither and thither. 'My travel career has slowed down a bit lately. I miss being a travel writer - that was the best job in the world.' Mr Benjamin was born in Los Angeles and studied Psychology at UCLA. But, he says, just like The Dude he can't remember much from his days in higher education because of a party lifestyle and drinking 'beer extremely fast'. The establishment and popularity of Dudeism has 'flabbergasted' the star of the movie Jeff Bridges, Mr Benjamin said. He said: 'When asked what they thought of the fact that someone had started a religion based on one of their movies, the Coens replied, ""We're as surprised as you are"". 'When asked what he thought of Dudeism, and what the Dude might think of it, Jeff Bridges said, ""I'm flabbergasted by it but the Dude would dig it"".' The establishment and popularity of Dudeism has 'flabbergasted' the star of the movie Jeff Bridges, Mr Benjamin has said . Oscar-winner Jeff Bridges as The Dude in the hit Coen Brothers' comedy The Big Lebowski . After almost a decade leading the Church of The Latter Day Dude, Mr Benjamin is now considering whether it's time to hand over the reins. He said: 'It can be exhausting being the leader of a religion. No one warned me about that. 'But there's a lot more tinkering to do before the structure can stand on its own. 'I meet Dudeists everywhere I go. Sometimes people even recognize me from some of the online videos. 'It's fun. Mostly people get it. Once in a while people think I'm an idiot. But that's okay. I am an idiot.' For more information about Dudeism visit its website.","Oliver Benjamin set up Dudeism inspired by character in The Big Lebowski .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Melissa Causer, 21, of Middleton-St-George, near Darlington, is accused of stamping on her friend's face, splitting her eyeball, after a night out . A woman was blinded in one eye after her friend stamped on her face while wearing 'lethal' stiletto heels, a court has heard. Melissa Causer, 21, stood on her friend, Sophie Robinson's face, piercing her eyeball with her stilettos after the pair argued over a taxi fare after a night out, a jury was told. Giving evidence from behind a screen, Miss Robinson, 20, told Teesside Crown Court how she was pinned to the ground, repeatedly punched, and stamped on three times after her best friend became 'infuriated and violent'. She said the third blow from the heel of the silver shoes caused 'excruciating pain' and then a burning sensation in her right eye. Miss Robinson said she and Causer had travelled from Darlington to Middlesbrough for a night out on January 10 this year. After a trouble-free evening, Miss Robinson went to find a taxi but could not persuade her friend to join her, prosecutor Richard Bennett told the court. Miss Robinson took a taxi by herself and arrived at Causer's home in Middleton-St-George, near Darlington, ten minutes before her friend got there in another cab. There was a discussion about money for the second taxi before Causer is said to have knocked her friend to the ground and attacked her. The prosecutor told the court: 'The very last thing Sophie Robinson saw with both of her eyes was that Melissa stamped on her face. 'The first two blows avoided her eyes, but, unfortunately, the third blow with those stiletto heels went into her eyeball and split it. 'She had no idea at that stage how serious and catastrophic the injury was.. .. the shoe heel penetrated the eyeball, causing immediate and irreparable damage. 'The heels of those shoes are a very lethal weapon if, indeed, they were used as a weapon. 'It is the prosecution's case that Melissa Causer intended to cause really serious bodily harm.' Jurors at Teesside Crown Court heard that the first two blows missed the eyes but the third pierced the eyeball . Under cross-examination, Miss Robinson denied pulling her friend from her cab by the hair. She also disputed that there was a scuffle in which they were both hitting each other, and that Causer had taken her shoes off in the car.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Sacked Manchester United manager David Moyes is in the clear over an alleged bar-room assault, police said today. The 51-year-old Scot was spoken to by police after claims made by builder Josh Gillibrand, 23, that he had been attacked at a wine bar in Clitheroe in May. Officers were called to the Emporium bar in the Lancashire market town following a report of an altercation on the evening of May 21, just a month after Moyes had been sacked from the Premier League club. David Moyes, 51, left, has been cleared by police over claims he assaulted builder Josh Gillibrand, 23, right . Mr Moyes, who lives near Preston, had been socialising with his friend, Blackburn Rovers managing director Derek Shaw, a businessman who lives in the Ribble Valley, and others. They had dinner in Piccolino's restaurant in Clitheroe before heading on to Emporium for a drink at around 10pm. Witnesses said that a group of drunken young men began shouting at Moyes shortly before he entered the bar, making comments about his managerial style. One said: 'Moyes started to head in with his mates but he was being barracked by drinkers outside. 'He was getting a bit of lip from a couple of blokes and then one guy, who was a bit drunk, said something about him being s*** and having never won anything.' A scuffle ensured, during which joiner Mr Gillibrand, from nearby Dutton, said he was grabbed by an angry Mr Moyes. Mr Gillibrand said he suffered concussion and a bloodied nose in the fracas, which ended when a police car was flagged down and officers came and spoke to the men involved. At the time, police said there were 'a number of differing accounts' of what happened, but today Lancashire Police confirmed no further action would be taken against any party. Wine bar: The alleged incident was said to have taken place at the Emporium in Clitheroe, Lancashire . A spokesman said: 'After careful consideration of all the circumstances in this case it has been decided that no further action will be taken against anyone. 'A thorough investigation has been carried out and everyone identified as having been involved in this incident or having witnessed it have provided accounts to the police. 'All these accounts were given voluntarily, it has not been necessary to arrest any person. These accounts have been considered and it has been decided that this is the most appropriate course of action.' Moyes was dismissed by Manchester United last April following a mediocre season after he replaced the retiring Sir Alex Ferguson.  He had been in charge for less than a year and was said to have received a £4.5million pay off. He has formerly managed Everton and Preston North End, and played as a centre half for a number of clubs including Celtic.","Moyes was sacked by Premier League club in April after a mediocre season .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Lucky escape: Jonah Murphy, one, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, fell nine feet through the bannisters just as he had learned to walk . A baby's first attempt at walking ended in disaster after he fell through a gap in the bannisters and onto hard tiles on the floor below. Jonah Murphy, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, was playing in an upstairs bedroom when he decided to take his first steps unaided, two days before his first birthday. The stairgate was closed but he stumbled on the landing and plunged straight through a gap in the bannisters, falling nine feet onto the hall floor below. Jonah's parents heard the thud and called an ambulance, which took him to South Tyneside District Hospital where doctors diagnosed a fractured skull. After X-rays and a CT scan, Jonah was transferred to the neurology department at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where he spent two days. Now, nine days on from the fall, he is back at home with his parents Kelly, 33, and David Murphy, 39, and older brother, Flynn, five. The orbital bone above his left eye is slowly healing, and the only trace of his accident is a slowly fading black eye. Mrs Murphy said: 'He's doing great now and he's back on his feet, but I really thought we were either going to lose him, or if he survived, he wouldn't be the same little boy he was before. 'By some miracle, he's OK.' She said the accident happened on the first day the little boy began to walk unaided. 'He has been around that area a million times before when he was crawling and there have been no problems,' she said. 'When I saw him lying there on the floor, I thought that was it.' The accident happened when Mrs Murphy was in the kitchen and her husband, a Nissan manufacturing worker, was in an upstairs bedroom. The family had already checked to make sure the baby couldn't fit through the five inch gaps in the bannisters, but didn't realise the one nearest the wall was slightly wider than the rest. The Murphys say there was a towel hanging over the bannister, and believe the baby put his hands out for balance, thinking it was solid, and fell through. Scroll down for video . David Murphy, 39, and wife Kelly, 33, had measured the gaps in their bannisters but one was wider than the rest . Long way down: Jonah with his father in the spot the baby was found after falling from above . The bannisters just outside Jonah's bedroom - which lead to a safety gate - have now been boarded up . Mrs Murphy said: 'The safety gate was closed so we didn't think anything of it. 'I just heard this thud and I screamed, and swooped straight in to pick him up. I think it took a couple of seconds for Jonah to realise what happened and then he started screaming. 'When I heard the thud and saw him on the floor the towel was with him. I just don’t think he would have been able to get through crawling.' She added: 'Up until the results of the CT scan came in, we were scared that we were going to lose Jonah. It was horrific, but thankfully there was no bleeding on his brain. 'Now we just want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . Predator: Simon Wood, 54, allegedly molested children in African schools and orphanages after claiming he was carrying out charity work . A British Airways pilot who was struck by a train after he was charged with child abuse offences 'took his own life', a coroner ruled today. First Officer Simon Wood, 54, allegedly molested children in African schools and orphanages after claiming he was carrying out charity work for the airline. He was due to appear in court last August to face separate charges of indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl and possessing indecent images of children but was found dead after being struck by a train near Potters Bar station in Hertfordshire. Graham Danbury, Deputy Coroner for Hertfordshire, said: 'I’m satisfied that, as a result of having been charged with offences, he was in a state of considerable distress which would have been understandable. 'He felt that his only way out was to take his own life.' Hertfordshire Coroner’s Court heard that Wood, from Potters Bar, died on August 18 last year. He had been due to appear at London’s Southwark Crown Court on August 30. Detective Inspector Simon Giles, from the Metropolitan Police, said officers had spoken to Wood in a car park at Heathrow Airport on July 19. He said: 'As a result of things discussed in that conversation about activity in Kenya and potentially things seen on his computer, he was arrested.' Wood was charged on August 15 with indecent assaulting an eight-year-old girl and 17 offences of possessing indecent images of children, Mr Giles said. After he was charged, Wood appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court and was released on bail with 'stringent conditions' including a curfew from 7pm to 7am, the inquest heard. Gary Mathias, fatality investigator at the British Transport Police (BTP), told the inquest that Wood’s body was found on the railway line between Hatfield and Potters Bar stations. A member of staff on a First Capital Connect train had spotted a man wearing a grey hooded top and blue jeans stood two metres from the track and alerted signal staff, he said. An hour later a passenger on another train saw a person wearing similar clothing lying on the track, Mr Mathias said. BTP officers were alerted and discovered Wood’s body which had been 'severely injured by a passing train', the hearing was told. No train drivers had been aware of hitting a person but CCTV images from a train had later shown a man believed to be Wood entering the track, the inquest heard. Wood, his face scribbled out by a youngster, entertained the children with zoo trips and music sessions . A post-mortem examination had found no medication or drugs in Wood’s body, Mr Danbury said. The cause of death was given as 'multiple traumatic injuries,' he added. The coroner said he was 'satisfied' Wood intended to kill himself and he would not 'speculate' over the possible outcome of the charges the pilot faced. 'I reach a conclusion that he took his own life,' Mr Danbury said. Witnesses: Metropolitan Police Detective Inspector Simon Giles (left), who headed  the investigation into Mr Wood and Gary Mathias (right) of the British Transport Police arrive at the coroner's court . Following the inquest, Wood’s family released a statement which read: 'Simon’s death and the circumstances surrounding it have been difficult for all concerned. We request that the privacy of the Wood family be respected at this time.' British Airways is to be sued for damages by 16 alleged victims, some of whom are still aged just eight. The mother of two girls who were allegedly sexually abused by the British Airways pilot stands outside the Intercontinental hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, today . Lawyers representing the young girls and women who claim the pilot assaulted them said the airline bears responsibility because he carried out the alleged attacks while on stopovers in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The alleged period of abuse was from 2003 to 2013, when the girls were aged five to 13, law firm Leigh Day said. Lawyer Nichola Marshall, from Leigh Day, said: 'We allege that Wood was able to abuse the victims, by reason of his employment with the airline, in particular through his involvement with the airlines’ community relations work. 'The schools and orphanages that our clients attended were all in receipt of charitable donations from the airline, and Wood played a key role in administering those donations, on behalf of British Airways. 'Our team will be travelling overseas over the coming weeks to meet with other potential victims in Nairobi and Uganda that have come forward more recently.' A British Airways spokesman said: 'We were shocked and horrified to hear the allegations against Simon Wood, which appear to relate to his involvement in child-related activities entirely outside the scope of his employment with British Airways. 'Our sympathies are with the victims and it is disappointing that the conduct of one person has caused so much distress to the many thousands of decent people who engage in charitable works on a regular basis.' The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Wood was first arrested over an indecent assault allegation in November 2001 but prosecutors ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Wood visited Nyumbani Children's Home for HIV-positive children but they said there were no complaints . It reconsidered the case in July last year after receiving new details of similar alleged offences committed overseas and apparent evidence of indecent images. At Easter 2002, Wood was among 20 crew members from two BA flights who volunteered to spend the holiday period with the Kenyan youngsters, showering the orphanage with presents, medicines and donations raised at home. He told the Press Association, which covered the trip: 'We play, sing, organise activities and generally entertain them. We become very close to the children.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . A pub landlord arrested by police investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence declared: 'I didn't kill her and I didn't have an affair with her'. Paul Harris, 46, who runs The Acomb pub in York, spoke out after he was released on bail after being questioned on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the hunt for the 35-year-old chef. He said: 'I know everyone is saying that I either murdered Claudia or I had an affair with Claudia, but that's not true. 'I just feel for Claudia's family.  This sort of thing must give them false hope.' Police investigating the disappearance of chef Claudia Lawrence, 35, left, who went missing in 2009,  arrested Paul Harris, 46, right, who runs The Acomb pub in York, three miles from Ms Lawrence's home . Search: As Mr Harris was questioned on Wednesday, detectives searched his pub, his van and his car . The publican told 5 News his children were reduced to tears after he was arrested and his pub searched by detectives from North Yorkshire Police investigating the case of the York University chef who disappeared on her way to work in March 2009. 'People have been texting my children asking ""Did your dad kill Claudia Lawrence?""  My kids have been in tears, my wife has been in tears all night,' he said. He said Ms Lawrence had visited his pub two weeks before she went missing, but said it was the first time she'd been there for years as she had starting frequenting another local pub, The Nag's Head, instead. Mr Harris, who has run the pub in the west of York, three miles from where Ms Lawrence lived, for 11 years, said: 'The police have told me I was arrested because a woman came forward recently saying something that contradicted what I said in a statement taken at the time Claudia went missing. 'I can't say who it is who came forward, or what was in the statement, but what I can say is that I volunteered to give the police a statement at the time. 'I gave my DNA, I've got nothing to hide.' He said the police were not questioning him in relation to Ms Lawrence's disappearance in 2009 but because of a discrepancy between something she said and something he said in his statement at the time. Mr Harris added: 'I've got nothing to hide, I've done nothing wrong. I just feel for her family because this sort of thing must give them false hope'. Mr Harris said his arrest on Wednesday reduced his two children to tears but added: 'I've done nothing wrong' Police hunt: Detectives and forensics undertook a detailed search of Mr Harris' York pub, basement and garden . He said police had searched his pub, his van and his wife's car, but not their family home, adding: 'They've made a right mess at the pub.' The publican said detectives had dug up a large slab of concrete in the pub's basement, and accused police of wanting 'to look like they're doing something'. He added: 'There's so much interest in this story that making arrests makes it look like they're getting somewhere. 'They've gone upstairs where I've been renovating rooms and made a mess up there, searching around. I've got about 12 doors which have been stripped of paint and they've taken two of them away. 'Why would you take them away? They've been stripped so won't have any DNA on them.' Mr Harris, who said he had displayed a 'Missing Claudia Lawrence' poster in his pub window  to help with the search, said: 'Claudia came into the pub once in the two years before she went missing. 'She was with people who are friends of mine - they're still friends now.  I didn't know her any more than that, and the cops know that.' Landlord: Mr Harris, seen in an old picture, said Ms Lawrence came into his pub once with mutual friends . He said: 'I just feel for Claudia's family, for her poor dad - I'm a dad myself. I've always told the police everything I know. I hope anyone out there with information who has not spoken yet will come forward - it's not too late'. North Yorkshire Police have yet to comment about Mr Harris' claims. Ms Lawrence, who lived in Heworth, York, was last seen by colleagues at the University of York on the afternoon of March 18, 2009 when she finished her shift. She spoke to her parents, Peter and Joan, on the telephone that evening but has not been seen since despite a huge police hunt.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A British Airways pilot who died at 43 after complaining he was being poisoned by toxic fumes on passenger planes may have been right, according to new research. Richard Westgate, from Edinburgh, suffered years of ill health including severe headaches, mental confusion, sight problems and insomnia before he died in December 2012 at the age of 43. Just before he died, he instructed lawyers to sue BA for health and safety breaches, convinced his problems were related to his being exposed to toxic chemicals on board the planes he flew. Now, new scientific research has provided compelling evidence that exposure to cockpit air contaminated with hazardous organophosphates caused his death. Scroll down for video . BA pilot Richard Westgate, 43, died after complaining he was being poisoned by toxic fumes in the cockpit . Lawyer Frank Cannon, who was instructed by Mr Westgate before his death, said: 'We believe that constant exposure to fuel leaks in planes contributed to Richard's death. 'This scientific research proves that Richard suffered from chemicals called organophosphates which cause chronic brain and other problems. 'This happens because of constant exposure working aboard aircraft.' The new findings - the results of a wide-ranging study which took in evidence given by Mr Westgate -  have just been published in the Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry. They show that scientists found organophosphates did affect Mr Westgate's health. Mr Westgate, a world record-breaking paraglider, died within days of the death of fellow BA pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, who also claimed she had been poisoned by contaminated air. Mr Westgate, who was not married and had no children, died  in Amsterdam, having stopped there for treatment on his way to Swiss suicide clinic, Dignitas. Records from the Civil Aviation Authority reveal that pilots and crew have to put on oxygen masks at least five times a week to combat suspected 'fume events'. Mr Cannon's Glasgow-based firm, Cannons Law, is acting for 25 people who believe they are suffering ill-effects from hazardous fumes on planes. Another BA pilot, Karen Lysakowska, 43, also died in December 2012, and claimed she too had been poisoned . Pilot John Hoyte, head of support group the Aerotoxic Association, is among those who believe the fumes are endangering the health and safety of crews and passengers, and is campaigning for toxic air detectors on board all flights. He said: 'Countless air crew and passengers are suffering, but this scientific report finally gives us the recognition that exposure to toxins from oil fumes can cause serious illness.' Last year, a pilot flying from Heathrow to Philadelphia was forced to make an emergency landing at a remote military base in Canada after toxic fumes seeped into the cockpit. And last month, three cabin crew went off sick after complaining about fumes on a flight from Heathrow to Newcastle.The problem was found to be caused by oil dripping into a motor at the rear of the plane.' A BA spokesman said: 'It would be inappropriate to comment or speculate on the cause of death of an individual. 'The safety and security of our customers and crew are of paramount importance to British Airways and will never be compromised.' Warm air is pumped into jets from the engines to provide a comfortable environment. But chemicals in engine oil can also enter cabins, despite safety devices meant to stop fumes, causing a condition called aerotoxic syndrome.","Pilot Richard Westgate died at 43 after saying 'breathing in toxic fumes'

"By . Harriet Arkell . Police investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence, 35, in 2009, today arrested a 46-year-old man from the York area on suspicion of perverting the course of justice . Detectives investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence have arrested a 46-year-old man on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. The man, who police say is from the York area, is currently being interviewed in custody while detectives conduct searches and forensic enquiries in relation to the investigation. Meanwhile, detectives investigating the disappearance of the 35-year-old from York were searching a pub in the city that Ms Lawrence used to frequent. Around eight police vehicles with officers, including scenes of crime and dog handlers, descended on the The Acomb pub in York early this morning and have been searching it since. A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police confirmed that they were interviewing a 46-year-old man in connection with Ms Lawrence's disappearance, but would not comment on the pub search. The force said the investigation was 'very much active' and said there was the possibility that further arrests will be made. Police also said that the 59-year-old man arrested in May on suspicion of murdering Ms Lawrence remained on police bail while their enquiries continued. Ms Lawrence, who lived in Heworth, York, was last seen by colleagues at the University of York on the afternoon of March 18, 2009 when she finished her shift.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Passport: American-born Randall Cole, 44, says he had to answer 'clearly homophobic' questions when he attended a routine interview to get a British passport . A passport official has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation after a gay man complained he was interrogated about his personal life in front of his four-year-old son during a routine passport interview. Randall Cole, 44, says he was grilled for half an hour by a Home Office employee in Chelmsford, Essex, about whether he had ever had sex with a woman, why his son's biological mother had given him up, and what passers-by thought when they walked past him and his husband with their two adopted sons. The American-born charity worker, who is married to a Brit and became a British citizen in May, said that when he objected to her questioning in front of his small child, the woman said: 'We can ask anything we want'. Mr Cole has filed a formal complaint to the Home Office, and the employee is currently suspended while an investigation is held into the matter. He said he was shaking after the interview, which was conducted in the middle of an open-plan office and left him feeling violated. The father of two adopted sons said that the atmosphere in the 'clearly homophobic' interview changed when he explained that he had two adopted children with his husband, Stuart Wales, 42, and the passport official realised he was gay. Despite him being accompanied by his son Samuel, four, Mr Cole said he was asked whether the children were biologically theirs, what Samuel and his brother Benjamin, eight, thought of their birth mother, and whether they were confused by their family set-up. Mr Cole said that he explained that even if the boys' birth mother were there too, if one of them fell over, he would run to him rather than her, but says the Home Office employee merely sighed and shook her head. He told the Guardian: 'Then she said: ""What do you think people make of you when they see you walking down the street with your kids?""' And he said she went on to quiz him about whether the boys called their biological mother 'Mum', forcing him to explain to his small boy about him coming out of his mother's 'tummy' but him and his husband being their parents.  Mr Cole said the line of questioning in front of his son left him upset that he had 'failed to keep him safe'. He said that when he said he worked part-time, the woman dismissed him as playing the 'housewife' role in the couple, and then her questioning became even more personal. 'She said: ""You must have had relationships with women in the past, though?""'  He said at this point he objected, but she was having none of it. 'She became indignant and said: ""We can ask anything we want, regardless of whether or not it makes you feel uncomfortable,""' he said. Chelmsford: Mr Cole has submitted a written complaint to the Home Office after his interview in the Essex town . Mr Cole, who married human resources manager Mr Wales in California but moved to Britain because of its reputation for tolerance, said the woman was clearly trying to humiliate him and put him in his place. He said she told him that he could refuse to answer questions but that his refusal would be noted in his application, and that she continued to press for answers on the point of whether he or his husband had ever been sexually active with women. The Home Office website says that during the interview for a first British adult passport: 'You'll be asked to confirm facts about yourself that someone trying to steal your identity may not know'.  Passport interviews are routinely recorded. This morning a Home Office spokesman said: 'People applying for their first British passport are required to attend an interview designed to detect and deter those trying to obtain passports fraudulently. Passport Office: The female employee has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation (file image) 'Intrusive questions about someone's sexuality as part of an interview would be inappropriate and is not a reflection of our policy. 'HM Passport Office expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from our staff and takes allegations of misconduct extremely seriously. 'The member of staff in question has been suspended and a disciplinary investigation is now underway.' Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell told MailOnline: 'It's truly shocking in this day and age that a Home Office official can behave in this intrusive and bigoted way. 'I'm delighted that the official has been suspended.  No-one applying for a passport should be subjected to such humiliation for any reason. 'It shows that the Home Office needs to do more to train its staff to be sensitive and non-homophobic.'","American-born charity worker Randall Cole, 44, became British citizen in May .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The boss of an insurance firm has told how an ambulance smashed into his office just seconds after he had got up from his desk. David Rose, 62, had just walked from his desk by the window of his office in Southfields, south London, yesterday, to the other side of the room when an emergency vehicle - which was responding to a serious incident - spun off the road and through his window. The ambulance, driven by a female paramedic, ploughed through two steel bollards and the glazed shopfront before coming to a stop just eight feet away from where father of one Mr Rose stood.  Astonishingly, no-one was seriously hurt. An ambulance smashed through the windows of the Rose Insurance offices in Southfields, London, yesterday . The ambulance is believed to have collided with the red car before spinning into the Rose Insurance office . Today Mr Rose, who has run his Rose Insurance firm from the office on Merton Road for 25 years, said: 'I would have been decapitated if I hadn't got up 20 seconds before to talk to a colleague and client on the other side of the room, as the ambulance went right over my chair and desk.' But he insisted that despite his knowledge of the insurance world, he would not chase London Ambulance Service for compensation, saying: 'I detest that sort of thing.  I'm old school and I'm just going to tidy up and get on with it.' The ambulance car collided with another car before it smashed through the building's frontage just after 5pm yesterday as Mr Rose and his office manager, Steve Terry, were talking to a client at the office counter. Mr Rose said: 'We were talking to a client when he heard an awful noise and I turned round to see blue lights and I thought ""They're getting a bit close"" and suddenly it was in our office.' He said he believed the ambulance was coming down the wrong side of the road when a car in the line of traffic on the other side turned right, into the ambulance's path. Mr Terry, 53, said: 'When I heard the crash I just thought the ambulance had hit a car but it carried on going and the car ended up where Dave's seat was. Crash scene: Mr Rose said he was not planning to sue because he 'detested all that' and was 'old school' 'Luckily nobody was hurt - it could have been a whole lot worse. My daughter works in Wimbledon Park and her mate went past on the bus and told her a car had gone through her dad's office. 'She was quite worried and came down in her car. She was relieved to find I was OK.' Mr Rose, who said another ambulance crashed into his shopfront nine years ago, but caused less damage, added: 'The ambulance driver seemed OK and I haven't seen her since. 'Everyone was remarkably calm and all the locals came to help me clear up, which was lovely.' He said the fire brigade helped winch the ambulance out and made his office secure with acrow props. Lucky escape: Twenty seconds earlier, David Rose had been sitting at his desk beside the window . A spokeswoman for the London Ambulance Service would not elaborate on the nature of the emergency the car was heading to, but said: 'We can confirm one of our cars was involved in a road traffic collision at around 5pm, with another car near Merton Road, SW18. This car was on its way to a serious incident nearby. 'We sent a single responder, two duty officers, an advanced paramedic and an ambulance crew to the scene. 'We treated one patient for minor injuries and took her to St George's Hospital - but not as a priority. 'The medic, although shaken up, did not need to go to hospital.' A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: 'We were called just after 5pm to reports of two cars in a collision, one of which had entered a shopfront. 'No-one was reported trapped and our officers made the area safe.'","Emergency vehicle collided with another car before ploughing into office .

Patrick Knetemann, 34, suffered broken discs in his neck and severe bruising after he was hit head-on by the VW Golf as he cycled along a main road in Slough, Berkshire, last month. A video camera mounted on his bike's handlebars captured the terrifying incident and the footage has been passed to Thames Valley Police officers who are investigating. Scroll down for video . Patrick Knetemann, 34, from Kensington, west London, had gone to Slough for an afternoon's cycling . The bullet cam on his handlebars captures the minute a VW Golf going the other way crossed over his path . Not looking: The car appeared to be turning into a Kwik Fit garage on the other side of Langley Park Road . Mr Knetemann, from Kensington, west London, had gone to Slough for an afternoon's cycling when he was hit by the black car as it crossed the road in front of him. He was thrown from his saddle and into the car windscreen, which shattered with the force of the impact, and left him lying, injured, in the gutter, but the motorist still sped off. A bullet cam on his handlebars continued filming as the bike spun wildly through the air and landed, broken in two, ten feet away behind the car. The crash completely sheered off the front forks and wheel of the experienced cyclist's £1,000 red BMC road bike. A passing off-duty paramedic came to Mr Knetemann's aid and he was rushed to nearby Wexham Park Hospital, where he spent two days being treated for fractures to two cervical discs in his neck and bruising to his upper body. Mr Knetemann said: 'He came out of nowhere. The impact was so quick I had no time to stop. Moment of impact: This video still shows the moment the car struck the front of Mr Knetemann's bike .

A fraudster who posed as a James Bond-type character on dating websites before conning them out of tens of thousands of pounds has been jailed. Jonathan Hill, 43, used popular dating sites including Plenty Of Fish and Match.com to make contact with women looking for love. Hill, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, claimed that he worked undercover for the secret service and even asked one unsuspecting woman to sign 'The Official Secrets Act’ before asking for money to pay his mortgage. Sheffield Crown Court heard that the father stole a total of £28,785 from four women. Jurors were told that one of his victims remortgaged her house and resorted to payday loans firms to pay her bills after giving Hill more than £18,000. Hill made contact with Debra Bates via the Freedating website in May 2013, and after cancelling several arranged dates they finally met in June, when he told her he worked undercover and would be away for long periods of time, prosecutor Kevin Jones told the court. He told her she would have to sign ‘The Official Secrets Act’ before asking her for £3,000 to help pay his mortgage. She transferred £500 to him initially, but later made several more money transfers to him totalling £18,025, Mr Jones said. He added: 'From July to September she hoped that their relationship would develop and last. 'Ultimately she ended up having to take out payday loans to cover her own bills.' In a victim impact statement read to the court the woman said: 'He charmed me into his way of thinking. I was waiting for 'my boyfriend' to come home.' Mr Jones added: 'This victim lost just over £18,000. She now struggles to let people into her life. She says this has affected the relationship with her own family. 'She remortgaged her house, which has resulted in extra payments and an increased term.' Another victim was a member of Match.com, and after they made contact Hill conned her out of £880, jurors heard. Mr Jones said: 'As time moved on, he alluded to being in the special services or undercover in the prison service. Plenty of Fish: Hill, from Doncaster, found his victims online, using dating websites including Plenty of Fish . The serial conman, who also used Match.com, stole a total of £28,785 from four women, jurors were told . 'He said he worked undercover all over the country. 'In February 2013 he asked for money. She initially refused but she transferred £880.' Another victim was a member of dating site Plenty Of Fish. The court heard she was having a difficult time at work and Hill was being ‘helpful and understanding’ when they made contact in March 2013. In August 2013 he asked for money and she eventually gave him £3,180. Robert Sandford, defending, said Hill’s actions had ‘coincided with his redundancy and financial pressures’, and said his girlfriend of eight years was standing by him. Court: Hill was jailed for three years at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, after admitting five counts of fraud . Hill was sentenced to three years in jail after he admitted five counts of fraud. Judge Robert Moore said: 'For two years you set out to find gullible females on the internet dating system. 'They needed love, you needed money, but pretended to give them love. 'It is clear you will have left these four ladies with long-lasting effects on their feelings of confidence and trust. 'Only an immediate and substantial custodial sentence can be justified.'","Jonathan Hill, 43, trawled sites like Plenty of Fish, Match.com and FreeDating .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A violinist who killed herself days after testifying against her 'predatory' former choirmaster told her husband she felt she had been the one on trial, an inquest was told. Frances Andrade, 48, died at her home in Guildford, Surrey in January last year, just a week after giving evidence in court about historic sexual abuse by music teacher Michael Brewer. Woking Coroner's Court heard the mother-of-four had spiralled into 'incredible despair' after a friend reported Brewer to Surrey Police the previous January and she was asked to give a statement. Brewer, who taught at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester before going on to direct the World Youth Choir, was later stripped of his OBE for services to music after being jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault.  His ex-wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, was also jailed for sexual abuse. Frances Andrade, 48, (L&R) killed herself after testifying against her former abuser, teacher Michael Brewer . The abuse happened when Mrs Andrade was a teenage pupil at Chethams School of Music, pictured . Mrs Andrade was just 14 and 15 when the abuse happened, but only came forward when she confided in a friend at a dinner party in 2011 and was alarmed that Brewer was still teaching. The court heard she was prescribed anti-depressants after talking to police, and had twice tried to take her own life in December 2012 and January 2013. Her husband, Levine Andrade, 59, found his wife, known as Fran, dead at 8am on January 24 last year. He said: 'She fell into incredible despair, the truth hit home. It was not something she wanted to report to the police. 'It brought back horrible memories from her past. 'Life took a real downturn after the court proceedings - that was when she was at her complete lowest. 'Apart from the trial bringing it all back up, she felt the defence barrister seemed to be attacking her personally. 'It got her completely down and she felt completely defenceless. I think she felt she was not prepared enough for the trial. She was not expecting to be attacked personally and have to answer so many direct questions in public. 'The words she used were: she felt as if she were the one on trial.' Brewer and his ex-wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, known as Kay, were jailed after being convicted of sexual abuse . The court also heard Mrs Andrade had met Brewer on two occasions since the abuse, and even asked him to hand himself in. Mr Andrade said his wife's mood changed after being asked to give a video interview for Surrey Police about the abuse she suffered, saying: 'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end. She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.' He said she would come downstairs to make herself food, go back to bed, while he took on caring for the children and teaching as well. 'It was very out of character, she loved the children, absolutely adored them,' he said. 'It got harder and harder towards the last few months. She did not want to speak to anybody.' 'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end.  She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.' Levine Andrade on his wife, Frances . On the morning of her death, Mr Andrade, himself a musician and teacher, went to offer his wife a cup of tea and noticed she was cold. After phoning for an ambulance, one of the couple's sons attempted CPR but when paramedics arrived they pronounced her dead. Mr Andrade was also asked if there were any other issues that could have caused his wife's anxiety but said while family finances were a 'problem', it was only because they had used their savings to pay the children's school fees. Mrs Andrade, who was adopted, had also traced her birth mother to Canada but found out she had two forms of cancer. Mr Andrade said: 'She felt helpless that she was far away and could not do anything.' In April this year, a serious case review by Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board said Mrs Andrade's death 'could and should' have been prevented, and mental health services failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids. Her death led to calls for the court system to improve how sexual abuse victims are treated. The inquest continues and is scheduled to run into next week.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A university student has told how he became a 'human fireball' after a doorman deliberately set fire to his fancy dress sheep costume. Sean Collins, 22, whose home-made costume was covered with cotton wool balls, was at a Preston nightclub for a friend's 21st birthday when his costume caught fire in what he assumed was an accident. Engulfed in flames, it took him ten seconds to rip the burning costume off, during which Mr Collins suffered horrific burns to his hands and arms. Before and after: Sean Colins, 22, suffered horrific burns after his sheep costume was set alight in a club . The University of Central Lancashire student was at the Evoque nightclub in Preston when he was set alight . Mr Collins, from Sunderland, may need two more years of treatment and suffers from anxiety and depression . He was rushed to hospital where medics said he had sustained 12 per cent burns to his body and needed several skin grafts and extensive hospital treatment. The forensic science and criminal investigation student at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said: 'I became a human fireball instantly.  I could feel this intense pain which I can't even begin to describe.' He later discovered that his injuries had been caused by a doorman at the Evoque nightclub, whom he'd never met, holding his cigarette lighter to the costume. Yesterday the bouncer, father of two Thomas McGuiness, 24, from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 months at Preston Crown Court after admitting unlawful wounding. Before jailing McGuiness, Judge Michael Leeming, QC, murmured 'horrific' and there were gasps in the courtroom as CCTV footage of the moment Sean's costume was set alight was played. Hanifa Patel, prosecuting, said Mr Collins, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, who had made his outfit out of cotton wool balls and hairspray to keep them in place, was having a cigarette with friends when 'All of a sudden his costume ended up alight.' Bouncer Thomas McGuiness, 24, left, was jailed after admitting unlawfully wounding Mr Collins, right . She added: 'When officers arrived at the scene the victim was being treated for his injuries and the defendant was present. 'He was standing very close and trying to see what was happening.  He then commented: ""It was my fault. I was talking to my girlfriend having a cigarette and as I was waving my hand my cigarette caught him and he set alight. ""'I'm an off-duty doorman and work at Evoque if you need to speak to me.""' Miss Patel said that Mr Collins' injuries after the incident on January 17 meant he had missed two months of the final year of his course at UCLan and had had to give up his part-time job in the kitchen at McDonald's. Adrian Williams, defending, said: 'This was an incredibly stupid prank, not a deliberate assault on Mr Collins. 'This defendant was shocked by the consequences of his actions, he did not foresee them at all but he is responsible for them.' Mr Collins said: 'I remember standing having a cigarette with two of my mates - the next minute I was on fire. Engulfed in flames: The student became a 'human fireball' in seconds and said the pain was 'intense' 'I literally just burst into flames and I remember feeling shock and panic.  I could feel this intense pain which I can't even begin to describe. 'It had taken me about 12 hours to make the costume and I became a human fireball instantly.  I panicked and ran around trying to get the suit off. 'The whole thing was on fire and I knew I just had to get it off.  My friends tried to help me and it took about ten seconds in total. 'Afterwards I ran into the street and sank to the pavement in shock.' Mr Collins was transferred from the Royal Preston Hospital for further care at South Manchester University Hospital where he underwent several skin graft operations. He may need a further two years of treatment, and has been left suffering anxiety and depression. He said: 'I was dealing with it pretty well for the first few days when I was in hospital because I thought it was an accident - I really thought someone had caught me with a cigarette.  But then when the police came to see me and told me it wasn't an accident, it really affected me. 'I was devastated that someone could do something like that, especially to someone they'd never met. 'It was completely unprovoked.' He added: 'I suppose in some ways I'm lucky it wasn't worse but my head is all over the place now.' Mr Collins said he was 'majorly disappointed' with the sentence, and added: 'I feel like what he's done hasn't been taken seriously.  If I hadn't managed to get the suit off I could have died, but he'll be out before too long.'","Sean Collins, 22, spent 12 hours making outfit of cotton wool and hairspray .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The trip leader of an expedition in which a 17-year-old boy was mauled to death by a polar bear has told an inquest how he wrestled with the predator as it attacked him after his rifle failed to fire. Horatio Chapple, a pupil at Eton College, was on an adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands in August 2011 with the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES) when he died. Today trip leader Michael Reid, 31, from Plymouth, told an inquest into Horatio's death how he was awoken by several people shouting 'Bear attack' on the night the polar bear went on the rampage. He said he grabbed the group’s rifle and left his tent, adding: 'The only priority was getting out as swiftly as possible and taking the rifle with me as this was a serious situation. Expedition leader Michael Reid, 31, left, told how he fought the polar bear that killed Horatio Chapple, 17, right . 'The bear was close and it was on top of one of the YEs (young explorers) in their sleeping bags. I believe it was Scott Bennell-Smith. 'I was not focussing on other people other than the bear that was on top of person on the ground. I do not recall seeing Horatio. 'I cocked the rifle, took aim, aimed it carefully as I didn’t want to shoot the YE.' Mr Reid said the rifle didn't fire, but it repeatedly failed to go off, and then the bear turned on him. 'The bear then came and attacked me because the rifle was then on the ground beside me,' he said. 'I shouted ""Use your pen rounds"" even though I hadn’t briefed the others where they were stored overnight, and although they are not safe to use (in close quarters), they are better than this bear carrying on. 'I remember the bear biting my head and I thought the weakest part is the eyes, so I tried to take out the eyes with my fingers, but was unsuccessful. 'Once it had moved off me I then recall asking ""Where is my rifle?"" and someone said ""It’s in your tent"" and I found it there. The inquest into Horatio's death heard how the polar bear, pictured after it was shot dead, attacked the camp . 'With one of the rounds that was on the ground having been ejected, I cocked the rifle and fired the round at the bear as it was attacking someone else.' He said that this time the weapon worked. Mr Reid said he had no recollection of seeing Horatio during the incident, but added: 'He was a member of our team, one of the best in our team if not the best in the whole expedition. 'He was a fine young gentleman with amazing potential.  I enjoyed being on the expedition with him.' Mr Reid said a bear watch could have been held on the night of the attack but it would have left the team tired and vulnerable to cold-related illness during the coming day’s planned long trek. Mr Reid, 31, who was seriously injured in the attack, added that although he believed the person he saw being attacked by the bear was Scott Bennell-Smith, from information he had since received this might be incorrect. Mr Reid said the expedition had been supplied with an incomplete tripwire system, which meant they had to set it up in a triangular rather than rectangular shape, and said his group had to improvise using a paper clip to modify the trigger system because the brass fittings were missing. The Etonian was described as 'a fine young gentleman with amazing potential' Andrew Ruck, from Edinburgh, who was mountain leader for the group, described how the polar bear moved from attacking Mr Reid, known as Spike, to himself. He said the bear at one point had its paws on his shoulders and he was looking straight into its face. Describing waking up in his tent, he said: 'I woke up straight away and sat bolt upright, I then remember Spike or I opening the tent to see the polar bear there, I do not think it had anyone or anything in its mouth at that stage.' He said that he then saw Mr Reid attempting to fire the rifle at the bear. He said: 'He tried to fire the rifle four times, bullets emptied out, he shouted ""It's not working"" and then the bear came over to him and knocked him to the floor. 'After that I exited the tent through the other entrance. I just charged towards the bear, shouted and picked up rocks and threw them at its face. 'I remember the bear then attacked me and knocked me straight to the floor, its paws were on my shoulder, I remember seeing its face. 'It swiped my face with its claw and my head would have ended up in its mouth at some point. 'The bear left me for some reason but I had very few clear thoughts after that. 'I know I ended up not in the spot where it attacked me and ended up right next to Horatio, I must have been aware someone had been very badly injured and I think I was trying to help.' Mr Ruck said that a decision had been made to use a tripwire system as an early warning alert that night and added that a bear watch would have had its own risks if it had been used instead. He said: 'Bear watches themselves carry considerable risk, they are absolutely not a fool-proof system, they are open to human error - in 2002 I personally briefly fell asleep on a bear watch when I was 18 and I was a YE (young explorer).' He added: 'Most encounters with polar bears are not fatal or even problematic. I am certainly aware that the behaviour of our bear charging into the campsite is completely abnormal.' The camp site where Horatio Chapple was mauled to death. Witness Matthew Burke said: 'The bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to Horatio' Matthew Burke, one of the young explorers , described how he saw the bear slamming down on to Horatio as it attacked him. Describing the incident, he said: 'I sat upright to the screams of ""bear, bear"". I unzipped the inner and the front porch and I saw the bear at the front of Horatio’s tent in the porch.” He said he then went out the back of the tent and saw Mr Reid aiming the rifle at the polar bear which was attacking a person he believed to be Horatio who was standing up in the porch of his tent. He continued: 'The bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to Horatio, it used its paws and slammed down on Horatio. Spike was trying to shoot the bear.' Mr Burke said he then went round to the outer tents and attempted to calm some of the other young explorers. He then returned as the bear stopped attacking Mr Reid and turned on Mr Ruck before returning to attack Horatio who was only dressed in his boxers. He added: 'After Andy was on the ground, the bear walked back to the tent with Horatio in it and continued to attack someone there, the person was half-in half-out of the tent with the porch of the tent on top of him. 'The tent had fully collapsed when the bear slammed down, this person was on top of it. At this point (the bear) was biting and clawing (Horatio).' Mr Burke said he then went into the leader’s tent and pulled the rifle inside and unsuccessfully attempted to find some more bullets for it. He continued: 'At that point I gave up searching and went out the back of the tent, it was at that point the bear spotted me and it chased me around the leaders’ tent and would change direction when I changed direction.' He said the bear then went after Scott Bennell Smith and knocked him to the ground before returning to Horatio’s tent. He continued: 'The bear didn’t see him (Scott) as a threat and went back to the first tent where it walked on top of the tent and it was clawing that tent. This is the point at which I believe Pat (Flinders) would have been injured. 'At this point Spike had got back to the rifle and fired the bullet. He took the shot and killed it.' He said he went immediately to Horatio’s tent and added: 'He was dead, there was no sign, he wasn’t making any sound, wasn’t moving, you could just kind of tell.' The inquest continues.","Horatio Chapple, 17, was on an adventure trip to remote Svalbard Islands .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Sara Agintas, 45, right, had a free gastric band operation and now she wants the NHS to send her daughter Hannah, 14, to £4,500 weight loss camp . A mother of six who dropped from 38 stone to 22 after having a free £14,000 gastric band says she now wants the taxpayer to send her overweight daughter to boot camp. Sara Agintas, 45, from Milton Keynes, says that while she has managed to lose weight after having an operation to reduce her stomach capacity, she's concerned that her 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, who is 5ft 9in and weighs 17 stone, needs expensive intervention by the State. Mrs Agintas, who has shrunk from a size 38 to 22 since her operation in 2012, said: 'I can’t afford to pay for a weight loss camp, but I don’t see why the Government can’t step in and provide for her with a funded camp on the NHS. 'It would be an investment for her future - I have tried everything I can to help her at home, with no luck.' Mrs Agintas had her gastric band operation done for nothing by a private surgeon after she appeared in the press two years ago calling to have the operation on the NHS. At the time, she said: 'I can’t afford a personal trainer or weight-loss surgery – I need help from the taxpayer.' Now she believes the only way her daughter will lose weight is by attending a weight-loss camp for children - paid for by the State. 'I don't want Hannah to end up the way I was and if she doesn't stop, that's exactly what's going to happen,' she said. 'I just can't get through to her - she will eat anything she can get her hands on. 'I make hearty home cooked meals at home from scratch, and I serve up smaller portions, but Hannah will always have seconds or finish up any leftovers - even though she doesn’t need it.' Mrs Agintas said: 'I would love her to go to a kids’ boot camp but it is just so expensive and way out of my price range. The camps I've looked at cost about £4,500 and that’s just not the kind of money I have. 'I think she would really benefit from going to a boot camp, so she can be out of the home environment and completely educated by health professionals. 'If she keeps on she will end up with no choice but to get a gastric band like me, and I don’t want that for her.' Scroll down for video . Mrs Agintas says her son, Sam, 16, left, is working on his diet but daughter Hannah, centre, needs expert help . The way she was: The mother of six went from size 38 and 38 stone to size 22 and 22 stone after her free op . Schoolgirl Hannah, whose BMI of 35 defines her as obese, said: 'I know I'm a bit overweight, but I don’t have as much to lose as my mum did. 'I think my mum has done really well and I’m proud of her.  I do want to lose some weight so she can be proud of me too, but I don’t find it easy. 'I wouldn't mind going to a boot camp.' In Britain, a five-week residential stay at a high-end fitness camp starts from £4,250.  Parents are told children can lose up to three stone, through a combination of diet, exercise and education about nutrition. Mrs Agintas says she's sought medical advice about Hannah’s weight but has been offered no support. 'I've taken Hannah to the doctors about her weight but all I have been told is that she's fine and will grow out of it once her teenage years are over,' she said. Mrs Agintas says she's sought medical advice about Hannah’s weight but has been offered no support . Hannah, left, has a BMI of 35, which classes her as obese, and her mother, right, says she must go to fat camp . Since losing weight and keeping it off with healthy cooking and exercise, Mrs Agintas says she has improved the quality of her life, getting a job as a passenger escort for disabled children and becoming a parish councillor. She said: 'The gastric operation really gave me the kick-start I needed to turn my life around. 'Before, I was stuck to a sofa. I couldn't move or do anything, and the only time I went out was at night to do the weekly shop. 'It wasn't a life, and my doctor gave me just one year to live, but I couldn't leave my kids without a mum.' Mrs Agintas lives at home with her three youngest children, Sam, 16, Hannah, and Zoe, 11.  Zoe is naturally slim, but both Sam and Hannah are overweight. Mrs Agintas says her weight crept up after she suffered from cravings for junk food when she was pregnant . Time to work out: The family, who live in Milton Keynes, eat healthy, home-cooked food, but it isn't enough . Sam weighs 18 stone but is trying to lose weight by eating his mother’s healthy meals and joining a gym to lose weight. Mrs Agintas said: 'The Government have billions of pounds, and I think they should spend some money helping parents who cannot afford to send their kids to a fat camp. 'More money needs to be spent on educating young people about food and exercise, it’s an investment for the future. 'I am worried about Hannah and her spiralling into what I was like. The situation is drastic and she needs to stop now before she gains any more weight. 'Hannah only has about four stone to lose and I'm sure she can do it - but I have tried everything. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.' Gastric band surgery is available on the NHS, but not for everyone.  Guidelines say the patient must have a BMI of 40 or more, or a BMI between 35-40 and a serious health condition (such as high blood pressure) that could be improved if the patient loses weight. It also depends on where the patient lives - different clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in different areas may have varying criteria for eligibility. Meanwhile, surgery for children is not recommended except for in exceptional circumstances where a child has a BMI of over 50 or is classed as morbidly obese. GPs will offer advice on weight loss so a visit to the doctor will be the best place to start. The NHS offers a free, downloadable 12-week weight loss plan, which advises on calorie intake and exercise. Other services on offer include slimming clubs, meetings with dieticians, and exercise groups.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A violent Jamaican woman who abducted a vulnerable man before torturing him for 17 hours will not be deported from Britain because a judge said social workers had failed her. The woman, known as Ms K, was sent to jail for five years for blackmail, false imprisonment and ABH after the 2009 attack - related to a drugs dispute - which left the mentally ill man fearing for his life after he was tied up. Upon her release from prison, Home Secretary Theresa May wanted to send the woman back to Jamaica, but lost after it was decided that failures by London social workers had turned the woman into a violent criminal. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary: Theresa May wanted to deport the violent Jamaican immigrant but lost her appeal . The woman was born in Jamaica and stayed there after her mother moved to Britain in 1992, suffering beatings at the hands of her Jamaican grandmother and being raped at the age of eight. In 1994, she was sent to London to join her mother and stepfather but was raped again by her stepfather's brother and a friend of the family. Ms K was then put into care and given a good foster family, but a mistake in paperwork meant that she was removed from there and transferred to a children's home. There she suffered yet more beatings and was sexually abused. After social workers let her mother remove her from care, Enfield social services were told she was being beaten by her mother in 2006.  Despite them hearing that the young woman was suicidal as a result, they did nothing, it was reported today. The family moved to the London borough of Haringey, where social workers failed to protect both Baby P and Victoria Climbie, but again social services failed to help, despite an A&E doctor warning Ms K was 'slipping through the net', the Sun reported. The woman was arrested in October 2009 after the torture of the vulnerable man. Social workers at Haringey Council, pictured, were blamed for letting the woman 'slip through the net' After her sentence finished, a tribunal overruled the Home Secretary's wish to send her back to Jamaica, saying: 'The state's failure to look after her has greatly contributed to her involvement in crime and her mental illness.' An appeal by Mrs May failed when Judge Ken Craig backed the tribunal's decision, citing a list of failures by North London councils Enfield and Haringey and saying that sending the woman back to Jamaica would be 'unconscionable'. Spokesmen for Haringey and Enfield Councils declined to comment today.","Violent immigrant abducted and tortured vulnerable man in 17-hour ordeal .

"By . Richard Marsden . and Hugo Gye . Angry at a car that had edged into a cycle-only box at traffic lights, this determined cyclist decided to give the occupants a piece of his mind. Not once, but twice. First the man remonstrated with them by shouting through the window of the white Audi A7 which had crept into the zone reserved for cyclists. When the Audi sped off, the infuriated cyclist rode as fast as he could to catch up with it at the next set of lights and keep up his high-volume rant. Incident: A road rage fight was sparked by an Audi A7 encroaching on a cycle box on the Farringdon Road in central London .

Race: When the car sped away, the infuriated cyclist rushed to catch up with it at the next set of traffic lights . The incident was captured by another . cyclist's helmet camera as he travelled to work along the busy . Farringdon Road in central London. One smartly dressed man remonstrated with the car's driver, telling him he was not supposed to be there because the space was reserved for cyclists, but the motorist sped off. The cyclist can be seen riding as fast as possible to catch up with the motorist at the next set of lights, where he confronted him once again. He called the driver a 'f***ing p***k' and added that the Audi had nearly run over his foot. Annoyed: The cyclist swore at the driver of the white Audi, calling him a f****** p*** . Anger: A passenger emerged from the car and began to fight back against the cyclist . Punch: The cyclist was knocked to the ground with a left hook, captured on video from another cyclist's helmet . Grapple: Horrified bystanders looked on as the two men fought in the middle of stationary traffic . Investigation: Police are hoping to hear from the cyclist who was knocked to the ground . But then a passenger suddenly got out . and hit the cyclist with a left hook, before pushing him off his bike . and into a taxi, which was also waiting in traffic. He yelled . obscenities at the man then returned to the Audi and was driven away. The incident was filmed and uploaded to YouTube by 26-year-old Jude, a magazine editor. He said he could not tell whether or not the car had hit the man's bike, but insisted that the driver paid 'little or no attention to the safety of the cyclist'. He added: 'Confrontations between cyclists and motorists are a daily occurrence in the same way that drivers shouting at other drivers from inside their car is common. 'That this resulted in physical violence is what makes it so shocking, I have never seen that before. 'It was shocking, you do not expect to see that kind of behaviour on the roads.' A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that officers were aware of the incident but had not received a complaint. 'We are keen to hear from the cyclist if he wants to report it,' he said.","Incident came after the white Audi A7 encroached into a cycle box at traffic lights in central London .

"By . Harriet Arkell . One of the last homeowners in England without electricity faces a £20,000 bill to be connected to the National Grid - despite living just a few yards from power lines. Retired Graham Spittey, 65, generates his energy with a noisy diesel generator and has to buy fresh food every day because he can’t have a fridge or freezer, even though his nearest neighbour, who lives 30 yards away, enjoys 24-hour electricity. Mr Spittey has spent years spent begging the National Grid to hook up his remote farmhouse in the Cornish village of Temple to mains electricity, and thought he had finally won last October when Western Power Distribution (WPD) agreed to extend existing electricity cables to his 200-year-old home for £6,800. But just as the former telephone engineer was planning which electrical gadgets he might treat himself to, the company refunded his money and told him connection to the mains would now cost him £20,000. Graham Spittye, 65, from Temple, Cornwall, lives yards from the A30 but still isn't connected to mains electricity . So close: His farmhouse, circled in blue, lies 30 yards from the power lines he wants to be connected to . Mr Spittey was told the price had gone up because workers would need to close off part of the nearby A30, one of the region’s busiest roads, to fit underground cables. He said: 'I would love to live in the 21st century but sometimes it seems as if even the 20th century hasn’t happened yet. 'Apparently the company now wants to renegotiate the price. They’ve told me it could now cost up to £20,000 to connect me, but that they don’t know for sure. 'They keep saying they’ll come back to me with a firm price but it’s just delay, delay and more delay.' Graham relies on an ageing Lister diesel generator to power his home for four or five hours a day, and can’t use any electrical items that need constant power. Despite its secluded location, his £350,000 property is just a few hundred yards from the A30 trunk road, and has BT poles right outside it. Mr Spittey said: 'Years ago when I first . thought about having mains electricity there were planning objections, . to do with it being an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and so on. 'I just want to live in the 21st century': But Mr Spittey still has to use this ancient generator for power . 'But there are now BT poles right outside my house, the main A30 has been upgraded a number of times and it’s about to be turned into a dual carriageway. 'There are electricity pylons and poles all across Bodmin moor - so I can't see that there are any planning issues at all.' He added: 'The most sensible thing is probably to just extend the mains cable that powers my neighbours but apparently the existing cable isn’t powerful enough to cope with two properties. 'I’ve suggested uprating that cable, but still nothing has happened. I’m just waiting for Western Power to tell me what’s going on, and I’ve been waiting now for nearly a year.' WPD said scheduled works to widen the A30 may give their engineers a chance to run cables underneath while the road is being dug up. Almost . every home in England and Wales is connected to the National Grid, with . nine properties in the tiny North Wales village of Abergeirw among the . last to be hooked up in 2008. Most of rural Cornwall was connected in the early 20th century, with even the smallest villages joining in the 1950s and 60s. Remote: Mr Spittey bought his farmhouse in the middle of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall 20 years ago . By the end of the 20th century only a handful of isolated rural settlements remained without a mains electricity supply. Mr Spittey, who dreams of having a fridge-freezer and a proper shower, says he was told 15 years ago there were only nine people in the country without mains electricity - and he thinks he now might be the last. 'When I bough the house 20 years ago I thought we would get mains electricity very soon.  Now I still dream of a fridge, a freezer, and a proper shower.' - householder Graham Spittey, 65 . He and his late wife, Glenise, bought the three-bedroom farmhouse 20 years ago and assumed it would be a simple job to have it hooked up to the National Grid. But he still relies on a noisy old diesel generator and has to make a 20-mile round trip every day to get fresh fruit and veg because he can't preserve anything for more than a few hours. The father-of-five, whose wife died two years ago, said: 'When I bought the house I thought we would get mains electricity very soon, but it's been 20 years and I really need it now. 'The main things I would like are a fridge and freezer and a proper power shower. I'm fed up with my existing one, the water just drips out weakly. 'The generator breaks a couple of times a year so I have to get someone to come out, and it means I'm left without electricity for a couple of days and I have to rely on friends and family. 'I always have lots of candles, torches and batteries on standby just in case the power goes. 'It costs around £1,000 a year to power and I use five litres of diesel a day in the summer and ten in the winter.' The grandfather of six, who says he has to go to his brother's house to watch football, added: 'You can guarantee that if there's an important match on the TV will go dead right at the vital moment.'","Graham Spittey, 65, bought remote farmhouse on Bodmin Moor 20 years ago .

"By . Martin Robinson . This is the moment a cat is torn to pieces by a pack of wild dogs still loose on a quiet Kent estate. Families living in Strood fear a child could be killed next because the animals have already stalked and then mauled seven pets to death. Police and the council have been called in after the series of attacks by the three dogs with 'unusual markings' but they have still not been traced. The latest attack was captured on CCTV where the dogs stalked and killed Coco. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Two dogs in the pack of wild animals have a tug of war over the body of Coco the cat - one of seven pets to be mauled to death on a quiet Kent estate . Murder: The leader of the pack is shown here on the righht carrying Coco's limp frame away followed by the other dogs, which still haven't been traced by police and the council . The pack is seen running along the pavement before crossing the road after spotting the black cat near its front door. The dogs then sprint across and play a tug-of-war with its body before the leader ran off with its lifeless body in its mouth. Parents on the Medway Estate in the north Kent town are now not letting their children out to play on their own because it is a safety risk. Victim: Beloved pet Coco the cat, pictured in one of its favourite spots at home, is one of seven cats to have been killed on its Strood estate . Bereft: Coco with owner Rik Tye, whose family fear for their children's safety and are not letting them out to play unsupervised . Upset: Mr Tye says he has shown the footage to an animal expert who 'can't pinpoint what these animals are' Mother-of-five Amanda Tye, 32, owns the cat with husband Rik, 36. She said: 'Coco jumped out of the way of the smallest of the pack bit her, snapped her neck and brought him over to the other dogs who then started ripping into her. 'I was asleep at the time but my neighbour shouted out of her window. 'He was lying in the road, her face was crumpled. It was heartbreaking. 'If they come back again I'll kill them.' 'They (the dogs) may well go for a child if they are hungry enough – they pose a big threat. 'Coco was a one in a million cat who we'll miss so much. 'I've had my eldest driving me loopy asking if he can go outside and I have to say that he can't. The only way he's allowed out is if I can see him.' Wild: The dogs are seen here sprinting along the pavement in a line before they spot Coco . Mysterious: The dogs with 'unusual markings' have not been found despite three visits by dog wardens . Fears: The dogs keep returning to the street in Stroud, who are frightened about being attacked . Suspicions: Residents fear that the pack of dogs are hidden inside this nature reserve across the road - jumping over the fence to kill cats before returning to their lair . Mr Tye said: 'I showed the video to an animal expert at a local farm and he said they're dangerous. 'Nobody can pinpoint what these animals are. Another victim? Hanging on the fence of the nature reserve is a poster asking for information on Hermoine, one of a large number of cats to disappear in recent weeks . 'They're hyena like things and do not have a face, it's all squished. 'It's a bit disturbing.' Coco had been a particular source of comfort to her children, especially eight-year-old Kyal who has autism. They are distraught that the cat has died. More worrying footage has emerged of the pack jumping up and smelling the front door of the Tye family home before chasing a cat down the road. Medway Council told MailOnline that they had sent dog wardens to the estate on three occasions and have been unable to trace the animals. A council spokesman said: 'Following reports of this incident community wardens went out on Sunday and twice on Monday to look for the dogs seen in the video. 'They were unable to locate the dogs or their owners'. Neighbours say they are living in fear of the dogs returning. Rikki Dunning, 38, who has four children and four cats said: 'It's worrying. 'They hunt in packs and if they can rip a cat apart they could easily attack a little baby.' Mother-of-four Lorraine Orange, 46, whose husband set-up the camera which captured the shocking footage, is worried about the dogs getting into her back garden. She said: 'They probably won't think twice about jumping over my fence and getting to my guinea pigs and dogs in my back garden. 'People in the estate are worried about letting their kids out.' Her husband Steven Orange, 44, added: 'Until we've heard the dogs have moved on we don't know where we stand. 'The dogs could creep up on a child. 'There's a fence next to a large nature reserve which has holes in it and that's probably where they're coming in through.' Street in shock: This is the spot where Coco had its neck broken by the 'faceless' wild animals . Cat lovers: Rikki Dunning and partner Kathy Hicks have 5 cats and are also worried the wild animals will attack them while Steven Orange and Lorraine Orange put up the camera that showed the animals attacking Coco . There have been several reports of cats going missing around the estate. Tortoiseshell cat Hermione went missing from her owner's flat opposite the nature reserve a month ago. Julie Keeble, 38, the owner’s wife put up signs appealing for help to find the moggy, fears it may be linked. She said: 'We thought she might have been poisoned but there's a possibility it could be something to do with these dog attacks. 'I haven't heard or seen these dogs but there used to be so many cats next to the nature reserve. It's strange.' Earlier this week ginger cat fur was spotted in the same road, sparking fears the rabid dogs had struck again.","Seven cats torn to pieces on quiet estate in Strood in recent weeks .

"By . Richard Spillett . Dale Bolinger is accused of grooming someone he believed was a 14-year-old girl in an online chatroom, where he talked of cannibalism and sexual fantasies . A 'fantasist' nurse with a cannibalism fetish who is accused of sexually grooming a 14-year-old girl online is 'more Walter Mitty than Hannibal Lecter', his lawyer told jurors. Dale Bolinger, 58, arranged to meet the girl via a fetish website after telling her he would kill her with an axe and then eat her, Canterbury Crown Court has heard. Father-of-three Bolinger bought the axe from a DIY store in Broadstairs, Kent, the day before he planned to meet the Mexican girl called 'Eva' who was living in Hamburg, Germany. Before retiring to consider their verdict today, jurors heard details of Bolinger's alleged attempt to meet the girl. They were told that the night before their planned meeting, Bolinger - who worked as a registered nurse at nearby Margate hospital - told her: 'Got the axe, you ready to get that train?' 'Eva', whose true identity has never been uncovered, failed to show up at Ashford International Station and Bolinger was later arrested after graphic chat logs on the Dark Fetish Network (DFN) were uncovered. Under cross-examination today, Bolinger said he had been 'stupid' and made 'very serious mistakes' but that he had not intended to kill or eat 'Eva'. He told police he believed the person he was chatting to online was probably a man in his 30s 'surrounded by pizza boxes' who would be dead by his 40s. And he said his motivation for going to Ashford International Station following their agreement to meet was out of concern for 'Eva', if she was in fact aged 14. Bolinger told the court: 'I wasn't going to take off anyone's head. It would have been messy, it would have been horrible.' In his closing speech, Bolinger's defence counsel Paul Jarvis said: 'We say that when you look at all the evidence, it's quite clear that Mr Bolinger is far more Walter Mitty than Hannibal Lecter. 'He is a fantasist and sometimes he goes too far and sometimes he stops, and sometimes - when the person encourages him - the fantasy continues.' He urged the jury not to rely on the chat logs as evidence of truth. Mr Jarvis added: 'What happened here is obvious. There is a man, he might be 39, he may well be in Mexico and he may well have a fantasy about children or girls. 'But he hasn't got anyone to play with, so the way he gets his kicks is to pretend to be someone younger so that he can feed off someone else on the DFN.' The court has been shown a 'selfie' picture Bolinger took before a planned meeting with the internet user, in which he shows off an axe he had bought from Homebase after discussing 'execution' online . Under cross-examination, Bolinger repeatedly denied that he believed 'Eva' was a 14-year-old girl, saying his intention in striking up contact with her was to 'feed into her fantasy'. He told jurors: 'I was very stupid and I cannot deny that I have been very stupid and made very serious mistakes, but for those mistakes I have pleaded guilty. 'I didn't believe that it was a 14-year-old or a girl or a child at all. I thought it was an adult male.' Prosecutor Martin Yale has said internet chats involving Bolinger on the DFN site about beheading and eating women and girls were discovered by the FBI in New York. Investigators discovered the email address 'meatmarketman' was being used in Kent and Bolinger was arrested after the information was passed to Kent Police. In chats with other users, Bolinger - who used a picture of supermodel Naomi Campbell on his profile - allegedly claimed to have eaten a 39-year-old black woman and a five-year-old child, Mr Yale told jurors. His profile, under the name Chris C, listed his interests as 'cannibalism, mainly the hunting and preparation of young but sometimes not so young women', it is claimed. Bolinger, who was working as a nurse around the time of the online chats, denies a charge of grooming . Referring to the graphic chat logs, Bolinger told the court: 'It was really about wanting to shock people...and seeing how far people wanted to go. In fact, I was running out of ideas.' Bolinger said that had 'Eva' turned up at Ashford International Station, he would have taken her home and contacted social services. Mr Yale suggested that he wanted there to be a meeting between them, but Bolinger replied: 'No I didn't, because if there was I would have been in real trouble. 'What I was hoping for was that she wouldn't turn up, and then I would go back and shout at her, and let her believe I was still interested.' Bolinger, formerly from Canterbury, denies one charge of attempting to meet a girl under the age of 16 following sexual grooming in relation to 'Eva'. Jurors have heard that Bolinger previously pleaded guilty to administering a poison or noxious substance after he put a cloth soaked in dry cleaning fluid over his friend Urlene King's mouth in July 2010. He has also admitted one count of making indecent pseudo photographs of children, and seven counts of publishing an obscene article.

"By . Corey Charlton . Killer driver: Wayne Payne - already serving a five-year . jail term for driving into Cameron Ward - received a fresh three-year . prison sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to supply . A driver who hit and killed a boy of five then told his victim's family 's*** happens, life goes on' has been convicted of dealing cocaine while on bail for the tragedy. Wayne Payne - already serving a five-year jail term for driving into Cameron Ward - received a fresh three-year prison sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to supply. The 31-year-old sparked outrage when he callously told Cameron’s family: 'S**t happens, life goes on' as he left Birmingham Crown Court after a court hearing last month. A judge who sentenced Payne for the drug offence condemned him as a common street dealer and said he committed the crime after being bailed in connection with Cameron’s death. Recorder Kevin Hegarty told him: 'Society takes a dim view of people dealing in class A drugs.' Phillip Beardwell, prosecuting, told Birmingham Crown Court that police found almost five grams of cocaine in a bag hidden inside a cooker at Payne’s home in Mount View, Sutton Coldfield, on October 4 last year. Officers also recovered two bags of cutting agents from a kitchen worktop, along with a set of electronic scales and £380 stashed under a rug. The three-year jail term will run consecutively to the five-year sentence imposed on Payne last month after he was found guilty of causing Cameron’s death by dangerous driving. Payne told the court he had used drugs for eight years and claimed he added a cutting agent to the cocaine to make it last longer. Payne was travelling at twice the area's legal speed limit in his Vauxhall Vectra when he hit a bike on which Cameron was sitting in Court Lane, Erdington, on April 1 last year. The . schoolboy’s father John Ward was wheeling the Paget Primary pupil along on a . pushbike ahead of mum Katie Lawrence and baby sister Ruby, who was just . four-weeks-old at the time, as the family returned from an Easter party. Payne hit . the rear of the bike, causing Cameron to be flung into the air. Police . and paramedics were called to the scene but the schoolboy could not be . saved. Mr . Ward, 37, said he had seen the lights of a vehicle about 200 metres . away and had gone out into the road between two parked cars. Cameron Ward was tragically killed when he was hit by Payne, who was driving 61mph in a 30mph area . Cameron was hit from behind while on his bike as he was being walked home by his mother, father and sister . Crime scene: Court Lane, Erdington, in Birmingham where Cameron was killed last year. Payne went on to callously tell Cameron's family 's*** happens, life goes on' after a court appearance last month . 'I thought it was safe to cross the road,' he said. 'It happened very quickly. It was over in seconds. 'I don't know how I got up but I did. I knew he was dead. I wanted to disappear. Cameron was my life and I had lost him.' A jury took just 45 minutes to convict Payne of the motoring offence. The trial heard Payne, who was also banned from driving for five years, was travelling at 61mph in a 30mph zone and he had not braked before the collision.","Wayne Payne hit and killed Cameron Ward and told family: 's*** happens'

"By . Richard Spillett . Eric Baker has spoken of the 'bitter irony' at surviving war-zoned but losing his leg to an accident in his own home . A Falklands War veteran who survived the Battle of Goose Green has been forced to have his leg amputated after stubbing his toe in a cruel accident at home. Ex-paratrooper Eric Baker, 67, survived war-zones and left the forces with the rank of colour sergeant following his service in the South Atlantic. He has spoken of the 'bitter irony' after he was severely injured when he slipped and stubbed his toe on a bed post at his home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Mr Baker was initially prescribed antibiotics after the accident, but the infection worsened and four weeks later he was still racked with pain and had to be rushed to hospital. Doctors said Mr Baker had gangrene after breaking a bone in his right foot. The decision was taken to amputate part of his leg to save his life. He remained in hospital for 10 weeks and had to return later to have a further five inches of his leg removed because the gangrene had continued to spread. He said: 'As soon as they came in they told me they knew I had gangrene because they could smell it. I went into hospital and within four days they had amputated my leg to below the knee. 'I was at Goose Green and worked my way up through the ranks of the army and became a colour sergeant but now I'm trapped.' Mr Baker, who at his peak could run a four-minute mile, says he is now a prisoner in his own home until adaptations are carried out to help him. He has hit out at his local council for failing to carry out the required work despite weeks of waiting. He added: 'Since January I haven't been able to leave my house, other than to go into hospital. The things I've seen - young blokes being blown up. I saw one of my friends getting shot in the neck three times. 'Now if there was a fire I probably wouldn't make it out alive because I can't get out of my house.' After initially being given a course of antibiotics, Mr Baker needed 10 weeks in hospital to treat gangrene . Mr Baker, who worked as a plant operator after leaving the army in 1985, is now reliant on help from neighbour Nicola Cheshire and a carer and cleaner who visit regularly. Pat Higgs, Doncaster Council's assistant director of adult services said his case was now being treated as a priority. He said: 'I was extremely concerned to hear about this case, which has been brought to my attention. 'I have carried out an immediate investigation and we are contacting Mr Baker to offer out sincere apologies.' Susan Jordan, chief executive of St Leger Homes, which manages Eric's home, said: 'We take the safety of our customers very seriously and we are working closely with Doncaster Council to make sure the alterations are carried out to Mr Baker's home.'

"By . Corey Charlton . This is the moment a man attempted an 'incredibly stupid' 20ft tombstone into shallow water while sitting in a kayak. Police and the RNLI have today reacted with dismay at the images of the person tombstoning 20ft off a groyne at Brighton Beach as horrified holidaymakers watch on. Cheered on by friends, he perched in the kayak and launched himself 20ft into the shallow water below. Police and rescue services labelled this stunt at Brighton beach as 'extremely dangerous' and 'stupid' A Sussex Police spokesman said it was an 'incredibly stupid thing to do - he could have been killed or ended up in a wheelchair for the rest of his life'. The spokesman added: 'Usually it is kids jumping into the sea - this is a dangerous new development if people are going to launch themselves in kayaks.' Since 2005 there have been 20 deaths and 76 serious injuries caused by tombstoning in the UK, according to coastguard figures. A spokesman for the RNLI warned it was 'extremely dangerous' to jump into shallow water. 'You can strike your head on the seabed or hit rocks which are not always visible.' The craze involves jumping from cliffs, piers and other structures, before entering the water below in an upright position 'like a tombstone'. Emergency services have continually warned of the dangers of the craze but there continues to be fatalities every year. Last week a young man was caught on . camera attempting a 60ft leap from Royal Albert Bridge, which spans the . River Tamar between Plymouth and Saltash, Cornwall. The police warning about the dangers involved in tombstoning comes just as holiday swimming spots such as the extremely popular Brighton Beach (pictured) begin to fill up in the middle of Britain's hot summer . Last week . police along the coast in Dorset warned there could be a tragedy just . yards from where Doctor Who star David Tennant and a TV crew are . shooting a new series of the nail-biter TV show Broadchurch. Daredevil . youngsters have been tombstoning and making macho leaps up to 30ft into . the sea from the pier at West Bay, narrowly missing boats coming in and . out of Bridport Harbour. Tennant, . along with BAFTA winner Olivia Colman and the rest of the cast, are in . the Dorset holiday resort where shooting has started on a follow-up to . last year’s crime drama. With the school summer break about to start, thousands of holidaying families will flock to West Bay hoping to spot a celebrity. Nic . Lonsdale, duty watch manager for Portland Coastguard, which covers the . West Bay area, warned 'jumping from piers, cliffs, rocks or other . structures into the sea can be very dangerous'. 'What . was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by teatime due . to tidal conditions and you do not know what other hazards might be . under the surface,' he said. 'Tomb-stoning . can be dangerous for a number of reasons - water depth alters with the . tide and it may be shallower than it seems, submerged objects like rocks . may not be visible, the shock of cold water may make it difficult to . swim and strong currents can rapidly sweep people away.'","Man in kayak caught on camera tombstoning 20ft in front of cheering crowd .
