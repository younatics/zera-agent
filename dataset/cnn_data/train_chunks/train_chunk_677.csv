A young father who was told he could lose both his wife and newborn baby is celebrating after his family was allowed home together for the first time. Kyle Moynan, 26, was told that his wife Lauren’s life hung in the balance after she went into labour at 27 weeks suffering from severe pre-eclampsia. Medics told him they would have to perform an emergency Caesarean to stand any chance of saving his wife’s life - but that the couple’s daughter would probably not survive such an early birth. Kyle Moynan was warned that he might lose his wife, Lauren, and daughter, Evie, when Mrs Moynan developed pre-eclampsia and went into premature labour 27 weeks into her pregnancy . Mr Moynan was forced to give the go-ahead for emergency surgery – aware that both his wife and daughter may not survive. Although surgeons managed to stabilise Mrs Moynan, tiny baby Evie was kept in intensive care for months while doctors tried to save her. But now, they are celebrating after Evie, now seven months old, has been allowed to go home for the first time - a day Mr Moynan feared he’d never see. Mr Moynan, from Carlisle, Cumbria, said: ‘There was a time when I feared I’d never have either my wife or my baby at home again - to have them both here is amazing. ‘It was the worst experience of my life. It was so traumatic and I could do nothing but just stand there and watch while the doctors tried to save Lauren and baby Evie. ‘I was worried I was going to lose them both. Mrs Moynan's organs were starting to fail as a result of the pre-eclampsia so Evie had to be delivered by emergency C-section . Evie is pictured at home with her mother, Lauren, sisters Faye (left) and Sophie (right) and her grandmother, Barbara (far right) ‘I am just so relieved to have them both home and safe now. I am grateful to all the doctors who saved their lives.’ Mrs Moynan was rushed to the Cumberland Infirmary after going into labour in the middle of the night when she was just under six months pregnant. Doctors carried out tests and although she had not realised she was ill, Mrs Moynan was quickly diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia. The condition was so advanced that it was causing her organs to fail. Evie only weighed 1lb 3oz when she was born and her parents were warned that she might not survive . Evie (pictured with her mother) spent the first seven months of her life in hospital - she spent two months in intensive care and she still requires oxygen to help her breathe . HGV engineer Mr Moynan said: ‘Lauren was wired up in the hospital bed. It was horrendous. All I could do is just stand there and watch while the doctors rushed around. ‘There wasn’t time for them to explain what was going on, so I had to just stand there and wait. I knew it had to be serious because of the way they were rushing around but I didn’t have a clue what was happening. ‘After what felt like forever a nurse pulled me to one side and told me that Lauren’s life was in danger and in order to save her life they would have to deliver Evie.’ Distraught Mr Moynan then had to give to go-ahead for an emergency Caesarean, even though doctors warned Evie’s chance of survival were slim, and it was a massive risk. He said: ‘It was all a blur and I knew it was risky but I couldn’t face losing Lauren and Evie, so I agreed for her to be delivered. Mrs Moynan said: 'I was so ill and they were pumping me full of drugs. I had cannulas in both arms and doctors all around me. I was just terrified that I would lose my baby' Mr Moynan had to give to go-ahead for an emergency Caesarean, even though doctors warned Evie's chance of survival were slim. Image shows Evie with her mother and sisters, Faye (left) and Sophie (right) ‘We have two other daughters, Faye, eight, and Sophie, five, and I had to stay strong for them.’ Mrs Moynan said: ‘I was so ill and they were pumping me full of drugs. I had cannulas in both arms and doctors all around me. I was just terrified that I would lose my baby.’ Luckily Evie was safely delivered but weighed only a tiny 1lb 3oz and Mr Moynan only had five minutes to see his newborn before she was rushed to Newcastle’s Royal Infirmary by ambulance, where medics fought to regulate her breathing. Mrs Moynan said: ‘We didn’t know if baby Evie would survive but because I was so poorly myself I didn’t really know that much about it.’ Mrs Moynan stayed in hospital for a further two weeks and Evie was kept in an incubator in intensive care, where her life hung in the balance for two months. After Evie was born she was rushed to Newcastle's Royal Infirmary by ambulance, where medics fought to regulate her breathing . Mrs Moynan said: 'We didn't know if baby Evie would survive but because I was so poorly myself I didn't really know that much about it' The dedicated parents travelled to the hospital every day to visit baby Evie, who spent two months in intensive care and one in high dependency before being transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit at the Cumberland Infirmary, from where she has just been released. Mrs Moynan said: ‘I would never have expected something this drastic would have happened. I just woke up and I was in labour all of sudden. Kyle was at work and I was so scared- luckily he made it to the hospital just in time.’ Mrs Moynan, who works as a nursery practitioner was still working until the day Evie was born. Evie's parents visited her in the hospital every day but now, at seven months old, she has been allowed home . She said: ‘I had only just started to think about getting things for Evie- we didn’t have her room ready or any clothes for her.’ Baby Evie still has to use an oxygen canister to help her breathe but now weighs a more healthy 12lbs. Mrs Moynan said: ‘I can’t believe I was so close to losing my own life, and my baby’s. It was such a whirlwind but I am just glad we are home and safe and Evie is doing so well.’ Mr Moynan said: ‘I am thankful for all the doctors did to save Lauren’s life and miracle baby Evie is doing well at home and getting stronger every day.’ Pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women during the second half of their pregnancy. Early signs of the condition include high blood pressure and protein in the urine. As the condition becomes more advanced, further symptoms can develop. These include swelling of the feet, face and hands, a severe headache, vision problems and pain below the ribs. Pre-eclampsia affects up to five per cent of pregnancies and is severe in about one to two per cent. It is more likely during a first pregnancy, if the woman has had it in a previous pregnancy, if the woman has a family history of the condition, if the woman is over 40, or if she is carrying more than one baby. The condition is often mild but can lead to severe complications if it is not monitored and treated. The only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to deliver the baby, until this happens, some sufferers are given medication to lower their blood pressure. Although most cases of pre-eclampsia do not lead to problems, there is a risk that the mother will develop fits - these can be life threatening for the mother and baby but are rare. Occasionally, the condition can also cause the mother to suffer a stroke or organ failure. About six or seven women die from complications of pre-eclampsia in the UK every year and about 1,000 babies die as a result of the condition - usually because of complications of early delivery.

Walker fired three shots, one of which struck Slater and killed him. Jenkins was also serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of a father of six in Orlando in September 1998.

Sex offender: Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 26 offences today at Norwich Crown Court . A former BBC presenter has been found guilty of 26 child sex offences spanning two decades and faces jail. Michael Souter, 60, was found guilty of offences against seven boys aged 11-16, including indecent assault, indecency with a child and serious sexual offences. The crimes took place between 1979 and 1999. Police also confirmed today that they are investigating further claims against the presenter, who was said to use his status as a local celebrity to play on vulnerable boys. A man who claims he was raped by Souter said he thought the former BBC and Radio Clyde present was 'the best thing since sliced bread' and that he 'aspired to be part of' his world before the alleged assault, which left him 'confused' and convinced 'he was the only one'. The alleged victim - whose case has not been heard in court - said there was now 'little doubt' that there were other victims who have yet to come forward. Souter, from Loddon, Norfolk, was found guilty of the 26 counts in a hearing at Norwich Crown Court. Jurors failed to reach a verdict on one count of indecent assault and cleared him of one charge of possessing an indecent photograph. Prosecutors described Souter, who was also involved in the Scouts and a social services youth mentoring scheme, as a ‘sexual deviant’ obsessed with young boys in uniform. During the five week trial, Andrew Shaw told jurors that Souter used his celebrity status to abuse society’s most vulnerable. Mr Shaw told the court: ‘He worked in radio and television and was something of a local celebrity. ‘The significance of his work and his involvement with the scouts and social services, is that these three roles brought Mr Souter into regular contact with pliable young boys and very often pliable young boys who were among society’s most vulnerable. ‘We say Mr Souter is a deviant sexual abuser of young boys, particularly boys in uniform and those wearing shorts.’ On trial: Souter, pictured arriving at a previous hearing, said the allegations were part of a conspiracy . Souter, originally from Scotland, had denied the offences saying that he was the victim of a conspiracy in which allegations against him were made up. He had worked as a producer and presenter in both commercial and BBC radio since the mid-1970s. He had previously presented for Radio Clyde. Mr Shaw said mistakes may have been made by the authorities in the past, but added: ‘As we have seen in recent high profile cases, victims often only tell what has happened to them when they are ready to.’ The court heard that on one occasion Souter had plied an victim, a casual worker at BBC Norfolk, with alcohol. He passed out and awoke to find his trousers pulled down and Souter, who had not been drinking, molesting him. Another victim was indecently touched at a Scout camp, Mr Shaw said. The court heard how he would take boys on trips to burger restaurants and theme parks, and used his links with Norwich City Football Club to invite them to matches. After Souter was convicted, colleagues came forward to say they had long suspected him of inappropriate behaviour. A man who worked for the BBC in the 1980s said: 'One of the first rules I was told when I started at the BBC was ""never be in a room alone with Mike Souter""'. 'It didn’t come as any surprise to me when I heard he had been charged.' Another man, who was not involved in the . trial, told police in 2002 he had been raped by Souter two years earlier, at the age of 17. Local celebrity: The court heard Souter used his links with Norwich City Football Club to invite victims to matches . He claimed the presenter, a friend of his parents, had invited him to his house and got him drunk before attacking him in bed. The . man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'I met Mike through . my parents and he was a kind of mentor, helping me set up my own . business. 'I thought he was the best thing since sliced bread - his was a world I aspired to be part of. 'When he raped me I was left confused and assumed I was the only one. 'Now I know there is a larger picture and there is little doubt that there are others in my situation. 'Mike Souter is somebody who values his reputation and public image above all else. 'Now this has been dragged through the public eye, he won’t be fooling anybody anymore.' Detectives confirmed today that they are still investigating outstanding claims against Souter. Norfolk police said they have identified 595 people as witnesses, a number of whom raised concerns about Souter’s behaviour. A spokeswoman said: 'Anyone who may be affected by anything raised during this trial can contact police. Norfolk Constabulary is committed to working with partner agencies to prevent child sexual exploitation, support victims and bring offenders to justice.'","Michael Souter, 60, was found guilty of indecent assault, indecency with a child and serious sexual offences at Norwich Crown Court .

Shamed: Alan Crickmore (pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court today) was suspended from practising as a solicitor in December 2010 . One of Britain’s longest serving coroners was today facing jail after he admitted plundering £2million from the estates of the dead. Alan Crickmore, 57, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, stole the money in a 'frenzied attempt' to balance the books at his law firm. He was first arrested in January 2011 after a probe into irregularities at his practice by police, who had only found out about the allegations following a report in a local newspaper. The former Gloucestershire coroner admitted 16 counts of theft, seven of . fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud between 1999 and 2011 at . Southwark Crown Court in London. After a career spanning 30 years, he was suspended from practising as a solicitor in December 2010, and shortly afterwards ceased acting in his role as coroner of Gloucestershire. Since his suspension he is still being paid a £60,000-a-year salary by his firm, it emerged. Crickmore became Gloucester deputy coroner in 1990, took over as the city coroner in 2002, and three years later was coroner for the Cotswolds. He then combined the two jobs to become the first coroner to cover all of Gloucestershire. He also deceived trustees who were clueless about financial matters, the court heard today. He embarked on an ‘absolutely chronic’ campaign of deceit from 1999 to 2011. Crickmore even took out a bogus mortgage on a property in Stiffkey, Norfolk, after he was ordered to repay £212,000 he stole from trustee Judith Lorman following a high court judgement. Dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and purple tie, Crickmore appeared to be close to tears as he admitted 16 counts of theft, seven counts of fraud by abuse of position and a further count of fraud. Hearing: Crickmore admitted 16 counts of theft, seven of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud between 1999 and 2011 at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) in Central London . Mark Fenhalls, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr Crickmore is a 57-year-old man who qualified as a solicitor in the 1980s and has been in practice in Gloucester since 1992. ‘He stole in various different ways about £2million from clients. All of the money was stolen from clients either from their estates if they died or clients who were unable to understand.’ Crickmore plundered the estates of the late Kenneth Layton Goodwin, Josef Dziuma, Elizabeth Iles and Peter Mitchell. He also conned Mrs Lorman and her son, Simon, as well as Claire Wilson and Sylvia Jones. Edward Henry, defending Crickmore, said he had been ‘in a trap of his own making for years’, resulting in a significant effect on his mental and physical health. ‘He became a fraud to himself before he became a conman, I regret to submit, to his clients. ‘He embarked on a frenzied attempt to balance the books and this was absolutely chronic over a period of over a decade. He has a significant history of depression and is completely broken by this. ‘He was made bankrupt in 2011 and discharged from bankruptcy in 2012 only because all of his assets were restrained for the purposes of confiscation.

From chipmunks to Mediterranean spiders, animals are evolving to cope with the effects of hotter temperatures, a scientist has claimed. DNA evidence suggests the European wasp spider is evolving into a new form and is moving to cooler regions to set up home in parts of northern Europe, while chipmunks living in Yosemite park in California are moving to higher, cooler altitudes, a biologist claims. The scientist believes that the changes are due to the effects of global warming and as habitats move, populations of animals that have previously not crossed paths, are mixing and have the potential to spread and adapt in new ways. Scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in Yosemite National Park and found that over 100 years, the animals have moved to higher altitudes as the average temperature of the park has risen by three degrees Celsius . Systems biologist Michael White, of the Department of Genetics and the Centre for Genome Sciences and . Systems Biology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said animals are already feeling the heat from global warming and are having to adapt. Writing for Pacific Standard, he said scientists tracking the movements of animals have repeatedly found that plants and animals have altered their behaviour in response to earlier springs and milder temperatures by moving to higher latitudes and altitudes. Dr White said global warming is in . effect a large evolutionary experiment that is causing huge genetic . changes as creatures rapidly adapt or become extinct. With lots of land and marine creatures moving into new territories, scientists are concerned about what will happen when they meet, as it could dramatically change ecosystems and food chains. They are turning to genetics to try and predict the present and future impact of global warming, by studying DNA in a scientific field called landscape genetics. Dr White cited the work of a team of scientists at the University of California-Berkeley as an example of how creatures are adapting to warmer temperatures. Dr White said scientists tracking the movements of animals have repeatedly found that plants and animals have altered their behaviour in response to earlier springs and milder temperatures by moving to higher latitudes and altitudes . The scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in Yosemite National Park and found that over 100 years the animals have moved to higher altitudes as the average temperature of the park has risen by three degrees Celsius. While there is an argument that the creatures are adapting to global warming, their numbers in the area have declined, causing some experts to question if they are simply on a fast-track to extinction in the region. The researchers compared DNA from historical specimens of the species collected in 1915 with contemporary chipmunks and discovered evidence of genetic erosion. In effect, the alpine chipmunk population is breaking up into isolated, genetically-limited groups and losing diversity in their DNA, which makes them more vulnerable to disease and natural disasters such as drought. 'The chipmunks' poor prospects are evident in their genes,' wrote Dr White. DNA evidence suggests the European wasp spider (pictured) is evolving and has colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates. The spiders primarily lived in Mediterranean regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic region . DNA evidence also suggests the European wasp spider is evolving and have colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates. The spiders primarily lived in Mediterranean regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic region. Interestingly while scientists thought they were trying to find new places to live that were the same temperature as the Mediterranean before temperatures have risen, the spiders have actually moved into regions that are cooler than their original homes. The reason for their behaviour is they have been mating with spiders that like the cold, to create an invading species that can survive freezing temperatures that would kill its Mediterranean relatives, researchers from Germany's Max Plank Institute told Dr White. They believe this cross-breeding is taking place as populations of spiders are mixing in regions where they would never have met before.","Biologist Michael White of the Washington University School of Medicine said animals that have previously not crossed paths are breeding to adapt .

Crime has fallen to its lowest level since records began more than 30 years ago, official figures revealed today. There were about 8.5 million crimes last year, down 7 per cent despite cuts to police budgets. But there was a nine per cent rise in reports of sexual offences, in part blamed on the inquiry into abusers like Jimmy Savile encouraging victims to come forward. Record low: The number of crimes reported to the annual survey in England and Wales fell seven per cent to 8.5million in the year to June . Based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales there were just over 8.5million crime in the year to June 2013, down from 9.1 million on the previous 12 months. It means the headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and is now less than half its peak level in 1995. Of crimes actually recorded by the police after complaints from the public, there were 3.7 million offences in the year to June, a decrease of five per cent compared with the previous year. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: ‘Police reform is working and crime is falling. ‘Recorded crime has dropped yet again, by more than 10 per cent under the coalition Government, and the crime survey says that crime has more than halved since its peak in 1995. ‘This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public.' Beat: Police have seen falls in violent crime and robberies but the number of reports of sexual offences has risen . He went on: 'England and Wales are safer than they . have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which . keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to . combat emerging issues.’ The rise in reports of sexual . offences was put partly down to greater numbers coming forward to report . historical sexual offences to the police. Cuts: Home Office minister Norman Baker said the falls i crime had been achieved at a time when police budgets were squeezed . The ONS said: ‘There is evidence to . suggest that these increases are partly a result of the Operation . Yewtree investigation, initiated in October 2012 and connected to the . Jimmy Savile inquiry. ‘Whilst some of these increases will . be a direct consequence of the crimes reported as part of Operation . Yewtree there is also evidence to suggest that there has been a wider . “Yewtree effect”1 whereby there is increased willingness on the part of . the victims to come forward and report historical sexual offences that . are not directly connected to Yewtree. ‘Additionally the publicity surrounding Operation Yewtree may have encouraged more victims to come forward and report more recent abuse cases.’ There was also a 21 per cent rise in fraud offences recorded. The ONS said the figures should be viewed in the context of a move towards the centralised recording of fraud by police. There were also increases in theft from the person, which was up eight per cent, and shoplifting, up 1 per cent. Max Chambers, head of Crime and Justice, at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘Whether you believe it’s as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family. ‘But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity. ‘While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable.’","8.5million crimes reported in year to June, down 7% on 2012 .

A black Saturday Night Live actor fed up with the show’s years long lack of any black female cast members says he refuses to dress in drag to fill the gap. Kenan Thompson played many notable black women like Whoopi Goldberg during his first seven seasons on SNL but, as he show enters its sixth straight year without a black woman, Thompson says someone else can pick up the slack. With just one other black man in this season’s cast and with six new cast members—all of them white—the person who will play this year’s Whoopis and Oprahs and Michelle Obamas remains to be seen. SNL cast member Kenan Thompson has played many women, including Whoopi Goldberg, but this week he said no more. In protest of his show's lack of female black women, he won't fill the void . In a chat with TV Guide, Keenan suggested there’s a lack of top-notch black female talent making it to SNL auditions. ‘It's just a tough part of the business,’ Thompson says. ‘Like in auditions, they just never find ones that are ready.’ Over its nearly 40 years on the air, SNL has had a grand total of four black women on its cast: Yvonne Hudson, Danitra Vance, Ellen Cleghorne and Maya Rudolph. After Rudolph’s departure in 2007, the show lacked a female of color and has ever since. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right. She was on for one season in 1980-1982. Danitra Vance, left, spent the 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . For critics of the show’s casting habits, the most recent selection of six new cast members, all of them white and only one of them female, was salt in the wound. Thompson’s refusal to wear drag in order to fill the void leaves viewers wondering who will and even Thompson doesn’t have the answer. Token? In the midst of the furor over the show's recent casting of six more people, all white, SNL announced Kerry Washington would host in November. She'll be only the 5th woman of color to host since season 35 . ‘I don't know. We just haven't done them,’ he said. ‘Maybe [Jay Pharaoh] will do it or something, but even he doesn't really want to do it.’ Thompson and Pharaoh are the only two black cast members in this, the 39th SNL season. In the wake of the scandal, SNL made a conspicuously timed announcement: Kerry Washington, the black star of hit show Scandal, will host the show in November. But whether producers made the hosting choice to placate critics seeing red because of so much white on SNL, booking Washington doesn’t change the makeup of the cast. And over the course of the last 90 episodes of the classic comedy series, only four women of color—two of them black and two Latinas—have been tapped as hosts. There is hope for black comediennes, however. Jay Pharaoh suggest to theGrio that Thompson is wrong and that the talent is definitely out there. ‘They need to pay attention,’ Pharaoh said as he described the comedy chops of black actress Darmirra Brunson and called out SNL casting directors. ‘Why do I think she should be on the show? Because she's black first of all, and she's really talented. She's amazing. She needs to be on SNL. I said it. And I believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year.’ They're out there: While Thompson says talented black women aren't auditioning, his only black castmate Jay Pharaoh says actress Darmirra Brunson (left and right playing Beyonce and Rihanna) would be the perfect SNL addition .","Kenan Thompson has played Whoopi Goldberg, Star Jones, and Bobbi Kristina Brown .

The mysterious British artist is staging a month-long 'residency' in New York City carrying out a project called Better Out Than In. However, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said defacing people's property is not his definition of art. Speaking at a press conference, he said: 'I'll leave it up to our Department of Cultural Affairs.

Banksy, a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of Bristol and whose real identity is unknown, has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world, known for his trademark spray-paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary. His artwork can sell for six figure sums. He surprised even the most ardent fans earlier this week by secretly selling his authentic artworks near Central Park for just $60 each on Saturday. The artwork stand opened about midday with an inventory value estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

A man takes a picture of Banksy's latest piece of work in New York - the Twin Towers accompanied with an orange flower . Each small to medium-sized canvas is worth at least $30,000. Yet over seven hours, just three people bought eight canvases - a total haul of $420. The first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount. Half an hour later, a New Zealand woman purchased some art. Video shows the vendor embracing her warmly and kissing her cheek. At 5.30pm, a Chicago man stopped saying he wanted art for his new house: 'I just need something for the walls.' He left with four original Banksys. The disinterested-looking vendor shut up shop at 6.30pm. Each day during his Better Out Than In residency, Banksy has posted a snapshot of his latest project and includes the location for fans to check out. The work varies from simple stencils to large, detailed murals. But four pieces of work have so far been destroyed by vandals. Ruined: A Banksy artwork which was destroyed by vandals last week . Omar NYC: Omar NYC is another graffiti artist who isn't thrilled Banksy is in New York this month . Rat: The vandal who tagged this Banksy piece left the message, 'We don't need no more rats!' The latest hit were a stencil on the side of a building in Woodside, Queens, and a car that was part of an installation on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side. The Ludlow Street piece includes an actual car parked in front of a wall covered in horses wearing what appear to be night-vision goggles. On Friday, a beaver stenciled on a wall in Brooklyn by the elusive artist also was damaged. The piece, which depicted a beaver leaning up against a railing, was covered with spray paint that read 'we don't need no more rats!' in red capital letters. The beaver's face also had been chipped off. Popular: Banksy's signature humour is at home on the streets of New York and his graffiti has attracted a swarm of attention .

The men refused to answer when Henry . asked where Banksy is, although he tweeted that he thought the man on . top of the truck might be him since as he was directing the others and . spoke with an English accent. The photographs were taken by twitter user @DjJonHenry/Twitter who believes that the man on top of the van could be Banksy because he spoke with an English accent . After his rather provocative declaration to having found Banksy, Henry then backtracked on his claims after receiving a deluge of negative tweets from fans of the street artist who accused him of trying to jeopardize the remainder of Banksy's month-long show. Although the artist has never confirmed his identity, his real name is believed to be Robin Gunningham and he is from Bristol, England. Previously photographs purporting to show Banksy were taken in Santa Monica in 2011 and East London in 2007.

His owner’s mother Kate Partridge said she could not believe her ears when she took the call - though she admitted that Pablo - nicknamed Six Dinner Sid after a children's book - has always been a 'character'. Before he made his road trip, Pablo was well known in Brockley, where dogs crossed the street to avoid him and he would force motorists to drive round him by sitting in the road. Just like the children’s book character Six Dinner Sid, he also had several houses he visited to be fed. He was known by different names including Betty and Fluffy, and he had his own chair in the home of an elderly neighbour. Office manager Ms Partridge, 59, said: 'None of us can believe it. I can’t get over it. 'Pablo has always been a Six Dinner Sid, but he has surpassed Sid this time. 'I was just thinking on Thursday that it must be a year since he was last seen. On Friday afternoon I had a call from a vet in Rosyth saying he had just been handed in. 'How on earth had he got over 400 miles from Lewisham and where has he been for the last year?' Staff at Cats Protection are now planning to arrange for Pablo to be flown back to London to be reunited with Kate and daughter Siobhan. Pablo joined the family eight years ago, when he used to go to their home and be fed before disappearing again. Eventually Ms Campbell, 33, an art teacher and mother-of-two, decided to give him a permanent home and had him neutered and microchipped, but he did not curb his wandering ways. The nine-year-old silver tabby turned up in Rosyth this week, more than 400 miles and a year after he went missing from his home in London . The travelling tom disappeared from his home in Lewisham last October and has been missing so long his owners thought he was dead . She added: 'He was always a character and a Six Dinner Sid, for those who know the children’s story. 'He used to sit in the middle of her road and cars would go round him, he hated dogs so they would cross the road to avoid him and he had several names - Fluffy, Betty and apparently someone thought Betty was pregnant. 'He also used to hang around the old people’s home in her street and had his own chair in the home of an elderly neighbour.' Pablo’s disappearances became more frequent after Ms Campbell’s son Caolan was born three years ago, and last October he vanished altogether. The family searched all his usual haunts before giving up, convinced he was dead. Luckily Doreen King, who works at the Vetrica surgery in Rosyth, had been asked to give Pablo the once-over and check him for a microchip after he had been handed to Cats Protection. The tabby had learned how to operate the door of the nearby TSB bank, and had been going inside to sleep on the chairs left out for customers. She said: 'He had been staying in the bank, as he had learned how to open the doors and was going in and lying on the chairs. 'They brought him in and I scanned him. At first when I saw the phone number and address I thought maybe they had moved up but when I got in contact with the owners they were still in London. But last week the cat strolled into a branch of TSB bank in Rosyth, Fife, after learning how to activate the automatic door . 'They thought he was dead. They had not seen him for a year. 'She was absolutely in shock. I phoned and said do you have a silver tabby called Pablo, and I told her that we had got him. 'She asked where we were, and I heard her shouting her husband and saying ""They’ve found Pablo and he’s in Scotland"". 'He must have jumped in a van or a lorry. 'He was in pretty good condition. I think somebody had been looking after him. He is really nice and friendly.' Staff at Cats Protection are now trying to arrange to fly Pablo back home, but they still have no idea how he made it all the way to Fife. The most likely theory is that he hopped into a lorry or removal van which was travelling north. But the most pressing problem now facing Pablo’s owners is how to keep tabs on him once he is back in his old neighbourhood. Ms Partridge added: 'If Siobhan was driving home and saw him up the road she would stop the car and he would jump in. He must have done something like that. 'We’re absolutely overjoyed to be getting him back, but it’s going to be hard keeping him in. 'There is another Six Dinner Sid book about Six Dinner Sid going to the Highlands. I think Pablo must have read them.'","9-year-old silver tabby Pablo disappeared from south London, last October .

Children who spend time in day care centres or with childminders are more likely to have behavioural issues such as hyperactivity, researchers have found. Youngsters who were cared for away from their parents also had a higher chance of ‘peer problems’, said Oxford University experts. The strongest and most consistent influences on behaviour came from the home environment and the level of care given by mothers, they claimed. Children who are cared for away from their parents had a higher chance of 'peer problems', the study found . Researchers set out to examine how different types of care influence child behaviour following the ‘dramatic increase’ in working mothers in recent decades. ‘Spending more time in day care centres, over the total period was a predictor of total problem scores,’ said Professor Alan Stein, of the university’s Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. However, children who spent more time in pre-school playgroups had fewer problems with their peers. And more time with a nanny produced better ‘prosocial behaviour’ – showing willingness to help others. The study authors, writing in the journal Child: Care, Health and Development, said: ‘Children who spent more time in day care centres were more likely to be hyperactive. ‘Children receiving more care by childminders were more likely to have peer problems. ‘The findings in relation to childminding suggest that it might be out of home care rather than group care that raises the risk of behavioural difficulties.’ They concluded: ‘These findings suggest that interventions to enhance children’s emotional and behavioural development might best focus on supporting families and augmenting the quality of care in the home.’ Researchers found the strongest and most consistent influences on behaviour came from mothers . The authors said the 2010 Marmot report on health inequalities had highlighted the importance of children’s early experiences in influencing their later emotional and behavioural development. Their study looked at 991 families recruited when the children were three months old. All the mothers were over 16 at birth with an average age of 30. Assessments were made around 51 months, when the children were at school entry age, through questionnaires about their behaviour and emotions completed by both teachers and parents. Researchers also carried out direct observations of caregiving provided by mothers and observed non-parental care for at least 90 minutes for children placed in other forms of care. The total number of hours in some kind of care away from the child’s mother was not related to the overall levels of problems, whether rated by mothers or teachers. However, it remained the case that children who received more group care in day care centres had more behavioural difficulties, according to both their mothers and teachers. Teacher assessments showed children who spent more time in day care centres had 'more total problems and more conduct problems.' Children spending more time with childminders were also rated as having higher levels of total problems. 'The findings in relation to childminding suggest that it might be out of home care rather than group care that raises the risk of behavioural difficulties,' the authors said.","Oxford University study found home environment provides most consistent influence on behaviour .

Parents who fail to teach their children right from wrong are at the root of Britain’s biggest problems, Ofsted’s chief inspector has said. Sir Michael Wilshaw attacked ‘hollowed out and fragmented families’ where parents suffer a ‘poverty of accountability’. He said child abuse and neglect were not the fault of councils alone. Such issues were the product of social breakdown. Sir Michael warned that the problems exposed in child abuse scandals were being deepened by an apparent national obsession with ‘pussyfooting around’ and ‘making excuses’ for bad parents. He said many children were ‘alienated’ from their natural father and that this lay at the root of the wider problems. ‘Some people will tell you that social breakdown is the result of material poverty – it’s more than this,’ he said. ‘These children lack more than money: They lack parents who take responsibility for seeing them raised well. It is this poverty of accountability which costs them. ‘These children suffer because they are not given clear rules or boundaries, have few secure or safe attachments at home, and little understanding of the difference between right and wrong behaviour. ‘If we believe that the family is the great educator – and I certainly do believe that – and the community the great support system, then we as a society should worry deeply about the hollowing out and fragmentation of both.’ He spoke as Ofsted’s first report on England’s 152 children’s services departments found 20 areas where children are poorly protected. He said Birmingham was one of the worst places to grow up in the developed world. The city recently published a review of the murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams by his mother in 2011. His comments come after a review of the death of two-year-old Keanu Williams was published . Sir Michael said: ‘It is an absolute disgrace and government needs to look at this with real urgency. 'Why is it that nearly a third of children in the city live in households on low incomes? ‘Why is it that infant mortality is almost twice the national average, worse than in Cuba and on a par with Latvia and Chile? ‘These are shocking statistics and a national disgrace. They are a testament to failure of corporate governance on a grand scale. 'What is shocking is that this is the city council with responsibility for more children than any other, our second city, the largest unitary local authority in the country. 'This is a city that should be nipping at London’s heels for power, status and influence.’ 'Sir Michael said children’s services had been undermined because one in three of the country’s departmental directors have either quit or been sacked in the past year – 50 out of the total of 152. ‘Incompetent and ineffective leadership must be addressed quickly,’ he added. ‘But where those in leadership positions have capacity and potential, this must be recognised and nurtured.’ The report found 86 of the 152 councils had children’s services that were ‘less than good’. The 20 judged inadequate were Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston on Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset. A spokesman for Birmingham council said: ‘This is a long-standing problem which we acknowledge.‘While we can only agree with the seriousness of what Sir Michael has said – indeed we have said it ourselves – we now need improvement rather than further diagnosis.’","Oftsed chief inspector said child abuse and neglect were the product of social breakdown .

Molly Clegg, who is just 18, from Lincolnshire, has used her university fund to buy the jewellery store where she has been working at weekends for the past year. She had just completed her A-levels and was considering going to university when the opportunity arose to take over Murano Silver in Market Deeping. Molly Clegg, who is just 18, has used her university savings fund to buy the jewellery store where she worked . Molly, who has dreamt of working in the shop since she was a child, was thrilled when she managed to buy the business from her boss and is looking forward to a glittering career. 'The shop opened when I was 10 and I used to go in and buy earrings with my pocket money, then I managed to get a Saturday job there about a year ago,' said Molly. 'I had considered going to university, but I couldn't decide what to study and when the opportunity came up to buy the shop I knew it was what I really wanted to do. 'I feel incredibly lucky and love it so much, I don't feel I am missing out by not going to university. I'm learning a huge amount on the job.' The money used to buy the shop was a combination of Molly's savings and ten years' worth of savings from her parents. Her father is an engineer and her mother is a housewife. The money was in a joint fund intended for university. Molly bought the business name, domain name, assets, and is paying a lease on the shop. Molly has been working at the shop at weekends for the past year . Molly left school with four A-levels and has always been entrepreneurial. When she was 13 she started making bead necklaces and bracelets to sell to her friends. She now sells her own designs, under the label Made by Molly, as well as classic silver pieces and unusual mixed metal jewellery. 'I have always loved jewellery and started making it out of kits when I was just six,' she said. 'As I go older I began designing my own and realised it was quite good, so I sold it to my friends. 'I love the fact that a piece of jewellery can change a whole outfit. You could wear a plain T-shirt but if you added a statement piece it could look completely different.' Molly admits that running the shop is very different to working there as a Saturday girl and now has to meet with suppliers, order stock and monitor sales. But she is enjoying being her own boss.

My friends all think it's great and are looking forward to seeing the shop when they're back from university.' Molly said some of her suppliers have been surprised about her young age. She added: 'I went to one showroom and they looked at me a bit puzzled, but I guess that's kind of understandable because not a lot of people my age are in my situation.'","Molly Clegg, 18, used university fund to buy jewellery shop business .

The man who shot First Amendment advocate and Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt is scheduled to be executed in Missouri next month - much to the dismay of the longtime porn-peddler. Mr. Flynt - who was paralyzed from the waist down as a result of the shooting - doesn't want the state to execute Joseph Paul Franklin, the suspected shooter and convicted serial killer. Rather, Mr. Flynt 'would love an hour in a room with him and a pair of wire-cutters and pliers.' Mr. Flynt says he wants to ' inflict the same damage on him that he inflicted on me,' but that he doesn't think the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for Mr. Franklin - or anyone else. Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death . Killer: Joseph Paul Franklin is suspected of shooting Flynt and has been convicted of murdering six people . 'As I see it, the sole motivating factor behind the death penalty is . vengeance, not justice, and I firmly believe that a government that . forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of . killing people itself,' Mr. Flynt wrote in an article published in The Hollywood Reporter. Mr. Franklin was never convicted of shooting Flynt. However, he confessed to the shooting, and the majority of law enforcement officials involved in the case - as well as Mr. Flynt - believe he is telling the truth. Mr. Franklin - a self-described racist - said his motive for shooting Flynt was retribution for publishing images of interracial sex in Hustler. Interracial relationships were the prime motivation for the majority of the killings during Mr. Franklin's four-year crime spree, which stretched from 1976 to his arrest in 1980. Paralyzed: Flynt was shot in 1978. The bullet severed his spinal cord and he's been paralyzed from the waist down ever since . In all, Mr. Franklin was convicted of six murders, but he has confessed to eight. Law enforcement officials, however, believe he could be involved in more than 20. In addition to the murders, Mr. Franklin has confessed to the fire-bombings of multiple synagogues. Mr. Flynt isn't Mr. Franklin's only high-profile victim - in 1980, he shot Vernon Jordan, a civil rights activist and adviser to President Bill Clinton. After his arrest, Mr. Franklin told investigators that he had planned to kill President Jimmy Carter and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. He said he opted not to kill Mr. Jackson after determining that his security detail would make it too difficult. Activist: Multiple obscenity charges have turned Flynt into one of the most outspoken free-speech activists in America . Many of Mr. Franklin's murders were sniper attacks from distances up to 1,000 feet. He meticulously planned the murders to ensure that he could escape without a trace. He was arrested when he was selling blood in Florida and a nurse noticed a large eagle tattoo on his arm that had been publicized as belonging to the suspect in several murders. Mr. Franklin currently is serving six life sentences. His death sentence was handed down in the murder of Gerald Gordon, a Jewish man who was leaving a synagogue when Mr. Franklin shot him and two others.

George Osborne has signed a deal with China which opens the doors for investors to take control of British nuclear power plants . China could take control of British nuclear plants after Chancellor George Osborne signed a deal today to get investors to help pay billions to replace ageing reactors. During his visit to China, Osborne said the two countries had signed a memorandum of understanding on nuclear cooperation that included roles for British companies in China's nuclear sector, which is the fastest growing in the world. 'While any initial Chinese stake in a nuclear power project is likely to be a minority stake, over time stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes,' a statement from the UK Treasury said. The memorandum also covers training in Britain for Chinese technicians, it said. Chinese nuclear companies have expressed an interest in building in Britain, but until today's announcement it was unclear whether the British government would welcome China's participation. The government said this week it was 'extremely close' to a deal with French energy company EDF related to building Britain's first new nuclear power station since 1995, a project which is likely to involve China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). That deal centres on a 35-year contract guaranteeing EDF and its potential partners an electricity price for the power from the new plant of at £92.5 per megawatt hour, roughly double the current wholesale price, the Wall Street Journal reported. A spokesman for the UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change said the talks were ongoing. Osborne's statement did not refer to the EDF project but his announcement was made at the Taishan nuclear power plant in southern China, which is a collaboration between EDF and CGNPG. Britain aims to renew ageing nuclear power plants that are going out of service but it needs foreign investment to pay the huge upfront costs involved. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said Chinese investment in the UK electricity market is 'welcome' Britain's shrinking power capacity could lead to blackouts during the winter of next year, a report prepared for an advisory body to the prime minister warned today. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said on Sunday he expected nuclear investments from South Korea as well as China, Japan and France. Pictured: Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station. Britain aims to renew ageing nuclear power plants but needs foreign investment to pay the huge upfront costs . Last year, Japan's Hitachi bought a new nuclear joint venture company from Germany's RWE and E.ON , underlining interest from Asian firms in entering Britain's nuclear industry. Last month, Britain also signed a cooperation agreement with Russian nuclear conglomerate Rosatom. Britain has shortlisted eight sites that can house new nuclear plants, two of which are owned by Hitachi, one by a joint venture between GDF Suez and Iberdrola and the remainder by EDF.

The unit’s creation came after the Allies suffered heavy losses and had to be evacuated from Dunkirk in northern France in mid-1940.

Shannon 'Bear' Cothran was working alone at a New Hampshire Shell outlet when he was threatened by a knife-wielding man demanding money about 3am yesterday. When Cothran pulled out his Ruger LCP .380 handgun, the masked would-be thief fled the Nashua station and is on the run from police.

'I took several steps . back, produced my sidearm, and informed him it was a bad idea and he . didn’t want to do it, and he left.' While Cothran said the move saved his life and the company's money, his employer didn't see it that way.

Now out of a job, Cothran said he hopes the company 'rethinks its policy' of prohibiting weapons. 'My one hope for all of this is that . they rethink their policy about not permitting cashiers to protect . themselves. I realize it's a liability for the company,' he told Nashua Telegraph. 'But I'm hoping they rethink their policy . of letting employees who are licensed to carry concealed weapons do so. I hope they look at this and realize there was no monetary loss to the . store, no injuries and that because I am a reasonable human being and a . responsible gun owner, they benefited.' Scene: This is the Shell gas station at 301 Main St. in Nashua, New Hampshire, where Shannon Cothran halted a robbery . Cothran, a former bouncer, stands by his decision to protect himself.

A Palm Beach County, Florida driver of a bus for the disabled has been fired after video emerged of him tying up an autistic man with a seat belt on Monday. Ilem Mintor says the unidentified 20-year-old just wouldn't stop opening the door of the vehicle, so he decided to act. While what he did has now cost him his job and there's video proof of him tying up and cursing at the man, Mintor maintains he did nothing wrong. Scroll down for video... Evidence: Video shows driver of a Florida handicap bus Ilem Mintor yelling at a 20-year-old autistic man, then pointing and cussing at him, before reaching for the vehicle's seatbelt . Cruel? Mintor clearly then ties up the unidentified man, while continuing to yell. Since the footage has emerged, Mintor has been fired from Palm Beach County's Metro Mobile . Mintor told WPBF news that the man repeatedly tried opening the door of the bus and passersby even yelled for him to call police. That's when Mintor pulled over and 18-year-old Amanda Tourino pulled out her cell phone and began recording the incident. Footage clearly shows Mintor pointing and cursing at the boy. He then can clearly be seen wrapping a seat belt around the boy's wrists, binding them together. Mintor defended himself in an interview with WPBF. 'I say, ""Don't do that, man,""' Mintor . recalled to WPBF. 'And I grabbed a seat belt. I say, ""If you keep doing . that, I'm gonna wrap your hand and take you back home like this."" I'm . just giving him the pressure now.' Defense: Mintor maintains that he did nothing wrong and says even passersby were yelling for him to call police as the man tried to open the vehicle door . But the video proves it was more than pressure and after Mintor bosses at Palm Tran and Metro Mobility saw the footage, he was fired. 'Metro Mobility is shocked by the actions that this driver took,' said attorney Neil Schiller said. 'In no way, shape or form does Metro Mobility endorse what the driver did. It's actually the opposite.' 'If I drive down the road and he fell out and another car hit him, what you gonna say,' asked Mintor in his own defense. Meanwhile, Tourino's mother said the only reason Amanda recorded the footage is because she told her to. According to Leigh Tourino, her daughter had complained about Mintor before. Tourino told her daughter to take out her phone and hit record if anything suspicious happened again. 'She did a good job,' Tourino told WPTV. 'She did a good job': Leigh Tourino, mother of the 18-year-old autistic girl who captured the footage that got Mintor fired, says her she'd heard about problems with the driver before .","The unidentified 20-year-old autistic man was aboard a Palm Beach County, Florida handicap mobility bus .

A mother was shocked to find her baby daughter had been clutching one of the UK's most venomous spiders - after her pals identified the arachnid from the photograph she posted on Facebook. Sadie Perry spotted that her 15-month-old daughter Ava drop the spider onto the carpet and quickly snapped a picture of the creature to upload to the social networking site. Miss Perry, 27, had laughed off inquisitive daughter's fearlessness as the tot picked up the spider, until her online friends identified it as a false widow. Shocked: Mother Sadie Perry came across her little daughter Ava playing with a venomous False Widow spider . Although the spiders are not naturally agressive their fangs are capable of piercing flesh and the venom can cause a painful swelling, which in extreme cases and if left untreated can prove fatal. 'I laughed as I was never scared of . spiders, and my daughter didn't seem too bothered either,' said Miss . Perry, of Kennington, Kent. 'I hadn't heard any of the spider warnings so I took a picture and uploaded it. 'As I read 36 notifications rolling in on my Facebook, my concerns started to grow.' Wildlife . expert Owen Leyshon confirmed he was '99% sure' the spider spotted by . Miss Perry was one of the genus of Steatoda, commonly known as the false . widow. Identified: Friends of Miss Perry identified the spider as a venomous False Widow after she posted a photograph of the arachnid on Facebook . The species can be identified by it's bulbous abdomen with cream-coloured markings that are often likened to the shape of a skull. It is one of the few spiders in the UK that can inflict a bite painful to humans. The species, which has the Latin name . Steatoda Nobilis, resembles the deadly black widow spider and has been . blamed for a spate of recent bites across the UK. One victim was four-year-old Sophie Harris who was bitten by a spider, and to the horror of her mother Amy, 28, sent home from hospital without treatment. Ms Harris took Sophie to Shrewsbury . Royal Hospital, near their home in Baschurch, Shropshire, after the . wound started to swell last week. She was told to take her daughter home and give her allergy medication, but as the pain on Sophie’s back intensified, Ms Harris eventually chose to squeeze out the venom herself, which she suspected had . come from a false widow. ‘When I looked I discovered a lump of black in the middle with yellow around the outside about the size of a 5p piece,’ the mother said. She said a spider bit her but because she is four and she’s got a wild imagination I didn’t know whether to believe her. ‘I’d read all about these spider bites and showed people on online forums pictures of the wound and they were sure it was a false widow bite.' A spokesman from Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said staff did not know what had caused Sophie’s injury. Decorator Ricki Whitmore, 39, almost lost his leg when he suffered a horrific bite from Britain's most poisonous spider after disturbing a nest of false widows while working at a school. Agonising: The vicious spider bites received by four-year-old Sophie Harris from Shropshire, left, and 22-year-old footballer Steve Harris from Devon . Drastic: Surgeons were forced to slice open Ricki Whitmore's leg and flush out the venom after his thigh swelled to twice its normal size . Surgeons were forced to slice open his leg and flush out the venom after his thigh swelled to twice its normal size. Mr Whitmore, from Romford in Essex, will now have to undergo six months of specialist physiotherapy and admitted: 'I am just lucky to still have my leg'. 'There was a really sharp pain and then my leg started to throb,' he told the Daily Star. There are fears that with temperatures outside plummeting as the winter months approach, millions of the spiders could make their way into homes across the country to escape the cold. Traditionally they were only found in the south of England, but there are nests being found in Wales and Scotland. Experts believe that the spiders my be thriving in the UK because of a wet start to the summer followed by a heatwave. Long-term climate change may also be to blame, leading spiders to set up home in new areas. However, some experts say many sightings of false widows could in fact be the common house spider. Steve Harris, a 22-year-old  footballer from Devon also needed emergency surgery after a nasty bite from the spider. He said: 'When I woke up I had a pain in my side - a stinging feeling. I didn't take that much notice until it started swelling and the pain got worse. 'I was in agony. I have never had pain like that before in my life. It's still very painful now. I still can't sleep properly and find it virtually impossible to get in and out of a car.' Poisonous: The false widow spider . The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most poisonous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. The . Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is . spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in . southern England. This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them. HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE . The . key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it . because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To . avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the . only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the . four legs. Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods . as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has . crawled in overnight. If you have a garage store things in . plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see . inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","Mother Sadie Perry saw her baby daughter Ava clutching spider .

Only three years after she found fame on the BBC1 show, she is down to her last £200, she could lose one of her homes and her marriage has collapsed. Miss English, 34, outlined her financial plight as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages. Scroll down for videos .

The business tycoon had been seeking . to recover the cash after she lost her constructive dismissal case . against him earlier this year. Miss English wept yesterday when an East London Tribunal Service panel ruled that she should not have to repay any of the money. At . the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English . knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which . she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham. Recently, . she claimed she was making double that amount from new business . ventures, including a fashion label and an events company. But . yesterday it emerged that the mother of two has not worked since July . and is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance. Star: Lord Sugar on BBC1 show the Apprentice .

She is also facing the . prospect of having one of her homes repossessed and has seen her . marriage collapse as a result of the stress of the original case. Miss . English told the tribunal yesterday that she now only has around £200 . in her bank account and was unable to even afford a birthday present for . her son. ‘I cannot afford . to feed my kids let alone pay the mortgage – that doesn’t even matter . any more,’ she said. ‘It is my son’s birthday today but I can’t afford . to buy him anything because everything we have goes on trying to . survive. ‘A couple of weeks . ago I made an application for housing benefit and there is an interview . set up. I have no choice. 'Unless I find a contract I will not be able to . support my family any more, I am losing close to 3k a month.’ She . added: ‘One of my homes is about to be repossessed, the bailiffs are . booked on October 8. The immense pressure as a result of the tribunal, . and in particular, statements made by the respondent [Lord Sugar] . attacking my credibility has been a major contributor to the breakdown . of my marriage. Bitter row: Lord Sugar and Stella English pictured following the latter's victory on the Apprentice in 2010. She was subsequently given a role at IT supplier Viglen . Stella English married Ray Dewar (pictured) in 2011 but claims their marriage has collapsed due to stress . ‘I feel unfairly penalised for standing up to such a powerful opponent.’ Miss . English had told an original tribunal hearing that she gave up an . £85,000-a-year City job to work for Lord Sugar, but had to quit inside . six months because she felt like ‘an overpaid lackey’. She . had claimed that on her first day at work she was told: ‘The cameras . have stopped rolling now… Welcome to the real world, there is no job.’ Miss . English also said she felt ostracised while she worked at Viglen, which . supplies IT equipment to schools, universities and hospitals. But the tribunal ruled in April that there was no evidence to support her allegation that she was unfairly treated. At the time, Lord Sugar described the ruling as a victory against ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’. Yesterday, . lawyers for 66-year-old Lord Sugar insisted Miss English brought the . original legal action against him simply because she was ‘bored’ with . her day job and missed the glamour of appearing on television. But . tribunal judge George Foxwell rejected his application to recover some . of his costs, saying that Miss English truly believed she had a case.

The 85-year-old, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, now visits his wife's grave every Saturday and said he was 'proud' of the decoration including the white chippings and ornamental stone border. But he has been left angered after the council insisted the ornamental garden was too big and not in keeping with its policy. Anger: Joe Grant has said he has been left 'devastated' after the council told him this decorative border was too big . Widow: Mr Grant lost his wife Blanche last year following an 11 year battle with Alzheimer's . Mr Grant, who has tirelessly campaigned for the rights of dementia sufferers since his wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2001, said: 'I feel devastated - how has it taken a year for them to come to tell me about this?' Mr Grant said he had no way of knowing the council's regulations before he built the decorative garden at Harton Cemetery in South Shields. Mr Grant said: 'It's very sad that the council has asked me to change the grave and I'm really annoyed. 'I want Blanche to rest in peace and I'm very proud of what I've done to the grave. 'Every Saturday I go to the cemetery and chat to Blanche. It's important to me that it looks nice in honour of her.'

An incompetent thief who robbed a taxi driver at knifepoint was foiled because he had ordered the cab to his own house. Jamie O'Neill, 27, stole a £240 phone from the driver - identified only as Mr Ahmed - before walking back into his home in Walsall, West Midlands, where he was quickly caught by police. He had used his own phone to order the cab, and held Mr Ahmed at knifepoint, before making the 10-yard dash for his house. O'Neill was sentenced to four years in prison today for his crime after being branded 'stupid' by his own defence lawyer. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that O'Neill ordered the cab with his own phone around 3am on 16 August this year. He sat in the cab's passenger seat and pulled out a knife which he held under Mr Ahmed's chin. He told him to 'give me all your money'. A scuffle broke out and Mr Ahmed was able to elbow O'Neill in the face and break the knife in two. He then ran away, allowing him to make off with the phone. After O'Neill left, Mr Ahmed called the police with his taxi radio, who were quickly able to arrest the criminal. Prosecutor Joanne Barker said: 'The defendant got in without saying anything and leant forward. 'In his left hand he had a knife - he placed the knife under the driver's chin and said ""give me all your money"".' Sentencing, Judge Robin Onions said: 'Only you will know what was going through your mind. 'In some ways it's a bizarre robbery as you called the taxi to your own home. 'It was clearly a pre-planned offence and a terrifying incident for the taxi driver. 'The victim was vulnerable. Taxi drivers have to be protected, but every so often they have to put up with people like you.' Nigel Ford, defending, admitted that O'Neill's actions 'defied all logic'. He said: 'He's a very distinctive young man and on the level of stupidity it's right up there. He was always going to be immediately apprehended by police. The potential gains were limited. 'Mr O'Neill fully appreciates the position he's placed himself in.

Sandeep Singh-Dosanjh has been ordered to repay £13million to the public purse or face another ten years in jail for a VAT fraud scam . The leader of a gang of organised criminals that cheated the taxpayer out of £38million has been ordered to repay £13million or face a further ten years in prison. Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, 31, from London, was jailed for 15 years in 2012 for the massive VAT fraud scam. HM Revenue and Customs has ordered him to pay back £3million in hidden assets within three months and the remainder of the £12,887,685.47 within six months. He masterminded the scam with two friends Ranjot Singh Chahal and Navdeep Singh Gill. The gang made millions in just 69 days running a series of bogus companies trading fraudulently in EU emissions allowances - known as carbon credits. In the only case of its kind, Dosanjh and the rest of the gang stole the money through a complex 'missing trader' fraud over six months from January 2009. The law was changed to prevent carbon credit VAT fraud as a direct result of this investigation. Singh Dosanjh splashed the proceeds on luxury cars including a Rolls Royce, a Mercedes and a Range Rover and also bought a £1million home in Bayswater, west London. HMRC said he also attempted to hide further money in offshore bank accounts but they was able to identify them and that money is part of the confiscation order. Robert Alder, HMRC Criminal Investigations, said: 'Dosanjh enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, investing the proceeds of his crimes in property and luxury cars. 'This was a complex and lengthy financial investigation requiring enquires to be made with overseas authorities. 'This large confiscation order shows that HMRC is committed to not just bring criminals to justice, but also to ensure that we recover the money stolen from the taxpayer by criminals and return it to the Exchequer.' The fraud was committed by bogus companies importing the carbon credits free of VAT into the UK. They . then sold the credits on, charging VAT which was never paid to HMRC, . and then dissolved the importing companies. The credits were then sold . on again between three further 'buffer' companies – also run by the gang . – before finally being sold on to legitimate companies so the trading . chain appeared legal. The VAT charged by the 'missing trader' was then shared out between the gang. Ranjot Singh Chahal, right, was jailed for nine years and Navdeep Singh Gill, left, was sentenced to 11 years . The trades were made in a matter of minutes via a computer system, and the stolen VAT was transferred to offshore bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates to ‘clean’ the stolen cash. Confiscation proceedings are ongoing to recover further money from the other convicted defendants. Gill, of Slough, Berkshire, was sentenced to 11 years and Chahal, of Southall, Middlesex, was sentenced to nine years in prison. All three were convicted of conspiring to cheat the public revenue between September 2008 and July 2009 after a 14 week trial.","HMRC order Sandeep Singh Dosanjh to pay back money within six months .

The BBC presenter says women will never have the expertise men have . In the animal kingdom, it’s common to find gender roles clearly defined between male and female. And the world of TV wildlife presenters is no different, according to veteran BBC host Michaela Strachan. Insisting ‘you can’t fight stereotypes’, the Autumnwatch star says her male co-stars take on the role of expert – while women are simply there as ‘enthusiasts’. Risking the wrath of feminists, the 47-year-old claimed men are ‘wired’ differently, making it easier for them to learn the names and categories of animal species. Women, meanwhile, care about ‘emotional problems’, she says. As one of TV’s best-known female presenters, Miss Strachan returns to screens on October 29 for the new series of the BBC2 wildlife show alongside Chris Packham, 52, and 57-year-old Martin Hughes-Games. She said: ‘Chris’s knowledge is phenomenal. I’m not anywhere near as knowledgeable as him, particularly on birds. I remember when I took the role on. I have enthusiasm and interest, but not the knowledge that Chris does. ‘Some people might say it’s a shame that it’s a female role that’s like that, but it’s very representative of people who are interested in wildlife. Chris and I have spoken about it often. ‘If you look at birders, 90 per cent are men, 10 per cent are women. It’s the way we’re wired. Women would like to know  the emotions of a bird rather  than its name and what category it goes in. Sometimes you can’t fight stereotypes. ‘Women have their strengths and weaknesses. Men are very different, and have theirs.’ Miss Strachan said women are far more likely to be experts in scientific fields that involve the study of emotional problems rather than hard facts. She added: ‘Far more women do primates than men. Far more women run orphanages and rehabilitation centres because we’re probably better at it. I am being stereotypical, but stereotypes are there because they are an average.’ Veteran: Miss Strachan (pictured here as part of Channel 5 programme Michaela's Animal Road Trip) says women care about 'emotional problems' Presenters: Miss Strachan returns to the screen in Autumnwatch with Martin Hughes-Games and Chris Packham (pictured) The claims come weeks after her predecessor Kate Humble criticised ‘autocutie presenters’ for being obsessed with beauty, saying she was ‘a conduit for information, nothing more’. But Miss Strachan – who took over her roles on Springwatch and Autumnwatch in 2011 – defended female presenters who focus on their looks. She said: ‘It’s not very easy to do light entertainment, read off an autocue and make it work. ‘Just think of the number of people who have tried and failed. ‘People shouldn’t be so critical of people who are good looking on TV.’ Defence: Miss Strachan (pictured here in last year's Autumnwatch) says 'people shouldn't be so critical of people who are good looking on TV'","BBC host says 'you can't fight stereotypes'

Access denied: Crizotinib could benefit 1,000 patients a year but is deemed to lack evidence of benefits . A drug for prostate cancer victims who have run out of other treatment options has  been approved for use on  the NHS. Enzalutamide extends life by at least five months for men who have stopped responding to hormone treatments or chemotherapy. Doctors hope the substance – developed in the UK – will help turn prostate cancer from a killer disease into a chronic illness with much longer survival rates. Trials show men taking the drug lived for five months longer than they would have done, with almost half having a better quality of life as a result. Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments. The new drug, which is a pill taken at home, costs around £25,000 for an average course of treatment. But the manufacturer Astellas Pharma has cut the price through a patient access scheme which makes it cost-effective, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the NHS rationing body. The drug was created by British scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of the ICR said: ‘Advanced prostate cancer is very difficult to treat, and it’s taken a co-ordinated effort to finally bring new drugs into the pipeline, after decades where there were no options once old-style hormone treatment stopped working. ‘What we’re seeing now is an unprecedented period of success for prostate cancer research, with four new drugs shown to extend life in major clinical trials in just two years, and several others showing promise. ‘It truly is a golden age for prostate cancer drug discovery and development.’ Enzalutamide was assessed in 1,199 patients with advanced prostate cancer who had previously received chemotherapy. Survival with enzalutamide was 18.4 months on average, compared with 13.6 months for men receiving a placebo. Killer: Prostate cancer, pictured here under a microscope, killed men within 14 months without the new drug . Around 43 per cent of men taking the pill reported an improved quality of life, compared with 18 per cent of men taking a placebo, says a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial went so well that an independent monitoring committee recommended it be stopped early in November last year so the men who received the placebo could be offered enzalutamide. In November last year, the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended the trial be stopped early and men who received the placebo be offered enzalutamide. Owen Sharp, of Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘This is great news for men … we need clinicians to have options at their disposal to do what counts – extend the lives of men with this disease when other options have run out.’ He added: ‘The truth is that there are precious few treatments for a condition which not only seriously impinges upon the life of those with advanced disease, but kills one man each hour. This is a victory for these men today. Professor Carole Longson, of  the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at Nice, said: ‘There are few treatments available for patients at this stage in their  cancer so we are very pleased  that we are able to produce  draft guidance recommending enzalutamide.’ The drug is expected to become available on the NHS in England early next year.","Enzalutamide was approved by the NHS rationing body after a price cut .

No Army vehicle currently in service could have protected six soldiers who were killed in a fireball in Afghanistan, an officer said yesterday. Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, and Privates Anthony Frampton, 20, Daniel Wade, 20, Christopher Kershaw, 19, and Daniel Wilford, 21, all died when a massive roadside bomb ripped apart their Warrior armoured vehicle last year. The blast flipped the troop carrier over, blew off the gun turret and sent flames 100ft into the air. The six men 'unlawfully killed' in the bomb blast in Afghanistan. They are (top row left to right) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley and Private Anthony Frampton, with (bottom row left to right) Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford . But at an inquest into the soldiers’ deaths yesterday Major Douglas Nelson, an expert on the Warrior, said: . ‘This was a large device and no vehicle that we have is designed to take . that.’ Significant steps had been taken to bolster the Warrior fleet since the . tragedy, he said. But he added: ‘They [the insurgents] can always build a . bigger bomb.’ The vehicle was on a routine patrol when it was blown up . about 25 miles north of the capital of Helmand, Lashkar Gah. It was the deadliest single enemy attack on UK forces in Afghanistan since 2001. Fellow soldiers struggled to extinguish the blaze but ‘nothing could . have been done to rescue or save them’, said Oxfordshire coroner Darren . Salter. Mr Salter said: 'This of course is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives. 'At . least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and . the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer. 'It also follows that there was nothing that their comrades could have done to rescue or save them.' Mr Salter recorded a narrative verdict. Outlining the events that day, he said: 'The six soldiers were therefore unlawfully killed whilst on active service.' The vehicle was patrolling with another Warrior when it was blown up about 25 miles north of the capital of Helmand, Lashkar Gah. It . was the biggest single loss of life for British forces in Afghanistan . since an RAF Nimrod crash killed 14 people in September 2006. The inquest at Oxford Coroners' Court heard that no other vehicle of its type was designed to withstand a blast of its type. Sgt . Coupe, a member of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, and . his comrades, all members of the Yorkshire Regiment's 3rd Battalion, . died of blast injuries caused by the explosion. Mr . Salter told the court: 'I am not going to second-guess decisions of . commanders in a courtroom today, that is not the purpose of an inquest. Brian and Sharon Kershaw, the father and stepmother of Private Christopher Kershaw, arrive at Oxford Coroners Court at a previous hearing . 'These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgments.' The . inquest heard that improvements have been made to Warriors since the . incident including better armour, burst resistant fuel tanks, better . ways of getting in and out in emergencies and improved fire detection . and protection systems. The . court was told that eight new fuel tanks have been fitted so far to the . vehicles that are being used in Afghanistan, with 21 more due to have . the upgrade, and the coroner said that 'significant steps' had been . completed in making improvements to the vehicles. Mr Salter said there was no need . for a formal report under his powers because he was satisfied the areas . of concern had been addressed. Father-of-two Sgt Coupe, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire; Pte Wade, from Warrington, Cheshire, who was about to become a father; Cpl Hartley, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire; Pte Frampton and Pte Wilford, both from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire; and Pte Kershaw, from Bradford, had all been in Afghanistan for only a few weeks when they were killed. The court was told it was important to send out the patrol that day, rather than waiting until the next, because of 'force protection' and showing a visible presence to insurgents. When the order was given at 6pm to leave, Pte Kershaw 'stepped up to the mark' and volunteered to take the place of another soldier on the patrol, who was just returning from the shower, the inquest heard. Monica Kershaw, mother of Private Christopher Kershaw, holds a photograph of her son as she arrives at the inquest . The two Warriors left just after . 6.30pm, and soon after, the first Warrior detonated the IED, which was . triggered by a pressure plate. The . force of the explosion turned the Warrior on to its side and 'flicked . off' its turret, with a fire breaking out almost instantly, which then . went on to set off ammunition inside. Fellow soldiers struggled to extinguish the blaze and get into the stricken Warrior, but everyone inside was dead. Speaking after today's verdict, families of the soldiers thanked their colleagues for their efforts to save them. Pte Kershaw's mother, Monica Kershaw, said: 'This process has been one which a mother never wishes to have to undertake. I feel like I have been involved in a nightmare, from which I can never awake, leaving me emotionally drained. 'From the information we have heard at the inquest, it was a pure quirk of fate that Chris should have been kitted up and got into a patrol for which he was not intended. Monica Kershaw holds a picture of her son Christopher who died after taking the place of one of his army colleagues at the last moment . 'I am still struggling with this - but . how like him to be ready to do his duty for his fellow soldiers. How . proud I am of his call to duty.' Pte . Kershaw's father, Brian, who attended the inquest with the teenager's . stepmother, Sharon, said: 'Chris always knew what he wanted to do and . followed his heart, he did what his grandfather did and became a . soldier. 'We hope there is a lesson to be learned from this inquest that will help and protect all soldiers in the future.' Cpl Hartley's mother, Natalie Taylor, spoke of her pride in her son but hit out at politicians, saying: 'To lose your child is as painful as losing your own life. Our servicemen and women will continue to die as long as politicians who rule our lives value money more than the lives of our sons and daughters.' Pte Wade's fiancee, Emma Hickman, who has battled to have the identity of their daughter Lexie-Mai officially recognised, said the inquest had been a difficult process but was an important step in finding out what happened on March 6 last year. 'It is important to me that Lexie grows up knowing what happened to her father,' she said. 'From the struggle to establish Lexie's identity and hearing all the evidence it has been an exhausting ordeal and still we have not come to terms with our loss.' Pte Wade's mother, Lisa Billing, paid tribute to her son as a 'well-respected young man'. Pte Wilford's mother, Diane Sharples, said her son loved his Army life and was proud of his service. A statement on behalf of Pte Frampton's family, read by lawyer Michael Davison, said: 'Obviously nothing can bring Anton back but we are grateful that we have answers. 'We note the verdict the coroner has reached that Anton was killed while on active service. We feel we can take some comfort from the evidence showing that Anton did not suffer.' Lieutenant Colonel Andy Cox MBE, Chief of Staff Task Force Helmand at the time of the incident, said: 'On behalf of the Army and 12 Mechanized Brigade, I would like to pay tribute to the six outstanding soldiers who tragically lost their lives in this incident. 'These men paid the ultimate sacrifice whilst serving their country and delivering a better future for the people of Afghanistan. 'Their loss is felt keenly across the regiment and the brigade, although this cannot compare to the pain felt by their families and friends.

Gemma Howden, 28, was desperate to slim down after ballooning to a size 26. But the mother-of-three could not afford to join a gym - so she turned her home into a tough assault course. Gemma Howden, 28, weighed 19st and was a size 26 (left) before she turned her house into an assault course in a bid to lose weight. She now weighs 9st (right) and says she feels 'absolutely amazing' Ms Howden, who weighed 19st, used the baby gate at the bottom of the stairs as a hurdle to jump over hundreds of times. She also used tins of baked beans and spaghetti hoops as weights in her strict daily exercise regime. Her stairs were then turned into a stepping course and she did star jumps in front of her TV. She said: ‘I was absolutely enormous - I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror or to have my photo taken. ‘I hated the sight of myself so much I wouldn’t pose for pictures with my kids. ‘To curb my unhappiness I’d stuff myself with a Chinese takeaway for four and then tuck into a giant slab of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk.’ Ms Howden was so ashamed of her weight that she avoided having her picture taken. She decided to lose weight when she realised there were no pictures of her with her children . Ms Howden could not afford to join a gym so she turned her house into a 'boot camp' - she ran up and down the stairs, hurdled over the stair gate and used food tins as weights . Then one day as Ms Howden looked through old photo albums she realised there weren’t any pictures of her with her children. It was a turning point and the shame finally gave her the motivation to lose weight. She said: ‘I felt so sad and I realised I was too ashamed to be in pictures because I was such a fat blob. ‘I am 28 and I felt 65. I was puffing and panting everywhere. Ms Howden (pictured with her partner, John) said: 'I'd pull the curtains to stop the neighbours seeing me in action - it would have been so embarrassing. But the results have paid off and now I'm ten stone lighter' ‘But I couldn’t afford to go to the gym so I decided to turn my home into a boot camp.’ Ms Howden began a brutal regime of exercise starting by running up and down the stairs in her home in Lampeter, West Wales. She dug out the baby gate to use as a hurdle. And while her children watched TV in the lounge she would do star jumps and jog on the spot. After the children went to bed, Mrs Howden would grab large tins of beans and spaghetti - to use them as weights. Ms Howden says that before she lost weight she felt like she was 65 and that she was always out of breath. Now she says she is no longer the fat mother at the school gates . She said: ‘I’d pull the curtains to stop the neighbours seeing me in action - it would have been so embarrassing. ‘But the results have paid off and now I’m ten stone lighter. ‘Now I’m no longer the fat mother at the school gates and my kids' friends don’t make fun of me.’ Now Ms Howden weighs 9st and she has swapped her t-shirts for tight fitting dresses. She said: ‘I feel absolutely amazing. When I tell people I lost 10 stone after turning my house into a boot camp they don’t believe it. But it’s absolutely true. ‘I’m living proof that you don’t need a gym to shed the weight. A few cans of baked beans and a baby gate will do just the same job.’ Below, London-based personal trainer Sarah O'Neill shares her suggestions with MailOnline. Biceps curls - Hold a small bottle of water or a tin of food in each hand. Stand up straight and keep your elbows close to your torso with your palms facing forward. Keeping the upper arms stationary, raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the weights are at shoulder level. Then, slowly lower the weights back to the starting position. Repeat. Overhead triceps extensions - Hold a bottle of water of tin of food in both hands and lift your arms above your head. Lower your forearms behind you by bending your elbows. Avoid allowing the weight to hit the back of your neck. Raise the weight overhead again by extending the elbows. Repeat. Sit ups - Lie on the floor with your feet flat and shoulder distance apart. Place a medium-weight book on your chest and put your hands over it to hold it in place. Using your stomach muscles, bring your body up to 30 degrees before lying back down again slowly. Repeat 10 or 15 times before having a rest and starting again. Lunges - Begin with one foot on the bottom step of the stairs. Extend your other leg behind you until your weight is on the heel of the front foot and ball of the back foot, with back heel lifted. Lower the back knee straight down towards the floor and then lift up slowly to start position. Repeat 10-15 times with each leg. Advanced plank - Place your elbows on the floor then stretch your body out behind you and put your toes on the bottom step of a flight of stairs. Pull your stomach muscles in and keep your back flat. Hold this position for about 60 seconds. Running up and down the stairs - This is usually safe as long as you ensure there is nothing on the stairs that you could trip over. It is also recommended that you wear trainers to provide support. Jogging on the spot and star jumps - These are also good exercise but it is recommended that you wear trainers to support your ankles.","Gemma Howden, 28, from West Wales, weighed 19st and was a size 26 .

The victim, who was 13 when the alleged abuse started and is in her late 20s now, filed a lawsuit against Reverend Michael Jerome Keating Monday claiming 'dealing with what he did to me is an hourly battle.' She alleges he fondled her breasts, made her lie on top of him while he was aroused, woke her in the middle of the night to ask for a back rub and french kissed her. In the deeply personal emails, made . public today by the girl's lawyer, Keating expressed love and affection for . the girl, regularly signing off 'love you lots and lots' and warning her . that she will be popular with the boys because she was 'pretty and . charming.' Keating, then-44 and 30 years the girl's senior, was attending St Paul Seminary at the time, studying to be a priest. He is now an associate professor in Catholic studies at the University of St. Thomas. According to her suit, Keating 'engaged in multiple instances of unpermitted, harmful and offensive sexual contact with the girl from 1997 to 2000. She said Keating repeatedly told her he loved her and she believed she loved him. In 2004 she said confronted him about the alleged abuse. 'He twisted things so much that by the end, I was apologizing to him,' she told the TwinCities.com. '(He said) ""you're just an angry girl, and everything I've ever done has been out of love,""' she said. She said the abuse drove her to attempt suicide twice. 'The pain of the abuse didn't stop,' she said. 'What he did to me was so internally damaging that I forgot who I was.' Keating was ordained in 2002 and served as a priest at St. John the Baptist church in New Brighton from 2003 to 2005, the lawsuit states. In 2006, the woman, then 21, detailed the alleged abuse, and showed the personal emails, to archdiocese officials but the church found there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of sexual abuse of a minor. The board 'does not believe that the priest's faculties should be suspended, given his effectiveness in many areas of his work,' a summary provided to the family in 2007 stated. A concurrent police investigation was also abandoned. She described the decision as devastating. Thrown out: In 2006, the woman, then 21, detailed the alleged abuse, and showed the personal emails, to archdiocese officials but the church found there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of sexual abuse of a minor . The woman said she decided to file her suit against Keating this week after allegations involving another priest at the Twin Cities archdiocese and claims that the church had failed to report sexual misconduct. She said she felt a tremendous relief since opening up about the abuse. She said: 'I feel free. I'm not scared. I feel proud of myself. I feel excited for what it means not just for me but for other kids.' On the weekend, Keating announced that he was taking a leave from the archdiocese. He is however, still scheduled for classes at St Thomas, according tot he University's website. Neither commented on the case to TwinCities.com and Keating did not return a call made to his home on Monday. In a statement to the Star Tribune, Keating's attorney Fred Bruno on Thursday said the woman's claims 'were thoroughly discredited over six years ago.' He said at the time Father Keating passed a polygraph administered by Minnesota's 'most experienced and highly regarded law enforcement polygrapher.' 'The unfortunate grandstanding and publicity generated by the recent announcement of this lawsuit add nothing to the credibility of the claims,' he said. 'Such self-serving tactics do not promote genuine justice, and are needlessly hurtful to an esteemed member of the Catholic community and to the Church as a whole.' In a statement from the girl on Thursday, she said she had given her attorney Jeff Anderson permission to release a video testimony recorded when she came forward about the abuse in 2006. She said in the statement: 'I want the truth to be known. I want it to be understood that when the abuse started I was barely 13. I want people to know that I came to the Archdiocese with everything I had, with my whole and honest story and I feel like I begged them to hear me. The abuse itself and the way this has all been handled makes me so sad. It breaks my heart.'","The victim, who was 13 when the alleged abuse started and is in her late 20s now, filed a lawsuit against Twin Cities, Minnesota Reverend Michael Jerome Keating Monday .

"Fans of Comme de Garçons say that Whole Foods has taken inspiration from the brand's heart-shaped PLAY logo . PUBLISHED: . 16:32 EST, 15 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:57 EST, 15 October 2013 . Fans of the Comme des Garçons PLAY label are drawing similarities between its 15-year-old logo and an apple illustration on Whole Foods market’s fall shopping bag. The PLAY logo, a red heart with almond-shaped eyes, looks ‘separated at birth’ from Whole Foods’s red apple with round eyes, say Instagram users, who have taken to social media to air their opinion about the two designs’ congruencies. Neither brand has issued comment on the likeness, but that hasn’t stopped one crafty Instagrammer, artist Richard Haines, from turning the discussion into an art project. He painted the Whole Foods bag for it to better resemble Comme’s insignia. 'Separated at birth': Instagram users are pointing to similarities between Comme des Garçons PLAY's logo (L) and an apple on Whole Foods's new shopping bag (R) Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo, known for her avant garde, forward-thinking designs, launched PLAY as a sportswear-influenced, casual diffusion line in 2002. Its array of classic clothes has lined the shelves of lauded stores including Colette, 10 Corso Como, and CDG’s own Dover Street Market. The label’s quirky heart with a sinister stare has become its calling card, and holds so much commercial value that in 2009 Converse launched a collaboration with the brand. They applied PLAY’s little heart to its basic Chuck Taylor styles, changing little else, and charged $100 for per pair (twice the cost of the same Converse sneakers without a logo). The collection was such a success that the collaboration is still ongoing, four years later. Play time: Comme des Garçons PlAY's logo (L) is often included on the brand's classic, streetwear-influenced casualwear (R) Some would even say that the Comme . des Garçons heart has become an international calling card for a certain . echelon of relaxed, artistically-inclined cool. So it’s not unbelievable that the label’s legion of diehard fans would become a bit agitated by an apple resembling their favorite insignia. The two illustrations do appear similar in the way that they are both red, have cartoonish black-and-white eyes, and no mouth. It . is not clear if Whole Foods took direct inspiration from Comme des . Garçons PLAY when developing the apple shopping bag. The recycled paper . bag launched in-stores in July, a store employee told MailOnline. Representatives for both Comme des . Garçons and Whole Foods did not wish to offer comment on the matter. But . plenty of people on Instagram have. Response: Cherry Bombe magazine's Instagram dispatch about the Whole Foods bag received countless replies from the title's followers . CFDA CEO Steven Kolb used the Pic Stitch app to illustrate the similarities between the two illustrations, writing ‘separated at birth’ in the photo’s caption. Rising magazine Cherry Bombe, an independent title that fuses the worlds of food and fashion, dispatched a photo of the bag, writing: ‘Did Wholefoods get Comme des Garçons to design their new grocery bags?’ Many followers commented on the image, expressing that they had been making a comparison as well. Art project: Artist Richard Haines painted over the Whole Foods bag to make the market's apple look like the Comme heart insignia . Artist Richard Haines took the matter even further. He painted over the Whole Foods’s apple to make it look like the Comme heart. ‘The new Whole Foods apple shopping bags remind me of CdG Play,’ he wrote on an Instagram of his first take at transforming the bag, where he changed the outline of the apple’s body to look like a heart. The art project continued with an additional dispatch. ‘Collaboration Complete,’ he wrote on a new photo, taken after he used white paint to give the newly-minted Whole Foods heart a more slanted-eye, sinister, and very Comme glare.",Fans of Comme de Garçons say that Whole Foods has taken inspiration from the brand's heart-shaped PLAY logo .
"By . Misty White Sidell . PUBLISHED: . 15:26 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:41 EST, 30 September 2013 . Farewell?: Reports say that Marc Jacobs will not renew his contract at Louis Vuitton . The chatter surrounding Marc Jacobs’s contract negotiations with parent company, LVMH, intensified on Monday with solid reports that he is poised to leave the helm of Louis Vuitton. Women’s Wear Daily is reporting that Marc Jacobs is unlikely to renew his contract as creative director of Louis Vuitton. The move would allow him to focus his energies on his namesake labels. Their article corroborates similar reports published by Reuters last week. It also substantiates longstanding rumors that former Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquière could succeed Jacobs at Vuitton’s helm. Jacobs--whose signature brand Marc . Jacobs and diffusion label Marc by Marc Jacobs are also owned by . LVMH--could be leaving Vuitton in order to take his personal businesses . ‘to the next level,’ writes the paper . Which . might mean, according to sources, that Jacobs could be eying an initial . public offering—placing him in the footsteps of his design contemporary . Michael Kors, whose business, following a 2011 IPO, now holds an . approximate $15 billion market value. Jacobs’s retail sales are now reportedly estimated in the billions. In . the last sixteen years, Jacobs (who joined Louis Vuitton as creative . director in 1997--the same time at which LVMH purchased a majority stake . in his own brand), has expanded the Vuitton brand from heritage luggage . purveyor to a massive commercial entity. He . was tasked with starting the brand’s ready-to-wear business from . scratch, as well as growing the label’s overall commercial popularity . and cool quotient. Jacobs’s ten-year contract at Louis . Vuitton will reportedly end in the next few months. Fashion insiders . expected the designer’s spring 2014 runway show, debuting on Wednesday, . to be his last for the brand. But . that might not be the case. WWD writes that Jacobs ‘could be tapped to . do more Vuitton collections, including the fall show in March,’ in lieu . of signing another lengthy contract—giving the brand enough time to . negotiate employment terms with his successor. Reinventing the wheel: Jacobs's tenure at Louis Vuitton is regarded for its collaborations with famous artists (like Steven Sprouse, above) who reinvented the brand's classic monogram . However, . they report that Wednesday’s show ‘could involve retrospective or . archival elements,’ which could ‘provide a glance back at a fruitful . collaboration that helped catapult Vuitton’s—and Jacobs’—global . profile.’ Further reinforcing the fashion rumor mill, it is also being reported that Nicolas Ghesquière is indeed the front runner to replace Jacobs at Vuitton. Ghesquière’s potential appointment would follow a 15-year run as the lead designer at Balenciaga—a tenure that abruptly ended last year. If appointed at Vuitton, Ghesquière would have some big shoes to fill. In the last sixteen years, Jacobs steered the Vuitton brand through a variety of successful phases, the most fruitful of which was the brand’s obvious foothold in the ‘logo-mania’ trend of the early aughts. Through collaborations with . contemporary artists like Richard Prince and Takashi Murakami, Jacobs . was able to reinvent the classic Vuitton monogram for a new, commercial . audience. The artists’ colorful interpretations of Vuitton’s historic . DNA earned the label a strong following in brand-conscious luxury . markets like China and Japan. Both countries have accounted for a large . portion of Vuitton’s global financial success. Extra credit: Jacobs is credited with starting Louis Vuitton's ready-to-wear collection, which he fashioned into a sophisticated, taste making label (above, models walk the runway at the end of last season's Louis Vuitton show) This . past spring Jacobs sat down in conversation with New York fashion . influencer Fern Mallis as part of her discussion series at Manhattan’s . 92Y venue. When prompted, he . glossed over the rumors already surrounding his Vuitton contract . negotiations, and said that leaving Vuitton wouldn’t be an entirely bad . thing as it would provide him extra time to spend with his new dog. Not that Jacobs’s schedule would be completely unoccupied—he’d still preside over the aforementioned Marc Jacobs and Marc by Marc Jacobs brands, which expanded earlier this year to include cosmetic offerings. Jacobs took the Vuitton . responsibilities on at a time when designers (including Alexander . McQueen and John Galliano) were eager to spread their influence and financial capabilities with . lofty creative director jobs. But that expanded influence also took a . toll on many designers’ time, patience, and sobriety. Galliano recently explained in a Vanity . Fair interview that the speed of the creative cycle at Christian Dior, . as well as his John Galliano line, was the primary reason for his spiral . into alcohol and drug addiction. Out of the box: Jacobs has brought a quirky, commercial edge to the Vuitton brand, which has incited a retail craze (above, people walk by a Vuitton boutique under construction in Shanghai) Jacobs, too, has been hospitalized for drug addiction. He was last admitted to rehab in 2007, and has since adhered to a strict nutrition and exercise regimen to stay healthy. Now, at 50 years old, may not be the worst time for him to get back to the basics. His longtime business partner Robert Duffy recently admitted in an interview that the duo had begun to let the creative responsibilities of their Marc by Marc Jacobs line slide, accounting for its waning retail prominence. Duffy even said that the brand was ‘getting a little stale.’ ‘We just let it go. We rested on our laurels and it hurt us,’ he said. In the spring, they appointed quirky English designers Luella Bartley and Katie Hillier to reengineer the label—a time at which Duffy reasserted both he and Jacobs’s dedication for the label. Leaving Vuitton would allow them that focus.","Retail sales for Jacobs's own labels are now estimated in the billions .

A former U.S. Army sniper arrested in a plot of assassinate a DEA agent nearly wept and his lips quivered in his New York jail cell when his attorney visited him this week, the lawyer says. Joseph Manual Hunter was arrested in Thailand last week, accused of running an international cartel of hitmen 'straight from the pages of Tom Clancy' and plotting to murder a federal agent for $800,000. Defense attorney Marlon Kirton told a U.S. District Court judge in New York on Tuesday that he suspects his client is suffering from mental illness and possibly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from his deployment to Iraq. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kingpin: Alleged American international hitman Joseph Manuel Hunter was today extradited to the U.S. Here, he is being escorted by Thai commandos as he boards a chartered jet in Thailand . Wanted: Joseph Manuel Hunter has been on the run since June, when U.S. authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in New York . 'He has some issues related to his service,' Kirton said outside court. 'He was almost weeping.' Hunter, 48, served in the Army from 1983 until 2004. Charges against him were were . announced by prosecutors in Manhattan last week, who portrayed Hunter and . his accomplices as ex-soldiers eager to kill for money. 'That's fun, actually for me that's fun. I love this work,' an ex-German soldier was quoted in court papers as saying. The attorney for that soldier, Dennis Gogel, said he believes his client was entrapped. During his time in the military from 1983 to 2004, Hunter was a sniper instructor and drill sergeant before allegedly becoming a career contract killer who . arranged the murder of 'multiple people' overseas. He was reportedly highly decorated by the time he left the service. At one meeting, Hunter was captured on tape describing how he . had arranged the killings of real estate agents. Authorities said those . killings had occurred outside the United States, though they did not provide . specifics. He . was caught in an international sting operation by the DEA, in which . agents posed as Colombian drug lords and offered Hunter a contract to . kill a fellow DEA agent and informer in Liberia for $800,000. International sting: U.S Attorney Preet Bharara announces the charges against former American soldiers including Joseph Hunter . An . attorney for the Federal government said:'The charges tell a tale of an . international band of mercenary marksmen who enlisted their elite . military training to serve as hired guns for evils ends.' 'The bone-chilling allegations in today’s indictment read like they were ripped from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel.' Hunter allegedly enlisted the services of a former German army sniper Dennis Gogel and fellow US veteran Timothy Vamvakias after searching through online resumes when he was offered the 'job' to kill the DEA agent. Hunter recruited several ex-soldiers in late 2012 and early . this year to be a security team for drug traffickers, said the indictment. According to the court papers, the DEA's sources promised Hunter at a March . meeting in an Asian country that his security team would be protecting . thousands of kilos of marijuana and would be seeing ""tons of cocaine and . millions of dollars."" Mr Bharara said the activities of Hunter could have been ripped straight from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel . Audio and video recordings of the meeting show Hunter . discussing ""bonus jobs"" of contract killings, saying the men he had . recruited want to do as much ""bonus"" work as possible, the indictment . said. When assassinations of a federal agent and an informant were . proposed, Hunter ""didn't flinch at the chance,"" Bharara said. He . boasted that his men could handle both jobs, the prosecutor said, adding that . ""from there, it was off to the races."" The indictment said a DEA source posing as a drug trafficker in May proposed to the snipers that they kill a DEA agent and a boat captain providing information to U.S. law enforcement authorities, saying it was necessary because there was a ""leak"" within the narcotics trafficking organization. In an email exchange, Hunter responded: ""My guys will handle it. ... Are you talking about both the captain and agent or just the captain?"" according to the indictment. They ordered submachine guns, pistols, and sophisticated latex masks and shipped them to Africa in preparation for the hit. The arrests occurred in Phuket, but authorities say Hunter and his gang ranged all over Southeast Asia trafficking drugs . But the DEA intercepted Gogel and Vamvakias in Africa before organising the arrest of Hunter this week. Thai . police said the DEA contacted Thai authorities several months ago to . say that Hunter was believed to be hiding in Phuket, where he had rented . a house. Another former German sniper and a Polish counter-terror expert were also arrested this week and will be extradited to the US. Derek Maltz, special agent in charge of the DEA Special . Operations Division, said the snipers were caught by agents dedicated to . ""outwit them, outwork them, outsmart them and put them out of . business.""

While Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has been under pressure for years to improve the company's performance and share price, this appears to be the first time that major shareholders are taking aim at Gates, who remains one of the most respected and influential figures in technology. A representative for Microsoft declined to comment on Tuesday. There is no indication that Microsoft's board would heed the wishes of the three investors, who collectively hold more than 5 percent of the company's stock, according to the sources. They requested the identity of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions were private. Gates owns about 4.5 percent of the $277 billion company and is its largest individual shareholder. The three investors are concerned that Gates' role as chairman effectively blocks the adoption of new strategies and would limit the power of a new chief executive to make substantial changes. In particular, they point to Gates' role on the special committee searching for Ballmer's successor. Microsoft is currently in transition, as it searches for a replacement for CEO Steve Ballmer. Ballmer has focused on improving sales of mobile phones and other devices . They are also worried that Gates - who spends most of his time on his philanthropic foundation - wields power out of proportion to his declining shareholding. Gates, who owned 49 percent of Microsoft before it went public in 1986, sells about 80 million Microsoft shares a year under a pre-set plan, which if continued would leave him with no financial stake in the company by 2018. He lowered his profile at Microsoft after he handed the CEO role to Ballmer in 2000, giving up his day-to-day work there in 2008 to focus on the $38 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In August, Ballmer said he would retire within 12 months, amid pressure from activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Management. Microsoft is now looking for a new CEO, though its board has said Ballmer's strategy will go forward. He has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the Internet. Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy. Gates, seen here in 2002, has been a driving force behind Microsoft since he founded it with Paul Allen in 1975 . News that some investors were pushing for Gates' ouster as chairman provoked mixed reactions from other shareholders. 'This is long overdue,' said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which owns Microsoft shares. 'Replacing the old guard with some fresh eyes can provide the oxygen needed to properly evaluate their corporate strategy.' Kim Caughey Forrest, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, suggested now was not the time for Microsoft to ditch Gates, and that he could even play a larger role. 'I've thought that the company has been missing a technology visionary,' she said. 'Bill (Gates) would fit the bill.' Microsoft is still one of the world's most valuable technology companies, making a net profit of $22 billion last fiscal year. But its core Windows computing operating system, and to a lesser extent the Office software suite, are under pressure from the decline in personal computers as smartphones and tablets grow more popular. Shares of Microsoft have been essentially static for a decade, and the company has lost ground to Apple Inc and Google Inc in the move toward mobile computing. One of the sources said Gates was one of the technology industry's greatest pioneers, but the investors felt he was more effective as chief executive than as chairman.","Activist shareholders own 5percent of the company .

An heir to the Rockefeller fortune claims that a Michigan man posing as a phony, Austrian prince stole an antique commode worth $80,000 from her late mother-in-law, and now she wants it back. According to court filings from the Manhattan Surrogate's Court, 57-year-old Lisenne Rockefeller, the daughter-in-law of Barbara 'Bobo' Rockefeller, claims that a man who called himself 'Prince Josef von Habsburg-Lothringen of Austria' stole a 250-year-old Louis XV Ormolu-mounted Tulipwood, Kingwood and Marquetry Commode from Barbara Rockefeller's Manhattan apartment while he was living there in December of 2003. The 'Austrian prince,' however, is actually Josef Meyers, and he's from Michigan. And he's not royalty - he's a convicted con-man with a lengthy criminal record. 'Royalty': 'Prince Josef' of Austria is actually Josef Meyers, a convicted con-man from Michigan . Antique: This 18th Century Louis XV commode is worth an estimated $80,000 . Ms. Rockefeller met 'Prince Josef' in December of 2003, and the two began spending 'a great deal of time together,' according to court document first obtained by the Daily News. Shortly after meeting, 'Prince Josef' convinced Ms. Rockefeller to let him and a woman posing as his wife - as well as two children he claimed were his - live with her in her $25 million mansion on East 67th Street for several months. While 'Prince Josef' was living with Ms. Rockefeller, Lisenne Rockefeller claims he began to isolate her from family and friends, and began taking control of her financial affairs. After 'Prince Josef had moved in with his mother, Ms. Rockefeller's son, Winthrop, noticed that the commode she'd bought in 1964 was missing from the apartment - and had been replaced with a cheap knockoff. Conned: Barbara 'Bobo' Rockefeller met 'Prince Josef' in 2003. Shortly after, he moved into her home . 'Prince Josef' explained the switcheroo by telling Winthrop that he'd moved the original commode into storage while the apartment was being painted. In 2005, Ms. Rockefeller was in failing health and her apartment became too much to manage. So Winthrop invited her to live with him and his family in Arkansas, an invitation she accepted. Ms. Rockefeller never returned to New York and died in 2008. Winthrop died in 2006 of a blood disorder. Lisenne Rockefeller says she spent years trying to track down 'Prince Josef,' and that she always expected that he'd return the commode. However, as she searched for the faux-prince, she discovered that he isn't who he said he was - he's not a prince, he's a convicted con-man. Lisenne Rockefeller made her discovery in 2011, when the New Yorker ran a lengthy article revealing 'Prince Josef's' true identity. Lawsuit: Lisenne Rockefeller has filed a lawsuit in her attempt to have the $80,000 commode returned . At the time of the article, Josef Meyers was in prison serving a 3-to-15-year prison sentence for failing to pay $220,000 in child support to his actual wife, whom he left in the 1990s. In a twist, the court filing claims, Meyers also has 'children who oddly shared the same names as his children in New York City.' Shortly after discovering the true identity of the man who'd passed himself off as a prince to her elderly mother-in-law, Lisenne Rockefeller found the stolen commode in a catalog for a Sotheby's auction. She later learned that Meyers had sold the piece to an art dealer in London in 2009. The art dealer later told the family that he thought he bought the commode at 'too good a price.' Now, Lisenne Rockefeller wants it back. ""The Commode was highly cherished by (Barbara) during her lifetime and . thus holds sentimental value to me and Winthrop's children, particularly . his older children who spent a great deal of time at (her) New York . City residence,"" she said in an affidavit. Sotheby's says it will hold the piece until the case is resolved.","'Prince Josef of Austria' actually is Josef Meyers, a con-man from Michigan .

Pensioners must shoulder some of the burden of the spending cuts or their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state, the Government’s social mobility tsar has said. Alan Milburn, a health secretary under Labour, called on the Government to slash universal benefits for over-65s such as free TV licences and winter fuel payments. He said it was ‘unfair’ that better-off pensioners were protected from the impact of the cuts while working families with children were bearing two-thirds of the burden of cutting the deficit. His comments were dismissed as ‘bonkers’ by pensioners’ groups, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who said: ‘Punishing pensioners isn’t going to help a single child achieve more in life.’ David Cameron’s official spokesman also dismissed the claims, saying: ‘The Prime Minister believes it’s right to make the commitments he’s made to pensioners and to introduce the triple lock which means pensioners will get a 2.7 per cent rise.’ Mr Milburn’s Social Mobility Commission unveiled its report on the state of the nation yesterday. He warned that the burden of cuts had fallen disproportionately on middle-class families, and that for the first time in more than a century there was a risk that the next generation of adults could end up with lower living standards than today’s generation. As a result, Mr Milburn claimed pensioners should shoulder more of the burden. The report highlights that the number of pensioners is rising, their state benefits are going up and the numbers who can fund them are in decline. It said ministers had allowed an ‘inter-generational injustice’ which sees better-off pensioners protected but families with children bearing two-thirds of spending cuts. ‘We do not believe that favouring pensioners over their children and grandchildren will be a sustainable position over the long-term if a meaningful dent is to be made in the UK’s high levels of child  poverty and low levels of social mobility,’ it added. Mr Milburn said pensioners should shoulder more of the burden and said their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state (file picture) Nick Clegg said: 'Punishing pensioners isn¿t going to help a single child achieve more in life' Mr Milburn later told the Mail that the Government was simply trying to protect its share of the vote among pensioners. ‘I just don’t think it’s right that you have ordinary hardworking middle-income families who are finding their finances being squeezed and their public finances being cut and, at the same time, wealthy pensioners seeing their benefits not just protected but enhanced,’ he said. ‘I think that is going to be increasingly hard to justify.’ He added that sparing pensioners from being charged the spare room subsidy if they rented homes that were bigger than they needed was also ‘part of the same picture’. ‘Pensioner benefits are rising by 17.5 per cent during the course of this parliament,’ he said. ‘That is equivalent to half of the reductions in expenditure on welfare. ‘I understand politically why a . Government would want to protect pensioners who vote, but you  can’t say . you want a fair fiscal deficit reduction and then you don’t  do it . fairly.’ Polls showed . wealthy pensioners would be happy to give up their winter fuel . allowances and free TV licences and bus passes, Mr Milburn said, adding . that cutting perks for all but the poorest pensioners – who receive . pension credit – could save £1.4billion a year. ‘Grandparents are more concerned about what is good for their children than themselves. ‘The . decline in social mobility is not just a problem for low-income . families, it’s definitely a problem for middle-income families too. ‘The gap is widening between the wages that people are getting, the prices that they are paying and  the fact that their children are  finding it hard to get on the housing ladder. ‘That is the reason why Middle England is feeling uncomfortable about the prospects for the next generation.’","Social mobility tsar wants Government to slash free TV licences for elderly .

A New York City preservationist is convinced that he has found the exact location of a legendary 18th century watering hole where General George Washington is believed to have stopped for a drink to celebrate his army's victory over the British. Adam Woodward told the radio station WCBS that the future first president of the United State and New York Governor George Clinton ducked into the Bull's Head Tavern at 50 Bowery after enemy troops had retreated from the city in 1783. The historic building located at the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge has housed many businesses over the centuries, including most recently a Duane Reade pharmacy and a popular Chinese restaurant. But now the structure is slated for demolition to make room for a new hotel - a move that Adam Woodward is hoping to halt. Doomed landmark: Preservationist Adam Woodward claims he has found evidence that 50 Bowery, which is slated for demolition, is the former site of an 18th-century tavern where George Washington drank . Knock on wood: Woodward believes that these hand-hewn joists date back to the 1750s when the Bull's Head Tavern first opened its doors . Set in stone: The activist also came upon this foundation wall built out of brick in a style consistent with Colonial masonry . Race against the clock: Historians hope to halt the demolition of the building, set to come down within months, so they could examine the basement for historical clues . Working against the clock, the preservation activist was able to gain access to the basement of 50 Bowery, where he discovered what he believes to be hand-hewn joists and foundation walls consistent with Colonial-era architecture. ‘I just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York City history,' he said. New York lore has it that the Bull's Head Tavern first opened around 1755, catering to cattle farmers and merchants, according to the New York City history blog The Bowery Boys. The establishment had a prime location east of Collect Pond - a bustling commercial hub crammed with tanneries, slaughterhouses, stockyards and stables. Towards the turn of the 18th century, the tavern was transformed into a busy cattle market where food and drink continued to be served to farmers, who amused themselves by gambling on dog fights and bear baiting displays. Pit stop: On November 25, 1783, when General George Washington, Governor George Clinton and 800 Continental Army troops converged on the Bull's Head Tavern before entering New York City . Working class hotspot: Bull's Head Tavern opened around 1755, catering to cattle farmers, merchants, tanners and employees of local stockyards and slaughterhouses . The humble working-class watering hole was thrust into the limelight on November 25, 1783, when General George Washington, Governor Clinton and 800 Continental  Army troops converged on the Bull's Head Tavern, preparing to enter New York City in a triumphant procession on the heels of the routed Redcoats. The tavern was later operated by the businessman and well-regarded butcher Henry Astor, a scion of a prominent German-American family, who prided himself on serving his customers the finest cuts of meat. For several years, the site of the historic tavern housed a stove emporium until in 1858 a large German beer hall dubbed Atlantic Garden took up residence at 50 Bowery. The future first president of the United States is believed to have prepared for his grand entrance into Manhattan inside the humble pub that for years has been a favorite among slaughterhouse workers . Local brew: In 1858, a large German beer hall dubbed Atlantic Garden took up residence at 50 Bowery, where it remained through 1911 . Rowdy: The busy beer garden was subjected to several police raids in the second half of the 19th century for selling alcohol on Sundays . In the 1870s and 80s, the rowdy pub was repeatedly raided for selling brew on Sundays in violation of the city's excise laws. Atlantic Garden shuttered its doors for good in 1911, to be replaced by a 'modern theater and office building' with a price tag of $300,000, according to a New York Times article published at the time. ‘The whole issue of whether the Bull’s Head was buried inside the Atlantic Garden was one of the great mysteries of New York,’ Woodward told the Times. The preservationist and photographer described how he entered into the debris-strewn edifice and spotted 19th century ironwork. When he descended into the bowels of the condemned building, Woodward noticed that the construction material has changed from modern cinder block to brick and stone. Standing under the sidewalk of the Bowery, Woodward looked up and saw what he believes to be 18th century building materials. Recent tenants: The address was most recently occupied by a Duane Reade drug store on the ground floor and the Golden Bridge Restaurant upstairs . Prominent businessman: The property at 50 Bowery is owned by Alexander Chu, president of Eastbank and the biggest landlord in Chinatown . ‘I was thinking, ""I am standing in the cellar of the Bull’s Head,""’ he recalled to the paper. Woodward and historian David Freeland, who also researched the site, are hoping to save the building from being razed to the ground – at least long enough to conduct a thorough archaeological investigation. They believe that 50 Bowery, currently owned by banker and real estate investor Alexander Chu, could be the oldest surviving structure on the island of Manhattan, according to NY Eater. Architect Peter Poon has drawn up plans to construct a 20-story, 220-room hotel that is expected to be unveiled in early 2015 under the name Hotel Bowery, the site Bowery Boogie reported. The Lo-Down NY reported that the Landmarks Preservation Commission has been made aware of Woodward's discoveries, but it cannot force the owner of the property to delay or abort the construction project.","Adam Woodward says he discovered hand-hewn joints and Colonial-area brick in basement of 50 Bowery, suggesting it may have been site of Bull's Head Tavern .

Adam Lester, 26, was spotted doing about 140 mph on the McNaughton Bridge on Tuesday night and arrested. Speed Demon: Adam Lester was clocked doing 140 mph on a motorcycle earlier this week . When the arresting officer told Mr. Lester to put his hands behind his back so he could be handcuffed, he told the officer he 'had to pee.' Unfortunately for Mr. Lester, he had to wait until he was in custody and taken to a police precinct to hit the head. Mr. Lester was busted by a city police officer conducting speed checks at the nearly one-mile-long bridge at about 7:30 p.m. The speed limit on the bridge is 55 mph. As Mr. Lester passed the officer, he was clocked doing nearly 100 mph over the posted speed limit. 'The officer said he even checked (the gun) twice' to verify its 140-mph reading, a department spokesman told the Pekin Times. The officer quickly began to pursue Mr. Lester and watched as he began to slow down. However, he still watched him 'blow through' a red light after he crossed the bridge. The officer then lost sight of him. When you gotta go: When he was arrested, Lester told authorities he was speeding because he had to pee . Shortly after, the officer spotted Mr. Lester again - stopped between two vehicles that were parked between two buildings. The officer got out of his cruiser and 'snuck up' on Mr. Lester and a woman who also was on the bike. Mr. Lester's female passenger later told police that he knew the officer was chasing him, which is why he ran through the red light in an attempt to avoid authorities. The woman also said that after they'd stopped, Mr. Lester told her to switch jackets with him. Court records show that Mr. Lester has been cited three times in the past month for speeding. He's also been convicted of speeding three times between 2008 and 2010. He's also been convicted of other traffic violations. For Tuesday's joyride, Mr. Lester has been charged with speeding more than 40 mph over the limit and fleeing and attempting to elude police, both misdemeanors, as well as other traffic violations. Additionally, he was charged with endangering the welfare of a minor because his female passenger is only 16 years old. That charge, however, was not included in the charges filed by prosecutors on Wednesday. Mr. Lester posted $200 bond. His next court appearance is scheduled for November 4.","Adam Lester has been busted for speeding three times in the last month .

They are one of the most romantic and iconic images of New York City but soon the horse-drawn carriages that have carried countless tourists round Central Park could be a thing of the past. Animal rights groups have long campaigned to ban horses from the congested city streets, and now the leading mayoral candidates are backing them. With only three weeks to go before the November 5 election, candidate Bill de Blasio has even said that if he is voted in he would replace the horses with eight-seater electric cars. New York style: The romance of horse drawn carriage rides in Central Park, popularized by shows such as Sex and the City, could soon be over . 'We are in the biggest, densest urban area in North America. It is not a place for horses. They are not meant to be in traffic jams,' Mr de Blasio, the Democrat front-runner said at a press conference with NY Class, an animal rights group. Although he previously passed on the chance to legislate on the rides in 2007, Mr de Blasio has now said he would ban the horses within a week of taking office. Members of the animal rights activists he is backing have donated to his campaign. According to the New York Post, records showed the group's co-founder, Steve Nislick, contributed the maximum $4,950 and two others, Wendy and John Neu, have paid in $9,900. While Mr de Blasio says a ban is needed on humane reasons, what offends his Republican opponent Joe Lhota most about the $15 million a year trade is the smell. Dangerous: City mayoral candidates are backing an animal rights group that says roads aren't safe . Horseless carriage: Rights group NY Class has suggested tourists could ride in electric cars, based on this model, instead . 'The smell that they drop there is unfortunate. The smell on Central Park South is also unfortunate,' he said earlier this year, according to the Daily News. But Christina Hansen, a carriage driver from Kentucky who has become the face of the industry, which has about 200 horses and provides work for nearly 400 people in New York, says the mayoral candidates have it all wrong. 'It's all a bunch of hysteria,' the 33-year-old carriage driver said, as she negotiated Manhattan traffic with her horse, Sara. 'Their agenda is not animal welfare. It's animal rights,' she said. 'We bred horses to be powerful, willing partners in our civilization. They project their own human emotions on to horses,' she said. The Central Park carriage ride has been immortalized in cinema. In Woody Allen's Manhattan, Allen's character kisses his young girlfriend in the back of a carriage. It is a scene that has been played out in several TV series too, from Sex and the City to 30 Rock. 'People come to us for the clip-clop. Nobody wants to pet a fender,' Ms Hansen said. Iconic: For tourists, the horse and carriage rides through Central Park are an essential part of a trip to the city . High horse: Mayoral candiates Bill de Blasio, left, and Joe Lhota have said they would ban the trade . When they aren't taking tourists around the sights of Central Park the horses are kept in stables such as Clinton Park, which is home to 78 horses. The rules regulating the carriage industry are set by the city. Horses work no more than nine hours a day, and every year spend at least five weeks on a farm. A veterinarian examines every horse twice a year and city inspectors visit regularly. Ms Hansen joked that the stable has more inspections 'than a day-care facility'. Over the past 30 years, three horses have died in traffic accidents, the latest in 2006. NY Class has recorded 19 accidents over the past two years that resulted in injury, but the carriage industry said most were minor incidents. Allie Feldman, executive director of NY Class, said horses don't belong in traffic and an eco- friendly motorized alternative could catch on with tourists. 'It retains the romantic, classic, nostalgic feel that you would get in a horse-drawn carriage, only it doesn't have the smell, it doesn't have the cruelty and it's much more safe,' she said. 'We think we're offering a really fair compromise.' End of an era: Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio has said he will ban the trade within a week of taking office . In Central Park South, across from the Plaza Hotel, Charlene Dertinger, 46, a native New Yorker celebrating a new job with a ride around the park, said it would be a shame to lose that tradition. 'I want to treat myself. I'm just going to sit by myself and enjoy the scenery,' she said. Close by, Australians Hazel and Terry Watkins were just finishing their trip, which they said was 'very New York'.","Bill de Blasio vows to ban $15 million a year trade within one week of taking office .

The family of a boy whose body was severely burned on his eighth birthday came face-to-face with the man accused of dousing him with gasoline and setting him alight on Thursday, for the first time since that horror day 15 years ago. Nearly every part of Robert Middleton's body was etched by fire, leaving him covered with third-degree burns outside his Texas home. In the years that followed, he endured painful skin grafts, more than 100 surgeries and constant physical therapy. As he grew into adolescence, he seemed to move on with his life. His sister said his mantra was, 'The past is the past.' But an important question from the past lingered: Would his attacker be brought to justice? Middleton never learned the answer. He died in 2011, shortly before his 21st birthday, from skin cancer that his family believes developed from cells in some of the skin grafts. Authorities reopened the case and last month filed a murder charge against Don Willburn Collins, the suspect Middleton had long accused of burning him. Scroll down for video . Murder charge: Authorities reopened the case and last month filed a murder charge against Don Willburn Collins, pictured on Thursday, the suspect Middleton had long accused of burning him . In a deposition given two weeks before he died, he alleged for the first time that the same person had sexually assaulted him two weeks before the attack. That revelation prompted authorities to reinvestigate Collins, a neighbor who was 13 at the time. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison. Collins appeared before Judge Kathleen Hamilton during a detention hearing in Montgomery County's 359th District Court in Conroe on Wednesday. Hamilton found there was enough probable cause to hold Collins and ordered he be held on a $1 million bond. But pursuing a murder charge against Collins, now 28, might be difficult for prosecutors, who would first have to get the case transferred from juvenile court to district court so Collins can be tried as an adult. If that hurdle is overcome, legal experts say, the greatest challenge would be convincing jurors that Middleton's cancer resulted directly from the severe burns. His family and authorities argue that a hormone needed to grow some of the skin grafts helped exacerbate cancerous cells in the skin. 'I know that they have the right person,' said his mother, Colleen Middleton. Hard road: Colleen Middleton, pictured, came face-to-face with the man accused of burning her son and causing his death for the first time in 15 years . Collins had been charged right after Robert Middleton was burned. But authorities were unable to proceed, in part because he was too severely hurt to help investigators. Montgomery County Attorney J.D. Lambright, whose office filed the new murder charge, said the case was originally given only a 'cursory investigation,' and Collins was released 6 months after his arrest. Collins was convicted of sexually assaulting a different 8-year-old boy in 2001. After serving his sentence in the juvenile system, he was twice convicted as an adult of failing to register as a sex offender. He is jailed in nearby San Jacinto County on a third violation of failing to register and could get up to 10 years. 'I had often wondered: Why has this case lay dormant for 15 years?' Lambright said. 'I've never been able to give a good answer for that.' After her son was burned, Middleton said her initial focus was on finding out who was responsible. But doctors told Middleton her son's health needed to come first. 'So we kind of had to put the whole criminal investigation on (hold) and just (did) it around Robert's schedule, his healing,' she said. Horror: Nearly every part of Robert Middleton, pictured before, left, and after, right, was etched by fire, leaving him covered with third-degree burns outside his Texas home . Initially, doctors told Middleton that her son would not survive the June 28, 1998, attack near their home in Splendora, about 35 miles northeast of Houston. That day, her son had gone over to a friend's house when she got a call that her son had been burned. She ran outside and found Robert lying on the street, naked. Middleton didn't understand why her son had no clothes on until she realized they had all been burned away. For the next three years or so, he spent more time hospitalized than at home. He was severely disfigured, lost most of his vision and had to use a wheelchair. Eventually he was able to walk again and dress and feed himself and go back to school. 'There was never normalcy, never,' Middleton said. By his 18th birthday, Robert Middleton told his family he was done with surgeries. The family, which was living in Missouri at the time, looked forward to a future in which he could one day live by himself, learn to drive and become a wildlife rehabilitator. But in March 2010, he was diagnosed with skin cancer. He died in April 2011. Before his death, the family had hired an attorney to look into his case because Middleton believed authorities 'weren't doing all that they could have done.' Tragedy: Colleen Middleton holds a photograph of her son, Robert, after an interview in Galveston, Texas on September 26, 2013 . Two weeks before his death, Robert Middleton gave his deposition. That deposition became part of a lawsuit his family filed against Collins. In December 2011, a jury returned a $150 billion verdict in favor of Middleton's family. But the verdict was mostly symbolic. However, Robert Middleton's revelation in his deposition renewed interest in the case. Lambright, who took office in January, said a 6-month investigation gathered new evidence, including claims that Collins told the other 8-year-old he was convicted of sexually assaulting that he would burn the boy just like Robert Middleton. On October 21, Lambright is scheduled to ask that Collins' murder charge be transferred to adult court. If a judge denies the request, that would end the case. Collins does not have an attorney for the murder charge. But Todd Dillon, his attorney on the failure-to-register charge, said he is worried that information from the murder case might make its way into the trial in San Jacinto County, which is set for February. 'It's important to remember he has never been convicted' in the murder case, Dillon said. 'As such, he still has the right of presumption of innocence.' Middleton, who moved with her family from Missouri to Galveston about a month ago to be closer to legal developments in the case, said she wondered at one point if she was selfish to ask that her son survive. But he told his mother he was happy he lived, and Middleton is grateful she had 13 more years of memories with her son. 'They were good years,' Middleton said. 'I just remember the good stuff.'","Robert Middleton was doused in gas and set alight on his eighth birthday in 1998, suffering third degree burns all over his body .

A former U.S state Senator is to sue a ski resort after he and his two daughters were injured when a chairlift derailed sending them falling 35ft to the ground. Former Democratic politician Michael Katz broke his back and suffered a brain injury in the fall at the Sugarloaf Mountain ski resort in Maine in December 2010. He was one of eight people injured when high winds dislodged a chairlift cable and five cars were sent plummeting to the ground. He is the only one of those injured to sue according to, as others have settled out of court. Mr Katz, who is a doctor, is said to have suffered the worst injuries out of those hurt in the incident. According to the Portland Press Herald, . Mr Katz is seeking unspecified damages and is also suing on behalf of . his two daughters who were aged 11 and 13 at the time and were also . hurt. The . lawsuit states: 'Abigail was thrown from the chair after impact, while . Emily was dragged up the mountain by the lift because a piece of Emily’s . ski equipment was stuck in the chair. 'Abigail and Emily could see their father lying motionless in the snow after the collapse, and their immediate thought was that he had been killed.' The family say that the resort wa negligent for operating the ski lift even though they were allegedly aware of its safety hazards. The resort says that it had tried to avoid a court case but that bosses were unsurprised by the legal action. The lift was an A 2 passenger monocable fixed grip chair manufactured and installed by Borvig in 1975. It was 4,013 feet long with a vertical of 1,454 feet and moved at a speed of 500 feet per minute. There were 162 chairs on the lift. It was removed from the resort shortly after the incident and replaced in December 2011. Mr Katz only served one term as a Senator before he was defeated at the polls by Republican Greg Lavelle.

When a fan fell ill after trying to make Delia Smith’s recipe for chilli con carne, he set off a celebrity feud that is continuing to simmer more than 30 years later. Miss Smith has become embroiled in a war of words with former That’s Life! presenter Esther Rantzen over accusations that the cookery writer failed to warn readers to pre-boil kidney beans to make them safe to eat. Miss Rantzen reheated the row this week by claiming she was ‘leaned’ on by her BBC bosses to apologise for broadcasting the claim in the consumer programme in the 1970s. Feud: Delia Smith (left) became embroiled in a war of words with Esther Rantzen (right) after a row over a chilli con carne recipe . A viewer had written in to say he fell ‘terribly ill’ after trying out the chilli recipe in Delia Smith’s Cookery Course, a best-seller published by the BBC. It was discovered that he had failed to cook the red kidney beans in Miss Smith’s recipe thoroughly enough. The beans need to be boiled for at least ten minutes to destroy high concentrations of lectin, a harmful toxin. Recalling the incident this week, Miss Rantzen, now 73, said Miss Smith threatened to withdraw publication rights for the book from the BBC unless she received an apology. ‘At the time Delia was the biggest money-earner for the BBC,’ she said. ‘She was the Jeremy Clarkson of her day. ‘Her cookbooks were a huge money-earner for the BBC and she was about to launch another book, and I am told, and I don’t know if this is true, that she said to the BBC, “Unless That’s Life apologise I am going to take my book to another publisher”. ‘The bosses said I had to apologise. It was the most obscure apology you have ever heard. I am not sure we did not put it to music. ‘What we said was [the viewer] made the mistake … and we told viewers they would have to make sure [the beans] were cooked, and Delia changed her recipe. I think honour was preserved on both sides.’ Despite the passing of the years, Miss Smith, 72, remains furious over the suggestion that her recipe made the viewer ill. She also denied the suggestion that she had threatened to withdraw publication rights from the BBC. She told the Daily Mail last night that Miss Rantzen’s remarks in the 1970s were ‘very damaging’ because her original cooking instructions were ‘perfectly safe’. A spicy dish with a dash of controversy: Delia's chilli recipe . Tasty dish: The recipe for chilli con carne was 'perfectly safe' according to Miss Smith . ‘The recipe stated that the mixture should be brought up to simmering point in a flameproof casserole over direct heat, then transferred to a pre-heated oven,’ she said. ‘This meant the kidney beans did not come off the boil for two hours. ‘The one person who had complained to That’s Life! had not actually followed my recipe. The chilli had been made in a porcelain dish (ie not flameproof) and therefore placed in the oven cold.’ Miss Smith said there was ‘never any question’ of her withdrawing publication rights. ‘I have always assumed that it was the production team that finally realised they had acted irresponsibly and committed a libel, whatever Miss Rantzen thinks she now remembers,’ she said. Delia Smith’s Cookery Course, which has been reprinted many times, now contains a clear warning on the importance of cooking kidney beans thoroughly.","Fan fell ill trying to make the recipe in the 1970s .

Two brothers ordered a man to strip naked and cover himself in cooking oil before branding him with two red hot irons during a five day attack. Darius and Dainus Svedskas and a third man,  Sarkis Muradjan, held the 22-year-old victim captive at a house in Nelson, Lancashire, and whipped him with a belt and electric flex. Darius Svedskas, 34, and Dainus, 24, have been jailed for four years and four months and four years and five months respectively at Preston Crown Court and Muradjan was sentenced to three years. Darius (left) and Dainus Svedskas (right) have both been jailed for more than four years each for the brutal attack on a 22-year-old, who was forced to walk on all fours and beaten with a belt and electric cable . The court heard the victim suffered permanent scald marks from being burnt with both a . travel and soldering iron after he was taken captive and battered for . pleasure by the two brothers he had previously regarded as friends. During his ordeal, the unnamed Lithuanian victim was ordered to walk on all fours around the house and was beaten about the head with a wooden chair causing serious head injuries. The victim's younger brother, 17, was also held captive by the group but managed to smash his way through a ground floor double glazed window and raise the alarm at a nearby factory. Both victims, who came to the UK to study and work, have returned to Lithuania. Sarkis Muradjan was also jailed for three years for his part in the attack . Darius Svedskas pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, false imprisonment and assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst Dainus Svedskas admitted false imprisonment and causing actual bodily harm. Muradjan, 32, also of Nelson, admitted false imprisonment and causing actual bodily harm. The attack happened in May after the victim was befriended by the three men, Lancashire Police said. His younger brother arrived in the UK to study on May 26 and was unaware of his brother's suffering until he too was held captive and brutally beaten. The teenager was subjected to several assaults over a two day period on May 28 and 29 where he was slapped and punched several times. Lancashire Police said the iron attack occurred whilst the older victim was cowering in a bathroom. He was ordered to strip naked, cover himself in cooking oil before being burned with a travel iron and soldering iron, and also whipped with the buckle end of a belt. The victim was then summoned downstairs where the assault continued and he was hit with electric cable and ordered to walk around on all fours. The ordeal only stopped when the 17-year-old, who feared for his brother's life, managed to escape by jumping through the thick plate glass window causing cuts to his face and body. Police said the two victims suffered 'physical and psychological abuse.' Following sentencing, Det Sgt Phil Pilkington from Lancashire Police said:  'I am pleased with the sentences handed down to Darius and Dainus Svedskas, along with Sarkis Muradjan, that reflect the seriousness of the violent assaults they carried out, along with keeping two innocent men against their will. 'The two victims were in the country to study and work and have been left terrified by their ordeal, especially the 22 year old who was the main subject of violence, threats and intimidation. During the five day ordeal, the Svedskas brothers forced the victim to strip naked and cover himself in cooking oil before they branded him with hot irons . 'The assaults that were inflicted on him were particularly degrading and prolonged and I praise the 17-year-old who showed bravery in escaping the situation to call for help for his brother. 'The brothers have now returned to their home country of Lithuania but have been left with permanent, visible scars that will be permanent reminders of their horrendous ordeals. 'I hope that the sentencing has given them sort of closure so that they can move on with their lives. 'Let these results serve as a warning to those who think it's acceptable to use violence against others - we will not tolerate it and you will be brought before the courts and punished.'","Lithuanian victim, 22, beaten with electric cable and buckle end of belt .

Eight areas to receive a fuel duty cut are Lib Dem constituencies but Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander dismissed any claims of favouritism . Drivers living in remote or rural areas are to receive a 5p a litre discount on their petrol. Three communities in England and seven in Scotland have been judged to meet strict criteria to qualify, the Government will announce today. They will receive the fuel discount already introduced in the remote Inner and Outer Hebrides, Northern Isles, and Scilly Isles. The move has still to be approved by the European Commission but Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail there was an overwhelming case for a cut in duty in far-flung areas of the country that have high prices at the pumps. Critics pointed out, however, that eight of the ten areas to benefit are in constituencies with Liberal Democrat MPs – two of them in Mr Alexander’s own seat. Four are in the constituency of former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy and one in Tory Foreign Secretary William Hague’s seat. Labour suggested it showed the Chief Secretary was willing to cut the cost of living only in ‘his own back yard’. But Mr Alexander dismissed any claims of favouritism, insisting the areas qualify because they are similar to the islands eligible for the existing discount. ‘It’s something that for people in these communities will make a real difference,’ Mr Alexander said. ‘The Daily Mail has rightly highlighted the fact that fuel costs matter to everybody, but particularly to those in rural communities where a car is a necessity not a luxury.’ The fuel discount can be introduced only if the Government can persuade the European Commission that it would not breach EU competition laws. A decision is expected within six months. Three communities in England and seven in Scotland have met the strict criteria to qualify for the 5p fuel duty cut and will receive the same discount as the Inner and Outer Hebrides Northern Isles, and Scilly Isles . Four of the areas to benefit are in Charles Kennedy's (left) constituency and one in William Hague’s (right) seat . Precedents have been set by Corsica and the Portuguese and Greek islands, which already enjoy fuel tax discounts approved by Brussels. If the extension is approved, it will bring the number of people in the UK to benefit from the rural fuel scheme to nearly 120,000. The new areas to qualify include towns in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon. They are at least 100 miles from a refinery and have sparse populations and high petrol prices. Catherine McKinnell, Labour spokesman on the economy, said: ‘Eight out of ten of these areas have Liberal Democrat MPs – including two in Danny Alexander’s own constituency. ‘The public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a Lib Dem Treasury Minister who refuses to tackle the cost of living crisis everywhere but his own back yard.’ But Mr Alexander said: ‘This has been a completely objective process. The list has been drawn up with pretty strict criteria.’ He also backed George Osborne’s attempt to hold prices down for motorists across the country by keeping fuel duty frozen until the 2015 election. It means that by then petrol will be 20p a litre cheaper than it would have been under the previous Labour government’s plans. Average petrol prices in the UK fell 5.49p a litre to 132.16p between mid-September and mid-October, said the AA. But it warned that a further dip in prices soon is unlikely.","Treasury Chief Secretary said there was overwhelming case for cut in duty .

An extremely rare photograph that captures almost the exact moment that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated is going up for auction next month. By sheer chance, Mary Ann Moorman Krahmer captured the moment that the president clutched his throat, one-sixth of a second after being hit by an assassin's bullet in Dallas in 1963. On November 15, one week after the famous photograph turns 50, it will go for up for sale at Cincinnati's Cowan's Auctions and is expected to fetch somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000. Famous photo: Almost exactly 50 years after the assassination of President Kennedy a photograph showing the second he was shot is going up for auction . Krahmer tried to auction off the photo during the summer through Sotheby's in New York, but the Kennedy family intervened. The family has a long-standing relationship with the auction house and officials said the photo was ‘too sensitive to auction.’ But the auction house in Cincinnati has had no such qualms. ‘This photograph has to be one of the most iconic photos of one of the most investigated moments of the 20th century,’ Wes Cowan told The Cincinnati Enquirer. Mary Ann Moorman was a 31-year-old Texan housewife when she captured one of the most significant moments in American history with her polaroid camera . Moorman, now 81 and  living in Gainesville, Texas, says she doesn’t need the photo any longer as she has her memories. The assassination of JFK happened at 12:30 p.m. on Nov. 22, 1963, in downtown Dallas when Lee Harvey Oswald's three rifle shots cut down the 46-year-old president. Moorman, then a 31-year-old plumber’s wife and a friend has driven downtown more intent on seeing the glamorous Jackie Kennedy than her husband. Using her a Polaroid instant camera, which had self-developing film that printed photos in seconds, Moorman caught the first shot that struck the president. ‘We were so close to the car, 10 to 12 feet away,’ she said, ‘I heard Jackie yell: “My God! He's been shot!'"" Moorman has admitted she was more interested in catching a glimpse of the very glamorous Jackie Kennedy rather than the President on the fateful day 50 years ago . The photo became hot property in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy and it was shown on TV within two hours of the incident occurring. Government officials questioned Moorman and it was six hours later before she was finally allowed to leave the courthouse and return to her suburban Dallas home. Then six hours later Government agents arrived asking for her photo, which was eventually returned weeks later sporting ‘a big thumbprint on it.’ Then in 1977, the House Select Committee on Assassinations subpoenaed the photograph and Moorman had to hire an attorney to get it back. Since then she has kept it in a safety deposit box until now. Video: Eyewitness to an American tragedy .","By sheer chance, Mary Ann Moorman .

A transsexual police officer who was allegedly forced to 'out' herself over police radio is attempting to sue her force. PC Emma Chapman has taken Essex Police to an employment tribunal after force control room staff allegedly questioned her identity over the radio on three separate occasions. The 44-year-old, who was born male and underwent gender reassignment in 1999, claims the force failed to fully investigate the incidents and did not help officers understand transgender issues. Essex Police disputes the allegations. PC Emma Chapman is suing Essex Police after she was allegedly forced to 'out' herself as a transsexual over police radio (file picture) According to the BBC, the first incident took place in October 2012 when she was left 'very distressed' after having to announce she was a transsexual over the radio, listened to by hundreds of officers and staff, because the operator, who said she a 'male voice', did not believe who she was. PC Chapman reported the incident but claims a full investigation was not carried out. Legal papers, seen by the BBC, say a further two incidents took place in June 2013 when control room staff again questioned who she was. In her statement she said: 'The radio is also a lifeline at times and I should not have to feel hesitant or anxious about using it.' PC Chapman was serving as a volunteer officer with Essex Police when she underwent gender reassignment in 1999. She became a full-time constable four years later She initially told people about the sex change and tried to help increase awareness of transgender issues. PC Chapman claims the force did not fully investigate the incidents and did not help officers understand transgender issues (file picture) She 'stepped away' from dealing with the issues in 2009 however after becoming 'frustrated' due to a lack of support and understanding. The hearing at East London Tribunal Court last week heard the officer said she was forced to work in an 'intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment' because of the incidents over the radio. Essex Police has denied the allegations. The officer secured the backing of the Police Federation to bring the proceedings against the force. The tribunal is now considering its findings and a decision is expected in the next few months.","PC Emma Chapman claims her identity was questioned over radio .

An unemployed man who refused a request from his bed-bound mother to leave his room and walk downstairs to turn off a light in their home attacked his brother in a row over his lifestyle. Shane Spong, 26, phoned his brother, Craig, who lived some distance away, and asked him to come over to the house to perform the tiny task, Guildford Crown Court heard. But when the outraged brother arrived at the premises he got into a furious row with the defendant over his lackadaisical lifestyle. Guildford Crown Court heard how Shane Spong called his brother when he couldn't be bothered to turn out a light . And in the confrontation that followed, Shane picked up a kitchen knife and lashed out at his sibling with it on June 10 this year. Craig suffered a cut on his head - and Mr Spong ended up under arrest. The defendant, a former driver, narrowly avoided being jailed after pleading guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm. Judge Christopher Critchlow expressed astonishment over the incident. The court heard how Shane Spong spent lots of his time on the internet . He said: 'If the defendant had only got up to turn off the light, none of this would have happened'. Ruby Selva, prosecuting, said that Spong lived with his mother, who was confined to bed. She said: 'The defendant’s mother called out for the defendant to switch a downstairs light off which had been left on'. She said: 'Instead, he called up his brother to come over to switch the light off.' Ms Selva told how Craig arrived at the property and there was an argument between the two of them. She said that Shane stormed into the kitchen, of the house in Guildford, Surrey and reappeared holding a knife in his right hand. Craig suffered a wound to his head, telling police officers later: 'He hit me on the head with the blade'. The Court heard that Shane told his injured brother: 'You used to hit me before. How do you like it?' Later the defendant insisted that he had never intended to hurt his brother, but had acted in self defence after being assaulted. The court was told that the victim described his brother as anti-social adding: 'He lives in his bedroom and online'. Studying papers on the case Judge Critchlow said that the defendant appeared to blame his brother, and didn't seem to accept much responsibility for what happened. The Judge said that the use of a knife was an aggravating feature of the case. 'It is a very serious offence. It could have had fatal consequences.' The court was told that Shane had no previous convictions. Mr Spong was sentenced to a 12 month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to perform 120 hours unpaid work for the community. Judge Critchlow warned him: 'I hope you realise how close you came today to going through that door to prison'. He added: 'There must be no further fights between you and your brother - with or without weapons'.","Shane Spong attacked brother in row over his lazy lifestyle .

A teacher was so embarrassed by a pupil's naughty comment about her weight that she shed a massive eight stone. Primary school teacher Jordanna Booth weighed nearly 18 stone and was teaching a Year 3 class when she heard an eight-year-old boy turn to a classmate and make a cheeky remark. She said: 'I'd arrived at the school for a work placement just three days before. Jordanna was prompted to lose eight stone from 18 stone (left) to 9 stone (right) 'One of the little boys I was teaching turned to a classmate and whispered: 'Miss Booth's fat.' 'The whole class heard and giggled out of surprise. I knew I should have disciplined him for being rude, but despite myself I was too embarrassed. 'I was absolutely mortified. I thought: 'I'm so fat, even the children are laughing at me'. The episode, which occurred during a teacher training work placement at St Vincent De Paul's Primary school, launched Miss Booth, of Liverpool, into an intensive 18-month weight-loss programme which saw her ditch her usual chips and takeaways for healthier alternatives. Jordanna, pictured before her dramatic weight loss with boyfriend Sam, says her diet consisted mainly of junk food . She was supported in her quest for a slimmer figure by personal trainer boyfriend Sam Bullows, 28. She said: 'Sam said my size didn't matter and I knew he meant it, but I still felt huge and disgusting. The pupil's comment spurred me into action.' Just a month later, Jordanna celebrated the start of 2011 at a New Years Eve celebration with Sam and was shocked when she looked at the photographs taken of her that evening. She recalled: 'It was the final straw. I looked really horrible in the pictures. I knew I had to do something to lose the excess weight. Jordanna says that she used to pretend that her size didn't bother her . 'I'd always been conscious of my size, but I tried to ignore the fact that I had got so big. 'Sam said he loved me how I was, and I tried to pretend I didn't care as I threw myself into my teacher training degree.' She struggled to control the urge to overeat and used any excuse as a chance to overindulge. 'At least three times a week I'd feast on greasy takeaways,' she said. 'While I was attending university for my teacher training I'd snack on chocolate, crisps and biscuits.' Determined to take back control of her life, she joined a slimming class in January 2011 and learned how to make simple and healthy meals. Jordanna says she is now grateful to the cheeky pupil for prompting her to address her unhealthy diet . She said: 'Straight away I realised how bad my diet was. No wonder I had got fat, with all the junk food I was eating.' Jordanna began taking long walks and started swimming with Sam. By the summer of 2012, Jordanna had dropped from dress size 22 to size eight and was celebrating the fact she had reached her target weight of nine stone. 'As the weight fell off, I felt like a different person,' she said. Before her dramatic weight loss, Jordanna's breakfast was typically made up of a bacon sandwich on white bread with butter or a bowl of Coco Pops. Lunch would be a shop-bought pizza or a pasty with a sandwich, and dinnertime consisted of chips with gravy as an after-work snack, followed by curry from a jar. Jordanna, with the support of personal trainer boyfriend Sam, totally changed her diet and now eats healthy, snacking on fruit and vegetables . Between meals she would snack on crisps, chocolates and cakes. Now, breakfast is usually porridge and fruit, followed by a jacket potato with beans and salad for lunch. A favourite dinner is spaghetti bolognese with extra-lean mince. The sweet and salty snacks have been replaced with fruit or vegetable sticks. Jordanna, who graduated from her teacher training course this year and is currently looking for a permanent placement, said she is delighted with the reaction she's had. She said: 'A couple of former coursemates didn't recognise me at first because I look so different. They couldn't believe I was the same person when I showed them some old photographs. It made me feel proud of my achievement.' Jordanna is now grateful for her pupils comment, and is enjoying wearing figure hugging-size eight dresses. 'If boys in class are giggling behind my back I'm told it's because they've got a crush on me,' she said.","Jordanna, 22, went from 18st to 9st and from size 22 to size 8 .

Caroline Wilcock, 51, grew up in Bowburn, County Durham, next to an asbestos firm. Locals recalled dust from the plant gathering on window ledges and cars. Children collected it to make snow balls and wrote messages in the deadly dust.

Payday lenders would face a multi-million pound tax to bankroll credit unions under Labour plans launched today. Ed Miliband set out plans to levy an additional fee on short-term lenders’ profits because too many people now face a 'personal credit crunch' at the end of every month. The Labour leader wants to double the £13 million given by the government to extend credit unions, which currently charge no more than 26 per cent a year. He pointed to the market for payday lenders doubling to £2.2 billion between 2008-09 and 2011-12. Credit unions, which are not-for-profit lenders, cannot compete with the might of the payday lenders, who critics call ‘legal loan sharks’. Labour also wants to cap interest rates charged by payday lenders – some of which are over 5000 per cent per year. The announcement follows David Cameron’s warned yesterday that payday lenders could still face a limit on the rate of interest they charge. The Prime Minister revealed he had not ruled out capping interest rates but Mr Miliband accused the government of not going far enough. The Labour leader meet with victims of the industry at a credit union office in Peckham, South London today along with Stella Creasy, the Labour frontbencher who has led the campaign against payday lenders. Mr Miliband said: ‘The cost of living crisis afflicting millions of Britain’s families is so bad that it is creating a personal debt crisis too. ‘The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid. And, as a result, the market in payday lending has doubled in just four years. Almost a third of the payday loans taken out in Britain at the moment are to cover the cost of people’s gas and electricity bills. ‘For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch.’ Labour controversially proposed energy price caps on energy firms last month. The policy has been criticised by economists who warned that it will simply force the Big Six to raise their prices before an anticipated cap. Mr Miliband said that Labour would cap . the cost of credit, halt the spread of payday lenders on the high . street and force them to fund credit unions. Miss Creasy praised campaigners who have forced payday lenders put out of football grounds and shopping centres. She . added: ‘We are determined to see a cap introduced in the UK so that we . can see an end to this legal loan sharking and give British consumers . the protection they deserve.’ The . industry has been criticised for preying on vulnerable customers and . charging annual interest rates as high as 5000 per cent. From next April, it will come under the control of watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. Campaign: Labour frontbencher Stella Creasy has pushed for tougher action to curb interests rates of so-called 'legal loan sharks' Payday lenders will be banned from repeatedly trying to claw out money from bank accounts to repay debts. They will also only be allowed to roll-over short-term loans twice, to ensure struggling families are not caught out by spiralling debts. Payday lenders will already be charged a levy from next April. The money will go towards debt counselling services. But critics want the government to do more by capping interest rates. Mr Cameron was pressed again on a cap during Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday and replied: ‘We continue to look at the issue of a cap and I don't think we should rule that out’. ‘We do have to bear in mind what has been found out in other countries and through our own searches about whether a cap would prove effective.’ Earlier this month the FCA was criticised for not including a rate cap in its plans to regulate the industry. Australia, most parts of the United States and some European countries have capped payday loan interest rates but the FCA has argued that such an approach could push borrowers into the hands of backstreet loan sharks.","Miliband warns too many face a 'personal credit crunch' every month .

The after-effects of the recession could lead to the pilfering of post-it notes and other office supplies, according to a study . The after-effects of the recession could lead to the pilfering of post-it notes and stealing of staplers, according to a new study. While people like to think they will stick to their ethical principles no matter what, when they feel financially deprived, they are more likely to relax their moral standards and commit minor transgressions, scientists claim. Canadian researchers found that faced with financial losses suffered as a result of the last recession, some people resorted to workplace sabotage and stole supplies and equipment. Scientists from the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, said people are more likely to judge other deprived moral offenders who do the same more leniently. Nina Mažar, an associate professor of marketing at the university and one of the lead researchers of the study, said: 'We found that most respondents did not think financial deprivation would lead them to behave immorally. 'Yet, once they actually experienced financial deprivation, they were more likely to loosen their ethical principles.' The study, to be published in the journal Organisational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes, found public policies that entrench financial inequalities, such as regressive taxation plans or tax cuts for the wealthy, could also lead to more cheating inside and outside the office. Last resort: Canadian researchers found that faced with financial losses suffered as a result of the last recession, some people resorted to workplace sabotage and stole supplies and equipment . And those who interpret or enforce policies or regulations as part of their work - in corporations, law enforcement, or the judicial system - need to be mindful of the deprivation effect too, the study said. Temporary upsets in a person's own financial position could lead them to go easier on others demonstrating unethical behaviour while under financial stress, according to the paper. There are many ways people assess their financial health, but research has found one of the strongest influences is comparing oneself to other people. A sense of financial deprivation can happen when people simply feel financially inferior to their peers. The findings are based on a series of experiments that studied people's views about dishonest behaviour and how they behaved once they were induced to feel financially-deprived themselves. Workplace theft is common: Employees may see their own and other colleagues' financial positions as inferior and unfair, relative to the companies and executives they work for, leading to workplace stealing . The effects were observed both in experiments where people actually experienced financial loss and in those where they were merely made to feel financially-deprived, relative to others. The effects were lessened however, when people saw that acting unethically would be unfair, would not improve their financial situation, or when they accepted that their financial position was deserved. Perceptions of fairness were key to participants' decisions to act honestly or dishonestly, said Professor Mažar. The research suggests that one reason why workplace theft is so common, is because employees may see their own,and other colleagues' financial positions as inferior and unfair, relative to the companies and executives they work for.","Scientists from the University of Toronto said that when people feel financially deprived, they are more likely to relax their moral standards .

Jonathan Glanz says that some social housing tenants in London enjoy a Made In Chelsea lifestyle . Social housing tenants living in affluent areas of London are enjoying a 'Made In Chelsea' lifestyle according to a Westminster councillor. Jonathan Glanz, a Conservative cabinet member for housing at Westminster Council said that subsided properties in London mean that social housing tenants can enjoy living in multi-million pound homes at the taxpayers' expense. Comparing the tenants' lifestyles to those enjoyed by the cast of Channel 4 reality show, Mr Glanz told the Daily Telegraph: 'Trust funds are often associated with the Made In Chelsea brigade, the young people portrayed in the ITV (sic) television series who spend their days dining out and sipping champagne. 'It may be a stretch, but in some way, their fortunes are not entirely dissimilar to some of the benefits enjoyed by social housing tenants in some of the country's most expensive areas. 'We some social housing properties in Westminster and other central London boroughs valued at upwards of £2million, a heavily subsidised rent on a two or three bedroom house a stone's throw from Oxford Street might otherwise only be affordable to a  so-called trustafarian.' But Soho resident Alida Baxter told the Telegraph that Mr Glanz's comments seemed to herald a campaign to get anyone out of London who wasn't rich. She told the newspaper: 'He seems to want to make a gated community of central London and he has said so often about the fact that this isn't the place where ordinary people should live or can live.' The row comes following Work and Pensions Secretary Ian Duncan Smith's introduction of a cap on housing benefit in June. And the introduction of the bedroom tax, which means that tenants with spare bedrooms must downsize, or pay extra rent.

A family of four was found dead in an Indiana home they’d only just moved into and authorities are blaming carbon monoxide. Police say a gas generator had been running in the garage of the Merrillville home of Michael Nichols, 41, his wife Kennetha Purnell, 38, their 13-year-old son Matthew and 11-year-old daughter Morgan because electricity hadn’t yet been connected to the home. They also say that was the cause of the family’s demise after carbon dioxide gas became trapped in the home, where the garage door and all the windows were found closed. Tragic: A family who'd only just moved into their Merrillville, Indiana home over the weekend is dead after using a gas-powered generator in an unventilated garage as they waited for their electricity to be turned on . Sad: Neighbors say the family minivan was parked in the driveway for days, but they didn't know who to contact about the suspicious lack of activity . Shocking: Kennetha Purnell and her children Matthew and Moran were found dead in their beds. Their father, Michael Nichols, was found slumped in a hallway . Purnell’s mother found the family dead Wednesday evening. A supervisor at Kennetha’s job with Chicago State University had alerted her to her daughter’s absene. But no one had heard from the family since Saturday, and police believe they could have been dead since the weekend. That’s when the family moved into the well-kept, two-story rental home in just south of Gary.

Derek Wildeman, 42, was savagely beaten at his home in Blackburn after telling a boy off when his curtains were set on fire . A man with learning difficulties who told a teenage boy off for setting fire to his curtains was beaten so savagely he will never be able to speak or look after after himself again. Derek Wildeman, 42, was attacked by Steven Quigley, 31, and his uncle Gary Quigley, 43, after he shouted at a 13-year-old boy over vandalism to his terraced house in Blackburn, Lancashire. The men, who were jailed yesterday at Preston Crown Court, beat Mr Wildeman so badly he suffered multiple fractures to the head and face and was left in a coma for six months.  Eight months on, he still needs 24-hour care and his mother says his life is effectively over. The attack took place on February 24 this year, when Mr Wildeman noticed at midnight that someone had reached through his boarded-up window and set fire to his net curtains at the home he shared with his two dogs. He put the flames out and went onto the street, where he saw a boy walking past with two friends. After an exchange of words the 13-year-old boy ran away and went to find Quigley who recruited his uncle, Gary, to help him get revenge on Mr Wildeman. After telling the boy he was going to smash Mr Wildeman's 'head in', Steven Quigley put on a black hat and gloves and, taking the teenager with them, went to Mr Wildeman's house at 2am. The court heard how Quigley climbed through a window and laid into the man whom neighbours described as a 'friendly loner' who 'wouldn't harm a fly'. A . neighbour who witnessed the attack saw Quigley land at least four or five blows on Mr Wildeman's upper body or head and repeatedly kick him as he lay on the carpet until a . man was overheard shouting: 'That’s enough.' The victim was so badly injured he had an operation to remove a blood clot from his brain. Thugs: Steven Quigley, 31, left, and his uncle Gary Quigley, right, 43, were jailed yesterday for the savage attack . Scene of the attack: Mr Wildeman was beaten at his terraced house in Blackburn, Lancashire . He . is currently in a rehabilitation centre in Burnley where he is in a . minimally responsive state and doctors say he is unlikely to recover from his . injuries. Mr Wildeman was so badly injured in the attack he was left in coma with multiple fractures to the head and face and needed complex surgery. Now his prognosis is poor and he is being assessed to determine if he is in a persistent vegetative state. He cannot eat, drink, speak or do anything for himself now and will need 24-hour care. Yesterday Steven Quigley was jailed for life after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He must serve a minimum of six years before being considered for release and will remain on licence for the rest of his life. The court heard he had a string of previous convictions for violence including assault, harassment, and criminal damage. Blackburn: A neighbour of Mr Wildeman's described him as a friendly loner who wouldn't hurt a fly . Judge Pamela Badley told Quigley: . 'There is a significant risk to the public of serious injury caused by . you committing further offences. I am unable to say when it will be safe . for you to be released. 'Derek . Wildeman did not say anything that might have provoked you during the . assault and he did not put up any resistance or retaliation.' 'He has suffered . catastrophic injuries and it is evident and it is evident that his life . in any normal sense is over. This was a sustained attack.' Gary Quigley pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm and was jailed for 20 months. After the case Mr Wildeman’s mother Isabelle, 65, said: 'Steven Quigley is not safe to be on the streets for what he did to my son. Derek is now effectively a cabbage and it makes me so sad. Boarded up: The rear of the two-up, two-down where Mr Wildeman lived alone with his two dogs . 'I went to see him yesterday and it’s sad not being able to hear him speak. He hasn’t really made any improvement in eight months. He’s never going to recover properly and will need 24-hour care for the rest of his life and he’s only 42.' 'I can’t come to terms with what has happened to my son. I am at the hospital every day and have been since he was admitted. My only concern is my son. 'What does the future hold? Steven Quigley had effectively killed him in all but name.' A neighbour of Mr Wildeman said: 'The fact is kids were taunting him and setting his curtains on fire. 'They picked on him because he was a loner and he had learning difficulties. He was quiet but he always said hello and was very friendly. He had two dogs and his mum used to visit him. 'He would just go along on his merry way and talk to everyone. He didn’t look like he would harm a fly. - there wasn’t a bad word you could say about him.'","Derek Wildeman, 42, told off boy, 13, after his curtains were set on fire .

Controversy: Argentinian politician Juan Cabandie was filmed making a phone call complaining that he had been pulled over for a traffic offence. The traffic officer who stopped him was later sacked . Video footage has emerged of an Argentine politician who was fined for driving without insurance making a phone call which led to the traffic officer who pulled him over losing her job. Government minister Juan Cabandie remonstrated with Buenos Aires officer, Belen Mosquera, in an unsuccessful bid to escape paying the fine he faced. The footage shows him telling the officer that he was a son of 'los desaperecidos' in reference to his parents being kidnapped by the military junta during Argentina's so-called Dirty War. He told Ms Mosquera: 'You think you are brave, well I am braver. I survived the dictatorship, I am the son of The disappeared.' But an unmoved Ms Mosquera, 28, told Cabandie that she was only doing her job and attempted to get him to sign the fine for driving while uninsured. Cabandie was unaware that a colleague of the officer was filming the exchange and he was caught on camera accusing her of trying to get money out of him in return for avoiding the fine. In the edited clip, he is then seen to make a phone call to 'Martin's office', believed to be Martin Insurralde, the mayor of the Lomas de Zamora municipality of Buenos Aires. He is heard to say: 'Pass this information to Martin, not to get her sacked but so that she gets disciplined , because this is an affront' Within days, Ms Mosquera had lost her job. Although the incident took place in May the footage has only just come to light and has sparked outrage in Argentina. It will do nothing to abate allegations of deep seated corruption that has dogged Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner's party in recent years ahead of a key mid-term election vote later this month. One Facebook user said: 'It's an awesome glimpse into how rotten, abusive and stupidly corrupt these 'Socio-democrats' are.' Cabandie was born in captivity after his mother and father were both abducted by the military junta in Argentina in 1978. Embarrassing: Cabandie is a member of Argentine President Cristina Kirchner's party . At just 15 days old, he was separated from his mother who was being kept at ESMA - an illegal detention centre where prisoners were kept during the so-called National Reorganization Process of Argentina's 1976–1983 military dictatorship. He only discovered that he had been adopted by a new family in 2003. He was elected as a deputy in Buenos Aires in 2007 after running as a candidate for the Frente para la Victoria (Front for Victory) party. Although he was only elected as a reserve candidate, he took a seat when one of his colleagues stood down.","Juan Cabandie tried to get out of fine for driving uninsured in Buenos Aires .

Avonte Oquendo is unable to communicate in words and has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, so his mother, Vanessa Fontaine, recorded her voice in hopes that the teenager would listen to her and walk towards the lights of an emergency vehicle that has been out searching for him in Long Island City.

According . to Kelly, the guard ran into the teenager at the entrance of the . Center Boulevard School and instructed him to return to class, but Avonte left . through a side door. However, Avonte's parents have indicated that they plan to sue their son's school for allegedly failing to keep him safe. Queens Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer and volunteers were out this morning handing out flyers about the missing teen at train stations in Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, and Woodside, according to The Forum.

On Sunday, the reward for Avonte's return had reached $70,000, including $50,000 from an anonymous donation to the group Autism Speaks. Avonte was reportedly spotted at a school festival in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn last Saturday around 5:30pm, reports the Daily Dot. ‘The kid in reference caused a bit of a stir as he stood very close [to the DJ],’ wrote the children’s entertainment company FuziPop on their Facebook page, ‘trying to touch the DJ equipment multiple times.’ Surveillance footage from his school shows Avonte dashing down a hallway and out the door October 4. The search for the boy has now spread across New York City and into outlying areas of Long Island and New Jersey .

Avonte’s brother Danny has helped make the online search go viral in the days since his disappearance. Thousands of followers have been added to Danny’s social media accounts and a Facebook page called Missing Avonte Oquendo has become a virtual hub for the search. Facebook followers have helped get the flier widely dispersed and have even gotten it translated into Chinese and Portuguese. ‘Avonte requires 24 hour supervision. He is 14 in body, but he has the mind of a very young child,’ reads the Facebook page. ‘Avonte has been alone for 10 days. He needs your help. He may appear dirty, he will have gone to the bathroom on himself, he may seem disoriented and no long answer to his name.’ Vigilant: A vigil was held Saturday as the search continued for Oquendo, with a focus on the areas in and around where Avonte was last seen in Long Island City, Queens . Hopeful: Two hundred transit workers fanned out on Saturday and thousands of other volunteers online and on the ground continued to help in the search Sunday. Avonte may have been sighted at a gathering in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn on Saturday . Avonte cannot care for himself and his family says he may appear soiled and has potentially stopped responding to his own name . On the ground, family and friends organized a vigil Saturday and search parties have fanned out from their headquarters in Queens across the city to help bring Avonte home. 'We get leads throughout the day, and whenever we get them, we try to take them seriously,' said Danny Oquendo. 'We call police detectives, then volunteers who go to that area.' Sunday morning, the search seemed to be focused in an area of Queens north of where Avonte first disappeared. ‘We need more volunteers to canvas the Ditmars area with a focus around 19th and 20th Ave between 37th Street and 81st street,’ Danny urged on his Twitter account @KingDetrick. ‘Go in groups!’ Avonte was last seen wearing black jeans, black sneakers, and a grey striped shirt.

Penney has announced it will open its doors on Thanksgiving evening to kick off the holiday shopping season, as the beleaguered retailer hopes to get back in the game for the crucial selling period. The Plano, Texas-based chain will be opening most of its 1,100 stores at 8pm, the same as rival Macy's. The Thanksgiving evening opening is much earlier than last year, when Penney didn't open until 6am Friday. That made the retailer one of the laggards for the unofficial kickoff to the season. Giving thanks for shopping: J.C. Penney, like Macy's, will open at 8pm Thanksgiving evening . Penney is also bringing back a tradition . it ditched last year: it will give away nearly two million holiday snow . globes starting at 4am on the Friday after the turkey feast. 'Obviously, we were one of the last . to open [last year],' said Tony Bartlett, Penney's executive vice . president of stores. But he noted this year, 'We're all in.' He promised that J.C. Penney's deals will be at least as good as two years . ago and will be much better than last year, when Penney gave away . buttons tied to a prize giveaway. Penney is also hiring at least 35,000 seasonal workers for the holidays, nearly 50 per cent more than a year ago. Competitive: The store is hoping its strategy will lead to improved sales . The holiday plan is yet another example of how Penney is unraveling the . strategies of its former CEO Ron Johnson, who was ousted in April after . 17 months on the job amid a botched up plan to reinvent the retailer. Johnson was fired two months after the company announced horrific . fourth-quarter results that covered the holiday shopping season. That . ended a fiscal year, which finished February 2, in which the Penney amassed . almost a billion dollars in losses and a 25 per cent drop in sales. Penney brought back Johnson's predecessor, Mike Ullman, as CEO. He is . restoring frequent sales and basic merchandise that were eliminated by . Johnson who was aiming to attract a more affluent, younger shopper. Uproar: Macy's says that most of its stores will open on the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday for the first time in its history, in a sign of how competitive the holiday season is shaping up . Shares were down 12 cents to close at $7.35 Thursday and have lost 63 . per cent of their value since the beginning of the year. The stock has . lost 83 per cent of its value since early February of last year. Stores are ushering the holiday season earlier every year, creeping into . Thanksgiving. Macy's scheduled 8pm opening on Thanksgiving compares . with its midnight Friday opening in 2012. Last year, Target Corp. opened its doors at 9pm on Thanksgiving, . three hours earlier than the previous year. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the . world's largest retailer, began the early bird specials at 8pm on the . holiday, two hours earlier than in 2011.

Schoolchildren have been attacked by fellow pupils who organised ‘Kick a Ginger Kid Day’, inspired by the cartoon South Park. Youngsters with ginger hair were targeted on their way to classes and inside the building as other students kicked them. Senior staff at the 850-student Wingfield Academy in Rotherham say some students who have carried out the attacks have been ‘strongly reprimanded’. Parents uploaded pictured of their battered and bruised children who were attacked on 'Kick a Ginger Kid Day' Parents set up a Facebook group which has attracted more than 40 members to discuss what had happened to their targeted children . The idea is believed to have been taken from an episode of the controversial cartoon South Park and websites have been set up aimed at organising a ‘National Kick a Ginger Kid Day’. Parents have launched their own Facebook group to highlight the issue and have complained to Academy head Russell Heritage to make sure there is not repeat of the violence. One mother, who asked not to be named, said she had taken her 13-year-old son out of school until she is given assurances there will be no further incidents. She said: 'My son rang me and said kids were kicking him saying it was National Kick a Ginger Kid Day. He was scared so I went to get him out of school. 'My son’s leg is swollen and there are bruises coming through. They said it was going to to be Kick a Blonde Kid Day the day after. Parents are outraged at the vicious attacks, and the school have assured them that some pupils have been 'reprimanded' Parents warned other children not to take part in 'kick a ginger kid' day, which is believed to stem from a South Park cartoon . 'It is both boys and girls who have been carrying out this bullying and I want action from the school to make sure it doesn’t happen again. 'Apparently it has originated from an episode of the American show South Park and websites have sprung up about it.' The unofficial day is believed to have been inspired by an episode of the controversial cartoon South Park. In 'Ginger Kids' Cartmen, the programme's most bigoted character makes a presentation targeting people with red hair, pale skin, and freckles. This leads to the majority of the town discriminating against people with ginger hair, highlighting how easy it is to persuade people to hate another section of society with no justifying argument. Cartman's friends dye his hair ginger while he is asleep and after suffering hateful treatment from the rest of his town, he decides to rally the red-heads and fight those who are not ginger. Eventually, Cartman realises the error of his ways and the town decides to overlook their differences and live in peace. The Kick a Ginger Day website stresses that the whole event is a joke and no one should kick another person. They sell merchandise praising people with red hair and emphasises that the day should not be put into reality.He said: 'I think it’s disgusting. It’s . very upsetting for my daughter. If I went into school and kicked a kid . then I would be arrested. The father of another 13-year-old Year 9 . pupil said his auburn-haired daughter had been singled out for the . bullying and went home with bruised legs.

Amnesty International has urged Iran not to hang a convicted drug smuggler for a second time after he survived his initial execution. 'Alireza M', 37, was pronounced dead after hanging for 12 minutes at the Islamic regime's Bojnourd prison last Wednesday following his conviction for possessing crystal meth. But when his family went to collect the body from the following day, they noticed he was still breathing and rushed him to hospital. Now, in a case branded 'misguided' and 'inhumane' by the human rights group, he is being nursed back to health until he is 'well enough' to return to the gallows to be re-hanged. Iran has the highest rate of executions per capita and puts to death more people annually than any other nation except China. This convicted murderer Hashem Anbarniya was hanged in 2002 . 'Carrying out a second execution on a man who somehow managed to survive 12 minutes of hanging – who was certified as dead and whose body was about to be turned over to his family – is simply ghastly,' said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme. 'It betrays a basic lack of humanity that sadly underpins much of Iran’s justice system.' So far in 2013, the Iranian authorities are believed to have executed . a total of at least 508 people, including 221 executions that have not . been officially confirmed, said the human rights group. Iran is second only to China in the number of people it puts to death for crimes ranging from murder and rape to spying and drug-trafficking. 'Inhumane': It is believed around 200 people have been put to death in Iran since its new president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June . 'It is natural that the Iranian authorities must combat the serious social, security and economic problems relating to drug trafficking and drug abuse,' added Mr Luther. 'But the reliance on the death penalty to combat drug trafficking is misguided and in violation of international law.' One family member told Iran's state-run media: 'When we were told the death sentence had been carried out, we went to collect his body to prepare for a memorial service. 'But when we went to the coroner's office we found him alive again, which made his two daughters very happy.' Once officials were told Alireza M had survived, they put him under armed guard at the hospital to await a second execution. A judiciary official told the state media: 'The verdict was the death sentence, and it will be carried out once the man gets well again.' Iran has executed an estimated 560 people this year - including around 200 that have been put to death since new 'moderate' president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June. Rouhani vowed to end the repression of the previous regime, but human rights groups have said executions have actually increased under his rule. Iran has the highest rate of executions per capita and puts to death more people annually than any nation except China. Many of the condemned are executed for theft, drugs-related offences, not following the rules of Islam or criticising the government. They are often hanged publicly in town centres or from bridges and cranes. Maryam Namazie, of the campaign group Iran Solidarity, said: 'Rouhani was quoted saying he wanted to empty the prisons - it seems the regime intends to do so via executions.'","The 37-year-old was put to death in the Islamic regime's Bojnourd prison .

A man had a tracker fitted to his car by an ex-girlfriend in a year-long ' campaign of harassment and stalking'. Childminder Julie Debra McCully, 43, began stalking Mark Coplen in the summer of 2012 when they split up, a court heard. She kept turning up wherever he was to cause him bother and he was baffled at how she always managed to find him. Julie Debra McCully was given a suspended jail term after stalking and harassing her ex-boyfriend . The moment of realisation for Mr Coplen came when he brother joked that mother-of-two McCully could have put a tracker on his car, Furness Magistrates’ Court, Cumbria, heard. He checked the underside of his vehicle in January 2013 and found the device fastened to it. Police were able to work out through bank details that McCully had indeed bought the tracker. McCully also posted letters to Mr Coplen's children in December 2012, making a false allegation that he had an illegitimate child. Mr Coplen's ex-partner Karen White and his daughter, Leah Coplen, were also stalked. She sent Ms White numerous texts outlining a number of her personal details which would have involved 'going to a great deal of trouble'. Ms White said in a statement: 'I became extremely frightened. The texts identified where I lived, what car I drive, when I’d been out of the house and came home and said ""I’m watching you"".' A statement from Mr Coplen’s daughter, Leah, said: 'Since she started bothering my dad, I started suffering from anxiety and have panic attacks and had to be referred for counselling.' McCully, of Chester Street, Barrow, Cumbria, was yesterday sentenced to 26 weeks in jail, suspended for 12 months. She was found guilty after a trial on October 1 and was convicted of two counts of harassment and two counts of stalking between May 1 last year and May 7, 2013. McCully (right in yellow hood) has been convicted of two counts of stalking and two of harassment . John Appleby, prosecuting, said: 'It became apparent that, strangely, wherever he went, she knew where he was.' Mr Appleby said that, when interviewed by officers, McCully claimed she had bought it with Mr Coplen’s consent because he feared his car was going to be stolen. In his victim impact statement, Mr Coplen said: 'I just couldn’t believe it when I found the tracker. I feel like my privacy has been totally invaded. 'I still can’t believe it. I check my car all the time. I feel almost trapped.' Defending, Trystan Roberts said a previous partner had described McCully as 'generous, warm, unselfish and kind' She also has 'cordial relations' with her ex-husband and has never been in trouble before, according to Mr Roberts. He said she had been a childminder for 11 years and that the conviction could have a 'fatal' impact on her career. She was given a restraining order against all three victims. McCully was also ordered to pay compensation to each, do 200 hours of unpaid work, pay £500 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.","Julie Debra McCully, 43, began stalking Mark Coplen in May 2012 for a year .

Questioned: Morrissey has revealed that he was quizzed by Scotland Yard over his controversial 1980s song Margaret on the Guillotine . Famously private singer Morrissey has revealed that he was quizzed by Scotland Yard over his controversial 1980s song Margaret on the Guillotine. The ex-Smiths star was 'cross-examined' by the force's Special Branch after the song appeared on his debut solo album Viva Hate. It describes Margaret Thatcher's death as a 'wonderful dream' - with lyrics such as 'People like you make me so tired' and 'When will you die?' The 54-year-old musician, who made the revelation in a new autobiography, was 'cross-examined' to determine whether he posed a threat to the then-Prime Minister, according to The Telegraph. His memoir, simply named Autobiography, also discloses details of how his first relationship with a man came in his 30s and how he later discussed becoming a father with a close female companion. Other revelations in the book include Morrissey's experience of being touched by a male teacher in his early teens, his offers of acting roles in EastEnders and Emmerdale and his brush with numerous famous faces. The star revealed he was in his mid-30s when he met Jake Walters at a dinner in Notting Hill. 'Jake and I fell together in deep collusion whereby the thorough and personal could be the only possible way and we ate up each minute of the day,' he said. 'There will be no secrets of flesh or fantasy; he is me and I am he. 'We managed to parrot on non-stop for two years in a jocular fourth-form stew of genius and silliness.' Concern: The 54-year-old musician, who made the revelation in a new autobiography, was 'cross-examined' by the force's Special Branch to determine whether he posed a threat to then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . The singer's 457-page book, which is not divided into chapters, was published at his insistence as a Penguin Classic. This sparked concern among readers and authors alike - with some arguing that the imprint was straying from its typically historically significant work, such as that of Homer, Dickens and Virgil. In the book, Morrissey discusses an incident with a male teacher in his teenage years. He revealed the member of staff took an interest in him - eyeing him up and massaging his hurt wrist with 'slow and sensual strokes'. He also talks about his strong attachment to Iranian-born friend Tina Dehghani, whom he met while living in Los Angeles. The kind people . Have a wonderful dream . Margaret on the guillotine . Cause people like you . Make me feel so tired . When will you die ? When will you die ? When will you die ? When will you die ? When will you die ? And people like you . Make me feel so old inside . Please die . And kind people . Do not shelter this dream . Make it real . Make the dream real . Make the dream real . Make it real . Make the dream real . Make it real . 'Tina is my first experience of uncluttered commitment,' he wrote. 'We take our place together almost without noticing.' Unsurprisingly, the singer's writing is as scabrous as the interviews he has given over the past three decades. He calls his colleague Mike Joyce a 'pounder drummer' when discussing what he thought were the injustices of a lengthy court case in which Joyce and bass player Andy Rourke sought a 25 per cent share of the band's earnings. And he refers to his ex-songwriting partner and guitarist Johnny Marr 'a virtuoso of to-ing and gro-ing, you might swear that you are in the company of identical triplets as Johnny stands before you'. Morrissey provides a forensic analysis of the court case - which he and fellow songwriter Marr lost - over many pages as he takes apart the witnesses, the lawyers and the judge. And he complains about the decision to increase the share of profits afforded to bandmates Joyce and Rourke, which was upheld on appeal. He is particularly venomous about Joyce's extensive legal claims on his royalties claiming he 'grabs all he can', taking '£3 million - or thereabouts' of Morrissey's royalties under a later Smiths deal with Warner Records, which the singer called 'a farce of unimaginable proportions'. The star also talks of his unhappiness with Geoff Travis, the man who signed them to his record label Rough Trade, even though he had not been interested in hearing their demo until Marr insisted. He claims they were poorly treated by Travis, despite the label's success being built on The Smiths. 'There will never be one instance in the Smiths' history with Rough Trade when Geoff would treat the band to a lavish none-too-cheap dinner or salutary clink of earthenware,' he wrote. Morrissey also revealed that he was offered acting roles on popular TV soaps Emmerdale and EastEnders - and could have appeared as the son of Dot Cotton. Finally opening up: Morrissey's memoir, simply named Autobiography, also discloses details of how his first relationship with a man came in his 30s and how he later discussed becoming a father with a close female companion . Despite shedding little light on the mysterious break-up of The Smiths in 1987, Morrissey discloses that he and Marr were 'both drained beyond belief' - adding 'there was no-one around us to suggest that we disappear somewhere to rest, and apart.' He also revealed the guitarist told him at one stage he was ready to reform The Smiths. However, Morrissey dismissed such a move, saying 'Surviving The Smiths is not something that should be attempted twice.'","Morrissey was 'cross-examined' by force's Special Branch after the song appeared on his debut solo album Viva Hate .

Britain should leave the European human rights system if it will not repeal the ban on prisoners’ voting, its most senior official has declared. By continuing to defy the ruling allowing prisoners to vote, Niels Muižnieks, human rights commissioner at the Council of Europe, said the whole system might ‘unravel.’ His strong letter to Nick Gibb MP, who chairs the parliamentary committee looking at the draft prisoners voting bill, is likely to escalate the simmering row with Strasbourg over the issue. Warning: Europe's most senior human rights official said that the European Court of Human Rights, pictured, must be obeyed . He wrote: ‘If the UK, a founding member of the Council of Europe and one which has lost relatively few cases at the Court, decides to ‘cherry pick’ and selectively implement judgments, other states will invariably follow suit and the system will unravel very quickly. ‘Thus, my message is clear: the Court's judgments have to be executed and the automatic and indiscriminate ban on voting rights for prisoners should be repealed. If the court system is to continue to provide protection, there is no alternative to this for member states, other than leaving the system itself.’ The Council of Europe which has 47 members, operates the controversial European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2005 that banning all prisoners from voting was unlawful. But ministers have resisted changing the law with MPs voting by an overwhelming majority two years ago to maintain the status quo. David Cameron said in November 2010: ‘It makes me physically ill to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison’. And last year he insisted: ‘No one should be under any doubt – prisoners are not getting the vote under this government.’ Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘Mr Muiznieks is desperate to defend the international gravy train he has made a living out of. 'I suspect the bleatings of a career European quangocrat will only stiffen the spine of MPs who want to defend British democracy, not European bureaucracy.’ Defiant: Tory MP Dominic Raab said the warning would 'stiffen the spine' of MPs who want to resist Europe's power over them . A ruling by the UK Supreme Court this week dismissed an appeal by two murderers who claimed it was a breach of both the Human Rights Act and EU law to ban them from voting. But, in a significant blow to David Cameron, the judges failed to rule that the UK’s existing blanket ban on prisoners taking part in elections is lawful. The verdict will thus intensify the pressure on ministers to grant at least some convicts the vote – or risk handing out millions in compensation for breaching their ‘rights’. Mr Muižnieks comments were published in evidence to the joint Commons and Lords parliamentary committee considering the prisoner votes, which published a draft bill last year. The bill sets out three options: a ban for prisoners sentenced to four years or more, a ban for prisoners sentenced to more than six months, or continuing to defy Strasbourg. Mr Muižnieks' letter adds: ‘A withdrawal from the ECHR would cast doubt on the UK's commitment to UN values and acceptance of UN mechanisms such as the Universal Periodic Review and treaty monitoring bodies. 'The UK's voice with regard to human rights issues in other countries would clearly be less credible.’ Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Albania are all members of the Council of Europe. The only European nation that refuses to join is Belarus, whose human rights record has been widely criticised. At the Tory Party conference last month, Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling suggested a future Tory government could leave the Strasbourg court.Britain has lost 202 cases at the European Court of Human Rights since 1998.

Michael Anderson said he was 'devastated and disgusted' after unemployed mother-of-five Beverley Concannon was allowed to walk free from court. Jade Lomas-Anderson was killed by the out-of-control animals in the defendant's council house in Atherton, Greater Manchester, as they tried to get hold of a meat pie.

Tears: Michael Anderson said 'We have a life sentence. It has absolutely ripped us apart' after Concannon walked free today . Concannon, 45, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the pets earlier this month after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge her with manslaughter by gross negligence because of a lack of evidence. The mother kept one of her dogs, a big American bull mastiff, in a tiny cage where it went 'stir crazy' along with two other pit bulls and and another bull mastiff which were all kept cooped up in her council house. She was staying the night with Concannon's daughter when the dogs attacked her on March 26 - leaving her with 'horrific' injuries 'from head to toe', Wigan Magistrates' Court heard. Armed police later shot all four dogs dead. Walked free: Beverley Concannon, 46, today avoided a jail sentence despite her four dogs mauling a 14-year-old girl to death in her council house . Dog attack: Concannon, 45, who is on benefits, avoided jail and was instead given a suspended sentence. The mother is pictured, right, leaving court  after her most recent court appearance and, left, earlier in the year before she changed her hair colour . Pc Martin Burkinshaw, who was first on the scene after the 999 call, said: 'I will never forget what I saw.' Concannon, who is on benefits, called her most aggressive bull mastiff Buddy her 'baby' - though it was kept 'crated' nearly all the time . in a cage not big enough for it to raise its head or turn around . properly. The other mastiff Neo lived in the yard and the pit bulls Ty and Sky were confined to the kitchen. The dogs were not walked despite there being a park two minutes from the house, the court heard. But rather than send her straight to jail, the judge instead gave Concannon a 16 week suspended prison sentence, and ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge totaling £165. Jade's family immediately marched out of the courtroom in unison hissing 'disgusting!' once it became clear the dog owner was not going to prison. Her stepfather Michael said: 'I'm devastated and disgusted in the . justice system. Today was just about dangerous dogs. I think she should . be held responsible for Jade. 'We have got a life sentence. It has absolutely ripped us apart.' Paul Taylor, prosecuting, read a statement from PC Burkinshaw who said it was the most shocking incident he had dealt with in his whole career. Victim: Jade, who was staying the night at Concannon's property, had injuries all over her body, the court heard . Dog attack: Jade Lomas-Anderson, 14, of Wigan, was holding a meat pie when the dogs pounced on her in March this year in Concannon's home . 'There was a large white bull mastiff type dog in the yard,' the statement read. 'Its head and mouth were covered in blood and it was bounding around the yard. 'There was also another very large brown coloured bull mastiff type dog. It was also covered in blood, and two smaller pit bulls. They too had blood all over them. 'I felt disbelief and shocked by what had happened. I have not dealt with anything as distressing as this incident in my career and my heart goes out to this girl and her family.' Mr Taylor said the way the dogs had been kept led to the tragedy. Buddy, a Bull Mastiff, was one of four dogs owned by Colcannon destroyed by armed police after the attack . A male Staffordshire Bull Terrier (right) and Bull Mastiff Neo (left) were also involved in the attack which took place in March . Aggressive: One of Beverley Concannon's Staffordshire Bull Terriers which was involved in the attack . Aggressive: Two of Beverley's dogs in the back garden of her council house in Atherton, Greater Manchester. The dogs were never taken out for walks . A report by canine behaviour expert Annette Conn concluded all four dogs suffered chronic frustration, and physical and mental distress. It described Buddy as 'stir crazy'. Mr Taylor said: 'Without exercise and stimulation dogs are likely to become hyper-aggressive. The defendant knows this and this is what happened with fatal consequences for Jade.' The court heard an animal charity had offered to take one dog, Sky, off Concannon, but the defendant, who sold the bitch's puppies for £150, declined. On the day of the incident Concannon had gone shopping, and left her daughter and Jade alone with the dogs. The pair were in a 'dangerous situation' which should never have been allowed to happen, Mr Taylor said. Concannon said she did not want her dogs mixing with people because she wanted them as guard dogs. Scene: Jade Lomas-Anderson was attacked by four dogs at the house in Atherton, Wigan . Police forensics officers arrive to investigate the scene where a 14-year-old girl was found dead . 'No doubt she prized them for their aggressive traits,' Mr Taylor added. Locals had complained before to housing and council officials about how the animals were kept and about their barking, but Concannon was allowed to keep them. Bill Pearson, defending Concannon, said: 'She tells me she would give anything to turn the clock back. 'She has a daughter, that young daughter found Jade Anderson, her daughter will never be the same again and neither will Beverley Concannon. 'I ask you not to take a mother away.' Passing sentence, District Judge Mark Hadfield said: 'The prosecution say the conditions in which the dogs were kept were so inadequate and was a factor contributing to their aggressive and dangerous behaviour. 'You are 45 and have no previous convictions. Through your solicitor today you have expressed remorse and condolences to the family of Jade. 'You are entitled to receive full credit for pleading guilty. You are a sole carer for your daughter. 'In all the circumstances, I have concluded that the sentence I am about to pass can be suspended.' Last month the Crown Prosecution . Service decided not to charge Concannon, who is on benefits, with . manslaughter by gross negligence because of a lack of evidence. They were also unable to prosecute . her under the Dangerous Dogs Acts because the animals were not banned . breeds and the attack happened on private land. The defendant, who is on benefits, instead admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the four dogs between July 19 last year and March 25.

An extremely rare whale distinguished by its long saber-like teeth and preference for sub-arctic waters has washed ashore in Venice Beach between the Venice Pier and Marina del Rey. The female Stejneger's beaked whale, also known as the Saber-tooth whale, washed up overnight Tuesday and was taken for examination to the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. Experts are puzzling over how the species, typically found in the Bering Sea or the freezing waters off Japan, managed to get so far south. Discovery: Heather Doyle, director of Heal the Bay's Santa Monica Pier Aquarium points out shark bites found on the beached Stejneger's beaked whale that washed ashore Tuesday in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles . 'We helped get it out of the water,' Peter Wallerstein of Marine Animal Rescue told City News Service. 'I was kind of shocked because we couldn't identify it.' Nick Fash, an education specialist at the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, told the Los Angeles Times that he was so excited when he got word of the whale Tuesday night that he cycled to Venice 'as fast as he could.' 'These whales are incredibly rare and almost never seen in the wild,' Fash said. Toothy: The Stejneger's beaked whale has distinctive teeth that protrude from its lower jaw . The 14-foot whale was covered with bites from a cookiecutter shark, so called for its habit of gouging round plugs, as if with a cookie cutter, out of larger animals. The Los Angeles County Natural History Museum's Stranding Recovery Team loaded the carcass of the whale onto a . flat-bed truck for examination. Fash told the Los Angeles Times that it is 'basically unheard of,' for a Stejneger's beaked whale to be found in such good condition so far south, so scientists are eager to learn more information about the elusive species through necropsy. Biologists carrying out the necropsy will be seeking information such as how the whale died and what her diet consisted of. Stejneger's beaked whales have long tapering bodies similar to dolphins and the males have tusk-like teeth that protrude from their mouths. Females and juveniles have the teeth, but they're hidden beneath a layer of gum.","A rare Stejneger's beaked whale washed up on Venice Beach overnight Tuesday .

A man whose dog bit a postman has been asked to pay nearly £70,000 of legal fees after a row over the incident ended up in court. After postman Robert Townsend was bitten by pointer-setter cross Rocky as he did his rounds in Fishburn, County Durham, he took on lawyers who offered dog owner Paul Race, 64, the chance to settle out of court for £6,000. When Mr Race contested it, saying his dog only bit the Royal Mail worker because he hit it with his satchel, the dispute ended in a court battle which the dog owner ultimately lost. 'I'm a victim of compensation culture': Dog owner Paul Race, 64, has been asked to pay legal fees of £68,000 . Now he has been sent a bill by the postman's solicitor demanding he pay £68,538.02 in legal fees arising from the case around the bite, which the dog owner's lawyer says caused just a 'minor cut'. Mr Race, a landlord, now fears his home may be repossessed, and says he is victim of a growing trend in Britain to bring no-win, no-fee personal injury lawsuits. He said: 'This [bill] highlights everything that is wrong with the no-win, no-fee compensation culture.' Mr Townsend was bitten by the pet dog in April 2008 as he made his rounds in the village near Sedgefield. Nearly a year later, the postman instructed Leeds-based solicitors Simpson Millar to pursue his grievance against the dog owner, and after two years of legal wrangling, Mr Race was told the postman would agree to settle out of court for £2,000 compensation plus legal fees of £4,061.02. However, disputes over whether the dog belonged to Mr Race or his ex-partner, and differing accounts over what took place when the postman was bitten, resulted in the case going before Middlesbrough County Court in January this year. Centre of the storm: Pointer-setter cross Rocky, who bit postman Robert Townsend in April 2008 . The judge ruled in Mr Townsend’s favour and he was awarded £1,500 compensation, which Mr Race paid. But when he was subsequently presented with a bill of costs totalling £68,532.02, Mr Race said he felt he had no choice but to appeal. The amount, which is still up for negotiation and must be approved by a judge, covers the cost of Simpson Millar's solicitor fees, including the additional money awarded for winning the case, as well as the fees of barristers, medical experts, witnesses and other administrative and legal expenses incurred during the proceedings. Nagam Din, of Simpson Millar LLP, said: 'Mr Townsend was subject to a distressing dog attack and, as such, he is entitled to compensation. 'From the outset, Simpson Millar has sought a swift and reasonable settlement to the case including mediation. 'Against the explicit advice from his solicitor to accept the court’s original decision, Mr Race remained determined to continue the dispute which caused additional delay and associated costs.' Earlier this week Mr Race lost his appeal at the Civil Appeal Court in London.  Now his solicitor says he fears he could be asked to pay even more, and fears losing his house. Lawyer Nathan Horsley, of Hedleys & Co in Sunderland, said: 'Mr Race made the decision to appeal based on Simpson Millar’s fees and the fact he didn’t agree with all that was said,' he said. 'We didn’t charge Mr Race to represent him at the appeal as we felt he was a victim of the no-win-no-fee compensation culture.'","Royal Mail worker Robert Townsend bitten by pointer-setter cross Rocky .

It comes amid complaints about reheated food, broken rides and cancelled stage shows. Hundreds of Brits have shown their support for the petition, which has 5,147 signatures so far. Scroll down for video . Petition: Thousands of people have signed a petition against Disneyland Paris (pictured) in France, amid claims it is 'seriously damaged' and 'literally falling apart' The document demands higher standards at the kingdom, which it claims is not living up to the 'Disney' standard. It has been addressed to Bob Iger, chief . executive of the California-based Walt Disney Company, which owns 39.8 . per cent of the French resort. 'The upkeep of parks, attractions and hotels has been neglected so often during the past 20 years that many facilities are not ""Disney standard"",' it reads. 'Many themed elements are decaying and crumbling, while others are literally falling apart.' Jake Howarth, from London, was one of the Brits to sign the petition. He said: 'I have long been a visitor to Disneyland Paris, and over the last few . years have sadly seen a decline in a number of things, all of which have . been mentioned in the petition. 'What strikes me about all of the Disney . resorts I have visited is that, no matter where people are from, the one thing that remains the same . world over is the Disney magic. 'Therefore, I feel it is unfair that . Disneyland Paris has been allowed to decline so sadly, and its visitors . are allowed to experience what I believe is now an inferior experience.' Tim Nightingale from Chatteris in Fenland, Cambridgeshire, added: 'I expect value for money and having stayed there a number of time, I feel the value has dropped with each subsequent visit.' On parade: Cartoon characters Mickey and . Minnie entertain crowds at the French resort . The petition, which was sent to Mr . Iger earlier this week, was started by Belgian theme park enthusiast . Guillaume Gallant, who claims he was disappointed by his latest visit to . the park. He told The .

He also claimed that food in one of the resort's most expensive restaurants appeared to have been re-heated. 'We . received our dishes in less than five minutes which is obviously too . short a time for our food to have been cooked after we ordered,” said Mr . Gallant. The petition, which has been . translated into six languages, claims the park's fast food outlets are . steep in price and cannot compete with other nearby restaurants, such as . McDonald's. It also highlights the 'early' closing times of the resort's restaurants. 'When . Disneyland Park closes at 11pm, you would expect to be able to have a . nice evening dinner, not to discover the restaurant closed at 7.30pm,' it reads. 'These short . opening hours make it impossible to book a meal for later in the day - . you either have to plan ahead or settle for counter service offerings in . Disneyland Park or Disney Village.'

Paris, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, has long been . considered Europe's number one tourist destination. Despite a rocky beginning - seeing low visitor numbers and financial problems - the park went from strength to strength and now houses five themed lands, featuring 49 attractions. Last year, it saw a record 16 million people go through its ornate iron gates - giving it nearly as many visitors as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre combined. However, it has always been considered a poorer imitation of its sister resort in Florida, which has three times more parks and considerably better weather. The petition, which claims the park's quality has been sacrificed in a bid to boost attendance figures and reduce costs, is another blow for Disneyland Paris, which has recently been the subject of much controversy. Earlier this year, Euro Disney, the company that runs Disneyland Paris, and two former gendarmes were fined 150,000 euros for using spying tactics on candidates applying for jobs at the theme park. And last year, an array of the park's cartoon characters went on strike over low wages, . Disneyland Paris was unavailable for comment. The petition, titled 'Save Disneyland Paris, has been launched in a bid to restore the French holiday park to its former glory. The resort opened its ornate gates for the first time in April 1992. It has highlighted a range of issues at the park, which it claims is 'literally falling apart', including: . Maintenance .

British military operations are at risk of being undermined by the march of European human rights laws and health and safety red tape into the battlefield, experts have warned. Enemies could view the courtroom as a new front in any future conflict as a way of 'paralysing' the armed forces, a report by the Policy Exchange think tank said today. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted he was 'concerned' about recent court judgements which could make it 'more difficult' to carry out operations. 'Mobile coffins': The family of soldiers killed in Iraq won the legal right to sue the Ministry of Defence for damages in a landmark case. They included those killed while patrolling in Snatch Land Rovers (pictured) In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court said in June that the families of soldiers killed in Iraq could launch claims for damages under negligence and human rights laws. Lawyers representing relatives said the ruling meant the Ministry of Defence owed a duty of care to properly equip servicemen and women who went to war. The government warned the decision could put national security at risk because it opened up war to 'the uncertainty of litigation'. An Iraqi man who claims he was abused while being held captive by the British Army in Basra is among those taking legal action against the government. Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the . radical Shia cleric, Moqtada al Sadr’s militia, is claiming compensation after 'being denied his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Another Iraqi, Ali Al Jedda, is also taking action after Britain. He was arrested travelling from London to Iraq . in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in . weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He denies the charge. He sued the government citing Article 5 . of the convention. His claim was dismissed by Britain's Supreme Court but the case was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights. Tom Tugendhat, one of the authors of . the Policy Exchange report and a former military assistant to the chief . of the defence staff, said: 'Over the past decade, legal steps based on . the European Convention on Human Rights have undone safeguards . Parliament drew up to ensure military commanders have the freedom of . manoeuvre to make vital decisions on the ground. 'The armed forces neither are, nor . should be, above or exempt from the law. But, imposing civilian norms on . the military is deeply misplaced . 'The focus on rights misunderstands . the nature of armed forces. As the ultimate guarantors of a nation’s . liberty they have agreed, voluntarily, to surrender or limit many of . their own rights. Without this the nation would be undefended.' Laura Croft, a retired US Army . lieutenant colonel and military lawyer, who co-wrote the report, said: . 'These judicial incursions into military terrain are not just changing . military ethos and long-standing legal principles. 'They are placing impossible burdens on the bureaucracy of military operations. 'By setting precedents which can barely be satisfied in today’s limited conflicts the courts risk paralysing themselves and the military in a war of national survival particularly when to these are added the demands of coroners’ inquests, health and safety legislation and the rights guaranteed under the ECHR. 'The paperwork alone would simply overwhelm the Ministry of Defence even if the findings of the eventual inquiries ascribed no blame.' 'Human rights creep': The report authors warned against the march of human rights and the laws of negligence into the battlefield. They said that the long-standing principle that military commanders have freedom of action while in action is at risk of being undermined . The report said the MoD faced 5,827 claims in 2012-13 and lawyers cost the cash-strapped ministry £36 million a year. It claimed: 'It may not be long before . either a foreign power or sub-state forces might begin to sponsor legal . actions as a way of paralysing the armed forces through legal process.' Martyn . Day, a lawyer with Leigh Day, a company which has fought high profile . cases against the MoD dismissed the report's findings as 'biased'. Abuses: The report authors, who warned of the creep of human rights laws into the battlefield, acknowledged abuses have been committed by British soldiers - including the death of Iraqi detainee Baha Mousa in 2003 . 'This is an entirely biased report which seems to have been written with the full co-operation of the MoD. 'We were not consulted and neither were our clients. Had we been, we believe this report would have been far more accurate. 'The report states that the customs . and practices of Britain’s armed forces are now under threat from the . law. 'We would argue that it is the breaking of these laws which is the . greatest threat to those who ""risk all for their country"". 'This includes not training or equipping soldiers adequately before putting service personnel into a combat zone. 'We find it very disconcerting that . the Government of law and order seem so intent on desecrating the legal . system, ignoring the safeguards the law provides for all individuals and . continues to act unlawfully through its many departments including the . MoD. 'Greater adherence to the laws, both domestic and international, are the only way in which the MoD's litigation will decrease.' However, Mr Hammond welcomed the report and said: 'I remain concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgements. 'These could make it more difficult for our troops to carry out operations in the future, and they potentially throw open a wide range of military decisions to the uncertainty of litigation. 'It cannot be right that troops on operations have to put the European Convention on Human Rights ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national security.'","Family of soldiers killed in Iraq were told they can sue in landmark ruling .

Theft: Paul Dale, a father of six, has had £30,000 worth of gold stolen from his home in Wales . Mr Dale, 45, was not insured and so is unable to claim any compensation for the loss. The father of six inherited 12 1oz bars of gold and three coins from his mother when she died of cancer two years ago. He kept them in a red velvet bag next to his plates and dishes - but when he drove his girlfriend home to Devon on Sunday, he left a window open allowing burglars to enter the flat. Mr Dale, a former soldier who can only do menial work after suffering two strokes, believes the thief must have known where to find the gold. 'You would not have seen it unless you knew it was there,' he said. 'They were in a deep dish.' Angry: The 45-year-old was keeping the family heirloom in a velvet bag in his kitchen cabinet .

'I started to panic and look around my home. He added: 'I turned the house upside down looking for it. Where could I keep it but at home?

Jayne Rand, 48, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after stealing 905 handbags in three years . A mother-of-two has been jailed for 18 months after she stole 905 handbags over a three-year period. Jayne Rand, 48, went into department stores across the UK leaving with luxury handbags on her shoulder, a court heard. Her lawyer admitted she had become 'almost addicted to stealing high-value bags' as she was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Newport Crown Court heard that Rand, of Purton near Swindon, Wiltshire, had committed the crimes to 'fund her lifestyle'. She targeted department . stores including Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis before . selling the bags on eBay. David Wooler, prosecuting, said: 'Her usual method of theft was to go into the store without a bag, pick up one from the display, walk around with it on her shoulder for a while, then simply walk out of the store. 'Sometimes she would have to remove the security tag, but usually she wouldn’t have to.' Police went on to her eBay account and 'found a significant number of designer handbags', which were priced 'competitively', he said. Mr Wooler added: 'Her house was full of sealable grey delivery bags and Post Office receipts. 'She set up a legitimate business and no one, not even her husband, knew what she was doing. 'Rand told police she needed money to fund her lifestyle.' Newport Crown Court heard Rand made £88,000 from eBay customers. But Mr Wooler said the total value of the bags she took could be 'in excess of £130,000'. She sold handbags designed by Radley, Ted Baker, Gucci and Bailey and Quinn. Her crime wave was brought to an end when two security guards caught her in the House of Fraser outlet in Cwmbran, South Wales. Rand admitted theft and told police she had stolen more than 900 handbags between 2009 and 2012. They said she would routinely target House of Fraser stores. Officers were later able to trace Rand's criminal ventures around the country by analysing CCTV from other stores she'd visited. Rand, of Purton, near Swindon, Wiltshire, also admitted stealing four purses. Rand targeted department stores across the UK walking out with the bags on her shoulder . Brands including Radley, Ted Baker, Gucci and Bailey and Quinn were taken by Rand between 2009 and 2012 . The court heard Rand started stealing after the property business she ran with her husband got into financial difficulty. Her planning consultant husband, Philip, and her grown-up daughters, Gemma and Amber, did not know she was shoplifting the bags. Andrew Taylor, defending, said: 'She became almost immune to the feeling of wrongdoing. 'She was almost addicted to stealing high-value bags in an attempt to keep the ship afloat. 'She never expected to find herself in such dire circumstances and out of desperation took this course of action.' Rand with her husband Philip who, along with his daughters, knew nothing of the crimes . The court heard Rand will sell off some of her properties to recover the money. Judge Rhys Rowlands said: 'You made a business of stealing over a protracted period of time and you must face the consequences. 'This was a remarkably serious raft of thefts which only ended when you were caught stealing a valuable handbag from a store in Cwmbran. 'How you got away with it for so long without being caught was deeply remarkable.' He said she showed 'professionalism' in her crimes and suggested that is why it took three years for her to be caught. 'You travelled the country with the . sole purpose of theft and you made a successful albeit dishonest . business of selling stolen handbags,' he said. 'The values are quite outside of what the court comes across even from professional shoplifting gangs. 'It’s . sad and unusual to see a woman of 48 with previous good character up . before the court for such a protracted and serious dishonesty.

After being left to die of his wounds in the San Borja de Alameda park in the Chilean capital, Daniel was found at 4am by a police officer and taken to hospital where he died 25 days later. Speaking to El Mercurio newspaper, Ivan Zamudio, Daniel's father, said: 'Of course I will not forgive them.' Judge Juan Carlos Urrutia said the four were guilty of a crime of 'extreme cruelty' and 'total disrespect for human life.' Presidential spokeswoman Cecilia Pérez said: 'Nothing can change the tremendous pain suffered by Daniel's parents, but there's no doubt that . today some tranquility has finally reached their hearts.

'We're satisfied with this ruling. There's a before and an after the Zamudio case,' said Rolando Jimenez, president of the Gay Liberation and Integration Movement. 'It generated such outrage because of the brutality, the hate, that it helped raised awareness. 'We've witnessed a cultural change that finally led to an anti-discrimination law.' The law had been stuck in Chile's parliament for seven years since it was proposed, as hardline campaigners failed to agree on the wording. Ivan Zamudio told the El Mercurio newspaper that he won't forgive the killers for what they did to his son . Even after the horrific killing of Daniel, the motion only passed by two votes. The law defined illegal discrimination as 'any distinction, exclusion or restriction that lacks reasonable justification, committed by agents of the state or individuals, and that causes the deprivation, disturbance or threatens the legitimate exercise of fundamental rights.' Daniel was the second of four brothers and had hoped to study theatre before he was murdered. The sentencing of the four men will take place on October 28.","Daniel Zamudio, 24, tortured and beaten on March 2 last year .

Families whose houses are to be demolished to make way for the government's controversial high speed HS2 rail link are outraged after being told they could live in mobile homes. Residents of the picturesque hamlet of Weeford in Staffordshire were stunned when a senior property acquisitions manager told them 'You could live in caravans' at a meeting between villagers and HS2 Limited. Their village has been earmarked for demolition to make way for the £43 billion route meaning dozens of residents living on green belt land could have their homes reduced to rubble. Residents of Weeford, in Staffordshire, which will be razed to make way for HS2, were told to live in caravans . Accountant Jonathan Loescher is furious at being told to live in a caravan by an HS2 representative . Stunning countryside: The high-speed rail link will go past the pretty hamlet of Weeford in Staffordshire . Villagers had said they wanted to remain living together as a community, replicating their village elsewhere in the area.  But for that to happen they needed all 12 of the homes to be demolished, so they could obtain planning permission to build in a green belt area. This . summer HS2 Ltd committed to demolishing all of the houses, clearing the . way for the community to approach Lichfield District Council for . planning permission for replacement homes . However the rail company has now stalled, telling anxious residents they may have to wait at . least three years before a final decision will be made. And at a meeting on Friday, the suggestion was put to villagers that they could live in caravans until then. Today locals living in the hamlet, where the average price of a property is £600,000, reacted with anger to the suggestion made at Friday's meeting that they should live in caravans. Accountant and smallholder Jonathan Loescher, who lives in a detached house in the village near Tamworth, said: 'Am I supposed to run my accountancy business from a caravan and keep my sheep, ducks, turkeys and chickens in the caravan with me? Place of worship: St Mary's Church in the hamlet will see its entire community relocated from their homes . The end is nigh: Many of the village's houses (average price £600,000) will be demolished for the new rail line . Around half of the hamlet's 12 homes are currently destined to be knocked down while the others will overlook the line . 'HS2 Ltd and the Government are completely out of touch with the problems residents affected by the scheme are going though. 'We just want to be able to get on with our lives.  We have been living under the threat of demolition for four years now and we face another three years of uncertainty. 'We came up with a viable plan, that is covered by law and supported by MPs and the council, but they won't go along.' Mr Loescher said HS2 had originally promised residents they would knock all the houses down so they would be able to relocate 'like for like' nearby. But he said he and other residents had now been told they might not get permission to rebuild until just before the bulldozers move in. The father-of-two said: 'We told them we needed to move beforehand, so we can set up, build our new houses and run our lives. Villagers are outraged to have been told to move into caravans while they wait for a decision on their new homes . Unsettling: Residents in the pretty Staffordshire village want to be relocated nearby as a whole community . 'But during the meeting they said they couldn't do that.  The man from HS2 was asked what we should do and he just told us to move into caravans. 'My wife went berserk. It was just ridiculous. They don't care about us, about how our lives would be ruined.' He said said villagers were fed up of the rail firm 'evading and prevaricating' when they were trying to resolve the problems caused by the proposed rail line. Weeford resident Pete Bennett, 53, said 'We have spent hours in spurious meetings and consultations with HS2 Ltd and achieved nothing because it is clear that HS2 Ltd are refusing take into account the plight of those whose homes and businesses are being destroyed by the scheme.' A spokesman for HS2 said: 'We met residents including Mr Loescher to discuss their aspirations for their village, including safeguarding their land which will enable them to apply for full compensation. 'The comment regarding living in caravans was part of a general discussion around several options for people who are relocating or in the process of building a new home. 'We remain committed to reducing to a minimum the impact of HS2 on the local community and environment in and around Hints and elsewhere. 'This will be covered in the formal Environmental Statement which will be submitted to Parliament and published for consultation alongside the hybrid bill at the end of the year.'","Much of Weeford in Staffordshire will be demolished to make way for rail link .

A sacked PCSO who is suing London's Metropolitan Police for discrimination has successfully argued . Rachida Sobhi is suing Scotland Yard for disability discrimination after she was turned down when applying to become a PC due to failing a background check which revealed that she had a criminal record for stealing . she did not know she had amnesia when she failed to declare a conviction for theft. But a tribunal has reserved its decision on several key points that will determine whether her claims against the police force are ultimately successful. Rachida Sobhi, 43, took the Metropolitan Police to court after she was denied a role as a police constable in December 2009, claiming she was discriminated against because of a disability. She was denied the job - and has since been sacked - because she was reprimanded earlier that year for failing to declare a conditional discharge for theft in 1991. But Ms Sohbi had since argued at the time she did not remember being arrested because she suffered dissociative amnesia stemming from personal trauma she had experienced around that time. A preliminary hearing at the London Central Employment Tribunal today was tasked to determine whether Ms Sobhi knew she had amnesia when she filled out the security form and whether she should have mentioned that on the form. Ms Sobhi said she wasn't aware when she filled out the form and only had any recollection at all she might have been arrested when she was contacted by a vetting officer in February 2009, about two months after she filled in the security form, to ask why her fingerprints were in the police database. 'For some strange reason... I had a couple of small flashes of memory - nothing else,"" she said. 'I still did not know of the existence of the dissociative amnesia then. I didn't even know what on earth he was talking about.' Miss Sobhi also told the hearing that she felt the Met did not support her after she discovered her memory loss. 'I just had a feeling that some sort of assessment need to be done. It is not very nice experience to go through - they refused to provide me with medical assistance. 'Without the help of my family and . seeking psychiatric assessment I could have spent the rest of my life . not knowing what was going on with my memory. 'February . 26 (2009) was the first time I was aware there was an allegation of . theft that had resulted in the receipt of a conditional discharge.' Ms Sobhi said she only had any recollection at all she might have been arrested when she was contacted by a vetting officer in February 2009 . She added that she did not know what other memories had been lost because of the 'traumas' she had suffered making her condition 'long-term'. Not specifying the issues, she said: 'I don't know how many memories are still lost in my mind. They have to be triggered - that is the impairment. 'I have come to accept that I am going to have to live with this for the rest of my life, waiting for the trigger moment, or hopefully not.' As a result of failing to reveal her conviction for theft, believed to involve stealing £20 worth of makeup from a Brixton department store while she worked there as a cashier in 1991, Miss Sobhi was given a reprimand by the Met. She says that because she had a justifiable medical reason why she did not reveal her criminal record, she should never have received it. Miss Sobhi believes that she would never have been sacked if the reprimand was not on her record and should now be wiped off. Judge Sigsworth expressed his surprise it remained and said that the Met should look into removing it from the record.'She has genuine dissociative amnesia. Clearly it should be removed from the record,' he said. Charles Sparling, representing Metropolitan Police, said he accepted Ms Sobhi's amnesia was real and she did not know about it at the time. But citing medical evidence, Mr Sparling argued Ms Sohbi's disability was not long-term and she was not discriminated against because of it. Once she realised she had amnesia, it was no longer a disability impacting her work, he argued. However, Ms Sobhi said she had to live with the knowledge that certain triggers could spark repressed memories at any time, which rendered her amnesia an ongoing, long-term disability. Mr Sigsworth reserved his judgement over the point. 'This is not an easy case,' he said. How Ms Sobhi's disability is defined will affect up to five separate claims she has made against the Metropolitan Police. The latest claim came after she was fired following a disciplinary hearing into an £80 littering fine she received for throwing a cigarette butt. Ms Sobhi said she would never have been sacked if the reprimand was wiped from her record. She argued because she had a justifiable medical reason why she did not reveal her criminal record, it should have been. The reprimand still remained on her record, she told the tribunal. Mr Sigsworth said he thought it should not have remained there. 'She has genuine dissociative amnesia... (so) it clearly should be removed from the record,' he said. Both parties have been given a week to send Mr Sigsworth submissions over the point in contention. Ms Sobhi had previously asked for the hearing to be heard in private, arguing her reputation was being damaged by her case being reported by media. Mr Sigsworth rejected the request.","Rachida Sobhi has successfully argued she did not know she had amnesia when she failed to declare a conviction for theft .

Cheat: Samantha Myatt has been banned from going out on weekends after defrauding the taxpayer of £16,000 in benefits . A benefits cheat has been banned from going out at the weekends in a bid to stop her going abroad after she spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money on foreign holidays. Samantha Myatt claimed to be an unemployed single mother in order to claim a total of £16,000 in fraudulent benefits, which she spent on travelling to Spain at least twice a year. But in fact the 39-year-old was working as a kitchen assistant and living with her partner, who received a pension from his former employer. She has now been handed a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to cheating the taxpayer. Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court heard yesterday that Myatt was caught out after investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions received a tip-off. Jacky Bramley, prosecuting, told the court Myatt first started claiming benefits in 2004, when she said she was a single non-working parent looking after her disabled child. In October 2005, her partner Neil Britton moved in with her in Wednesfield, West Midlands - but failed to declare that he had a company pension. Two months later, Myatt found work as a kitchen assistant and a second part-time job at Gala Bingo. Ms Bramley said Myatt had deposited large sums of money into Mr Britton's account, including £3,000 in August 2010 and £68,000 in December 2010. Mahmood Hussain, defending, told the court Myatt had got into debt and was aware of the seriousness of what she had done. Myatt pleaded guilty to six counts of failing to notify a change in circumstances and three of falsely making a statement to obtain payment or benefit. Sentenced: Myatt was given a suspended prison sentence at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court, pictured . She was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay costs of £2,265. Judge Graham Wilkinson also imposed a curfew on Myatt stopping her going out on Friday or Saturday night for six months in case she tries to go on holiday. 'You have lied and lied again all the way through this investigation,' he said. 'You were spending your ill-gotten gains on life's luxuries.'","Samantha Myatt, 39, claimed to be an unemployed single mother .

Lita Morgan, who was adopted when she was two-years-old, has now spoken out after her mother was convicted of cruelty against her . A woman subjected to a decade of abuse at the hands of her cruel adoptive mother has spoken of her ordeal for the first time. Christine Morgan forced her adoptive daughter to drink bleach from a cloth used to clean toilets during her ten-year reign of terror. The violence also included holding the child’s head under the bath water until she couldn’t breathe and threatening to kill her. Lita Morgan, who was adopted when she was two-years-old, has now spoken out after her mother was convicted of cruelty against her. Miss Morgan, 27, reported the crimes to police after suffering post-traumatic stress, caused by the abuse, as an adult. She said: 'I never want a child to suffer in the way I did. Nobody capable of such violence should be able to adopt a defenceless child. 'I feel let down and angry that I was left to suffer at her hands for so long. Social services could have saved me but they missed the signs and believed every word she said. 'I doubt I will ever get over what happened to me but I hope speaking out might save another child from the same hell I went through.' Miss Morgan was adopted at the age of two, but the abuse started when she was four-years-old. She said: 'For as long as I could remember mum had treated me differently to my brother who was also adopted. 'I was kept locked in my room and dressed in dirty clothes. If I asked for something to eat she would slap me in the face. 'I was bullied and teased at school for being smelly but she didn’t care.' Miss Morgan, 27, reported the crimes to police after suffering post-traumatic stress, caused by the abuse, as an adult. She is pictured here as a baby with her adoptive mother Christine Morgan . Miss Morgan once asked her mother why she treated her so badly. 'She told me she had wanted to adopt twin baby boys but they had gone to another mother and she got left with me instead. 'I wondered why she had gone ahead with the adoption if she didn’t want me. I dreamed of her taking me back to a children's home so another family could have me. 'I didn’t understand what I had done so wrong for her to despise me as she did.' As she grew older Miss Morgan said the beatings got worse and her adoptive mother often left her covered in bruises. 'She would grab me around the throat and tell me to die. Miss Morgan was adopted at the age of two, but the abuse started when she was four-years-old . 'It wasn’t unusual for her to smack me until my skin was bright red and pull my hair out in clumps.' One day Morgan held her adopted daughter's head under the bath water, leaving the young girl fearing she would die. 'I really thought that was it. I came up gasping for air lucky to alive.' Another time her mother forced a bleach soaked rag used to clean toilets into her mouth. 'I . had been playing on the stairs and she just got angry and grabbed me . and dragged me into the bathroom where she had been cleaning. 'I never want a child to suffer in the way I did. Nobody capable of such violence should be able to adopt a defenceless child' - Lita Morgan . 'She had the dirty rag in her hand, got me in a hold and rammed it into my mouth. 'It was burning like acid and I was gagging. Eventually I managed to escape from her grip to run to my room and throw up.' Miss Morgan claims there were several missed opportunities to rescue her from the abuse. She said: 'One day two women turned up from social services. The school must have told them about my bruising. But mum was a good actress and told them I was just clumsy so they went away again. 'I remember breaking down because I knew then I was never going to be saved.' She said Morgan’s husband also colluded with her to keep the abuse hidden by backing up her lies. Miss Morgan said: 'I was upset but I never blamed him. I could see he was afraid of her too and I honestly think he didn’t know how bad it was because most of it happened when he was at work. Christine Morgan (pictured) was convicted on two cruelty charges at Southampton Crown Court last year . 'He was also scared of losing me because he knew social services would take me away if they knew about the abuse.' It was only after he passed away when she was 17 that Miss Morgan found the strength to leave. 'Without dad the abuse got even worse. I couldn’t take anymore. I confided in a friend who let me stay with her.' Eventually she found a job and a flat and worked all hours to block out the memories of her childhood. But, she said, no matter how hard she tried, she could not forget. She said: 'I suffered flashbacks and nightmares. I would dream I was six years old again with my head under the water gasping for breath.' Her GP referred her for counselling, but Miss Morgan says talking about the abuse made the flashbacks even worse. One day she suffered a breakdown and found herself at her local police station asking for help. She said: 'For the first time someone listened. I made a statement and mum was arrested.' Christine Morgan, 61, appeared at Southampton Crown Court last year. She denied the charges and Miss Morgan gave evidence from behind a screen. During the hearing Elizabeth Bussey-Jones, prosecuting, said: 'She describes from a very early age being subjected to various forms of verbal abuse, being told by Christine Morgan that she hated her, that she was a waste of space and that she wanted to kill her. 'She recalls various acts of violence towards her which vary from being pinned up by the throat against a wall, being smacked and having her hair pulled.' The jury found her mother guilty and she was convicted on two cruelty charges. Morgan was warned to expect jail but because of her failing health Judge Gary Burrell handed her a 12 month suspended prison sentence and ordered her to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. She was also told to pay £1,500 in costs. Miss Morgan has now said: 'I was devastated by the sentence. It didn’t seem fair for what she put me through. But it helped me accept that there was nothing wrong with me and I did not deserve the abuse. 'I was a child who needed a loving home and instead I got placed with that lunatic. 'She didn’t know the first thing about being a mother and should never have been allowed anywhere near a child. 'I am sharing my story because I don't want anything like this to happen to another vulnerable child.'","Lita Morgan was forced to drink bleach from a cloth during years of abuse .

She moved into the prison 12 years later when she was 50, holding individual counseling sessions, leading pep rallies at the prison church, and doing countless small tasks for inmates over decades. Known as 'Prison Angel,' she lived in a cell with a view of the guard tower. Located at the end of the dark hallway, it barely had room for a cot, desk and folding chair. She moved out in her final years as her health declined but remained a regular presence at the prison and a beloved figure among Tijuana's powerful and powerless until she died. late bloomer: Sister Antonia took her vows at 50, after her second marriage was over and her children were grown. Too old to join a religious order, she made a private pact with God, moving to the prison in March 1977 . Legacy: Her biggest legacy is with the murderers, drug smugglers, thieves and other convicts at La Mesa. She brought bandages, soap and medicine and left with messages to their loved ones . Charity: Sister Antonia Brenner embracing Eloisa Mendoza Peregrina, who suffers from leprosy. Brenner abandoned her life of rare privilege and has lived and work in the notorious Mexican La Mesa State Penitentiary since 1977 . Brenner was born Mary Clarke in Los Angeles, the second of three children. Her father made a fortune selling office supplies to defense contractors during World War II. The family lived in Beverly Hills and had an 11-bedroom, ocean-view summer home in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles. Later, she moved to Ventura County, her last home before the prison. After two failed marriages, Brenner immersed herself in charity work and was deeply influenced by a Los Angeles priest named Anthony Brouwers. When she became a nun in 1977 — 13 years after Brouwers died — she named herself Sister Antonia in his honor. Brenner didn't hesitate to intervene in thorny conflicts at the prison, which is marred by a history of violent clashes, including one in 2008 that left about two dozen inmates dead.

So silence comes, explanation comes and arms go down.' Brenner also counseled and supported prison guards and police, creating Brazos Abiertos, or Open Arms, a group that provides financial support and holiday meals to families of slain Tijuana police officers. Alberto Licona, Tijuana's deputy police director and president of Brazos Abiertos, said Brenner founded the group in 1997 after an inmate confided with her about killing a police officer and she sought to help the victim's family. Her biggest legacy is with the murderers, drug smugglers, thieves and other convicts at La Mesa. She brought bandages, soap and medicine and left with messages to their loved ones. In 2007, the city renamed a street for her adjacent to the prison. 'Even when her health was in decline, she always found time to attend to them,' Licona said. Brenner often visited her family in .

Two teenagers are facing criminal action after taking part in a 'dare' to engage in a sex act inside the school cafeteria at lunch - while another student filmed the incident on a smartphone. The first-year-students at Etowah High School in Woodstock, Georgia have been charged with public indecency after the incident, which happened on October 10. School spokeswoman Barbara Jacoby said a female student had allegedly 'made a sexual offer to a male classmate during lunch'. Two students at Etowah High School in Georgia have been charged with public indecency after engaging in a sex act in the school's cafeteria. The school said 'appropriate disciplinary action' will also take place . Gawker.com reported the male student involved initially believed the offer to be a joke. Ms Jacoby's statement said the male student later claimed that 'when the female student began to act upon it... he stopped her.' Students at the school said the girl had been 'dared' into performing the act. One pupil told WSB-TV that a video of the act started to circulate around the school shortly after it took place. 'The guy who recorded it, he sent it to people... a lot (of people),' the student said. Another added: 'I don’t think it’s a responsible thing to do, but knowing our generation, you know, we don’t really think before we act and we just send it off.' A third student told the TV channel that the students 'stacked up a bunch of books and book bags' around them, to hide their behaviour. She added: 'Students at the next table had no idea what was going on.' The TV channel reported the teenagers, not named because they are under the age of 18, have not returned to class since the incident. The school confirmed they have been charged with misdemeanor public indecency and Ms Jacoby added: 'appropriate school disciplinary action also will occur'. The statement said: 'Two juvenile Etowah High School students were charged with misdemeanor public indecency for an incident that occurred on October 10. 'Appropriate school disciplinary action will also occur.' When asked where adult teachers were at the time, the spokeswoman told 11Alive that only six to eight employees staff the cafeteria during lunch and are mostly there to ensure students do not leave.","Teenagers have not returned to school since the incident on October 10 .

High-flying: Businesswoman Sarah Davison has been awarded £1.6million in damages after her career was cut short by botched post-birth surgery . A high-flying banker whose career was cut short by botched post-birth surgery has been awarded more than £1.6 million in damages. Businesswoman Sarah Davison gave birth to her first child Freddie at Portland Hospital, London, in December 2008 with the help of an episiotomy - a surgical incision used to enlarge the vaginal opening. However, only two weeks later, the 36-year-old started to experience agonising pain, severe difficulty controlling her bowels and an inability to stifle wind. The procedure had caused a third degree tear, which was not spotted after her consultant obstetrician Craig Leitch failed to carry out a 'proper' examination, London's High Court heard. After realising the extent of Mrs Davison's injury, Mr Leitch then carried out 'plainly insufficient' repair work at the private hospital in Great Portland Street, said Mrs Justice Andrews. He also failed to keep a clear record of what he had done. 'It appears that there was no proper . examination carried out post-delivery, so that the severity of the tear . remained undetected and thus it was not made the subject of immediate . surgical repair and treatment with antibiotics,' she said. Mrs Davison, who was a vice president of Credit Suisse in Canary Wharf, London, before going on maternity leave, has since been left in mental and physical pain - meaning she can no longer work in the financial sector. Despite undergoing reconstruction surgery and other treatment, she has been left with significant ongoing symptoms causing her embarrassment, inconvenience and distress, the court heard. Driven: The 36-year-old had been vice president of Credit Suisse in Canary Wharf, London . Mrs Justice Andrews said that the . mother-of-three has adapted well to her condition - however, the . experience has taken its toll on her mental health, particularly her . ability to cope with stressful situations. She said Mrs Davison was an intelligent, able and articulate woman who had secured a place on the prestigious . Goldman Sachs training programme after graduating from Warwick . University with a first-class degree. By 2006, the businesswoman had risen to the position of vice president at Credit Suisse in Canary Wharf - where she earned a net salary of 10,700 a month before taking maternity leave. At the time of Freddie's birth, she had every prospect of returning to the pursuit of a highly successful career in the city, said the Mrs Justice Andrews. A 'horrendous' experience: Mrs Davison gave birth to her first child Freddie at Portland Hospital (pictured) in Great Portland Street, London, in December 2008 with the help of an episiotomy . Lawyers for Mr Leitch admitted . liability in July this year and agreed to pay damages for Mrs Davison's pain and suffering, . future medical and surgical costs and psychiatric care. But they contested Mrs Davison’s claim for loss of past and future earnings and congenial employment. However, Mrs Justice Andrews rejected the defence case that Mrs Davison’s failure to return to work was not a result of her injury but a lifestyle choice - instead awarding her £1.59million, as well as interest and her legal costs. 'This is a case in which Mrs Davison’s injury has put paid to her ability to return to any form of work in the financial sector and severely limited the nature of any future employment,' she said. 'Many of her undoubted talents are going to go to waste. Her future is uncertain and any work that she does undertake in future is likely to be fairly solitary and considerably less well paid.' After the case, Mrs Davison said she was relieved that the legal proceedings had come to an end. However, she said it was 'hugely disappointing' that she had been forced to invest five years fighting to understand what happened during Freddie’s birth at the hospital. 'As yet, there has been no apology from Mr Leitch despite an admission of medical negligence,' she said. 'I hope that my case can benefit other women looking to minimise unnecessary risk at childbirth and enjoy safe and effective care.' Shivi Nathan, a medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell, who represented Mrs Davison, said: 'Sarah suffered a horrendous, life-changing injury as a result of this doctor’s negligence, which is shocking and simply not acceptable. 'Sarah chose to go through private care for the birth of her son thinking it was the safest option for her but, from the care she received from Mr Leitch, this couldn’t have been further from the truth. 'The consequences of his actions will stay with Sarah forever and mean she can no longer work in the profession which she worked so hard in. 'Sarah was on the path to even greater success and this was simply cut short by the actions of Mr Leitch.'","Sarah Davison, 36, suffered a third degree tear after having an episiotomy .

A prison officer whose career was ended after an inmate plunged a broken bottle into her back has spoken of her relief that all guards are to be issued with stab vests. Claire Lewis recalls how she ‘almost died’ when she was attacked by convicted triple murderer Kevan Thakrar three years ago. But she says she could still be working in one of Britain’s top security jails if ministers had offered routine stab vests sooner. Victim: Frankland Prison Guard Claire Lewis was left scarred for life after a horrific attack with a broken chilli sauce bottle by convicted killer Kevan Thakrar . Scarred: The broken bottle created a one inch hole in Claire' back and chipped her spine . A review is being carried out into giving frontline staff ‘covert clothing’ to protect from knife attacks launched by prisoners, MailOnline revealed this week. The number of prison assaults involving knives has doubled in a decade, with staff at risk of being deliberately attacked by inmates or getting caught up in fights. One morning in March 2013 Claire and fellow guard Craig Wylde unlocked Thakrar’s cell door at Frankland Prison, a Category A jail in County Durham. Thakrar, serving three life sentences for murdering three men with a machine gun over a £10,000 drug debt, lunged at Craig with a broken chilli sauce bottle, tearing open his upper left arm and severing an artery. ‘Then he turned on me,’ Claire remembers. ‘He used a broken chilli sauce bottle. It snapped in my back and it almost killed me. ‘Had I had protective equipment I wouldn’t have suffered the injuries I suffered.  It left me with a hole about an inch deep and it chipped my spine. ‘As a result I subsequently was medically retired, I have got PTSD. I have lost my career,' she told MailOnline. Attack: Kevan Thakrar, serving three life sentences for murder, was cleared of the attempted murder of Claire Lewis and fellow guard Craig Wylde. A campaign poster (left) against violence in jails featured a graphic picture of Clair's back after the attack . Claire, who lives with her partner Ged Mulheran and two daughters aged 18 and 15, said the attack had a ‘massive impact’ on the entire family, including ‘missing out’ on the years when her children were studying for exams. ‘Now I am on a cocktail of medication as well to assist with pain relief. I used to be physically fit and now I really struggle to do anything without suffering the consequences.’ The decision to issue prison guards with stab vests round the clock comes just two years after the government insisted it was not necessary. Last year alone there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in England and Wales involving a knife or blade, up from 127 in 2002. Protective vests and gloves are usually only used when trouble breaks out in jails or if prison officers believe there is a serious threat to their own safety. But now prisons minister Jeremy Wright has revealed that the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) which runs the country’s jails is now ‘assessing the benefits and feasibility’ of issuing vests routinely. Growing problem: There were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in England and Wales involving a knife or blade last year, up from 127 in 2002 . Claire added: ‘It is very humbling to see that the government has finally made the right decision to issue staff with the right equipment. ‘I am over the moon to be honest because I don’t think members of the public actually realise what goes on inside those prison walls. ‘There is a need for protective equipment because the number of assaults is increasing. ‘We are dealing with some of the worst and most hardened criminals in the country. I think the prison service is kind of the forgotten service. ‘Once you are in those walls nobody knows exactly what you deal with on a daily basis.’ After the attack on Clair and Craig, Thakrar was cleared of attempted murder by a jury at Newcastle crown court. He claimed he had been a victim of a culture of racism at the jail and launched the attack in self defence after years of abuse.","Claire Lewis scarred for life by attack by triple murderer Kevan Thakrar.

A promising student has been jailed for stalking his ex-girlfriend and threatening to drown her in a lake after she broke up with him. Adam Love bombarded aspiring doctor Gabrielle Onions with 200 phone calls, 400 text messages and 74 emails in just 14 hours after she told him their relationship was over. When the 26-year-old's pleas were ignored, he started to send his ex increasingly threatening messages, a court heard. Jailed: Adam Love, left, has been sentenced to eight months in prison for stalking Gabrielle Onions, right . Couple: The pair met when they were both studying at the University of Wolverhampton . In one text, Love told Miss Onions, 21, he would throw her into a lake and watch her drown while he had sex with another woman. The defendant, who was once named his college's 'student of the year', blamed his actions on steroids he was taking to improve his performance as an amateur bodybuilder. He met Miss Onions when the pair were both studying at the University of Wolverhampton, but she broke up with him because he was 'too controlling'. Love, from Tipton in the West Midlands, was yesterday sentenced to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to harassment at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Harassment: Love bombarded Miss Onions with messages and threatened to drown her in a lake . Traumatised: Miss Onions, 21, says she is living in fear following her ex-boyfriend's stalking campaign . 'What you did was totally unacceptable,' said recorder Leo Pyle. 'You dominated her life and when she ended your relationship, you started the campaign of harassment in which you threatened her life. 'You subject Miss Onions to a barrage of threats and taunts and she had been beside herself with fear.' Love was also given an indefinite restraining order which bans him form contacting Miss Onions or going near her home in Wednesfield. Gerard Brady, defending, said that Love had been taking steroids around the time of the incidents. Award: Love was once named 'student of the year' when he was at a further education college . 'They led to him behave in an appalling way,' he said. 'It was persistent behaviour but no violence was ever used. 'He knows what he did had a devastating effect on his victim.' Speaking after the case, Miss Onions said that the ordeal had jeopardised her medical studies, and criticised the 'lenient' sentence. 'I was living in fear and I still am,' he said. 'He became more aggressive and more controlling. I want to try and put this behind me and move on. 'I don't think eight months is enough for the stress and emotional strain it has put on me. He blamed steroid use in court but he was aggressive when he wasn't on them. 'It had a huge impact on my studies.

Lorenzo Riggins proved that the customer is not always correct when he called police because his McDonald's order was shorted by one burger. Riggins said he was hungry Tuesday night when he entered a McDonald's in East Albany, Georgia. He ordered seven McDoubles, one McChicken and a fries. Clueless: McDonald's customer Lorenzo Riggins was arrested when he called 911 over a botched order. He didn't realize it was illegal to call 911 when it wasn't an emergency . But when he got out to his car he realized that they got his order wrong: there were only six McDoubles in the bag. So he went back in and asked for his order to be corrected, but the person behind the counter wasn't giving out service with a smile. 'She was trying to get an attitude with me and I said I'm going to call the police,' Riggins told WALB. Riggins carried out that threat relaying his story to 911 operators. They heard out his story, asked him where he was and asked him to wait at the McDonald's. Attitude: Riggins was shorted a burger at this McDonald's in East Albany, Georgia - and when employee behind the counter refused to correct it, so he called police . When officers showed up, instead of confronting the McDonald's employees they arrested Riggins for misusing 911. Arrested: Riggins spent a night in prison for the call . 'I called the police and thinking that everything all cool by calling the police, I didn't know I was misusing 911,' he said. Riggins was booked and spent a night in the Doughtery County Jail. The next morning, a judge dropped his case saying the night in jail was enough punishment for the crime. 'It's really not funny. It's not,' Albany EMA and 911 Deputy Director Jim Vaught said. 'A person who was waiting to get a call in for an ambulance of a car wreck is having to wait - possibly.' Vaught told KSDK that calling 911 is no joking matter, and does come with the threat of arrest if you misuse the line. 'The thing you need to understand is that we have their telephone number and we have their voice recorded and we will turn it over to the police department and you will be prosecuted,' Vaught warned. While he's upset about the incident,Riggins said that it won't stop him from eating at McDonald's again. 'I would like to say check your food before you leave, always be careful when you go buy food anywhere you go,' advised Riggins.","Lornezo Riggins said employees at a McDonald's got his order wrong by one burger .

A retired NHS manager came within inches of death after a bullet was fired at him during a struggle with a gunman at a luxury holiday hotel. Peter Norledge, 70, and his wife Christine were staying at Cape Town's Waterfront Victoria Junction as part of a 48-strong British tour group. The couple were enjoying a late night cup of tea just before retiring to bed when a man knocked on their door claiming he was there to check a problem with the ventilation. Recovery: British tourist Peter Norledge, 70, was left inches from death after battling a hotel room intruder who beat him around the head with the gun barrel . Brave: The armed robber had tricked his way into Mr Norledge's luxury hotel room in Cape Town, South Africa, where he had been staying with wife Christine . Recalling the struggle from his hospital bed, Mr Norledge, from Derby, said: 'It sounded like housekeeper who had just delivered us some milk for our tea. 'I thought he had come back for some reason. But it was a different bloke who said he had come to check the ventilation. I let him in and the next thing I knew I was looking down the barrel of a gun. 'He instructed my wife and I to lie face down on the bed but I refused. He then pushed me and demanded money. I opened the room safe and he grabbed two bags of jewellery I had just purchased. 'I wasn't prepared to let him take them so I tried to hold on to his wrist and he then grabbed my wallet. I then tried to grab that back from him and that's when we started fighting. 'I was afraid but I also didn't want him to get away with it. But he got the upper hand when he started to hit me with the barrel of his gun. Blows rained down and I covered my head with my hands. 'Then a shot went off. I don't know if it was accidental or if he fired it to scare us. The bullet hit the ceiling and ricocheted onto the floor where it was later found by police. 'While the robber was hitting me I heard Christine screaming at him to stop hurting me. I think her screaming frightened him off.' Destination: The Victoria Junction Hotel in Cape Town where Mr and Mrs Norledge had been staying as part of a 48-strong British tour group . Christine, 60, who had been screaming at the robber during the attack, called reception for help. It was only then that the gunman fled. Drenched from head to waist in blood, Mr Norledge was later rushed to a Cape Town hospital where he underwent two hours of neurosurgery to repair a depressed fracture of his skull. He also received sutures to a number of lacerations on his face. The brave pensioner is still recovering in hospital and will only be discharged in the next few days. He was attacked at around 8pm on Friday. The couple had been due to leave South Africa with the rest of the tour group on Monday but will only return to the UK once he is fully recovered. Destination: Mr Norledge and his wife Christine had been staying at a plush hotel on Cape Town's waterfront (file picture) Mr Norledge says although he was scared during the ordeal he only started to fear for his life when the shot was fired. 'That's when I thought he might kill us.' But despite a dream holiday spoilt at the very end, he has no regrets about standing up to the robber. 'What do you do otherwise? Stand there meekly and hand everything over?' Meanwhile Cape Town detectives are still searching for the suspect who is in his mid thirties. He stole Norledge's wallet containing about 400 South African rand (about 25 sterling) and £300. Police have compiled an identikit of the suspect and have obtained hotel CCTV footage of him knocking on doors on the fifth floor before he proceeded to the fourth floor.

According to new research by Spanish scientists prehistoric man had discovered that using a mixture of frayed and sharpened sticks to clean his teeth after a meal gave him healthy gnashers long after other animals had lost theirs to decay. It was the start of man's ability to live longer than other members of the animal kingdom, giving him time in which he could learn and invent, thus laying the foundations for modern civilisation. By gum! The primitive toothbrush was used to clean the teeth of food after meals, and also kept gums healthy be regular grooming . The groundbreaking discovery was made by scientists at the Catalan Institute of Human Palaeoecology and Social Evolution in collaboration with the University Autonoma of Bellaterra and the Council of Valencia. They found that the primitive toothbrush was not only used to clean food from between teeth after meals but, in doing so, made for healthier gums and therefore a longer life. They worked out the regularity with which prehistoric man used the rudimentary toothbrush by  tracing the marks made by the wood on the teeth of various jawbones from throughout the ages. For tooth! The regular cleaning using sticks was demonstrated by the marks the wood made on the teeth meaning healthy teeth for longer, and that meant longer life, said researchers . Earliest evidence of the removal of food debris from between teeth was found by the team in 'Homo habilis', who lived between 1.9 and 1.6 million year ago. The latest research made in fossil remains of Neanderthals shows that sticks were also used to  'ease the pain ' caused by several oral diseases. The researchers published an article in the journal Plos One, 'Toothpicking and periodontal disease in a Neanderthal specimen from Cova Forada of Valencia '.

A group of self-confessed ‘non-traditional mothers’ are putting out a calendar to help spread the word about their organization and to help tackle people’s perceptions of what a mom should look like. The Tattooed Hippie Pirate Mommas movement was formed in July 2011 and describes itself as a group for ‘anyone who is or loves a tattooed mom.’ It was founded by Stacy Willingham, a mother of two from Denton, near Dallas. Meet the mommas: Elin Adcock, left, is a computer support professional and mom of three by day, while Brook Ray, right, is mom to a two-year-girl, a chef and wine shop owner . Ashley Jones, left, is a mother of two and wife to a former Marine, while Azure Hardy, right, is a senior at the University of North Texas, majoring in Anthropology and a mom . From humble beginnings it has rapidly spread to include branches in San Antonio, Austin, Denver, California, Missouri, New York and is even going international with two branches launching soon in London. ‘I became a stay-at-home mom when I had kids. I was just really wanting to meet other moms, and I joined a local playgroup for moms with toddlers and babies,’ Willingham told SFGate. ‘The first meetup I went to I felt so out of place because I was the only one with tattoos and piercings, and the other moms seemed more reserved where my personality was a little more loud.’ As well as the groups in different locations, the Tattooed Hippie Pirate Mommas also has a thriving online presence on social media sites including Facebook and Meetup.com and now has over 700 members. Skye Weatheread, left, runs the Taschen Library in downtown Dallas and is a mom of two boys, while Stacy Willingham, right, is the founder of Tattooed Hippie Pirate Mommas and a professional writer, she is married with three kids . Lori Peniston, left, is an Interior Designer/Artist and single mom to a three girl, while Stephanie Hopkins, right, is the mom to two daughters and plays roller derby for North Texas Derby Revolution under the name ‘E'wok O'Shame’ Willingham thinks the reason the group is gaining popularity, online and off, is because people understand her vision. ‘I think we're breaking a stereotype. Just because we have tattoos doesn't mean we can't raise amazing children,’ said Willingham, who has 15 tattoos. In fact not all members are tattooed or pierced, but the one thing they do have in common is that they didn't feel comfortable in more traditional mommy groups. Willingham says there are core values which set member of the Tattooed Hippie Pirate Mommas apart from other more traditional groups. ‘Members have to be open-minded and fearless. We are renegade women who aren’t afraid to speak our mind and are raising our children to help run the world,’ she told Mail Online. Ashley Ellsworth, left, is a stay-at-home mom to two boys and her fiancé, while Ashhlye Soto is a 22-year-old married stay-at-home-mom to Eden, aged one . Anni Weir, left, is a married hairstylist with a son, Noah, while Amanda Servis, right, is a hairstylist and single mom to a son also called Noah. She did the majority of hair and makeup for the girls who modeled for the calendar . The group does a lot of the same things any other moms playgroup do – going to the park, play dates, picnics, going to the mall, girls nights out – but they also have got together to have tattoo parties. The members of the chapter in Denton recently put together a calendar to benefit multiple charities in their local area for the second year running. As well as raising money for good causes, the calendar was also a good opportunity for the moms to meet up and enjoy some all-important ‘me’ time. ‘Most of us are stay at home moms who don’t often get the opportunity to dress up and feel beautiful,’ said Willingham. ‘At the photo session for the calendar I had moms coming up to me saying that they felt gorgeous and had had the best time.’ Amber Fergason, left, was one of the mommas from the San Antonio group to take part, while Stephanie Meier, right, is a hairstylist and single mom to daughter Wren, 2. She also did hair and makeup for the girls in the calendar . Dawn Dreyer is a Dallasite, artist, DJ, social butterfly and mother to a brilliant 12-year-old little lady. By day she's a computer wiz, pushing parts & pixels, crunching numbers. In her spare time she puts energy towards her love for music and arts. You can see her grooving behind the turntables to her beloved DubStep, using power tools to create her 3D projects, paint brush in hand before an open canvas or dancing to her favorite tunes at music festivals . The calendar has a 1950s pinups theme and was very professionally done by Courts Griner Photography, it was shot on location with hair and makeup specialists to give it an authentic feel. ‘The project also has a wider aim to break down stereotypes and show that there are different types of moms that you might not see on a regular basis and that they are great parents too,’ said Willingham. She admits that she and other members have experienced strangers telling them that they are setting a bad example for kids, but she strongly disagrees and argues that she and the other Tattooed Hippie Pirate Mommas are raising more open-minded and accepting children. Combating bullying is a key issue for the group and their golden rule is that members must be respectful of others.

That's kind of our motto,’ Willingham said. ‘We have each other's backs. We're like family, honestly.’ The group’s name also has meaning: .

Pirates - took their codes of loyalty very seriously, never turning their back on each other; they faced other pirates as a group, and their success depended on being a united front. They made their own rules and laws and did what they wanted.

Sitting in the studio audience, Gordon Ramsay’s daughter watched her father’s latest television interview with pride. Until, that is, the topic of conversation shifted to her. The famously forthright chef revealed that he has been checking  up on whether the 15-year-old is doing her exam revision – with the help of a spy camera he has installed in her bedroom. Keeping tabs: Gordon Ramsay with his daughter Megan last year in California . Close: The father and daughter were also photographed shopping in LA earlier this year . A close eye: Though Megan seemed delighted by her shopping spree here, the new revelations are likely to prove less welcome . Ramsay disclosed in an interview with Jonathan Ross how he enlisted the help of his 13-year-old son Jack to keep tabs on daughter Megan. He said: ‘Megan’s 15, she’s here tonight with her boyfriend. ‘They’ve been spending a lot  of time in her room recently.  But revising. ‘Revising … They seem to be spending a lot of time revising  and yet the results aren’t … . Spy-cam: Ramsay said he paid his son Jack to secretly install a Go-Pro camera in Megan's wardrobe . ‘I’ve been a bit naughty over the last couple of weeks because I got Jack a little Go-Pro. One of those little secret cameras. ‘So I said to him, “Look mate, here’s twenty quid, go and target your big sister’s room and put that camera right at the top left-hand side of the wardrobe”. ‘So, Megan, I’d like to talk to you about your revising …’ Go-Pro is a brand of high-definition personal cameras. The Scottish chef’s move is a controversial one – and not only in Megan’s eyes. Last year, US college student Aubrey Ireland was granted a civil stalking order against her parents due to their overprotective behaviour that included installing monitoring software on her electronics. Ramsay, 46, and his wife Tana, 38, have four children from their 16-year marriage. Jack has a twin sister, Holly, and Matilda, 11, is the youngest in the family. The chef is known as a fitness fanatic and recently took part in an Ironman competition, which involves a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile bike ride and a half-marathon. Iron man: Ramsay took part in a grueling triathlon competition last week . Ripped: The chef prides himself on his success, and joked that he would give Jamie Oliver a Michelin star if he could follow in his fitness footsteps . It led Ramsay to issue a challenge to fellow chef Jamie Oliver on the Jonathan Ross Show, which will be shown on ITV tomorrow. He told Ross: ‘If he completes an Iron Man, I’ll give him a Michelin star.’ Ramsay has been awarded 15 Michelin stars in total, and currently holds 12.","TV chef made the unnerving confession in an interview with Jonathan Ross .

This is the dramatic moment a brave police officer grabs his shot colleague and pulls him to safety during a stakeout with a gunman. Despite the rain of gunfire the brave policeman dodged the bullets to get wounded officer Paul Hutchison to safety. The identity of the heroic Mephis Police Tactical, or TACT, Unit officer is unknown,however, it was believed that Mr Hutchison, who was shot in the thigh, would have been killed were it not for the actions of his quick-thinking colleague. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hero: This is the dramatic moment a brave police officer grabs injured Paul Hutchison and pulls him to safety during a stakeout with a gunman . Shooting: Officer Paul Hutchison was shot as he tried to arrest a suspect wanted for attempted murder . Safety: The unnamed officer then dragged Mr Hutchison behind a parked car and out of the line of fire . Mr Hutchison and his partner had been trying to arrest suspect Aaron Dumas, who had barricaded himself inside his home in Memphis, Tennesse, USA, when the shot which injured Mr Hutchison was fired in the stakeout. Mobile phone footage taken at the scene shows the moment Mr Hutchison was shot, before the other officer comes to the rescue. He was being hailed a hero today, after managing to drag Mr Hutchison, who has served with the Memphis Police for 15 years, behind a nearby vehicle. Following the shooting Dumas, who police believe was also behind the shooting of another officer from the elite TACT unit, Timothy Jackson, torched his home in the south of the city while still inside. His body was later found among the charred remains of the house, slumped inside a bath. Mr Hutchison and Mr Jackson, who was shot in the leg just hours before his colleague, were both said to be recovering from their ordeal after they were both released from hospital. Waiting game: The police officers had been engaged in a stand off with the suspect when Paul Hutchison was shot . Dumas had been wanted by police on attempted murder charges after a woman, believed to have been his girlfriend and her brother were shot in an argument earlier this month. They were both treated in hospital and described by medics as being in 'good condition'. The shooting was believed to have been sparked when police officers threw tear gas into the home, with Dumas firing back, hitting Mr Hutchison. Mr Jackson, who has been with the TACT unit for five years, had been shot four hours before the second attack on Tuesday. Neighbour James Wihite, 79, had been walking close to the scene when officers first tried to enter Dumas's home. 'I heard one shot,' Wilhite told Memphis newspaper The Commercial Appeal. 'Immediately following that, I heard a volley of shots. Then immediately after, an officer came out limping, supported by another officer. He was limping, noticeably in pain.'","Officer Paul Hutchison shot by stand off with attempted murder suspect .

The neighbor of a doctor accused of murdering his wife with a cocktail of prescription drugs has demonstrated how she found the woman's 'greenish pale' body in a bathtub after the couple's six-year-old daughter begged her for help. Martin MacNeill, 57, is accused of . killing his wife, Michele, after convincing her to get a face-lift and . giving her the drugs during her recovery so he could continue his affair . with their children's nanny. In court in Provo, Utah on Friday - the second day of the trial - prosecutors used a model of the bath where she was found wearing only a black shirt in their Pleasant Grove home on April 11, 2007. The couple's neighbor, Kristi Daniels, . testified on Friday that she found Michele listless body in a bathtub wearing . only the shirt and with skin that was a 'greenish pale' color. Reenactment: Kristi Daniels leans over bathtub to describe Michele MacNeill's body position when she was called to the home for help in 2007 during the trial of Martin MacNeill in Provo, Utah on Friday . She had raced to the house after the couple's six-year-old daughter, Ada, knocked on her door and said simply: 'My dad needs some help.' When Daniels went to the house, she could hear MacNeill's screams from outside. She went to the bathroom, where MacNeill said he needed a man's help to get her out and she called her husband Doug, who also testified on Friday. Despite their efforts to revive her, Michele was pronounced dead two hours later. Kristi said that a few day later, MacNeill told her his wife had died of natural causes. 'He told me she had died of a heart problem, like a basketball player that had just died suddenly on the court,' Daniels said. Accused: Martin MacNeill, pictured in court on Friday, is accused of killing his wife with a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs so that he could continue a year-long affair with his children's nanny . Testimony: Daniels, who lived next door, said she ran to the home after their six-year-old asked for help . Both of the Daniels testified that they only became aware of Gypsy Willis, the children's Nanny, being around the house after Michele's death. Doug said that he first saw her 'a week or two' after Michele died and would later see Willis and MacNeill running errands or taking trips together without the children. In the trial on Friday, there was also testimony from a dispatcher, police and paramedics. The 911 dispatcher who handled MacNeill’s call, Heidi Peterson, testified that they initially had to guess where to send emergency responders as MacNeill was so frantic they could not understand him. A recording of the call shows him . desperately begging for help and rudely dismissing the dispatcher. He . also hung up the phone on her despite her pleas for him to stay on the . line. Together: His wife Michele, a former beauty queen, was found dead at their home in April 2007 . Case: Prosecuter Chad Grunander, left, and Defense attorney Randy Spencer talk during a recess in the trial on Friday. Prosecutors had brought in a replica tub of the one where Michele was found . Prosecutors said . MacNeill was hell-bent of forcing his wife to have a face lift and then . pressed the plastic surgeon for drugs she didn't need so that he could . give her the fatal dose. Medical examiners can't determine exactly how the 50-year-old woman died. A doctor who examined her before the face-lift testified she was generally healthy. Defense attorneys say it was from heart disease, not because of any actions of her husband, although they acknowledged during opening statements that he wasn't the easiest defendant to identify with. 'Martin has made poor choices in his life. He had affairs during his marriage,' defense lawyer Susanne Gustin said in her opening statement. 'We may think he's a total jerk and disgusting. And that's natural. But decide this case on the facts rather than the emotion.' Frantic: Also on Friday, Heidi Peterson, the 911 dispatch manager who answered his call, testified and said that she could often not understand MacNeill as he was so frantic. He also hung up on her . MacNeill, 57, was charged in August 2012, nearly five years after his wife was found in the couple's Pleasant Grove home. The . case shocked the Mormon community of Provo, 45 miles south of Salt Lake . City, because the suspect was a doctor and had been a church leader. He was clinical director at the Utah State Hospital but has surrendered his medical license. The drugs his wife was taking weren't common for someone getting a face-lift, the surgeon, Dr. Scott Thomson, testified on Thursday. He said he would not normally prescribe Valium or Oxycodone, among other painkillers and sleeping pills, for recovery, but did so 'because Martin was a physician and he asked me for these things'. Affair: Michele, left, was allegedly killed so that her husband could continue his affair with the children's nanny, Gypsy Willis, right. They had been seeing each other for a year-and-a-half before the death . Family: MacNeill had worked as a Mormon bishop and had eight children, pictured, with his wife . Michele required only antibiotics, and he advised her to use painkillers sparingly, Thomson said. Von Welch, another doctor who examined Michele MacNeill before cosmetic surgery, said her husband was eager to 'get things going'. Welch was surprised the couple rejected his advice to put off the surgery until she got her high blood pressure under control. The MacNeills had eight children, and their oldest daughters have been outspoken in their belief that their father killed their mother. Rachel MacNeill and Alexis Somers have gone on national TV with their claims and sat in his court hearings holding up photographs of their mother. They insist his motive was the affair.","Martin MacNeill, 57, is accused of forcing his wife Michele, 50, to have a facelift so he could kill her with a lethal combination of prescription drugs .

A Florida woman returned home this week to discover a baby who had been left on her doorstep - but local officials insist it was all a big misunderstanding. The little boy was strapped into his car seat that was placed just outside Lynn Cattanio's Naples home. Inside a diaper bag left nearby the 39-year-old woman found a note supposedly written by the infant's mother. Scroll down for video . Confusing situation: This infant boy was found on the doorstep of a home in Naples, Florida, Tuesday morning, but authorities claim he was not, in fact, abandoned . Shocking discovery: Lynn Cattanio (left), 39, returned home earlier this week to discover an infant (right) strapped in his car seat outside her home . ‘[It] said that we looked like a loving family,’ she told the station WBBH. The Collier County Sherriff’s Office had initially launched an investigation into allegations that someone was possibly trying to sell the newborn before dropping him off on Cattanio's doorstep. The claims, however, later proved to be unfounded, leading the agency to conclude the probe. The Naples resident, who operates a local candle shop, recalled a bizarre encounter that happened over the weekend - just days before the shocking discovery. ‘This lady walks by with a little white Maltese. All of a sudden, within 10 minutes, we knew her life story,’ Miss Cattanio said. The child was left on this doorstep along with a diaper bag containing a note from his mother . The woman said that the stranger allegedly mentioned that she had a daughter who recently had a baby, but refused to care for it and wanted to sell it for $10,000. After coming upon the baby boy outside her home Tuesday morning, Cattanio went over to a nearby motel where she believed the infant's family were staying, but they were nowhere to be found. Misunderstanding: A sheriff's office spokesperson suggested that Cattanio may have misread the situation, mistakenly believing the the child had been abandoned . The following day, the owner of the Naples inn confirmed that a family matching Cattanio's description had been renting a room there for a week. ‘[The family] didn't alarm us, but seems like she had some kind of issue,’ the motel proprietor said. Sometimes we see they all are arguing.’ In a bizarre twist, Cattanio said that after she called the authorities to report that someone had left a baby on her doorstep, the infant's grandmother suddenly showed up at her home and took the child back. But as soon as the unnamed woman got into her car and started pulling out, she was surrounded by a dozen sheriff's deputies. Friday morning, however, a spokesperson for the Collier County Sheriff's Office told MailOnline that it all has been a misunderstanding, and that the case had been closed. Public information officer Michelle Batten said that the boy had not, in fact, been abandoned, but declined to provide additional details on the case.

Two pregnant woman miscarried after a jealous friend poisoned their drinks, a court in Austria has heard. Secretary Angela Maier, 26, was desperate to have a baby of her own but suffered three miscarriages. The depressed woman was consumed with jealousy when she then learned that her sister-in-law and best friend were pregnant. Maier told a court in Klagenfurt, Austria: 'I couldn't stand the thought of them having babies who would be growing up when mine was dead. 'Mine should have been with them as well, but instead mine died while theirs went on.' She was suffering from depression as a result of her loss and the sight of her friend's impending births. The woman cruelly poisoned the expectant mothers' drinks with medicine she was prescribed after her miscarriage. The court heard how the woman and her best friend had become pregnant at the same time, and had been shopping for baby clothes and planning together. The friend said: 'I asked for a glass of water, and she said she had a special drink for pregnant women, that she didn't need any more. 'A short while later I started to bleed, and then I lost the baby. When I found out what she had done, I wrote back and told her she was a murderer. I can't forgive her.'

When 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was discovered murdered in her basement in 1996, many were quick to suspect her parents of carrying out the crime. As it turns out, a grand jury voted in 1999 voted to indict the young beauty-queen's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, but then-Boulder, Colorado District Attorney Alex Hunter decided not to prosecute - a revelation first reported this year by the Boulder Daily Camera. But that evidence may soon be public record thanks to a judge who ruled yesterday that the indictment should be made public, unless the current DA can make a compelling case for keeping them secret. Scroll down for video . Time for transparency: A judge ruled yesterday in favor or releasing the 1999 grand jury indictment against John (left) and Patsy (right) Ramsey, parents of murdered 6-year-old pageant-queen JonBenet . Murder mystery: 6-year-old JonBenet was reported missing on Christmas Day 1996, and discovered dead in her home's basement the following day. The case remains unsolved . Current DA Stan Garnett will make his case against releasing that indictment mid-week next week.  His office has argued in the past that releasing the documents would constitute a 'beach of promise' to the grand jurors. 'The issue raised by the plaintiff's request and the lawsuit are more important than any one case,' said Chief Trial Deputy Sean Finn. 'Every grand juror and every witness who appears before a grand jury, takes an oath of secrecy, and every witness and grand juror is promised that those involved in the process will honor that oath.' Their decision: Members of the grand jury are pictured in October 1999. They eventually voted in favor of indicting John and Patsy Ramsey . No action: But the grand jury's indictment was never prosecuted since then-District Attorney Alex Hunter didn't believe he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Mr and Mrs Ramsey committed the crime . But Weld County Judge Robert Lowenbach ruled yesterday that it would not be a breach of grand-jury privacy to release the document and instead said that it was in the public interest to see the thought process behind the DA's decision. 'This court agrees that transparency of a prosecutor's decision not to proceed with an indictment from the grand jury is in the public interest,' Judge Lowenback wrote. 'Recognizing that the grand jury's ""indictment"" is not requited to be supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, but that the district attorney cannot proceed with a prosecution unless he has a reasonable belief that he can obtain a conviction, the process followed in this case offered citizens no opportunity to consider the conflict between the decisions of the prosecutor and the grand jury.' So DA Garnett will have to find another reason to keep them out of the public. Then and now: Then-District Attorney Alex Hunter (left) decided not to act on the grand jury's indictment. Current DA Stan Garnett (right) will argue to keep the indictment sealed next week . 'This is a complicated legal issue,' Mr Garnett said in a statement Thursday. 'My office is reviewing the court's ruling very carefully and will make a determination how to respond by middle of next week.' The Thursday ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed last month by Daily Camera reporter Charlie Brennan and a press advocacy group. They believe that the indictment is a criminal justice record that 'reflects official action' by the grand jury and should be disclosed. The indictment and ensuing lawsuit are just the latest bend in the legal back-and-forth between the criminal justice system and the Ramseys. Gruesome discovery: JonBenet was found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her parent's Boulder, Colorado home (above) Ongoing case: Patsy Ramsey was a suspect in her daughter's murder for the rest of the life. She died in 2006 from ovarian cancer . No charges were ever actually filed against John or Patsy Ramsy, and the same goes for JonBenet's older brother Burke who allegedly slept through her kidnapping and subsequent murder in the family's basement on December 26. Mrs Ramsey died after a battle with ovarian cancer in 2006 and John has since remarried. In 2008, following the testing of previously unknown DNA found on JonBenet's underwear, the Boulder District Attorney formally ruled out any connection between JonBenet's immediate family members and the murder. A new District Attorney reopened the case in 2009, and it still remains open to this day.

Boxing Day, 1996: JonBenet found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado .

"By . Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 18 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 18 October 2013 . A sex attack victim said yesterday that she has been betrayed by British justice after her attacker walked free from court citing his ‘sexsomnia’. The woman, a married teacher, said she was subjected to a violent assault by Paul Fallon, 41, as she slept next to her husband at a friend’s house. But the court accepted Mr Fallon’s explanation that he was asleep at the time of the alleged assault, which happened after a birthday party. Distraught: The mother-of-two- has complained to the Director of Public Prosecutions after her attacker walked free . His wife also gave evidence in his defence, saying he would sometimes have sex with her while asleep. The victim has written to Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer to request a review of her case and other ‘sexsomnia’ cases. She claimed in court that Mr Fallon was awake during the assault and said later that the Crown Prosecution Service failed to question his sleepwalking account properly. The CPS appeared to have breached its own guidelines that sleepwalking defences should be ‘robustly challenged’, she added. A jury found Mr Fallon not guilty ‘by reason of insanity’ because he could not control his actions while asleep. He was allowed to walk free from court yesterday despite the judge admitting that he posed a ‘serious risk’ to others. Free: Paul Fallon, 41 claimed he was asleep during the sexual assault and was found not guilty due to his 'sexsomnia' The woman, a 42-year-old mother-of-two, has branded the treatment of her case ‘shambolic, disgraceful and inept’. She told the Daily Mail: ‘I was assaulted where I should have felt safest, in the arms of my husband. I called the police and went through the ordeal of giving evidence because this man violated the sanctity of my marriage. 'During the trial I suffered an extremely unpleasant and traumatic cross-examination, only to then find out that the CPS weren’t even challenging his sleepwalking defence. ‘I was violated by this man and then I was betrayed by the CPS. I am now having to have counselling as I became continually tearful and anxious after the assault and I suffer horrific nightmares.’ The case is the latest in a series of controversial trials in which men have claimed they cannot be held accountable for rapes or sexual assaults because they suffer from the rare sleep condition known as parasomnia, nicknamed ‘sexsomnia’ because of its use as a defence in sex crime trials. Following the attack, Mr Fallon was assessed for three nights at the private Edinburgh Sleep Centre and diagnosed with a sleep disorder after a doctor hired by the defence saw his arms and legs move while he was asleep. But the prosecution’s medical expert did not assess Mr Fallon independently and both of these doctors worked for the same chain of private clinics. Neither expert was called to give evidence or face cross-examination at the trial and the jury was simply presented with their reports that Mr Fallon suffered from a sleep disorder. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ‘It is a farce that the CPS didn’t challenge his defence properly. The law needs to change to stop other victims being let down by justice.’ The attack happened in February 2012 after the woman and her husband celebrated a friend’s birthday at a Northamptonshire restaurant. Mr Fallon, a self-employed marketing consultant, and his wife Magz, 40, were also there and several couples returned to a friend’s house after the meal. He had been drinking heavily and was left to sleep on a sofa while his wife went alone to a hotel. The victim and her husband slept on a bed in the same room as Mr Fallon. She said she was still wearing her tights and underwear when she woke to find Mr Fallon attacking her. ‘I was lying on my side, curled up, and he grabbed my shoulder and flipped me onto my back,’ she said. 'Sexsomniac': Paul Fallon's wife Magz gave evidence on her husband's behalf, saying he would have sex with her while he was asleep . ‘I stopped him and he got up and tried to run away. I was screaming and hysterical and I called the police immediately.’ The attack lasted seconds and her husband only woke when she started screaming. Mr Fallon was charged with sexual assault and stood trial at Northampton Crown Court in August. The jury was told he suffered from insane automatism, a defence which means a defendant had no conscious knowledge of his actions and cannot be held responsible for them. The jury found Mr Fallon was not guilty ‘by reason of insanity’, a rare verdict which meant he was still put on the Sex Offenders Register for five years and was told to undergo medical treatment. Mr Fallon, who shares a £1.5million home in affluent Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, with his wife, has agreed to pay the £3,900 bill for a year of private treatment for his sleep disorder. The judge also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning from him from sleeping at friends’ homes or any private home unless he has previously told householders he suffers from a sleep disorder and given details of his conviction. Judge Lynn Tayton QC said he had been assessed as posing a ‘medium risk of serious harm’ to others, and said the risk would rise if he slept near women. She said: ‘Steps must be taken to reduce the risk which, in my view, you still pose... It seems to me that I have to have an eye to the protection of the public.’ The victim says in her letter to Mr Starmer: ‘Having experienced the trauma of my case being handled in such a shambolic manner, it is not surprising women are unwilling to report sexual crimes to the police.’ The CPS said it did seek to challenge the defence’s medical evidence. Its website sets out its policy on sleepwalking defences, saying: ‘It is essential that this defence is robustly challenged.’ Micheal Neofytou, defending Mr Fallon, said: ‘He was effectively not culpable for those actions.’ Mr Fallon’s solicitor, Phil Smith, said: ‘My client is content that the jury accepted the account he provided from the start was the truth. ‘Three experts were instructed and examined him – one by the defence and a second by the prosecution. The third – jointly appointed by the prosecution and defence – then endorsed the findings of the first two. All three experts agreed his actions occurred while in a sleep-induced state.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mother-of-two, 42, was assaulted as she slept next to her husband .

Torment: Robber Wayne Head wanted to escape the drug culture in his open prison, a court heard . A convicted robber fled from an open prison to get away from the rampant drug culture inside the jail which was destroying his life, a court heard. Wayne Head, 35, blew his savings on so-called legal highs which were freely available in HMP Leyhill in Gloucestershire, a judge was told. Head, who was described as a 'model prisoner' before his transfer to the Category D prison, walked out and returned to Plymouth, Devon, to visit family memorials at a local crematorium. He handed himself in after four days at large following a police appeal. Head . was handed a four month jail term and is now in a more secure jail . after he admitted absconding from lawful custody in August. He had been locked up for more than six years after being handed an indeterminate sentence for a brutal robbery in August 2007. Defence barrister Ali Rafati told . Plymouth Crown Court that Head had been a model inmate before he was . transferred to Leyhill open jail in April. He said legal highs were circulating and after four months he had spent all his savings on the drugs. Mr Rafati said: 'It was all too much for him and he stepped over the fence.' He . eventually arrived back in his native Plymouth and visited the . crematorium before a family member urged him to give himself up. Drug culture: Convicted robber Wayne Head fled HMP LeyHill, in South Gloustershire, pictured, to escape the drug culture inside the jail' the court heard. Head is expected to be transferred to Channings Wood jail at Denbury in Devon - only 35 miles from his home. The judge, Recorder Malcolm Galloway told Head he may have harmed his chances of parole and release in December. Prisons categorised from A to C are closed, means inmates are barred from leaving . Category A prisons are for those deemed highly dangerous to the public. Category B jails are for those who do not require maximum security, but pose a significant escape risk. Category C prisons are for criminals who are unlikely to try to escape. Category D, otherwise known as an open prison, houses criminals who are not deemed a risk to the public and who are being prepared for release. Many are allowed to undertake work in the community or to go on 'home leave' while serving sentences. He told him: 'They may have difficulty in concluding you are no longer a risk because of your escape.' A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Anyone who absconds will be returned to a closed prison and may face further criminal charges. 'We take the illicit use of drugs in prisons, and the problems they cause, very seriously. We work hard to keep contraband out of prisons and use a range of security measures, including random mandatory drug testing of prisoners and working closely with the police. 'We are also supporting the Bill currently in Parliament which would allow prisoners to be tested for legal highs.' Minimum security HMP Leyhill holds some inmates who were sentenced to life in jail. The prison is seen as one of the softest in the country, where prisoners are not even locked in their cells. Disgraced former Energy Secretary Chris . Huhne was transferred from tough Wandsworth Prison to HMP Leyhill just seven . days into his eight-month jail term for perverting justice when he got . his wife to take his speeding points. It has no perimeter security fence and has been in the headlines during recent years after a number of high profile escapes. Easy access: Many 'legal highs', which are sometimes marketed as plant food or having other apparently harmless uses, are freely available online . In September, betting shop robber Timothy Stern, 31, begged officials at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire to let him come back after he escaped from Leyhill. He claimed he wanted to return to the high-security jail to be closer to his family. Stern’s good behaviour had seen him transferred to minimum-security Leyhill, near Bristol, in August. But he walked out and turned up at his old jail 24 hours later asking to be let in. Drug experts liken taking so-called legal highs to Russian roulette because users have little idea what they are being exposed to. In August it was reported deaths involving legal highs increased by 80 per cent last year – to one every week. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show fatalities relating to the psychoactive substances rose from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 – compared to 22 in 2010. Drugs such as 'meow meow', 'Black Mamba' and 'Benzo Fury' were all legal when they were first produced, but have since been outlawed. However, banning the substances has had no effect on the number of deaths they have caused, which increased from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics. Among legal highs, deaths involving a substance called cathinone tripled from six in 2011 to 18 in 2012.","Wayne Head blew all his money on drugs while in HMP Leyhill, court told .

Pet owners on a quiet Coventry cul-de-sac are locking up their cats after at least nine die in just tree weeks. Several cats are still missing in what the residents believe is a string of assassinations carried out by an angry neighbour. RSPCA are now investigating the mysterious cat deaths after five owners lose their pets in just two days. Sharon Price, a mother-of-two has lost four cats in just two weeks. Brother and sister Olli and Lilli, seven, Ziggy, five and seven-month-old kitten Annie all suddenly fell ill. ‘Without doubt someone has been killing off cats - and I don't know how they can live with themselves,’ Sharon said. ‘My children and others on the street are absolutely heartbroken and distraught, they are part of our family. ‘I hope whoever has done this is caught.’ Last month, Ms Price, 42, noticed Olli had been vomiting and feeling unwell. Eventually his condition became so severe he had to be put down. Just five days later Ziggy suffered the same fate and within a week all four pets had to be put down by vets. Clayton Emms - whose cat, Tilly, has been missing for nine days - believes someone has been been luring cats to drink poisonous antifreeze after becoming incensed by the high number of animals on the street. Mr Emms, 43, said: ‘There have been incidents in the past of some neighbours moaning about the number of cats on the street. ‘And on several occasions a couple in a silver car have been spotted eyeing up cats on the street. ‘Since they were seen, cats have been dropping like flies.’ Cat killers: At least nine cats have died and several are still missing on this cul-de-sac in Coventry and owners believe one of their neighbours is poisoning their pets . After Tilly’s disappearance followed by the death of his neighbours' pets, Clayton is now too scared to let his other cats out of the house. The RSPCA are investigating at least nine deaths in the close and surrounding streets but admit the number could be much higher than expected. Tests have not been carried out and it is not known if the incidents were connected, deliberate or accidental - but the charity said all had symptoms of poisoning. Neighbour Bartosz Bartczak also believe the deaths are a result of a feud on the cul-de-sac which has spiralled out of control. Mr Bartczak, 35, who lives a few doors down from Sharon Price, said: ‘We haven't seen our cat Lexus in over a week and it's extremely worrying as it's a quiet area, if he's been killed we just want to know instead of panicking. Assassinated? Sharon Price's cat Ziggy began vomiting and became so severely ill he had to be put down by a vet . Unexplained deaths: Sharon Price's Olli and seven-mont-old kitten Annie also had to be put down . After the deaths of several cats, including Sharon Price's Lilli, residents on the street are keeping their cats locked up inside . ‘I am absolutely certain someone is killing our cats, around lots have died already and many more are ill or missing - that is no coincidence. ‘In the past there's been neighbours who've said there's too many cats on the street, saying they make too much noise at times, rummage around in bins and dig up gardens. ‘Those are just small things - to start poisoning cats is outrageous. How can someone just kill pets because they don't like them? ‘My youngest daughter is so distraught she cannot stop crying - we're all upset.’ The RSPCA are now urging owners to be extra vigilant, and handed out leaflets on common poisons animals ingest - such as antifreeze. If a cat ingests even a small amount it can lead to kidney failure. RSPCA animal welfare officer Ben Jones said: ‘It is really sad to hear that so many cats have died in such a short space of time. ‘As yet we do not know if this was deliberate or accidental but we do want to remind people that deliberately poisoning an animal is illegal and could mean a £20,000 fine and even six months in prison.’","At least nine cats killed on one cul-de-sac in under three weeks .

Apart from a few nervous-looking brides, nothing seemed to stand out in the wedding photos which landed on the desks of immigration officials in marriage visa applications. But when they placed them side-by-side, a more sinister story began to emerge. Home Office immigration officials’ suspicions were raised when they noticed several different couples were wearing exactly the same outfits to their weddings. At least five brides were clad in the same distinctive red and yellow shawl, while a golden turban appears to have been passed between the grooms. The officials had struck gold – exposing a major sham marriage scam. Suspicious: Eva Holubova's wedding with Nikola Horvarthova (right). Immigration officials uncovered the scam from these photographs . A string of Eastern European and British brides were paid up to £1,000 to fly to Pakistan and pose for wedding pictures, with the aim of getting dozens of Pakistani men into Britain illegally. With proof of their marriage, each man could apply to come to Britain to be with his wife, who was here legally as a result of EU open border rules. The scam organisers thought that by holding the wedding ceremonies in Pakistan they would evade the scrutiny of register offices in the UK, where officials are on the look-out for bogus couples. But clearly they needed to pay more attention to the details. Same clothes: The traditional dress was the same in Sabah Qureshi wore as she smiled with her new 'husband' Not only were the garments the same, several of the weddings appear to have taken place in the same room, with the same broken clock on the wall. Tinsel and other decorations also appeared in several pictures. Standing alongside Czech bride Eva Holubova, 20, in one of her weddings is 26-year-old Nikola Horvarthova, apparently acting as her maid of honour. She also joined in the scam, staging her own wedding wearing the same outfit – and in the same room. A court heard that Holubova was paid to get married three times in four months. Three other fake brides, Czechs Michaela Lengyelova, 30, Matylda Krejci, 29, and Briton Sabah Qureshi, 24, also wore the red and yellow diamond-pattern shawl for their photos. All were handed jail sentences of up to a year for immigration fraud at Sheffield Crown Court. Jailing Holubova and Horvarthova, Judge Rosalind Coe said it was a ‘very well organised and professional operation’. She told the gang members: ‘Participation in sham marriages is an abuse of the marriage ceremony itself and an abuse of immigration control. Sham marriages strike at the heart of our immigration system.’ In total 16 brides were prosecuted by Home Office officials in several cases over the last year involving the highly organised sham marriage gang based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Investigation: A court heard fake bride Nikola Horvarthova (pictured) was one of the women that took part. A string of Eastern European and British brides were paid up to £1,000 to fly to the Pakistani capital Islamabad and pose for wedding pictures . Ringleader Talib Hussain, 42, was jailed for six years in January. His house was described in court as the engine room of the conspiracy. His ex-wife Rahina Zaman, 33, who helped him, was jailed for two-and-a-half years. Two of the other main organisers, Tariq Mehmood, 27, and Veronika Horvothova, 21, are still on the run. Mark Bates, from the Home Office’s Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial Investigation team, said: ‘This has been a complex case, with our investigations stretching from the UK to Pakistan. The gang involved thought they had come up with an ingenious way of breaching UK immigration laws. They were wrong, and as a result are now behind bars. ‘The message to anyone involved in this sort of criminality is clear. The Home Office has dedicated teams with the resource and expertise to catch up with you and bring you to justice.’ Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘The sentences handed out send a clear message to anyone tempted to break immigration rules. We have the resources, expertise and technology to catch you, and you will pay with your liberty.’","Eastern European and British brides paid up to £1,000 to pose for wedding pictures .

A teen convicted of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend because she dumped him smirked in court on Thursday as the girl's father revealed how he held her in his arms until she died after she was shot five times in the back. Anthony Ruiz, 17, was convicted of aggravated murder in the deaths of Jennifer Zacarias, 16, and her unborn child.

Scroll down for video . Smirk: Anthony Ruiz, 17, pictured in court on Thursday, was convicted of aggravated murder in the deaths of Jennifer Zacarias, 16, and her unborn child . 'I took my daughter; I took her in my arms. I realized there was too much blood she had been assassinated,' Pedro Zacarias said through an interpreter, according to Fox News. 'Everything became dark.' The John Marshall High School student was shot multiple times by Ruiz last February, because he was mad she had ended the relationship, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said.

Emotional: Pedro Zacarias, with his wife beside him, recalled how he heard shots fired before finding his little girl lying in the snow in the backyard of their Cleveland home in February . Victim: Jennifer Zacarias, 16, pictured, was shot multiple times by Ruiz in February . As he made his way to the podium on Thursday, Pedro Zacarias stopped and turned toward Ruiz, saying something to him in Spanish. The exchange was cut shot when the judge and prosecutors jumped in the middle. The distraught father later called Ruiz 'a coward' and told him to stop 'that stupid smile.' Jennifer's mother, Leticia Villafan, clung to her husband as he spoke, tears streaming down her cheeks. A group of other family members and friends sat in the courtroom wearing bright lime green T-shirts with Jennifer's picture on them. Zacarias said: 'This person has taken what was most valuable to us. To see him outside, to know that he is alive is more than we can handle.' Judge Nancy McDonnell sentenced Ruiz to 33 years to life. Jennifer's parents said they thought the sentence was too light and feared he'd get out while young enough to hurt someone else. 'For me it would be a death penalty, and if possible shoot him,' Zacarias said. Ruiz also addressed the court and asked the judge to 'have mercy' on him. He said: 'I was in love and I did make the wrong decision and I apologize for what I've done.' He also quoted the bible. 'I pray every day that the path he chose isn't to be sent to prison or my purpose in life to be a prisoner,' Ruiz said.","Cleveland, Ohio, teen Anthony Ruiz was convicted of aggravated murder in the deaths of Jennifer Zacarias, 16, and her unborn child on Thursday .

Asian-Americans have very low obesity rates but are at a high risk of heart disease and diabetes because their bodies are more likely to store fat around organs . Asian-Americans may have a misguided sense of how healthy they are because medical surveys often create a misleading average BMI score by defining their ethnic group too broadly, experts have claimed. Recent figures released by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have been criticised for propagating a 'model minority myth' after it lumped at least ten countries in that category without regard for regional trends. The survey classed somebody as Asian if they had descendants from Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand and Vietnam, among others. For example, Filipino adults are 70 per cent more likely to be obese than the rest of the Asian-American population — but about one in 10 Vietnamese and Korean adults is underweight. Scott Chan, program director for the Asian Pacific Islander Obesity Prevention Alliance, says he has encountered funding issues because of the misleading statistics and even has trouble convincing his own family to live healthier lives. Mr Chan added: 'Combined together, it looks like we don’t have a problem, it kind of propagates that ""model minority"" myth — that Asians are healthier, we’re skinny, we’re fine.' 'The attitude among . many Asian-Americans is “I’m skinny, and I’m Asian, I should be fine — I . don’t have to worry about obesity and diabetes.""' The figures also showed that just 11 per cent of Asian-Americans are . obese but doctors have said they are at a high risk of heart disease . because of the way their bodies store fat. Their bodies are more . likely to be apple-shaped, storing fat around their waist which can lead . to it penetrating the liver, and are more likely to pack fat in between . organs. Figures published in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that 10.8 per cent of Asians are obese, compared to 33 per cent of whites, 42 per cent of Hispanics or 48 per cent of black people. Just 11 per cent of US Asians are obese compared with 33 per cent of whites, 42 per cent of Hispanics and 48 per cent of blacks, a survey has shown . For most people a body mass index . (BMI) of over 25 is considered overweight, but Asian people have been . known to develop fat-related illnesses with a BMI of just 19 - which is . technically underweight. Scientists also criticised the survey for using a very broad definition of Asian making the category effectively 'meaningless' (file picture) Speaking . to NBC News, Dr. Karen Kim, a professor of medicine at the University . of Chicago, said: 'It looks as if we don’t have a problem. But it’s a . huge problem. 'There are huge differences where weight does not adequately reflect the realities of complications from being overweight. 'For Asians, you do not have to be overweight to get the complications for obesity.' But . that is likely to be masking a problem in the Asian community, leading . people to falsely believe that they are healthier than they actually . are. BMI is a figure calculated by comparing a person's weight and height. A BM of less than 20 is considered underweight, 20-25 is in the normal range, 25-30 classes a person as overweight and a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. It is still the standard method by which doctors calculate obesity, but has been discredited for being overly-simplistic, diagnosing some professional athletes as overweight. Health experts have said that a more helpful benchmark for measuring obesity in any population may be to consider waist circumference and fat distribution, both of which are highly correlated with metabolic syndrome.","New survey shows just 11 per cent of Asian-Americans are obese .

Jorge Dyksen's extraordinary show of determination came as the 16-year-old played forward on the Manchester Regional High School junior varsity soccer team in New Jersey on Friday. Despite losing his lower legs and arms when a skin infection prevented blood from circulating to his fingers and toes, the teenager lives an active lifestyle and is an inspiration to his teammates. 'I have no legs and arms, and I can do . everything without them,' Jorge told ABC News. 'I can kick a soccer . ball, I can hit a baseball, type, and even text.' Scroll down for video . Inspirational: Sixteen-year-old Jorge Dyksen, whose four limbs were amputated when he was 14-months-old, scored a goal for his New Jersey soccer team in a match on Friday . Upbeat: Jorge was born in Panama but has been traveling to New Jersey since he was a child for new prosthetics and in September 2010, he was adopted by an American family . Jorge, whose goal was the only one his team scored in the game, was born in Panama and every year since his amputations, he has traveled to the U.S. for new prosthetic legs and medical attention. When he was in the U.S. for the care, he met John and Faye Dyksen, who became a volunteer host family for the youngster and they officially adopted him in September 2012. 'He's always been a part of the family,' Faye said. The parents, who have five children, said that two of the kids were 'weary' when they learned of Jorge when he was a baby - but when they met him 'all the fears just went . away'. 'It was kind of like love at first sight,' Faye said. He now spends nine months in New . Jersey with the family and three months over the summer in Panama with . his biological family, who had been unable to afford his medical needs. Young years: He lost his limbs when a skin infection prevented blood circulating to his hands and feet . Determined: He said that he never feels as though he cannot do something because of his limbs . 'It was really a sacrifice of love for them,' Faye told NorthJersey.com. 'They realized that they could not care for his special needs down there.' In the U.S., the Dykens throw yearly fundraisers to raise enough money to cover the costs of his new prosthetics. A pair costs around $27,000, ABC reported. He said that he does not think of himself as disabled and gets great support from his family, friends and coaches. 'I just feel like a normal person because everyone treats me like it,' he said. 'I just keep going on and doing what I want to do.' Assistant Coach Daniel Sanchez said it had been Jorge's aim to score a goal by the end of the year. He said Jorge is an inspiration and 'big motivating factor' for the team. Loved: His soccer teammates say he is an inspiration and remind them that you can do anything . 'Whenever the team is down for any reason, he pumps them back up,' Sanchez said. 'Jorge is not only a great teammate but a great friend, definitely a team player - what every coach wants.' Jorge hopes to become a motivational speaker and tell people: 'Never give up.' 'Because I know there's people out there that really need motivation and everyone says I always motivate other people,' he said. 'I help them get happy in their lives.' Jorge made headlines in 2010 when New York Yankee Mariano Rivera, a fellow Panamanian and a hero of Jorge’s, surprised him at his 13th birthday party with three other players. 'He is amazing,' Rivera said at the time. 'He has a desire to live his life. Today he is going to swim. Amazing. People complain about little things.

Linda Jones has said she has accepted her daughter's murderer Stuart Campbell will never reveal where Danielle's body is, more than 12 years after she went missing. But she said never being able to bury her daughter 'tortures' her every day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heartache: Linda Jones has spoken of the 'torture' of never being able to bury her daughter Danielle, who went missing in 2001 . Tragic: Mrs Jones said she had 'not been given the chance to say goodbye' to her daughter properly . Victim: Danielle Jones went missing in June 2001 after leaving home for school. The following year her uncle Stuart Campbell was jailed for life for her murder and kidnap . The 15-year-old disappeared in June 2001 after leaving home to catch a bus to school. In December 2002 her uncle, Stuart Campbell, of Grays, Essex, was convicted and jailed for life for her kidnap and murder following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. Appeal judges upheld those convictions. Campbell has never admitted how he killed Danielle or where she is. In a documentary to be aired tonight, Mrs Jones, of East Tilbury, Essex, has described the pain of never being able to bury her daughter. She said: 'The fact that he won’t give us that one peace.  I’ve accepted that he won’t but to not be able to bury her and know where she is, is an everyday tortuous position.' Mrs Jones said: 'We’ve not been given the chance to say goodbye to her properly.' 'Monster': In the documentary Mrs Jones described Campbell as 'the most despicable repulsive thing there is' Convicted: Stuart Campbell has never admitted how he killed Danielle or where she is . Mrs Jones said even though there is no grave to visit, she is able to go to the memorial garden built at Danielle's school. She said: 'For us it’s really important to have somewhere to go. As I say, normally you would have a grave, we don’t have that. 'We’ve got all our memories indoors but I . think sometimes you need somewhere to go and lay flowers and just have a . bit of peace. 'As a mum, you protect your children and I didn’t protect her enough' - Linda Jones . 'As hard as it is to come here I think also it makes you almost feel you are with her in happier times, when she was a schoolgirl.' Mrs Jones and her husband Tony have raised two sons, which she said is what helped pull her through the tragedy. Mrs Jones said: 'She was a beautiful fun loving girl, she had everything to live for. I miss her every minute of every day.' At an inquest in 2005 senior detectives said police would 'not give up' trying to find her body. Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Reynolds said police believed Campbell had killed and disposed of Danielle's body alone. Campbell, a father-of-two whose hobbies included body-building and karate, denied any involvement in her disappearance. 'Torture': Danielle's parents Tony and Linda Jones pictured after Campbell was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager . But the prosecution produced evidence that Danielle, a pupil at St Clere's School, Stanford-le-Hope, was seen talking to a man in a blue Transit van shortly after leaving her house. Campbell owned an identical van. The jury of seven women and five men heard that Campbell had developed an 'irresistible sexual attraction' for his niece. He regularly picked her up from the . school bus stop in his van; sent her 'an inordinate amount of text . messages' and kept a diary chronicling his contact with her. Much-loved: Mrs Jones described her daughter as 'a beautiful fun loving girl' who 'had everything to live for' Campbell claimed to have been in another part of Essex on the morning Danielle disappeared, but expert analysis of his mobile phone showed that could not be true. Investigations also revealed that his phone and Danielle's phone were together near his home for around 30 hours after she vanished. In a bag in Campbell's loft, police found female underwear including a pair of cling-top women's stockings stained with blood. The stockings bore traces of Campbell's and Danielle's DNA. In the documentary Mrs Jones said: 'I think he is the most despicable repulsive thing there is.  I don’t know of a word other than monster that could describe him. 'As a mum, you protect your children and I didn’t protect her enough.' In 2005 Campbell appealed the decision claiming he did not get a fair trial. In the appeal, his lawyers argued that the trial judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, should have excluded highly prejudicial evidence to the effect that Campbell had a fixation for young girls and taking photographs of them, and downloaded material about teenage girls from the Internet. They also urged Lord Justice Kennedy, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Bean to rule that one of the jurors should have been discharged because he lived next door but one to a police officer involved in the case and another senior investigating officer lived in the same village. The appeal however was dismissed.","Danielle Jones disappeared in June 2001 after leaving home for school .

Posting a photo of the food you’re about to eat on Instagram has become a daily ritual for many. Often this ‘food porn’ isn’t as appealing to those looking at it, but scientists are now claiming taking a photo of your food before you eat it makes it taste better. Scientists are claiming taking a photo of your food before you eat it makes it taste better. The study revealed that performing any ritual, such as raising a toast, improves the experience of eating . In fact, the study revealed that performing any ritual, such as raising a toast, improves the experience of eating. Researchers at University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management claim taking a photo puts you in the moment and in doing so, heightens your senses. The person taking the photo will, on some level, feel the difference creating an incentive to continue the practice. The study from Brigham Young University found that looking at too many pictures of food can make it less enjoyable to eat, and can even put people off eating it in the future. This is because looking at pictures of what is on a plate can make a person bored with their meal before they've even taken a bite . Kathleen Vohs, the professor of Excellence in Marketing at the Carlson School, wondered about the power of rituals after noticing the funny routines that people often perform before eating and drinking. ‘Whenever I order an espresso, I take a sugar packet and shake it, open the packet and pour a teeny bit of sugar in, and then taste,’ she said. ‘It's never enough sugar, so I then pour about half of the packet in. The thing is, this isn't a functional ritual, I should just skip right to pouring in half the packet.’ Vohs and colleagues conducted four experiments to investigate how these kinds of ritualistic behaviour influences taste. In the first experiment, some participants were asked to eat a piece of chocolate following a detailed set of instructions: ‘Without unwrapping the chocolate bar, break it in half. Unwrap half of the bar and eat it. Then, unwrap the other half and eat it.’ Researchers at University of Minnesota revealed that a longer delay between ritual and consumption of food improves taste . The other participants were simply instructed to relax for a short amount of time and then eat the chocolate bar however they wanted. The results showed that those who had performed the ritual rated the chocolate more highly, savoured it more, and were willing to pay more for the chocolate than the other group. A second experiment reinforced these findings, showing that random movements don't produce a more enjoyable eating experience. The data also revealed that a longer delay between ritual and consumption bolstered these effects, even with a neutral food like carrots. Half the participants saw pictures of sweet foods, while the other half saw salty foods. After rating each picture based on how appetising it looked, everyone was given peanuts. Participants then rated how much they enjoyed eating the peanuts. The people who looked at salty foods enjoyed the peanuts less . In the final two studies, the researchers showed that personal involvement in the ritual is paramount- watching someone else methodically mix lemonade doesn't make it taste any better. Additionally, they found that ‘intrinsic interest’ -the fact that rituals draw people into what they are doing- accounted for the positive effects that rituals have on our eating experiences. While these rituals may seem small or mundane, the researchers note that the effects they produce are quite tangible. And while rituals are common before mealtimes, they could play a role in other situations, too. ‘We are thinking of getting patients to perform rituals before a surgery and then measuring their pain post-operatively and how fast they heal,’ Vohs said.","U.S. scientists claim posting photos of food on Instagram improves its taste .

Yasmin Vickery was catapulted from a white-knuckle 'Twister' fairground ride at 50mph and smashed into a safety barrier in Northampton . The youngster, pictured before the accident carrying the Olympic torch, left, and injured, right, was treated for a suspected broken neck following the accident on November 3 but incredibly escaped with severe bruising. Mobile phone video footage taken by Kim, 41, shows the moment Yasmin flew off the ride at the Hollowell Steam Rally and Heavy Horse Show in Northampton. A loud thud can be clearly heard on the clip as Yasmin was slammed into a metal fence. The film shows the emergency button being pressed and the ride grinding to a halt while a frantic Kim can be heard asking 'Where’s Yasmin?' Today Kim, a company secretary, described the distressing moment she feared her daughter was dead. Captured: Yasmin approaches sat on the fast-spinning ride on the right .

Yasmin is thrown from the ride and heads towards a metal barrier in the fast-moving clip . She said: 'Yamsin had been on the ride with her little cousin Kya and the bar came up, as she went to lean to pull it back she came flying off. 'She spun into the air because it was going so fast, then you could hear this almighty thud. She had gone flying through the barrier. 'I was filming the ride and didn’t notice until the ride stopped what had happened, we were laughing and joking at the time. 'But then I just saw my little girl . in a heap over the other side. My six-year-old daughter Talisha who had . been watching was in tears, she was petrified - she thought her sister . was dead.

Hundreds of hospital kitchens across the country are dirty, have cockroach and mice infestations or are stocking out of date food, a MailOnline investigation has revealed. Inspectors found that three-quarters of kitchens are flouting basic food hygiene rules while nearly a third were not properly cleaned. Six NHS hospitals had mice, two had rats, five had cockroaches and another hospital had an unspecified problem with 'pests'. Infestation: Cockroach egg cases found by inspectors in an undercroft at Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup during an inspection last year. They wrote that they posed 'an imminent health risk'. The pictures were in documents released to the MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act . Large cockroaches: A number of dead cockroaches are photographed in a trap in an undercroft by an environmental health inspector investigating the kitchens at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup . 'Serious infestation': More cockroaches can be seen on the wall and ceiling of the undercroft in another photo taken by environmental health teams from Bexley Council . The figures will raise fears that patients are being put at risk by dirty kitchens and staff ignoring proper hygiene policy. Nationwide, hospitals spend as little as £3 a day per patient - and 82,000 meals a day are thrown out. Campaigners said it is unacceptable that the public never find out about dirty kitchens 'until they are teased out using Freedom of Information requests'. An analysis of 769 environmental health inspection reports revealed that 581 hospitals across Britain are breaking the rules. Inspectors found 229 kitchens were dirty while a further 62 were stocking out of date food. The MailOnline obtained copies of reports carried out by environmental health teams under the Freedom of Information Act. Inspectors . at Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Kent, found mouse droppings and a . 'serious cockroach infestation that posed an imminent risk to health' in an undercroft . last November. The Bexley Council workers found there had been a cockroach 'population explosion' - but it had been missed by pest control teams. 'Imminent health risk': Inspectors at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup, found a cockroach infestation and mouse droppings . Pests: Mouse droppings are seen on a shelf by inspectors at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup. They carried out four follow-up visits . Dirt: A fat and grease deposit is seen in the undercroft at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup. After the inspection in November 2012 they carried out a deep clean . Mess: Inspectors take pictures of rubbish abandoned beneath lockers during their inspection at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup . Cleaning concerns: Inspectors took this picture which shows dirt in the corners of the kitchen which had not been properly cleaned at Queen Mary's Hospital . The hospital was ordered by the council to explain why the kitchen should not be shut down and they promised to carry out an immediate deep clean. Council inspectors carried out four daily follow-up visits to make sure that the problem was being dealt with. Officers also found the kitchen was dirty. In other serious breaches of food hygiene laws, Burnley General Hospital was issued with an improvement notice after oriental cockroaches were discovered 'in various parts of the kitchen areas'. A spokeswoman said the incident in December last year had been swiftly dealt with. And at West Park Rehabilitation Hospital, in Wolverhampton, inspectors wrote in January 2012 that a dead rat had been found in an electrical cupboard. At Workington Community Hospital teams discovered a bottle of Daddies brown sauce which was a year past its best before. At Mile End Hospital, environmental health officers found mouse droppings on shelves in the kitchen. An inspector who visited the hospital in east London wrote: 'Evidence of mouse droppings found on dry storage shelf and to base of preparation table in the kitchen. 'IPM pest control carrying out visits weekly but not under controlled. Strongly advised to find source and prevent further pest entry into the kitchen.' Inspectors at Warwick Hospital launched a probe after someone allegedly suffered food poisoning after eating breakfast in the hospital cafe in April 2012. However, they were unable to substantiate the complaint. At Harefield Hospital, London, in May 2012, inspectors found patients were being forced to eat their meals off paper plates because the dishwasher had broken down. And at St Richard's Hospital in . Chichester, inspectors found ham slices best before December 6 when they . carried out an inspection on January 12 this year. Dirty: Inspectors found mouse droppings on food on the kitchen floor at Mile End Hospital . Roger Goss, co-director of Patient Concern, said that patient food is forgotten by hospitals who focus all their efforts on treating patients. 'These figures make a mockery of the mantra that patient safety is paramount on the NHS - they should not have bug-infected kitchens,' he said. 'All the focus is on clinical treatments and getting people in and out of hospital as quickly as possible. The things that get forgotten are cleaning and providing patients with good meals. 'If a restaurant has a poor hygiene rating you can eat elsewhere but if you end up in hospital you have no choice but to eat the food you are served. 'The NHS claims to be open and transparent but they hide the results of their kitchen inspection reports. Cockroaches: Inspectors found oriental cockroaches in 'various parts' of the kitchen at Burnley General Hospital . 'We only ever find out about malpractice if it is teased out via a Freedom of Information request. Hospitals should publish these reports online immediately - that is true transparency.' A spokesperson for NHS England, said: 'Healthcare providers have a duty to ensure that the environment that food is prepared and stored in meets the highest standards of safety and hygiene. 'Anything less is unacceptable and we would expect immediate action to be taken at any hospitals where these high standards aren’t being met.' A spokesman for Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust which runs Queen Mary's Hospital said they are working to ensure the kitchens are kept clean. He said: 'Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust took over ownership of the Queen Mary's Hospital site on October 1. Dead rat: Inspectors at West Park West Park Rehabilitation Hospital, in Wolverhampton wrote that a dead rat had been found outside the kitchen . 'We became aware of the problems identified at the canteen in November 2012 whilst carrying out our due diligence assessments prior to taking over the hospital. 'We also noted that the Environment Health Officer reported that he ""was very impressed with the improvements which have been made and maintained"" when he carried out a repeat inspection in May 2013. 'We take food hygiene very seriously and will work closely with the contractor at Queen Mary's to ensure cleanliness standards are maintained, in keeping with the excellent standards we have in our other NHS properties.' Graham Argent, Divisional Manager for Estates and Facilities at The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which runs West Park Rehabilitation Hospital, in Wolverhampton, said: 'The incident of a dead rat being found outside the kitchen of the hospital is a historical one, dating back to 2011. 'Our pest control contractor treated the area and we also carried out a programme of measures to stop rodents being able to enter the underground ducts of the hospital. 'We are happy to say that no further instances have been reported since then.' A spokesman for Mile End Hospital said that it had been awarded an overall five-star rating for the kitchen. 'Urgent steps were immediately taken to eradicate a small problem in the dry food storage area where there was evidence of mouse droppings on a shelf.

As the old stereotype goes, German people are always first to bag the sun loungers, and always last to say thank you. The Goethe Institute, which is Germany's . equivalent of The British Council, claims that a number of factors could explain away the . stereotype. Famed for their punctuality, they also have a reputation for getting straight to the point - which can be perceived as rude by the British. Scroll down for video . Germans are stereotypically thought of as the first with their towels on the sunloungers (posed by models) The explanation is that the country's centuries old divisions may make some feel like they are 'surrounded by enemies'. Because of the nation's fractured past, Germans hold stability, structure and order in high regard. The Goethe Institute have produced a video which explain the misconceptions - and how Germans differ from people of different nationalities. In the clip, a German man is seen standing upright and to attention with a handful of documents while the foreigner - possibly British - sits in a slouched position. Christine Jansen of the Amsterdam branch of the Goethe Institute told website The Local: 'We produced the films as a starting point of a discussion about cultural differences when doing business with Germans.' She added: 'The video-makers attribute Germans' tendency to avoid personal matters in favour of getting straight to the point to history. 'They say the historic division of Germany into several smaller states meant Germans were constantly surrounded by enemies and they kept themselves to themselves.' But Jansen told The Local that the mention of Germany being surrounded by enemies was not a reference to the Second World War and that there had been some criticism of that part of the video.","Germans like 'stability and structure' because of nation's fractured past .

An Iowa teenager who shot dead both of his grandparents was 'relieved' to admit to the brutal killings, a detective testified at his trial today. Isaiah Sweet was 17 when he shot dead 55-year-old Richard Sweet and 62-year-old Janet Sweet just before Mother's Day in May 2012 at the family's home in Hartford, Iowa. His defense attorneys don't dispute that he was the one who killed the Sweets, who raised him, but they argue that the act was not premeditated - and so he is therefore not guilty of first-degree murder, the harshest charge under the law. But Manchester police Sergeant James Hauschild said Isaiah, now 18, admitted that he planned to kill his grandfather with a baseball bat. Instead, he shot Mr Sweet in the back of the head. Confessed: Isaiah Sweet's lawyers aren't disputing that he killed his grandparents - they are arguing that it was not premeditated murder . In chains: Sheriff officers lead a shackled Isaiah Sweet into the Clayton County Courthouse yesterday for his first appearance. He is being held on $1million bond . The teen also said that he needed to 'pay for what he did,' according to a video-taped interview. Iowa State Patrol trooper Jon Stickney testified about finding Mr Sweet's body. 'His brain was falling out of his head. You don’t forget a sight like that,' the veteran trooper said. Brandon Ahlers, 21, Isaiah's friend who pleaded guilty to being an accomplice in the murder, testified that Isaiah texted him the day before the killing to ask him about methods for killing someone. A search of Isaiah's computer also revealed that he had made online searches for how to kill a person in a way that 'wasn't too messy' and 'didn't cause pain.' Among the options Isaiah allegedly explored were poisoning his grandparents, beating them with a bat and shooting them. They were both found slumped dead on their couch, shot in the head. Rick and Janet Sweet were found slumped on their couch dead last May. Their grandson admitted to shooting them both in the head . Police captured Isaiah Sweet, 17,  from Iowa, in Cedar Rapids after a short chase the day after the killing. After killings, the teen used his Twitter page to post a number of cryptic messages which police believe are about the murders. They included: 'Time to live my life', 'I'm f***ed up, torn down, I'm twisted, doorknob', and 'My phone is as big as hell right now'. Isaiah Sweet is charged with two counts of first-degree murder. After he was arrested the tweets continued on his alleged Twitter page, where he uses the pseudonym Isweet37. They said: 'You drunk c*** f***ing snitch', 'Damn. Cant wait to get outa the cop shop' and 'All youve done the past 30 minutes is sit in a corner and text? #Retardcop'. A close friend told The Des Moines Register that the teen hated his grandparents and would often say he wanted to kill them. She described their relationship as 'contentious'. Jade Offerman said: 'He never got along with his grandparents. He absolutely — he hated them. Sometimes he tried to get along as best as he could with them just to make his life easier.'

She said the believed the grandparents, particularly the grandfather, were sometimes strict with the teen but didn't believe anything he said about wanting to kill them. 'I never took him seriously. He’d be like, ""I hate them so much. I’m going to kill them"". But obviously you hate your parents sometimes and you say stuff like that,' she said. 'Nobody takes you seriously.' Before the killings, Sweet drove Miss Offerman and some friends to a party at an apartment in downtown Iowa City in a truck which is believed to have belonged to the elderly couple. One of the passengers, Kelli Fisher, 19, said Sweet had drugs in the vehicle including marijuana and prescription painkillers. The labels were scratched off on the bottles, said Miss Fisher, and she noticed he was 'visibly shaking' and carrying a knife. She told The Des Moines Register: 'He showed us a knife that he had just bought, which was really weird…It was smaller, but it had very, very jaggedly edges.' Miss Offerman said Sweet called her on Sunday and acted very strange and secretive but said it sounded like a goodbye call after he said to her: 'I love you. I miss you. You’re never going to see me again.' The accused murderer allegedly told at least three people that he had drugged his grandparents and killed them, according to court records. Richard and Janet Sweet were said to be facing financial difficulties and Mr sweet faced a first-degree theft charge for allegedly taking $10,000 from the trust for Marie Ann Sweet, his mother. Court records show Janet Sweet was served an eviction case dated July 2011. In December, Janet Sweet filed a child-support case against Stacy Sweet, Isaiah Sweet’s mother.","Isaiah Sweet had been tweeting cryptic posts across the weekend .

Error: More than 100 people are reported to have complained about text messages telling them they are in Britain illegally . Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have been sent text messages encouraging them to leave the country. Technical support company Capita dispatched nearly 40,000 to suspected visa over-stayers as part of a Home Office campaign. The text reads: ‘Message from the Home Office. Our records show that you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please  contact us on 0844 3754636 to  discuss your case.’ Capita is being paid to send the messages as well as letters to some 60,000 foreign nationals who may still be in Britain despite their visas expiring. However, the Home Office faces fresh criticism for its tactics to tackle illegal immigration after more than 100 people complained about being sent text messages saying they had no right to stay in Britain. It has emerged those to receive the messages include a civil rights campaigner who has been in Britain since 1966 and an immigration caseworker. It comes as Home Office minister Mark Harper signalled that controversial vans telling people to 'go home' could be used again despite opposition from the Lib Dems. London Mayor Boris Johnson also backed the vans, claiming they could be useful in persuading people to leave Britain. In the text campaign, the standard message from private contractor Capita states: ‘Message from the UK Border Agency: You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain.’ They were first sent out last Christmas holidays and the company also uses phone, email or letter to warn people that UK Border Agency records suggest they need to leave the country. Earlier this year the Information Commissioner launched an investigation into the bizarre tactic, amid complaints that UKBA held inaccurate and outdated data, in breach of the Data Protection Act. Now a government source has told the Independent that ‘mistakes have clearly been made’ ABOUT who has been targeted, triggering more than 100 complaints. One, Suresh Grover, is a civil rights campaigner and founded the anti-racism charity The Monitoring Group which has campaigned for justice for Stephen Lawrence and Victoria Climbie. He told the newspaper: ‘I was absolutely shocked and quite horrified to receive the text. I thought it wasn’t meant for me. ‘I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have always had a British passport.’ Controversy: The Home Office has also faced criticism for the use of billboard vans telling illegal immigrants to 'go home' Bobby Chan, an accredited immigration adviser at a central London law firm, also received the message. Mr Chan said: ‘I came here in 1973 so I was very surprised to receive this message and even found it quite funny. ‘But if an elderly Chinese person received one of these messages they would get very worried. Capita told me I received the message because I put in an application to the Home Office recently but it must have been 30 years since I last put one in and I didn’t have a mobile then.’ The Home Office claims only 14 people have been contacted in error. Meanwhile, fresh coalition divisions emerged over the us of billboard vans telling illegal immigrants to 'go home'. Immigration minister Mr Harper defended the tactic in a pilot this summer and suggested it could be used again. He told BBC1's Question Time: 'I don’t see any problem with saying to people who have no right to be in the United Kingdom they can’t be here anymore. 'If it’s successful we’ll look at rolling it out, if it’s not successful, we won’t.' Split: Tory Immigration minister Mark Harper (left) suggested the ad vans could be used again but Lib Dem Jeremy Browne defended himself from criticism that as a minister at the Home Office he failed to block the vans . Lib Dem Jeremy Browne, who was sacked as a home office minister last week, hit back at criticism from those around Nick Clegg that he failed to stop the vans ever being used. He said: 'I wasn't told about the vans. I wasn't copied into the paper that was circulated in the Home Office. 'Now whether that was due to a deliberate political decision or was an administrative oversight, who knows? 'As an illustration into how stretched you can be in a department, when this controversy broke out I was on the other side of the world,' he told The Times. 'It's been reported I was on holiday. I wasn't. I was in the Far East of Asia as part of the international comparison of drug policy. 'The first thing I knew about the poster van is when I was in the lounge of Hong Kong airport and logged on to the computer to catch up with the news eight time zones away ...

When builder Joseph Ingham received a call from his distraught wife to say £3,000 of gadgets and family heirlooms had been stolen from their home, he was initially furious. Then he decided to get even – by tracking down the culprit and forcing him to hand back his possessions. Three hours later, the father of two had returned home with most of the stolen goods – even before the police had finished taking down a statement from his wife. But to Mr Ingham’s dismay, the officers accused him of ruining their own investigation and threatened him with arrest. Now Mr Ingham, 32, has been vindicated after a judge praised him for ‘showing other people how to investigate a case’, and helping to convict serial burglar Dean Harris. Mr Ingham launched his own investigation straight after wife Rachel, 33, called him with the news their home near Bridlington, East Yorkshire, had been burgled. An iPod and two tablet computers belonging to daughters Jodie, 15, and Ayesha, 12, had been stolen along with a laptop, camera, jewellery, a watch and heirlooms. Mr Ingham said: ‘I did what anyone should have done. I was so angry that my house had been burgled and I was not insured. ‘I knew I would never hear the last of it from my girls, and my wife was so upset. ‘Bridlington is not that big a place. People know each other in this town.’ Hull Crown Court heard Mr Ingham visited a bail hostel for criminals and promised £20 to a resident for information. The man revealed Harris’s name and the estate where he lived. Mr Ingham quickly discovered that he knew Harris’s girlfriend, Emma Miles, from his school days. Luckily she was in when he called at their home. Mr Ingham said: ‘I told her to get her boyfriend on the telephone. I was 90 per cent certain he had robbed my house.’ When Harris denied all knowledge, Mr Ingham threatened to ‘ransack’ his house and look for the stolen goods himself. Harris told Mr Ingham his possessions were ‘under the bed in his daughter’s room’. Miss Miles found a rucksack containing the valuables and handed them over. Professional criminal Dean Harris, who was tracked down by one of his victims, was found guilty of committing two burglaries on the same day . Around £600 of items – mainly jewellery – were missing. But on returning home triumphant, Mr Ingham said he was ‘treated like a criminal’ by police. They criticised him for threatening a witness and offering a reward. ‘They were threatening to arrest me. They were saying I had ruined the investigation,’ he added. However, at Harris’s trial last week, Judge Michael Mettyear was more forgiving. ‘I am sorry to say Mr Ingham has shown other people how to investigate a case,’ he told the court. ‘I may not approve of all his behaviour. The police are not able to use . his methods but at least he gave it a go and made all the inquiries. 'He brought to justice a persistent long-term burglar.’ Harris, 43, was found guilty of committing two burglaries and was jailed for three-and-a-half years.","Joseph Ingham decided to track down burglar who raided his home .

A water park where visitors will be to swim with wild dolphins before sitting down to eat the meat of the mammal is being planned in Japan. The controversial tourist trap has been announced by town of Taiji in the south-east of the country which is already known for its mass dolphin hunts which turn the shoreline blood red. The fishing town was made famous when an Oscar-winning documentary called 'The Cove' revealed how the animals are rounded up in the sea before being stabbed to death for their meat. Controversial: Taiji fisherman, above, will retain dolphins in a cove by surrounding them with nets and keeping them in the sea, visitors can then view them in their natural environments from boats . Slaughter: The rest of the captured dolphins will be killed for meat to be served to tourists, a practice made infamous in the 2009 Oscar winning documentary, 'The Cove', pictured above . But rather than bowing to global pressure to ban the practice after the film was released in 2009, Taiji officials say they want to capitalise on their dolphin trade by keeping some alive for entertainment in a sealed off 'safari' part of their bay while others are killed for catering. Masaki Wada, a government official for the town, said: 'We already use dolphins and small whales as a source of tourism in the cove where dolphin-hunting takes place. 'In summer swimmers can enjoy watching the mammals that are released from a partitioned-off space. 'But we plan to do it on a larger scale. This is part of Taiji's long-term plan of making the whole town a park, where you can enjoy watching marine mammals while tasting various marine products, including whale and dolphin meat' The attraction will be separate from Hatakejiri Bay, the place into which local fishermen corral dolphins, select a few dozen for sale and slaughter the rest for meat. If the plan goes ahead, a whale safari park stretching roughly 69 acres will be created by putting nets up around the entrance to Moriura Bay which is in the north west of the town. Killed for sale: The town of Taiji has a license to slaughter thousands of dolphins every year . Big business: Dolphin meat, shown above, is a major source of industry for the fishing town . Black whales and bottlenose dolphins caught in waters near the town would be released into the area, which would be developed as a nature park. Officials are looking to open part of the park within five years, Wada said. Wakayama prefecture, in which the town is located, said the town caught 1,277 dolphins in 2012 and has licence to capture 2,026 this season, which began in September and runs until August. Tokyo-based conservationist group Iruka & Kujira (Dolphin & Whale) Action Network criticised the plans. Nanami Kurasawa, secretary general . of the group said: 'Marine mammals migrate across oceans, and . international public opinion is that wildlife should be allowed to live . as they are. 'The plan will only ignite more protests over dolphin-hunting.' In the wild: Protestors have criticised the plans for the park, saying that cashing in on the slaughter of dolphins will only lead to further protest in Japan and the rest of the world . Despite international outrage, however, locals in Taiji argue that dolphin-hunting is part of a 400-year-old whaling and culinary tradition. Japan regularly draws criticism for its annual whale hunt in the Antarctic, with Australia bringing the issue to the International Court of Justice this year. Tokyo defends the practice as internationally legal 'scientific research'. The 2009 film ""The Cove"" brought Taiji to . worldwide attention, winning an Oscar the following year, after . graphically showing the killing of dozens of trapped animals, including . by using underwater cameras.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . PUBLISHED: . 18:16 EST, 18 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:54 EST, 18 October 2013 . Disgraced former minister Chris Huhne was paid to appear on the BBC, apparently in breach of the corporation’s own editorial guidelines, it has emerged. The former energy secretary, who still has to wear an electronic tag after being released early from his sentence, is thought to have received around £150 plus travel expenses to conduct an eight-minute interview last week. He was ostensibly invited on to the Sunday Politics programme to discuss energy policy, but spent several minutes talking about his sentence. The BBC’s editorial guidelines clearly forbid paying ex-convicts for talking about their crimes. Platform: MPs criticised Huhne's appearance on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme . MPs criticised the corporation for giving Huhne a public platform to rehabilitate himself by plugging his post-prison ventures only five months after he was released from jail. Huhne spent the first two minutes of the interview talking about the reasons for his sentence. He served 62 days of an eight-month term for perverting the course of justice after he lied about speeding points which his ex-wife Vicky Pryce took for him on her licence a decade ago. He told presenter Andrew Neil he was prosecuted and jailed merely to provide a ‘deterrent effect’ to others. ‘It wasn’t a question of changing my character. It was actually about stopping people like you, Andrew, from doing the same thing and swapping speeding points... That was why the prosecution was brought. I had not offended for ten years on this,’ he said. BBC guidelines state producers should not pay criminals or former criminals ‘for interviews or other contributions relating to their crimes’, adding: ‘Payment of an actual fee will only be approved for a contribution of remarkable importance with a clear public interest which could not be obtained without payment.’ Court: Huhne, seen here leaving Southwark Crown Court, in central London, is still on electronic tag . BBC sources insisted Huhne’s interview did not break the rules because he was invited on the programme to discuss Labour’s proposal to cap energy prices rather than talk about his crime.If Huhne had served his full sentence, he would not have been released until November 13. Until then, he will have to wear an electronic tag and obey a night-time curfew at his home in London. Miss Price, who was also sentenced to eight months, has since published a book about her experience in Holloway prison, called Prisonomics. On Monday she gave her first broadcast interviews since being released, including BBC Breakfast and Radio 4’s Today programme. While discussing prison policy, she was allowed to plug the book, the royalties from which she is giving to a charity. A BBC spokesman declined to say whether she was paid for the interviews. Prisonomics: Economist Vicky Pryce went to prison for taking speeding points for former husband Chris Huhne. She has written a book about her experience in Holloway prison . Huhne has been appointed European chairman of energy company Zilkha Biomass Energy and has started writing a weekly column for The Guardian. He mentioned the column several times on Sunday Politics, saying it gave him a ‘great platform’, although he denied having a ‘strategy of rehabilitation’. Towards the end of the interview, Mr Neil said he wished they had ‘more time to talk’ and promised to have Huhne back on the show. Tory MP Conor Burns said: ‘If the interview was exclusively about energy policy, why was he asked about his rehabilitation? ‘There is no shortage of energy experts or even former energy secretaries. ‘Clearly the BBC felt his crime was itself newsworthy, and that’s why they wanted him on so much. ‘I find it extraordinary the BBC would use licence fee payer’s money to pay someone who was so recently convicted and who clearly hopes to re-join the political conversation.’ Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee criticised the BBC for paying Huhne when serving politicians are not paid for interviews about politics. He said: ‘I don’t see why he should be rewarded by the BBC financially for getting himself into the position where he was put in prison to talk about things he would have talked about as a minister. It seems perverse.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are happy that Chris Huhne’s appearance was in accordance with BBC guidelines.’","Disgraced former minister appeared on the Sunday Politics programme .

We all have memories of humiliating spots moments from our youth, but luckily for most of us, they won't have been captured on camera. So spare a thought for Mark Armitage, a cricket player for Eastwood, whose very short innings has been filmed in slow motion. Despite surviving just two balls the opening batsman is hit in the crotch and on the arm before finally dismissing himself as he falls over and knocks his own bales off. Opening Eastwood batsman Mark Armitage had a humiliating game against Bradfield, surviving just one ball before dismissing himself on the second . After taking the first ball to his crotch the unfortunate batsman spins round before falling to the floor . The fielders for Bradfield can be seen laughing to themselves in the background as Armitage hits the dirt . As the video starts with the batsman at his crease it seems the unfortunate amateur made it onto the pitch without error, but got almost everything else wrong. As the first delivery flies in Armitage swings at it, attempting to knock it away to his left-hand side, but completely misses and instead takes the impact to his groin. To make matters worse the effort he put into the shot causes him to spin round before landing face down in the dirt. After picking himself up Armitage has a go at a second ball which turns out to be even worse . As the ball rebounds off of his forearm the batsman completes a 180 degree turn in front of the camera . Howzzat: Just two balls into the game Armitage takes his own wicket after sprawling into the stumps . As the fielders for Bradfield laugh away, Armitage picks himself and what is left of his dignity up and prepares to face the second ball. But that turns out to be an even bigger disaster that the first as he steps forward to meet it with the bat, but instead lands the ball on his forearm. As the ball falls to the ground two feet away from him, Armitage flies backwards in a comical 180 degree turn. Unfortunately for him he comes down backwards with his bat fully outstretched, hitting the stumps and knocking the bales clean off. Despite the embarrassing turn of events the batsman was seen laughing while going off and even received a high-five from a teammate on his way to the showers.","Batsman Mark Armitage was playing for Eastwood against Bradfield .

The New York City Police Department's controversial 'stop and frisk' crime-fighting tactics violate the U.S. Constitution, a federal judge ruled on Monday. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said the city police adopted a policy . of 'indirect racial profiling' by targeting racially defined groups for . stops. Scheindlin said she was not putting an end to the policy, but rather was reforming it. She did not give specifics yet on how that would work but instead named an independent monitor who would develop an initial set of reforms to the policies, training, supervision, monitoring and discipline. 'The city's highest officials have . turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in . a racially discriminatory manner,' she wrote. 'In their zeal to defend a . policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored . overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting ""the right people"" is . racially discriminatory.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Plain clothes detectives search suspects in Harlem, New York City. The New York City Police Department's controversial 'stop and frisk' crime-fighting tactics violate the U.S. Constitution, a federal judge said Monday . Four men (not pictured) sued the NYPD in 2004, saying they were unfairly targeted because of their race . Police brass received warnings since at least 1999 that officers were violating rights, she said. 'Despite this notice, they deliberately maintained and even escalated policies and practices that predictably resulted in even more widespread Fourth Amendment violations,' she wrote in a lengthy opinion. She also cited violations of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. 'Far too many people in New York City have been deprived of this basic freedom far too often,' she said. 'The NYPD's practice of making stops that lack individualized reasonable suspicion has been so pervasive and persistent as to become not only a part of the NYPD's standard operating procedure, but a fact of daily life in some New York City neighborhoods.' Four men sued the department in 2004, saying they were unfairly targeted because of their race. There have been about 5 million stops during the past decade, mostly black and Hispanic men. Scheindlin issued her ruling after a 10-week bench trial, which included testimony from top NYPD brass and a dozen people — 11 men and one woman — who said they were wrongly stopped because of their race. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin (pictured) said the city police adopted a policy of 'indirect racial profiling' by targeting racially defined groups for stops . Stop and frisk is a constitutional police tactic, but Scheindlin concluded that the plaintiffs had 'readily established that the NYPD implements its policies regarding stop and frisk in a manner that intentionally discriminates based on race.' She said, through paperwork alone, she determined at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion, the necessary legal benchmark, lower than the standard of probable cause needed to justify an arrest. The class-action lawsuit was the largest and most broad legal action against the policy at the nation's biggest police department, and it may have an effect on how other police departments make street stops, legal experts said. Lawmakers have also sought to create an independent monitor and make it easier for people to sue the department if they feel their civil rights were violated. Those bills are awaiting an override vote after the mayor vetoed the legislation. The city had no immediate response to the ruling. City lawyers argued the department does a good job policing itself with an internal affairs bureau, a civilian complaint board and quality assurance divisions. She rejected their arguments. 'The city and its highest officials believe that blacks and Hispanics should be stopped at the same rate as their proportion of the local criminal suspect population,' she wrote. 'But this reasoning is flawed because the stopped population is overwhelmingly innocent — not criminal.' Scheindlin appointed Peter L. Zimroth, the city's former lead attorney and previously a chief assistant district attorney, as the monitor. In both roles, Zimroth worked closely with the NYPD, the judge said. He did not respond to a call seeking comment.","The New York Police Department deliberately violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of New Yorkers with its contentious stop-and-frisk policy, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled .

New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez paid $305,000 to buy evidence and hide potentially incriminating links to Biogenesis, the Florida clinic behind baseball's doping scandal, according to testimony during arbitration to overturn his doping ban. As the proceeding to end the dispute between Major League Baseball and Rodriguez reached its halfway point on Friday, it was revealed A-Rod handed over cash for documents that included videotapes and affidavits that could incriminate him or be used in defense against doping allegations, the New York Daily News reported. Rodriguez is fighting the 211-game ban handed down by MLB in August to Rodriguez and 13 other players for violating doping regulations in the league's collective bargaining agreement. Rodriguez is the only player contesting the ban and can play for the Yankees during his appeal. New York Yankees' star Alex Rodriguez, pictured here (center) arriving at the offices of Major League Baseball in New York at the beginning of hearings to overturn his 211-game suspension, paid $305,000 to buy evidence from disgraced Florida clinic Biogenesis, according to a source . A source with knowledge of the closed-door proceedings, held in MLB's New York Park Avenue offices, told the Daily News that A-Rod and his representatives confirmed during sworn testimony that Rodriguez forked over the $305,000 to buy the evidence from Biogenesis - a claim that boosts MLB's case against the fallen star. But with MLB seemingly set to strike out Rodriguez, A-Rod's team hit back with a counter claim that the league also paid cash to Biogenesis for its own evidence in the case. The New York Post claims its own source revealed that MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred testified on Thursday that he authorized a payment of $125,000 in cash in return for documents from the Florida clinic. Anthony Bosch, former boss of South Florida anti-aging clinic Biogenesis, is the star witness in the MLB case against Rodriguez. It has been alleged Biogenesis supplied baseball superstars with banned substances . But A-Rod's legal team denied the allegation the 38-year-old third baseman paid any money to acquire data from the disgraced anti-aging clinic. 'The notion that we paid any money for any Biogenesis documents is patently false, and anyone who is leaking this information knows it’s false,' said A-Rod attorney Joseph Tacopina. But a third source told the Post the tit-for-tat claims over cash payments was all about the detail. Rodriguez apparently did acquire copies of Biogenesis information but did not pay for it, a point that shows just how much the he-said she-said desperate details of the proceeding have turned ugly. Alex Rodriguez strikes out against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium in September. His 211-game ban is not in effect while he appeals the decision. A-Rod's career could be on the line as the MLB doping dispute gets ugly and uglier . A Post source claimed Manfred's testimony stated a member of MLB's investigation team made one payment of $100,000 and a second payment of $25,000 to Gary Jones, a former Biogenesis employee, for information stolen from Biogenesis founder Tony Bosch. After receiving his 211-game ban based on connections to Biogenesis, Rodriguez sued MLB and included in his filing that: 'Dan Mullin of MLB purchased what were represented to be these stolen documents for $150,000 in cash, which was handed off in a bag at a Fort Lauderdale, Florida area restaurant.' MLB denied those allegations and said: 'None of those allegations is relevant to the real issue: whether Mr. Rodriguez violated the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.' Major League Baseball COO Rob Manfred said that if the league did buy evidence from third parties it was to reveal the illegal activities of players . Manfred said MLB buying evidence was legal. 'There is nothing wrong with purchasing documents in an investigation,' he told the Daily News. 'We did it in the course of trying to see if we had players using performance-enhancing drugs in violation of our agreement. I’ve acknowledged it previously.' Arbiter Frederic Horowitz is expected to rule in December whether Rodriguez’s suspension by MLB will be hit out of the park or stand firm. If confirmed, the ban will be the longest in MLB history. A-Rod's career - and legacy - depend on the decision.","Bid to overturn 211-game ban turns ugly as cash-for-evidence claims hit both A-Rod and Major League Baseball .

Marks & Spencer customers with a mighty appetite can now try to tackle the biggest steak available from the high street supermarkets. Called the Tomahawk, the steak weighs 2lb 8oz and is more than five times heavier than the average cut of meat – which are usually a less-daunting 7oz. Carnivore's dream: The Tomahawk steak is more than five times heavier than the average cut of meat . But at such a formidable size it remains to be seen whether the new prime cut of steak will be too much for Marks & Spencer customers to stomach. However, Tom Harvey, the company’s meat buyer, said he has high hopes that the new product will be a success when it becomes available online for the first time this weekend. Mr Harvey said: ‘I trialled the idea of the Tomahawk with my friends. When they saw it in my kitchen it had jaws hitting the floor, and there is now a waiting list of guests wanting to come and feast. 'We’re really looking forward to seeing our customers’ reactions and hope that this will be the ultimate dish for them to wow their dinner party guests with.’ Inspiration: The Tomahawk was named after the large Native American weapon of the same name . The £25 Aberdeen Angus rib steak is hand trimmed and sold with the entire rib bone left intact to enhance the flavour. It has been named the Tomahawk because it is said to resemble the large Native American weapon. The beef is from cattle reared in the UK and is matured for 28 days before it becomes available to order. Mr Harvey added: ‘Feasting on colossal slabs of well-reared, well-butchered meat is a simple guilty pleasure you can’t beat. 'We know our customers love eating our delicious steaks, and our Tomahawk really is the ultimate steak experience.’ M&S recommends cooking the steak by  frying it first and then browning it in the oven before serving. The Tomahawk steak is part of Marks & Spencer’s Food To Order online-only range featuring its own butchers and fishmonger service as an extension of its web-based entertaining range. And while the steak will offer the ultimate challenge to the committed carnivore, the supermarket does recommend that the Tomahawk should serve two to three people.","The so-called Tomahawk steak weighs five times more than the average cut .

Faith schools could be banned from teaching their own denomination if proposals to add RE to the national curriculum go ahead . Faith schools could lose the right to teach their own belief and instead have to give more weight to other religions. A report by the Religious Education Council for England and Wales says RE has become marginalised and should be added to the national curriculum. But that would make it a legal requirement for all school to teach the same syllabus, regardless of their faiths. The report, a three year review of religious teaching in schools, could form the basis of a new curriculum when it is released next week. Chairman John Keast has admitted that it would be difficult for faith schools to teach their own denomination, but said one solution could involve optional modules for students. Speaking to The Times, he said: 'These are quite important and difficult issues to overcome. I don't personally think they are insuperable. 'I think you could get sufficient agreement on a national body of religious education knowledge and skills and understanding that everyone should know for the modern world.' Since 1944 RE has been given a special status as a compulsory subject but which has no specified content. Instead the subject matter is agreed by a committee of faith leaders, teachers and politicians agree the topics covered in each area. Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, is criticised in a report on religious education for scrapping bursaries for trainee teachers and not putting RE on the English Baccalaureate . Faith schools make separate arrangements through their diocese while academies can also decide their own content. The report will also accuse Micheal Gove of damaging RE by scrapping bursaries for trainee teachers, refusing to add the subject to the English Baccalaureate and rejecting calls to update teaching materials. An Ofsted report said earlier this month also said more than half of England's schools were failing pupils on religious education. The report says there is a lack of focus on the subject and that six out of ten schools are not realising the subject's full potential in lessons, highlighting low standards, weak teaching and confusion about the purpose of the course. The RE council also had to raise £100,000 to fund its own curriculum guidance after the Government turn down its bid for funding. A Department of Education spokesperson said: 'Religious education remains a compulsory part of the school curriculum and the numbers studying the full course GCSE and A levels in the subject has increased in the past year.'","Report says RE should be added to national curriculum .

But even by the standards of Tony and Cherie Blair, their latest transaction is set to be particularly lucrative. A four-storey house bought for £1.29million for eldest son Euan has been put on the market for £2.35million – leaving the Blairs with a potential £1million profit in just three years. Shrewd: A four storey house bought by Tony and Cherie Blair, right, for their son Euan, left with new wife Suzanne Ashman, for £1.29million is now on the market for £2.35million just three years later . There’s one snag, however. The house is being marketed as containing a ‘separate apartment’, even though planning permission has never been obtained for one. The Central London home was bought in the name of Euan, 29, and his mother Cherie in 2010. It immediately attracted controversy because of an attempt to get planning permission to separate the basement into a self-contained flat. Westminster Council received an application to build steps down to the basement from the street, and to divide it into a separate flat. The internal stairs to the basement were to be removed. Three neighbours complained, fearing greater pressure on parking, rubbish collection and other services, and after advice from the council the application was amended. On the market: The Central London property has an asking price of £2.35million . This application retained the new external entrance – and its own kitchen – and was duly approved. However, a council officer noted in June 2010: ‘This permission does not authorise the use of the basement as a separate self-contained flat.’ By May 2011, the council received a complaint that Euan had replaced a door to the upper floors with a wall, in an apparent attempt to create a separate basement flat. Following ‘enforcement action’ the council was told the wall was being replaced by a door. But last year, the battle to create a separate flat resumed and, at one stage, a new number was placed on the basement door, along with a letter box. The council again took ‘enforcement action’ saying that it received a report of ‘general nuisance (loss of amenity)’, involving the ‘use of the basement as a self-contained flat’. Visits from the council led to a denial from Euan that he was using his basement as a separate flat, and the action ceased. But the property is now being marketed by Sandfords estate agents as having ‘a separate apartment on the lower ground floor’ ideal for a ‘separate office or rental investment’. There is no warning it still needs planning permission. Last night sources at the estate agents claimed that the one-bedroom flat had been rented out for £1,200 a month. The source said a locked door on the stairs to the upper floors ensured the basement could be used as a separate home. Last night a spokesman for the Blairs refused to explain why both the house advert and estate agent suggested the basement was a self-contained home – but insisted Euan and Cherie had done nothing wrong. ‘Westminster Council has already accepted that there are two units, which is why it charges two separate council taxes,’ the spokesman added. A spokesman for Westminster Council said: ‘No planning application has been received to divide this house into two dwellings – and following information received we have now started an investigation.’ Another council spokesman said council tax valuations had no bearing on whether planning permission had been issued for the basement flat to be a separate dwelling. Last month Euan married girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25.","Central London house is on the market for £2.35million .

As a young mother’s vehicle skidded to a halt on a Long Island, New York highway, remarkably she and her three-year-old son had escaped without a scratch despite careering off the road. However, she was about to make an important, yet shocking discovery. Although the car had come to rest on top of some brambles that ran alongside the Northern State Parkwam, it was what the woman stepped onto that set the mystery in motion: a human skull. Recognize him? Investigators initially thought the man, who was wearing this shirt when found, was a boy because of his small stature. Dental examination revealed he could have been as old as 55 . Hidden from view: The skeleton was discovered here, at the side of the Northern Parkway, hidden from view . Concealed: The body was found in woods that run along the center of the highway and that few, if any people, ever walk along . Within hours of the gruesome discovery in March 2004, investigators from the New York State Police began to recover the rest of a fully clothed male skeleton – the body of which had been partially stuffed into a plastic bag. The police were stumped. They had no idea who the man was or how he died – and more importantly, who dumped his body. Luckily, there were some clues that cops were able to seize upon and they earnestly begin to generate a profile of the victim. One of their best clues to his identity was an item of clothing, an iconic artefact from the era of Pac-Man and MTV – his 1980s Members Only jacket. Evidence: It's known as the 'Members Only case', named because the man, his entire, fully clothed skeleton had been stuffed into a plastic bag and when eventually unearthed, was wearing a Members Only jacket . Change: Even some coins were found in the man's pockets - although they tell us nothing about who he was . The victim was wearing a white button-down shirt, bellbottoms, tube socks and the Members Only jacket. Bellbottoms were popular in the 1970s, and the jacket had its heyday in the 1980s. The jacket was taken to a lab where detectives learned the item had been made at a factory in Sri Lanka in 1982. It meant the man had probably been hidden in the woods by the side of the highway for more than twenty years, before being found. Almost ten years on since the discovery of the missing body in 2004, detectives still haven’t identified the victim or figured out who might have killed him. ‘We want to identify him to give somebody, somewhere, closure,’  said Senior Investigator Thomas Hughes to NBC News. ‘Maybe there’s a kid out there who wants to know what happened to his father.’ Hughes, who caught the case when the body was first found, says the 2004 investigation was ‘painstaking,’ and that it was frustrating not to have resolution. Mystery: The victim was wearing this shirt when they died but did not have any JD on them . Found: A 1970s-style 'Afro-pick' comb was found with the body . The man inside the clues: Despite his unglamorous clothing, he was also wearing a fancy Bulova watch. The timepiece had been manufactured by the Queens, N.Y., based company in 1960, when it had carried a retail price of $500 . Bare bones: The case was only looked into when a woman involved in a car accident stepped onto a human skull after her car slid off the road . ‘When it went cold,’ he said, ‘I kept working on it myself.’ He’s now been paired with a new investigator to take another pass at the evidence. There were no bullets found at the crime scene and there was no trace of identification found anywhere near the body. The investigators have had to make guesses about who the man was and where he may have lived. A computer generated reconstruction of the victim shows a high-cheekboned face with dark hair and a slightly dark complexion. In 1994 the Medical Examiner believed the victim to be Caucasian, based on his cheekbones, but Hughes says that now he’s not so sure. There were coins in the pocket of the bellbottoms, and the date on a dime, the newest coin, was 1974, meaning the crime couldn’t have happened any earlier. The man’s money clip was empty but had the logo of a New York City heating oil company called Paragon Oil. He was also wearing a fancy Bulova watch. Short: The man was just 5ft 1in tall and was wearing bellbottoms which were popular in the 1970s . Tube socks: Buried for almost 30 years . Cops say the most distinctive thing about the dead man was his height. At first police thought he may have been a child because he was only 5 foot 1 but dental analysis puts the man’s age at anywhere from 35 to 55. Twenty years ago, during the original investigation, the combination of a fancy watch and the small stature of the man made investigators believe that he man could have been a jockey – but no jockey’s had been reported missing. Investigators are focusing on the man’s height as a way of trying to identify him. Someone who was shorter than 99 percent of American adult males. The case will restart its inquiry in Queens and attempt to retrace life in the 1980s. Few of the missing persons cases from the early 1980s and before have been computerized. ‘Back then missing persons cases were filed and put in a box,’ explained Hughes. ‘We’ll literally be looking through warehouses full of boxes in Queens.’ Anyone with information on the ‘Members Only’ case should call the New York State Police Troop ‘L’ Major Crimes Unit at (631) 756-3300.","Police now having another attempt at solving the case .

Surveillance video showing a Dallas police officer shooting a mentally ill man as he stood still about 20ft away contradicts the assertion of an officer that the man threatened his safety by lunging at him with a knife. Bobby Gerald Bennett remains in hospital after being shot in the stomach on Monday. The officer who shot him, Cardan Spencer, is on indefinite administrative leave pending a criminal investigation after a neighbor released surveillance video that captured the incident. Bennett was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a public servant, but Police Chief David Brown announced on Friday that the charge would be dropped. Caught on camera: Surveillance footage from a neighbor's security camera show two officers approaching Bobby Bennett, left . Injured: Bennett is pictured falling to the ground after being shot by an officer who claimed he lunged at him . Mr Bennett's mother, Joyce Jackson, said in an interview yesterday that her 52-year-old son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that he was off his medication at the time of the shooting. Ms Jackson said she was arguing with . Bennett when she called the police. She was told that officers who have . been trained in dealing with the mentally ill would arrive to assist . her. The officers arrived outside her . southeast Dallas home at about noon to find Mr Bennett sitting on a . chair in the street holding a knife. At this point, accounts of the . incident differ. Health problems: Bobby Gerald Bennett suffers from schizophrenia and is bipolar . Officer Spencer wrote in a police report that Mr Bennett refused to drop the knife and moved towards him and another officer 'in a threatening manner'. He said that was when he fired at Mr Bennett four times from about 20ft away, wounding him. The . video tells a different story. Although the police report says Mr . Bennett 'lunged' at the officers with a knife, in the video he stands up . from the chair but then doesn't appear to move at all until the gun is . fired and he crumples to the ground. The . surveillance video doesn't include audio, and Officer Spencer wrote in . his report that Mr Bennett yelled at them, 'You all are gonna need more . officers than this!' But it doesn't show that the incident . 'escalated, which led an officer to fire his weapon upon the . individual', as police spokesman Warren Mitchell said in a statement a . few hours after the shooting. Police Chief David Brown said in a statement on Thursday night that Officer Spencer has been placed on indefinite administrative leave pending a 'thorough criminal investigation'. Ms Jackson said she and her son had been arguing about whether he could take an ink drawing of a rose he had done for his late grandmother. The drawing is framed on the wall of her home. The argument soon escalated to the point where Ms Jackson felt she needed police assistance. 'I'm devastated that I felt the need to call 911,' she said. Ms Jackson said her son struggled . with mental illness and often left her home to sleep on the streets, but . said he is an avid artist and reader and isn't violent. According to state criminal records, he was convicted of larceny, . vehicle theft and forgery in the 1980s but has no recent arrests. 'I was expecting help from someone that's a lot more knowledgeable than me,' she said. Mr . Mitchell, the police spokesman, declined to say whether the two . officers sent to Ms Jackson's home had any specific mental health . training. Ms Jackson, who . was inside her home when she heard four gunshots, said it was a . 'miracle' that her neighbor's camera recorded the incident. Otherwise, . 'I wouldn't have had a leg to stand on,' she said. Maurice Bunch installed the surveillance camera two years ago after a trailer was stolen from his driveway. Regrets: Bennett's mother, Joyce Jackson, says she wishes she hadn't called for help when her son become agitated after trying to take this picture from her home . 'The videotape just cries out for an independent investigation,' Bill Wirskye, a former high-ranking Dallas County prosecutor, told Dallas News. 'Maybe there’s something that’s not in the video that would justify the officer’s actions, but at least based on the videotape and the documentation that I’ve seen, it’s not a justified shooting.' Because of the charge against him, Ms Jackson had been prevented from seeing her son, who has been in intensive care since Monday. An order from a judge reversed that decision on Friday. 'When I knew I was going to get up to see him, I was jumping up and down up in the cul-de-sac,' Ms Jackson said.","Recording appears to go against Cardan Spencer's claim that he fired because of threatening behavior .

A teenager has died after a fire tore through her grandparents' home while she was house-sitting for them while they were on holiday. The girl was found dead at the five-bedroom property in Abernant, near Aberdare in south Wales by firefighters who fought the blaze. Neighbours said the 18-year-old was house-sitting for her relatives when the £450,000 home, owned by Keith and Ann Harris, went up in flam yesterday. A teenager has died after fire tore through her grandparents' home. The five-bedroom property, pictured, in Abernant, near Aberdare in south Wales was destroyed by the blaze . Firefighters battled the flames for three hours before they discovered the 18-year-old's body inside. She is understood to have been house-sitting for her relatives . It is understood the couple were on holiday at the time and had asked their granddaughter to 'keep an eye' on their home. Robbie Williams, who lives nearby, raised the alarm after spotting smoke billowing from the building. He fought to get into the burning house, in a bid to reach anyone trapped inside. 'I jumped over the fence and dropped down into the garden, and the flames were so intense, blowing hard in the wind. 'I . wanted to get onto the veranda to help anyone inside, but there was no . way I could get in. It wasn’t so much the flames, it was the heat which . was incredible.'

Escape route: Adam Lanza set up an ambush for police with his car in a way that allowed him to flee through the woods . Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza laid out five identical sets of military fatigues in his darkened bedroom and set up an ambush for cops arriving at the school that could have afforded him a chance to flee into the nearby woods, it was revealed today. The new details - gleaned from an in-depth Connecticut State Police investigation - suggest Lanza could have been planning to escape Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting dead 20 first grade children and six women. Detectives still have not determined what drove Lanza to plan and execute the horrific December 14 attack on the innocent teachers and students. The new information comes from the Hartford Courant, which published a report Friday with exclusive details from the investigation. When Lanza arrived at the school, he parked his mother's Honda sedan in a way that would have allowed him to ambush unsuspecting police officers who were arriving at the scene of the shooting. The passenger side door was facing toward a wall of the school. He leaned a semi-automatic Soviet-style 12-gauge shotgun against the car - presumably to use once police showed up. He took an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle and two handguns inside with him. All four of the weapons belonged to his mother. Detectives told the Courant that the car was positioned to give Lanza a straight line of fire toward cars headed toward the school up the property's long driveway. The school and the nearby woods would have been behind him - allowing him cover and, possibly, an escape route. The report also details an eery scene that Lanza left back at the million-dollar mansion where he lived with his mother. Lanza killed 20 children and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School before taking his own life . In his bedroom, he taped black plastic garbage bags across the windows to block out all sunlight. His bed was crisply made. And he laid out five identical sets of combat fatigues - tan-colored shirts with five pairs of khaki pants. In the nearby computer room, detectives found an empty cereal bowl next to the computer hard drives that Lanza had taken out of his computers and tried to smash with a barbell. Those he didn't smash, he carved a 'W' into. Lanza's mother, who pulled her son out of public school and home-schooled him, was found in her bed. She was shot four times in the head with a .22-caliber rifle. The shots were fired at point-blank, with the muzzle of the gun pressed against her forehead. Detectives say Lanza's online habits - which include numerous postings about guns and other mass shootings - could provide the greatest clues about his motives.","Gunman Adam Lanza parked his car at Sandy Hook Elementary in a way to give him a clear line of fire for arriving police cars .

A man has confessed to the kidnapping, rape and murder of two women in a Cleveland neighborhood in the 1990s as well as additional rape and kidnapping charges. Elias Acevedo, 49, was charged on Thursday with the kidnapping, rape and murder of 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton who was found strangled in 1994, and Christina Adkins, who was 18 and five months pregnant at the time of her disappearance in 1995. He faces 293 counts, including charges involving the rape and kidnap of children. Scroll Down for Video . Confession: Elias Acevedo has confessed to raping and killing two women in the mid-90s . Acevedo lived on the same block as notorious kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro during the 1990s. Following the discovery of Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus, who had been missing for 10 years, languishing in the basement of Castro's home, there was a renewed focus on missing persons cold cases. 'Because the public became more aware and investigators were determined and relentless, people were re-interviewed and there was an increased interest in these missing person cases,' FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson said. When police questioned Castro's neighbors, it was discovered that Acevedo was a convicted sex offender and hadn't reported his address to police. Locals: Christina Adkins (left) and Pamela Pemberton (right) both went missing in the mid-90s . Neighborhood: Cuyahoga County Sheriff deputies patrol the neighborhood outside Ariel Castro's home in Cleveland in May, the same block where Acevedo lived . Acevedo was arrested on June 11 in connection with a 1993 rape case after a rape kit taken at the time was tested for DNA evidence. According to Cleveland.com, the woman Acevedo raped in 1993 was his brother's common-law wife. She dropped the charges against him because he had seven children and twins on the way at the time. Tragic: Christina Adkins was 18 and five months pregnant when she was murdered by Acevedo . When detectives spoke with her about Acevedo this year, they were able to start building up a profile of his behaviour, which involved strangling, keeping the underwear of his victims and a tendency to return to certain geographical areas. The 1993 rape occurred close to the spot where his neighbor Pemberton's body was found in 1994. Pamela Pemberton was found dead in a field on West 11th Street, near Clark Field, by three youths going to school October 24, 1994. Homicide detectives said Pemberton had been strangled and was found naked. She had been going to meet a friend at a bar and never returned home. Acevedo was then linked to the 1995 disappearance of Adkins, who was last seen close to Acevedo's home. A spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office said that Acevedo has confessed to the murders, which means authorities will not seek the death penalty. Victims: Christina Adkins (left) and Pamela Pemberton (right) were murdered within a few months of each other . The Guardian reports that Acevedo led detectives to the spot where he dumped Adkins' body in a manhole under a busy highway overpass on the Ohio city’s west side. Remains recovered from the manhole were sent for DNA testing and test results today proved the remains were those of Adkins. Acevedo has a long criminal history that dates back to 1988, including theft, receiving stolen property and a 2003 rape and kidnapping case for which he served three years in prison. The 293-count indictment, unsealed Thursday, charged Acevedo with aggravated murder, as well as 173 counts of rape, 115 counts of kidnapping and one count of gross sexual imposition.","Elias Acevedo, 49, has confessed to the kidnap, rape and murder of two women who disappeared in the mid-90s .

Early screenings of the upcoming blockbuster about Noah's ark has opened the floodgates of criticism as the film's director and the studio are at odds over the interpretation. The Hollywood Reporter states that the epic film, titled Noah, has been screened in front of three audiences with different faith backgrounds and was met with mixed reviews. The $125million film was shown to a largely Jewish audience in New York, a mainly Christian crowd in Arizona and a mixed group in California. His vision: Darren Aronofsky, the director behind The Wrestler and Black Swan, has spoken about how has wanted to create a film about Noah's story since he was a boy . Director Darren Aronofsky also introduced the exclusive trailer to an audience at the Echo Conference led by a Texas Church in July and it was widely praised by attendees who posted messages about it on Twitter after the fact. Interpretation: Questions have been raised about Aronofsky's vision for the film as he has previously stated that he views Noah as 'the first environmentalist' 'Just saw the trailer for Aronofsky's ""Noah"". It looks like it's gonna be off the chain,' Twitter user Micah J. Murray wrote. The project is a personal one for Aronofsky, whose recent films The Wrestler and Black Swan were nominated for Academy Awards. At the Echo conference, The Hollywood Reporter says that he said that he has dreamed of making a film about Noah's story since the seventh grade when he wrote a poem about the biblical figure. The poem won an award and he read it in front of the United Nations which he said 'gave me the courage and spirit to be a writer. So Noah's very much been a patron saint in my life leading me toward my creative endeavors.' This vision is apparently one that he does not appreciate being messed with, as unidentified sources told The Hollywood Reporter that he has been 'very dismissive' of the suggestions made by Paramount executives. The studio is splitting the cost of the collossal film with New Regency, so their input is significant but allegedly Aronofsky does not care. Film marketing consultant Mark Joseph saw one of the pre-screenings of Noah and said that it was 'an example of a director not listening to those voices that would have been warning of the dangers of veering too far away from the biblical text.' 'The director is there to serve the studio and the audience, not veer off into directions that go against the core audience's beliefs- at least if the goal is to get them to come to the theater.' Big budget: Russell Crowe (left) and Ray Winstone (right) are two of the stars in the film, which doesn't use any actual animals as Aronofsky chose to have them digitally created instead . One such direction is an interpretation of Noah as 'the first environmentalist', which Aronofsky has said in the past. A writer that obtained an early summary of the film- which uses a great deal of special effects and completely invented the animals that will be used alongside stars like Russell Crowe- and that blogger, named Brian Godawa said that it will be 'an uninteresting and unbiblical waste of a hundred and fifty million dollars'.","Director Darren Aronofsky is making a film about Noah's ark that has a reported budget of $125m .

A recent study discovered the brain activity of former NFL players is abnormal when compared to non-football players. The revelation comes after Imperial College London researchers compared the brains of 13 unnamed former footballers to 60 healthy individuals and found that the activity in the frontal lobe of the former players’ brains differed significantly from that of the non-players. The frontal lobe is responsible for the cognitive processes in the brain, abnormalities in activity can lead to difficulties with planning and other everyday tasks, the study said. Drastic difference: A researcher points to the drastic increase in brain activity among former NFL players . Scientists conducted a study where all participants had to rearrange colored balls into multiple tubes in the fewest possible steps while undergoing an MRI, the College explained in a release detailing the findings. Though the former players performed slightly worse than the volunteers, their brain activity differed dramatically. ‘The NFL alumni showed some of the most pronounced abnormalities in brain activity that I have ever seen, and I have processed a lot of patient data sets in the past,’ lead study author Dr Adam Hampshire said. The difference was striking enough that a computer program was able to differentiate between former gridiron greats and Average Joes with a 90 per cent success rate, the study said. Scientists determined the increased frontal lobe activity was the result of repeated blows to the head during football games. ‘The critical fact is that the level of brain abnormality correlates strongly with the measure of head impacts of great enough severity to warrant being taken out of play,’ Dr Hampshire explained. Brain problems: Junior Seau experienced insomnia and other symptoms of brain trauma after retiring from the NFL - he committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest so his brain could be studied . These blows, the doctor continued, have far reaching consequences. ‘This means that it is highly likely that damage caused by blows to the head accumulate towards an executive impairment in later life,’ he added. Several safety measures have been put in place in recent years by the league, including rules against hitting defenseless players, leading with helmets and ‘launching’ into players – a term used for defenders jumping into the players to violently tackle them. Tougher concussion protocols and tests have also been introduced, but Dr Hampshire cautioned they still aren’t enough. ‘Researchers have put a lot of time into developing tests to pick up on executive dysfunction, but none of them work at all well,’ he lamented. ‘It’s not unusual for an individual who has had a blow to the head to perform relatively well on a neuropsychological testing battery, and then go on to struggle in everyday life.’ Dr Hampshire did admit his study was only preliminary and that more testing would need to be done, but it may provide more ammo to the league’s detractors – including four players who filed a concussion lawsuit only days after the league settled a similar suit in August.","13 former NFL players were tested against 60 non-players .

Former Vice-President Dick Cheney has revealed he once feared that terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his heart to kill him. and had his doctor disable its wireless function. Mr Cheney, who has a history of heart trouble and suffered the first of five heart attacks at age 37, ordered his doctor to disable the wireless function. He was reminded of his concerns while watching the popular TV series Homeland, where a senator was killed by a terrorist who tampered with his pacemaker. Defense: Dick Cheney, pictured in April, had the wireless function of his heart device turned off . 'I was aware of the danger, if you will, . that existed, but I found it credible,' Mr Cheney told 60 Minutes, in a . segment to be aired on Sunday. Medical record: Dick Cheney and his doctor, Jonathan Reiner, have written a book together . 'I know from the experience we had . and the necessity for adjusting my own device that it was an accurate . portrayal of what was possible,' he added. The former Vice-President, who had a heart transplant last year when he was 71, said doctors replaced an implanted defibrillator near his heart in 2007. Mr Cheney said that cardiologist Jonathan Reiner turned off the wireless function of the device, which controls irregular heartbeats with electric jolts, in case a terrorist tried to send his heart a fatal shock. While the Homeland scene may at first have appeared far-fetched, Australian researcher Darren Pauli claimed it was possible to deliver deadly shocks to pacemakers from 30ft away, . Mr Cheney and his doctor are currently promoting a book they co-authored, entitled Heart: An American Medical Odyssey. In the 60 Minutes interview, Dr Reiner said he was worried for Mr Cheney's health during the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Medical . tests seen that morning showed Mr Cheney had elevated levels of . potassium in his blood, a condition called hyperkalemia, which could . lead to abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest. Treat: Cheney's fears of a terror attack on his device were played out in this episode of Homeland . Going strong: Vice-President Cheney had a heart transplant last year . Dr Reiner said as he watched news coverage of the tragic events on television he thought, 'Oh, great, the vice-president is going to die tonight from hyperkalemia.' Mr Cheney underwent numerous heart-related procedures over the years, including angioplasties, catheterizations and a quadruple bypass operation. However, he said the health problems never affected his job performance during his eight years as vice-president in George W. Bush's administration. Asked if he worried about his physical health impacting his judgment and cognition, Mr Cheney replied: 'No.' Health fears: Cheney with Condoleezza Rice on 9/11. Dr Reiner feared he could have a heart attack that day . He said he was aware of potential side effects from limited blood flow to the brain and effects on cognition and judgment but didn't worry about it. 'You know, I was as good as I could be, given the fact I was 60-some years old at that point and a heart patient,' Mr Cheney said. He dismissed stress as having had an impact on his heart disease, adding: 'I always did what I needed to do in order to deal with the health crisis in the moment.'","Vice-President had wireless function on heart device switched off to protect him .

Government ministers have said that iPads could be given to elderly people who could use video conferencing and email to stay in touch . Lonely pensioners should be given iPads to provide a 'low-cost link to the outside world', ministers have said. The advice has emerged just a day after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt branded the forgotten millions of elderly people in the UK a 'national disgrace'. At the National Children and Adults Services conference yesterday, Mr Hunt revealed that around five million people say television is their main form of company. But it has now become apparent that in July ministers suggested video conferencing and emails on tablet computers as a way for elderly people to stay in touch with their families. In a response to a House of Lords inquiry the Government said: 'Systems are now available which use lightweight touchscreen tablets enabled with wi-fi and broadband to allow users to send and receive email and text messages, share photos and video conference with family, friends, care providers and health professionals via a universal messaging system.' Baroness Wilkins, a Labour peer, attacked the suggestion in the House of Lords. She told The Telegraph: 'This surely was dreamed up by a 25 year-old, totally unaware of the realities of being an 85 year-old woman living on her own in frail health in 2030. 'Loneliness requires human contact, touch and empathy, and the everyday stimulus of news and gossip. It requires people whose presence does not depend on the state of a local authority’s budget.' A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Loneliness amongst older people is a serious problem, and one that cannot be tackled using a 'quick fix' solution. It is about changing attitudes in society, and making time in our busy lives. 'Older people deserve the utmost respect and dignity in care. There is no substitute for human contact and the emotional support and companionship of a close friend or family member.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said that there are five million people living in the UK whose main source of company is the television . The plans were attacked by Labour peer Baroness Wilkes who said they had been dreamed up by a 25-year-old with no idea what it is like to be old . In his speech Mr Hunt said he was struck by the reverence people in Asian countries show to their elderly people. 'My wife is Chinese and I am struck by the reverence and respect for older people in Asian culture,' he said. Hunt added: 'If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this -- and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. 'And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents.' Concerns about social care have been heightened in recent months by a series of scandals of abuse and neglect in care homes, which house about 400,000 people in England. A recent report also sparked alarm about the care local authorities were providing to people in their own homes, revealing that three-quarters allowed carers to spend just 15 minutes with each of their patients. The number of people aged 60 or over hit 14million for the first time in 2011 and is expected to rise to 20 million by 2031.","Response to House of Lords inquiry said OAPs should be given iPads .

Jason Martin injured Richard Henderson after receiving a text from his former friend asking him to turn down the volume on his Xbox game console.

Now . judge Adele Williams has given him a seven-year jail sentence, plus . another year for dangerous driving, telling him that Henderson, 39, had .

He added: 'Some things can’t be replaced, like photographs in a family album, but they have great sentimental value.'

'While we were sitting right there we thought, ""Man if this . rock falls it’ll kill them"".' I didn’t have to push hard.'

Support: Jackie Peterson, pictured here arriving at Scott's formal sentencing in 2005 stood by sun until her death this month . The mother of death row killer Scott Peterson has died still believing her son is innocent after she lost her battle with cancer, a family source has revealed. Jackie Peterson, whose son is on the condemned wing in San Quentin, California, died aged 70 earlier this month, sources close to the family have said. She stood by her son during his trial and maintained that he was wrongfully convicted for the coldblooded murder of his pregnant 27-year-old wife Laci and their unborn son Conner on Christmas Eve 2002. Jackie was known to have breathing difficulty and was seen with an oxygen mask for much of her son's hearing. Her husband, Scott’s father Lee, recently brought her home from . hospital so he could care for her in her dying days, the source said. A source close to the family told RadarOnline: 'Jackie’s death has not been announced publicly. The family does not want the notoriety that will come with it.' Peterson, 40, pleaded not guilty to the murders and has never revealed what happened before he dumped Laci’s body in San Francisco Bay. It’s understood Jackie was not able to visit her son behind bars before her death. The news comes as Scott Petersen is in the process of appealing his sentence . He filed the automatic appeal of his 2004 death sentence to the California Supreme Court maintaining that he had nothing to do with the murders. No goodbye: Jackie, right, pictured here with husand Lee, left, did not say goodbye to Scott, who is on death row in San Quentin prison, before she lost her battle with cancer, a source said . Peterson's attorney, noted death penalty lawyer Cliff Gardner, filed the 423-page document eight years after a San Mateo County jury found the former fertilizer salesman guilty of suffocating Laci and dumping her in the San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve 2002. Gardner claims that the overwhelming . publicity Peterson's trial received, incorrect evidentiary rulings and . other mistakes deprived him of a fair trial. The . murderer was convicted in 2004 after a trial that his attorney argues . surpassed the O.J. Simpson murder trial in terms of publicity. Death sentence: Scott Peterson was convicted in 2004 of the murder of his wife, Laci, and their unborn son . Such was the hype surrounding the trial that it was ordered moved from Stanislaus County of the Petersons' home, to San Mateo County. But Gardner argued that the trial should have been moved yet again because of the crush of publicity in San Mateo County. 'Before hearing even a single . witness, nearly half of all prospective jurors admitted they had already . decided Mr. Peterson was guilty of capital murder,' Gardner argues. And in what may be a first for the . American system of justice, outside the courthouse in which the parties . would try to select a fair jury, a radio station posted a large . billboard which had a telephone number for people to call in and vote . 'whether Peterson was a man or monster'. Inmate: Scott Peterson was transported to San Quentin Prison death row after he was formally sentenced to death for the murder or his wife Laci and their unborn son . Resident: The East Block Condemned Row II at San Quentin State Prison in San Quentin California, where Peterson is housed as he awaits his execution . Peterson was pictured in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit. 'The publicity continued throughout . trial,' Gardner argued. 'A mob estimated at more than 1,000 people . gathered at the courthouse to await the guilt phase verdict. 'After the guilty verdict was . announced, the 12 jurors departing to await the beginning of the penalty . phase - and decide whether Mr. Peterson would live or die - were met . with wild applause and cheering.' Beyond issues with the publicity, . Gardner argues the judge made several erroneous evidentiary decisions . and other rulings that led to Peterson receiving an unfair trial. Gardner notes that Peterson was . convicted and sentenced to death even though investigators never . directly proved 'how, where or when' the murder occurred. Prosecutors told the jury that Laci was killed sometime between the night of December 23, 2002 and the following morning. They believed she was suffocated in her home, but Gardner argues that there was little direct evidence collected at the house to support that theory. Peterson claims that Laci was killed . sometime after he left their Modesto home the morning of December 24, . 2002 to go fishing in the San Francisco Bay. Highly publicised: Scott Peterson has always maintained his innocence and claims he did not get a fair trial . Innocent?: Peterson claims that Laci was killed sometime after he left their Modesto home the morning of December 24, 2002 to go fishing in the San Francisco Bay. Gardner goes on to complain that the judge automatically excluded prospective jurors who said they opposed the death penalty. He argues that those jurors should have been questioned more about whether they could still decide the case fairly. Gardner also claims that some of the prosecution's strongest evidence should never have been shown to the jury. For instance, Gardner alleges that the police dog who picked up Laci's scent at the Berkeley Marina 'even though the dog had a dismal record of being wrong a remarkable 66 per cent of the time.' The thick legal brief delves into numerous other issues alleging incorrect rulings, juror misconduct and other errors. All death penalty cases are appealed to the California Supreme Court, which is struggling to keep up with the pace of cases. There are 725 inmates on Death Row and no prisoner has been executed in California since January 2006. Lawsuits in federal and state courts have temporarily halted executions.The appeal is expected to take months, if not years, to be resolved.

When 22-year-old Sheena Morris was found hanging from a dog leash in her Florida hotel room on New Year's Day, Bradenton Beach police ruled it a suicide. But that's something Sheena's mother Kelly Osborn could never accept. In the five years since her daughter's death, Osborn has been relentless in championing her daughter's case - insisting that investigators take a look at evidence that could lead to charges against Sheena's then 48-year-old boyfriend Joseph Genoese. With officials close to making a decision on whether to classify Sheena's death as a homicide, her mother's fight will be featured tonight in an hour-long episode of ABC's 20/20. Mystery: 22-year-old Sheena Morris (above) was discovered hanging in her hotel room on New Year's Day 2009, but her mother has been fighting for the last five years to get her case reclassified as a homicide . Searching for the truth: Sheena's mother Kelly Osborn (pictured left with her daughter) has always believed that her daughter's then 48-year-old boyfriend Joseph Genoese (right) had something to do with her death . In the special, Ms Osborn explains all of the different factors that led her to believe her daughter didn't commit suicide. Shortly before her death, Sheena renewed a magazine subscription, wrote a rent check and renewed her AAA membership for the year. Sheena was in Bradenton Beach to spend New Year's Eve with her fiance, Genoese. That night they went to dinner at a restaurant across the street and then returned to their room at the Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island. Ringing in the New Year: Sheena and her boyfriend had dinner on New Year's Eve before returning to their room at the Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island where neighbors later reported hearing them fighting . Love/hate: A friend described both Sheena and Genoese as stubborn, and said they would often butt heads . Then after midnight, guests in an adjacent room called 911 after hearing a fight in the couple's suite. 'She wasn't the type of person to back down,' friend Rena Carideo said. 'He clearly wasn't the type of person to back down, so they butt heads more often than not.' When police arrived, they passed Genoese on his way out. Sheena was in the room with her two dogs but didn't give any details about the fight. According to the account on the family's website, Justice4sheena.com, Sheena called the police department close to her home in Hillsborough County at 2am because she wanted officers to check it over. In a taped recording, the young woman's voice can he heard saying he was 'going to ruin her apartment because she ruined his life'. The Justice4Sheena site also has pictures she took on New Year's Day after their fight, recording her injuries. Evidence: Pictures posted on the Justice4Sheena page show images of her injuries she documented after their New Year's Day 2009 fight . The next day Ms Osborn got a call from Genoese who told her about the fight and how he was having a hard time reaching her. Some 13 hours after Sheena's 911 call, police entered the hotel room and found her hanging from one of her dog's leashes in the bathroom. 'Getting a notification like that is...physically and mentally, the worst, most horrifying event you could have in your life,' Ms Osborn said about learning of her daughter's death. From the beginning Ms Osborn suspected that Genoese had something to do with Sheena's death because he lied to her the fist time they met. When he introduced himself, he said he was 35 when he was really 42. Seeds of distrust: When Sheena first introduced her 42-year-old boyfriend to her mother, Genoese lied and said he was 35 . Three days after Sheena's death, Ms Osborn met with Genoese alone in her garage and warned him that she would find out the truth. 'This isn't over,' she said. 'Sheena didn't commit suicide. You can make this as easy or as hard on me, and yourself, as you would like.' Ms Osborn has kept true to that promise. Over the last five years she has put her real estate career on the back burner while focusing all of her spare time on Sheena' case - collecting police reports, 911 call transcripts, autopsy reports and crime scene photos. How did she get there? One crime expert noted that there was sand caked on Sheena's feet at the scene, but no traces of the sand anywhere on the ground in the bathroom or just outside the bathroom . She's also studied other suicides, looking for patterns such as the presence of drugs and alcohol in the system. Sheena tested below the legal limit for alcohol. There's one thing that really stands our to her about the picture of Sheena taken at the crime scene. 'Sheena and I, we wore the same mascara. I knew that...if you cry with this mascara on, that mascara just clumps up, your eyelashes are all clumped up and...hers were perfect.' Crime experts have spotted some other holes in the case. Veteran crime reporter Lee Williams pointed out that there's sand caked on Sheena's feet but no traces of sand in the shower, on the bathroom floor or on the floor outside the bathroom. Holes in his story: Genoese claimed to return to his apartment in Tampa after the fight, but his toll pass has no record of being charged for a return trip . 'Either Sheena was carried in there, postmortem and hung, or she somehow levitated into that room,' Mr Williams said. And then there's the case of Genoese who apparently returned to his apartment in Tampa that night. He gave investigators his toll pass but there was never any record of it being charged on the return trip - leading Ms Osborn to believe he never left. Initially Genoese wasn't named as a person of interest because Marcos Claudio, a tenant at his apartment, had seen him returning home that night. 'I have people that saw me that night,' Genoese said. 'What would be my motive?' 'I'm being victimized because I cared for someone,' he added. History repeating? A photo posted in June 2011 no the Justice4Sheena page shows Genoese in another hotel, with a new woman . But in April 2012 Mr Claudio revised his statement, saying he couldn't be sure when he saw Genoese coming home because he had been drinking on New Year's Eve. Lately, Ms Osborn's hard work is finally starting to pay off. After asking three independent forensics experts to review her daughter's case, they all agreed that it was not a suicide. She brought those three affidavits to the medical examiner who reclassified the death as 'undetermined pending further investigation'. Justice: Recently, Ms Osborn's hard work has paid off and she got the medical examiner to reclassify her daughter's death from suicide to 'undetermined pending further investigation' A year ago, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement decided that the case should be reopened. The case into Sheena' death is ongoing but a decision is expected soon from the Bradenton Beach police on whether to keep the suicide ruling, or reclassify the death as homicide and press charges against a suspect .

The couple, identified only as Miss Zhang and Mr Teng, are said to have placed anonymous advertisements in newspapers suggesting they would be willing to part with their baby - unborn at that stage - in exchange for 50,000 yuan (about £5,000). Police in Shanghai have charged the couple with human trafficking after accepting money for the baby, who was born at home and still only weeks, or months old, when sold. Callous: The couple, identified as Miss Zhang . and Mr Teng, are said to have put anonymous ads in . newspapers offering their baby for cash (stock image, left). They used the cash to buy an iPhone (right) and trainers .

The unemployed couple, who have two other children, were also accused of using the money to purchase a number of luxury goods. They are understood to have told prosecutors that they were acting in their daughter's best interests, claiming they had hoped to find a home for her with a financially stable family who would be able to provide her with an eduction. 'We did not give the baby away for money but in order to give it more security,' Shanghai's Jiefang Daily newspaper reported them as telling officials. Splashing out: Having received the money, which was deposited in their bank account, the couple went out on a spending spree in Shanghai (pictured) But prosecutors said they believed the couple's bank records show they had hatched a 'sinister conspiracy' to profit from the sale of the baby. One credit card bill is said to show that immediately after trading the child, the couple spent large amounts of money on the internet, including buying an iPhone and a pair of expensive trainers. In an attempt to hide that they were behind the sale of a child, the couple tried to conceal the fact that Miss Zhang was pregnant and she had even gone to the length of giving birth at home. They are said to have told neighbours that the baby bump during Miss Zhang's pregnancy was a tumour.

Open verdict: Private Cheryl James, 18, was found dead with a single bullet would to the head outside the Surrey barracks in 1995 . Relatives of a young Army recruit found dead at Deepcut Barracks today FRI demanded a fresh inquest after forcing police to disclose dozens of secret files. The family of 18-year-old Cheryl James, represented by human rights campaign group Liberty, lodged an application with the Attorney General for permission to fight for a new hearing. The move by Pte James' parents, Des and Doreen James, is the latest step in their 18-year battle for justice. The teenage recruit was found dead from a single bullet wound to her head outside the notorious base in Surrey in November 1995. An inquest held a month after her death recorded an open verdict. She was one of four young soldiers who died in mysterious circumstances at the barracks in Surrey between 1995 and 2002, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse. Private Geoff Gray, 17, Private Sean Benton, 20, and Private James Collinson, 17, also died from gunshot wounds. The families have refused to accept the theory that all four soldiers committed suicide using their own rifles and have accused the Army of a cover-up. Concerns about the string of tragedies led Surrey Police to open an investigation in 2002. Officers took hundreds of statements and instructed forensic experts but concluded there was no evidence anyone else was involved in the shootings. Controversially, Surrey Police flatly refused to give Mr and Mrs James, from Llangollen, North Wales, access to the files. Now the force has caved in and handed over 44 volumes of files – including witness statements, documents, notes and photographs - after Liberty threatened them with legal action under the Human Rights Act. Fight for justice: Des and Doreen James, pictured in 2006, have been handed 44 volumes of secret police files from a 2002 investigation into their daughter's death . Some 70 per cent of the papers have never been seen before by Pte James' family. Liberty said the material includes forensic tests that have never been properly examined and evidence some witnesses lied - including one on oath at the inquest. The pressure group has applied for a fresh inquest into Pte James' death and will soon be doing the same on behalf of the parents of Pte Benton. If Attorney General Dominic Grieve gives his consent, the family will take the fight to the High Court in a bid to secure a fresh inquest. In a statement, Mr and Mrs James said: 'We're disappointed it has taken close to 18 years for us to even get disclosure of the evidence related to Cheryl's premature death. Dead: Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, found dead with five gunshot wounds in June 1995 . Dead: James Collinson, 17, from Perth, found with a single gunshot wound in March 2002 . Dead: Geoff Gray, 17, from Seaham, took two bullets to his head in September 2001 . 'No family should ever have to go through what we've experienced, and the fact there still has never been any meaningful inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut remains a stain on the integrity of everyone involved. 'All four were placed in the care of the state and all four were badly let down. 'The implications of the new evidence is both serious and extremely worrying.' Liberty's legal officer Emma Norton said: 'Cheryl's grieving family have been consistently snubbed by the state in their quest to discover what really happened to their daughter - only a fresh inquest can deliver the truth they so deserve. 'The human rights of our troops are worthy of exactly the same protection as everyone else - until what happened to these young people at Deepcut is competently, calmly and independently investigated, justice will not be done.' A spokesman for the Attorney General's office confirmed that it had received an application from Liberty.","Family of Cheryl James, 18, demands new inquest into her death .

Liverpool Fashion Week is enforcing a strict no-sunbed rule which will mean only models who have never used, or pledge not to use sunbeds, can be involved. The ban is part of a move to encourage young girls in the city, notorious for their permatan look, to be more aware of the dangers of skin cancer. Liverpool Fashion Week has pledged not to employ models who use sunbeds. The organisers hope this will show young people that they can look good without risking their health by using sunbeds . Half of 15 to 17-year-olds in the city say they have used sunbeds, compared to just 11 per cent nationally. Amanda Moss, organiser of Liverpool Fashion Week said: ‘The health and wellbeing of our models is of paramount importance and we're delighted to be the first fashion week that has a complete ban on sunbed-using models. ‘We want our models to look their absolute best, which means not putting themselves at risk of skin cancer or premature ageing from the sunbeds. ‘We're also aware of just how many young girls in the city are using sunbeds and we hope that by showing how gorgeous our models look at this year's Liverpool Fashion Week, we will help sunbed users in the city realise they don't need to get on the beds to look great. ‘Our girls can still have that golden glow, but they'll get it from a bottle, not from the beds.’ Former Atomic Kitten Liz McClarnon, from Liverpool, has admitted using sunbeds in the past and campaigned against their use . Using a sunbed just once a month has been proven to increase the risk of malignant melanoma, but almost half of sunbed users aged 11 to 17 in the city have admitted to using them at least once every week. Models taking part in the fashion event will be made to sign a pledge agreeing to not use sunbeds during or after Liverpool Fashion Week, which runs from 14th to 19th October. Victoria Jane Davies, a 31-year-old model from Liverpool, said: ‘The “Liverpool Look” is grounded in the belief that being tanned is beautiful and so there's this constant pressure to be tanned. ‘I started using the sunbeds from a young age, once or twice a week to ensure I looked and felt good. It's only as I've got older that my skin started to show the damaging effects of the sunbeds. ‘They enhanced my lines and wrinkles and gave me more moles and freckles. As a model, I have to always have my best face forward and going on the sunbeds could have really ruined that.’ Dr Paula Grey from Liverpool City Council said: ‘We can't ignore the significant problem that Liverpool has with young people using sunbeds compared to many other parts of the country. ‘Having the city's fashion elite ban sunbeds will really help to drive awareness for the cause and engage with young people in Liverpool who look up to the models they see on catwalks.’ Liverpool council's 'The Look to Die For?' campaign is being supported by Cancer Research UK and the local NHS.","Liverpool Fashion Week is supporting Liverpool City Council's 'The Look to Die For' campaign by refusing to employ models who use sunbeds .

She is the mystery party girl seen cavorting with Sally Bercow – wife of the Speaker of the House of  Commons – in the back of a London cab last week. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal today that the woman shown draping her leg across Mrs Bercow’s lap is her best friend and drinking companion Farah Sassoon – a wealthy businesswoman and Labour donor. Until now, Mrs Sassoon’s glamorous daughter Sophia, an actress and model who starred in hit reality TV show Made In Chelsea, has been  better known than her mother. High jinks: Sally Bercow with 'mystery friend' Sarah Sassoon after an awards ceremony this week . 'Ladettes': Sally Bercow waves her arms in the air as she leaves the awards dinner with Farah Sassoon on Tuesday night . Event: Mrs Bercow arrived at the central London event with her husband John Bercow, but left with Mrs Sassoon . But pictures of Mrs Bercow and Farah Sassoon after leaving an awards ceremony have changed  all that. Mrs Bercow and Mrs Sassoon, who married hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns, are so close that Mrs Sassoon, 48, has been given a special security pass to the Houses of  Parliament, allowing her to bypass strict security checks. The two are familiar figures in  the watering holes of Westminster, where they have been seen drinking champagne until late at night. But they have more in common than just partying. Although Mrs Bercow’s husband had a long career in the Tory Party before becoming Speaker, she is a vocal Labour  supporter. Businesswoman: Mrs Sassoon owns a 'specialist' hotel and conference booking company with close links to the Labour party . Her views are shared by Mrs Sassoon, who has given more than £40,000 to the party – including a £4,200 donation to Ed Miliband’s leadership campaign in 2010. Just weeks ago, Mrs Sassoon was spotted with Mrs Bercow chatting to the Labour leader on the Commons Terrace. Her security pass derives from the special status of the Bercows as some of the few people who live in the Palace of Westminster. They occupy a palatial grace-and-favour apartment overlooking the Thames and are allowed to grant a few passes to ‘friends and family’. While other visitors must go through stringent and lengthy airport-style checks to gain entry to the Palace of Westminster, Mrs  Sassoon can walk straight in by showing her pass, just like MPs. MPs say they have often seen the two women laughing in Commons bars in recent months. ‘They look like a couple of ladettes out to have some fun,’ said one. ‘They can be relied on to provide entertainment for some of the fuddy duddies here.’ Identified only as a ‘female  companion’ of Mrs Bercow, Mrs Sassoon was photographed with  her friend after they left an  awards ceremony for gay magazine Attitude at the Royal Courts of  Justice. Mrs Sassoon was shown throwing her leg across the Speaker’s wife’s lap. Mrs Sassoon owns a ‘specialist’ hotel and conference-booking  company – Trust Reservations –  which has close commercial links  to Labour. One of her biggest contracts is arranging hotel rooms for Labour delegates at its annual conferences. Firm friends: The two women are said to be familiar figures in Westminster drinking venues . Cavorting: Mrs Bercow and Mrs Sassoon were photographed after the Attitude Awards at the Royal Courts of Justice . The company’s website boasts a picture of a Labour rally featuring deputy leader Harriet Harman and ex-union boss and Labour MP  husband Jack Dromey. Since 2007, Trust Reservations has given more than £35,000 in cash and ‘staff costs’ to Labour. In 2010, the company made a  separate £4,200 donation to Mr  Miliband’s leadership campaign. Records show that the money was received three months after he was elected Labour leader. A Labour spokesman declined to discuss the company’s business connections with the party.Mrs Sassoon was unavailable for comment last night.","Speaker John Bercow's wife was photographed at an awards ceremony .

Former Match of the Day presenter Jimmy Hill is suffering from Alzheimer’s, his family have revealed. Hill, who managed Coventry after playing for Fulham and Brentford, is now living in a care home near the south coast after his condition deteriorated. He was famously chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association and successfully campaigned for the abolition of the £20-a-week maximum wage, which was scrapped in 1961. Scroll down for video of Hill on Match of the Day... and as a linesman . Jimmy Hill presenting the BBC's Match of the Day in 1981 - he racked up 600 appearances on the show .

Sporting icon: Once a successful footballer and manager, Jimmy Hill, pictured in 1964, also became chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in 1957 . VIDEO: Hill introduces Match of the Day . It was one of the most seismic changes in football and meant that players not clubs controlled their earning power. Hill's Fulham team-mate Johnny Haynes was the first English player to earn £100 a week. That has arguably led to the player power of today, with stars such as Wayne Rooney and Yaya Toure earning upwards of £200,000 a week. Hill is fondly remembered in Coventry after an innovative spell as manager, during which he changed the colour of the club's kit and their nickname to the Sky Blues. This is still in use. He was also chairman of Coventry, and at Fulham and Charlton. If that wasn't enough, he once even ran the line at a First Division game at Highbury in 1972 after an official was injured and an appeal went out over the PA system for a replacement. He is probably better remembered now for his career as a broadcaster and he presented Match of the Day more than 600 times.

Jimmy Hill pictured at a Fulham v Chelsea match in 2006 - he was diagnosed in 2008, but his condition only came to light at the weekend . Mr . Hill Jnr, a property consultant and fitness coach who lives in west . London told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘He is the most sprightly physical specimen in the home, but his mind is not what it was. The home is the best place for him. That is not my complaint. ‘My concern is we only discovered in 2008 that power of attorney had been signed three years earlier. We said in 2008 that if Bryony’s lawyer steps aside and one of us children has joint power of attorney, we will be happy. ‘Unfortunately, that was declined. We were told they had considered giving one of the children power of attorney in 2005, but decided against because it would have been too difficult to choose just one.’ Mr Hill Jnr has raised the issue with his local MP, Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, who passed his concerns to Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor. Joanna Hill, who lives in Mexico, added: ‘It is a shame that we as his children have no rights over his treatment and care. ‘Children whose parents have married more than once should be made aware that they will be unable to influence their affairs if they register a power of attorney.

If true, Farrow's claims would mean that Ronan is not the son of her former long-term partner Woody Allen and that he would have been conceived when Barbara and Frank Sinatra were married. But Mrs Sinatra, who was married to the singer until his death in 1998, dismissed the revelation as 'a phony deal'. 'I can't hardly believe that,' she told the Desert Sun. 'It's just a bunch of junk. There's always junk written - lies that aren't true."" Scroll down for video . Dismissal: Barbara Sinatra (left) has responded to claims by Mia Farrow (right) that her son Ronan (right) could be her late husband's son, rather than Woody Allens. She branded the claims 'phony' Mrs Sinatra, 85, said that she had not been aware of the claims - which Farrow made in an interview with Vanity Fair - and that Ronan Farrow, now 25, had been left nothing in her late husband's estate. Ronan, a journalist and lawyer, has also dismissed his mother's claims, writing on Twitter on Wednesday: 'Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.' Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. She told Vanity Fair that he was the great love of her life, and claimed: 'We never really split up'. The marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie with her husband. They divorced in 1968. Together: Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra were married in 1966, when she was 21 and he was 50. She told Vanity Fair that they never really broke up and that he was the love of her life . New life: She went on to have a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, pictured with their adopted daughter Dylan and Ronan (right) and it was believed that he was Ronan's father . Two years later, Farrow married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn. The couple adopted three children and also had three biological children before divorcing in 1979. In 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, although the two never lived together. Farrow became Allen's muse and starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986. Her relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. Barbara Sinatra was married to Frank Sinatra from 1976 until his death in 1998. Vanity Fair interviewed Farrow and eight of her 14 adopted and biological children for the article. Ronan said in the article that he is 'so proud' of his large family. Marriage: Frank and Barbara Sinatra, left in 1976 and right in 1978, were married until his death in 1998 . 'I grew up across the table from Moses, who has cerebral palsy, and next to my sister Quincy, born of a drug-addicted inner-city mother, and Minh, who is blind,' he tells Vanity Fair. 'I could never have understood what it means to grow up blind or with cerebral palsy. I saw problems and needs, so the next thing you think is: ""O.K., what are you going to do about it?"", he adds. A strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back; and he has been deemed a child prodigy. He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree. Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Other costs, including shipping, insurance, and storage are minimized or eliminated by shipping goods directly from sellers without any intermediaries. This minimizes costs for sellers, while creating transparency and ease of purchase for buyers.’ They run two types of auction; Themed auctions which sell items based on ‘eclectic groups’ which run monthly, and Benefit auctions where they team up with non-profit organisations and charities. Paddle8 currently have offices in New York and LA, and claim on their website they will be opening in London ‘soon’.

The bereaved mother of a 13-year-old boy who was gunned down in Brooklyn, New York, last year has filed a lawsuit against a funeral home claiming that it had used footage from her son's emotional service in an ad without her permission.

Miss Orr's lawsuit filed this week in Brooklyn Supreme Court alleges that two months later, her other son discovered a video online promoting the ritual services of the Bedford-Stuyvesant funeral parlor Robeson &  Brown that featured shots of her son's coffin. ‘It just brought back memories,’ Orr told the New York Daily News. ‘Just seeing him in a casket — that was just too much. I’m really upset.’ The lawsuit contends that the undertakers have not received consent from Wallace's family to use the video showing the distraught family. The controversial clip advertising the mortuary has since been pulled down from the web. Robeson & Brown has not publicly commented on the lawsuit. The Daily Dot pointed out that there is still a 24-second clip on YouTube showing a snippet of Wallace's gospel service, which was uploaded by the user deanmeminger August 31, 2012.

Zaid Al-Hilli denies shooting his brother as he sat in his BMW car close to the French town of Annecy . The Surrey accountant arrested over the murder of his brother in the Alps today claims he was physically attacked by him at their last ever meeting. Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, denies shooting his brother as he sat in his BMW car close to the French town of Annecy. But he says Mr Al-Hilli had a fight with his brother, the then 49-year-old Saad Al-Hilli, in November 2011 over their father’s inheritance. ‘He pinned me down,’ said Mr Al-Hilli. ‘I was on the bed in my bedroom and he pinned me down. That’s it. That’s all.’ On September 5, 2012, Saad was blasted to death along with his wife Ikbal, 47, his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist. Now Mr Al-Hilli, who comes from an Anglo-Iraqi background, is on police bail following his arrest on suspicion of planning the murders – claims he also vehemently denies. Instead he told the Sunday Times that he believes Mr Mollier was the real target of the gunman and that the French police were concentrating on the Al-Hillis out of bigotry towards foreigners. ‘I have told the police from the beginning that I am an open book. I have nothing to hide,’ said Mr Hilli, who was arrested in June. Eric Maillaud, the French prosecutor who has become the figurehead of the enquiry, pushed for Mr Al-Hilli’s arrest but has since admitted that the case against him ‘would not last 20 minutes’ in a court of law. Mr Al-Hilli, a payroll manager who lives in Chessington, Surrey, said he was in Worthing, Sussex, on the day of the murder, and his alibi has been confirmed. Mystery: The scene of the killing in the Alps last year, which was believed to target the al-Hilli family . He has spent a total of 25 hours talking to the British police, but has refused all requests to travel to France. Killed: Saad al-Hilli was gunned down along with his wife and mother-in-law . ‘The French, I don’t trust them at all,’ said Mr Al-Hilli. ‘My brother was killed there in that region and I am not going to take the risk. If they wanted to come over here, that’s fine.’ Mr Al-Hilli said a feud over a £1millon house in Claygate, Surrey, was the only problem in an otherwise ‘smooth’ relationship between the brothers. The French claim that one of the reasons Mr Al-Hilli was arrested was because of a series of mysterious phone calls to Romania when he could have been ‘hiring’ a hitman. But Mr Al-Hilli said this was absolute fiction, saying: ‘I have no idea where Romania came from; I’ve never even been asked about Romania.’ Mr Al-Hilli said he would be prepared to take a lie detector and was on ‘a mission to find out the truth.’ He thinks the possibility of Mr Mollier being the target has been played down because of the influence of the ‘rich, powerful local family’ of Mollier’s girlfriend, the pharmacy heiress Claire Schutz. Mr Mollier had just started three years paternity leave from the nuclear components factory where he worked, and was relying on the now extremely rich Ms Schutz to support him. Road: Mr Mollier and the al-Hillis were killed by an unknown assassin near Lake Annecy . Investigation: Police outside Mr al-Hilli's home in Surrey hunting for clues into his death . It was Ms Schutz’s father, Thierry Schutz, who suggested the cycling route towards the village of Chevaline along which Mr Mollier died. In the year since Mr Mollier’s death, his surviving family have refused to release a photograph him, have never paid public tribute to him, and have attempted to keep all details of his life a secret. The Al-Hillis’ daughters, Zeena, then 4, and Zainab, then 7, survived the attack, and are now in the care of other family members.

Celestina Mba, a devout baptist Christian, is mounting a fresh legal challenge after a court ruled last year that she had no right to refuse to work on Sundays . A devout Christian who lost her job after refusing to work on Sunday is mounting a fresh court appeal this week. Celestina Mba, 58, lost a previous case after a judge ruled that not all Christians observed the Sabbath as religious. But she is now taking her case to the Court of Appeal and if successful could establish the right of Christians to refuse to work on a Sunday. Mba, a children's care worker, will argue that every employer has a duty to 'reasonably accommodate' religious beliefs in the workplace. The legal challenge comes after the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Britain had failed to protect the freedom of Nadia Eweida, a British Airways employee who was suspended after refusing to remove a cross at work. Mba's lawyer, Paul Diamond, is expected to argue that the ruling in Eweida's favour extends to religious days as well as items of clothing. Under the new ruling the baptist mother-of-three only has to prove that she herself holds the belief, not that it is a general rule which all Christians observe. Shopworkers are already guaranteed the right to refuse to work Sundays, but other businesses must prove a legitimate need to force people to work. If the court rules in Mba's favour it could also grant Muslims the right to take Friday off, and Jews to be excused on Friday and Saturday. If successful, campaigners hope the Court of Appeal ruling would mark a rare victory for Christian causes in British courts . Mba, who is now working a new job in south west London which allows her to take Sundays off, quit her previous job in 2010 after a row broke out. Between 2007 when she was first employed and 2008 Mba claims her employers, Brightwell children's home, were happy to accommodate her request after she mentioned it at her interview. Mba's case has be launched after Nadia Eweida won her case in the European Court of Human Rights over the right to wear a cross at work . However in 2008 she was told she would have to work, and began getting other staff members to cover for her, until she was called to a disciplinary hearing in 2010 after which she left. During the case she said: ‘I was willing to work at any unsocial time of shift in order to preserve my Sundays, I was prepared to work nights, or Saturdays.' She argued that she doesn't just go to church on Sundays, but spends the whole day caring for vulnerable people in her community as part of her church's ministerial team. The order to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy is the fourth of the ten commandments. John Deegan, Mba's manager who also gave evidence at the time, told the tribunal he did not believe she had specified she could not work Sundays. Christian campaigners hope this week's case could provide a welcome victory for a faith they feel has been overlooked when it comes to sensitive issues. Andrea Williams, founder of the Christian Legal Centre, told The Sunday Times: 'The courts have acted to protect the kara bracelet (worn by Sikhs), Afro cornrow haircuts, the wearing of a hijab and a Muslim's right to fast, but have refused to grant protection to the cross of the Christian Sunday. In January this year Nadia Eweida praised Jesus after winning her seven year long appeal after she was suspended from her job as a British Airways air stewardess when a customer complained that they found a cross she was wearing offensive. The ruling, which was praised by David Cameron, said that a uniform dress code didn't supersede her right to express her faith.","Celestina Mba, 58, quit her job after being told she must work Sundays .
