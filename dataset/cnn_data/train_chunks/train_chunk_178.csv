"(CNN) -- Every old-school journalist wants this assignment: test beer to see if it's been watered down, as a recent class-action lawsuit in California claims. CNN conducted an independent lab test of Budweiser and related brands this week. The results? Budweiser contained 4.94% alcohol by volume, compared with 5% stated on the label. Bud Light Lime possessed 4.13%, compared with 4.2% stated on the packaging. And Bud Ice showed 5.35%, compared with the label's 5.5%. When told of the results, a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch, which brews the brands, reiterated the company's stance that the lawsuit is ""completely false"" and ""groundless."" Berrong on Beer: Why I drink good beer . ""The sample test results you provided are well within the variability of the all-natural brewing process and all in full compliance with all alcohol labeling laws, as we noted,"" Peter Kraemer, vice president of brewing and supply for Anheuser-Busch, told CNN. Joshua Boxer, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he wasn't surprised by how CNN's results differed from the brewer's figures. The lawsuit's claims are partly based on internal information from former Anheuser-Busch employees, and the suit will be seeking the beer maker's internal numbers on alcohol content, Boxer said. ""That's the proof you should actually be asking for,"" Boxer told CNN. The plaintiffs' attorneys believe a bottle of Budweiser has 4.7% alcohol instead of the label's 5% figure. Over a year of brewing, that alcohol difference amounts to ""tens of millions"" of dollars in savings for the company, Boxer said. ""The most accurate data, as we discussed, is going to come from Anheuser-Busch because they do their testing six times per second,"" Boxer said. ""And they use different technology, in fact, from the laboratories you used."" Earlier this week, two California residents sued Anheuser-Busch, alleging the company waters down Budweiser and other beers ""significantly"" to boost profits. The class-action lawsuit alleges that the maker of the ""King of Beers"" has the technology to precisely control the amount of alcohol in its beers but adds water so the alcohol is well below the advertised figure of 5% by volume, the suit said. ""There are no impediments -- economic, practical or legal -- to AB accurately labeling its products to reflect their true alcohol content,"" the 18-page lawsuit said. ""Nevertheless, AB uniformly misrepresents and overstates that content."" The beer maker has rejected the lawsuit's allegations and now points to media outlets' independent tests to bolster its response. ""The claims against Anheuser-Busch are completely false, and these lawsuits are groundless,"" Kraemer said earlier this week. ""Our beers are in full compliance with all alcohol labeling laws. ""We proudly adhere to the highest standards in brewing our beers, which have made them the best-selling in the U.S. and the world,"" he said. The brands that the suit alleges are watered down are those tested by CNN and Bud Lite Platinum, Michelob, Michelob Ultra, Hurricane High Gravity Lager, King Cobra, Busch Ice and Natural Ice. But the suit doesn't provide figures for the allegedly watered-down alcohol content. Nina Giampaoli and John Elbert, who reside in Sonoma County, California, are the plaintiffs who say they stopped buying Budweiser after learning of the alleged mislabeling, the suit said. Their suit, filed last week in federal court in San Francisco, alleges violations of California's consumer protection laws and Missouri's Merchandising Practices Act. ""I think it's wrong for huge corporations to lie to their loyal customers -- I really feel cheated,"" Giampaoli said in a statement. ""No matter what the product is, people should be able to rely on the information companies put on their labels."" CNN's Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","CNN hires an independent lab to test samples of Budweiser and three related brands .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A former kingpin for a Colombian drug cartel pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court to charges of drug trafficking, obstruction of justice by murder and racketeering, federal officials said. Authorities say Montoya, known as ""Don Diego,"" was the head of the Norte del Valle drug cartel. Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez had faced 15 criminal charges, said Montoya's Miami attorney, Bill Clay. ""As is often the case in plea agreements, there are concessions and benefits a defendant gets,"" Clay told CNN. ""There are benefits that are very valuable to Montoya. Twelve counts will be dismissed at the time of sentencing."" Montoya's plea covered two federal cases. In one, prosecuted by the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, Montoya admitted to one count of conspiracy to import more than 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder, federal officials said. In the second case, prosecuted in the District of Columbia, Montoya pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage racketeering. That case was transferred to Miami for the plea. Sentencing is set for October 21, Clay said. By statute, Montoya could be sentenced to life in prison, but he will not, the attorney said. He said he believes prosecutors will ask for a 45-year sentence. Federal officials lauded the plea agreement Tuesday. ""This notorious leader of the extremely violent Norte Valle Cartel is where he belongs: behind bars for murder, drug trafficking and racketeering,"" acting Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a news release. Montoya, 48, had a $5 million reward on his head before his capture in Colombia in September 2007 and extradition to the United States 15 months later. He had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list since 2004. Authorities say Montoya, known as ""Don Diego,"" was the head of the Norte Valle drug cartel. The FBI called the cartel ""the most powerful and violent drug trafficking organization in Colombia."" The Justice Department said Tuesday that, ""based upon FBI estimates, at its peak the Norte Valle Cartel was responsible for 60 percent of the cocaine exported from Colombia to the United States. ... (B)etween 1990 and 2004, the Norte Valle Cartel exported more than 1.2 million pounds, or 500 metric tons, of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States."" Even though he did not have to, Montoya chose to make a statement to Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga, the Colombian's attorney said. ""He said to the judge he wanted to express remorse to his family and to the families of the victims of his criminal conduct,"" Clay said. Montoya is the fourth member of his family to be convicted as part of the Florida case, officials said Tuesday. A brother pleaded guilty in January to one count of conspiracy to import more than 5 kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In November 2005, officials said, another brother and a cousin each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than 5 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. Each received a sentence of more than 20 years.","Former kingpin for Colombian drug cartel pleads guilty in U.S. District Court .

"London (CNN) -- That's what puts bread and butter on the table!"" chirped golfing great Gary Player as he putted a ball effortlessly on the green. The man who has trademarked himself as the ""World's Most Traveled Athlete"" says he has racked up more than 15 million air miles traveling the world in a stellar career that saw him win 165 tournaments and nine major championships over five decades. But a lot has changed since his early days on the pro golf circuit. Watch video: Golf legend Gary Player . ""When I first traveled 60 years ago there were no jets. We traveled from South Africa to America for example, it took us over 40 hours -- four stops,"" said Player at a golf course in Kent, an hour outside of London. ""We used to stop at a place called Cocos Island and I remember the captain saying 'Folks we're going to be here for two hours -- lie on the beach, you can have some coconut juice, there's some sun screen, have a drink and when you hear TO WOOOO, come and get back on the plane.' ""It really is amazing how things have changed. Now, even though you fly non-stop all over the world, planes are never on time and there's a delay to get off the plane. I think airports should make it easier for people coming through -- I know they do try but that's not good enough."" Having only landed from South Africa a few hours before the interview, Player was on good form with his trademark enthusiasm and humor. ""When you talk about exercise and eating correctly it's easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle,"" he said. Athletes are the ultimate road warriors, crossing continents and oceans, fighting through jetlag to compete and perform at the highest level. Jet lag is the bane of long-haul travelers, especially red-eye flights, and everyone tries to cope in different ways, with the rule of thumb being ""one day to recover for one hour time difference."" See also: Paralympic stars on fast track to London . Player is very specific when giving his advice on how to stay healthy on the road, especially before your journey begins. ""You've got to be very fit,"" he said. ""Before I left last night I had a strenuous workout which helped me to sleep on the plane. ""I didn't have any dinner of any sorts. All I had were a few grapes and a banana. And this morning I didn't have any breakfast. You must make sure you drink a lot of water; when you arrive at your destination try and have a hot and cold shower to get the blood circulating, sleep for an hour, not too long and just get and go about your day normally."" See also: On the road with sports stars . Player said his favorite golfing victory was the 1965 Australian open -- not because of the tournament itself but what he put his body through beforehand. The day before the tournament began, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Player had to fly from Paris to Melbourne, Australia -- via New York, Los Angeles, Hawaii, Fiji and Sydney, he said. ""Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus said no, they weren't prepared to play -- but I did,"" Player recalled. ""I got there three hours before. I'd never seen Melbourne in my life, they gave me a brand new set of golf clubs and I won the Australian open by seven shots. I just putted and held every single putt."" This year, at the age of 76, Player became the 10th recipient of the PGA Tour's Lifetime Achievement Award. He is still as active as ever, traveling the world designing golf courses and breeding horses on his stud farm in South Africa. With such a busy schedule, exercise is still a major part of his daily routine. ""I exercise my entire body. I work out, I punch the bags in gyms sometimes, but I ride horses, I work on my farm. ""I do a thousand sit-ups -- some on a ball, some on a bench, some on the floor, some on these crunch machines, I do a whole variety because you don't want your body to know what you're going to give it that day."" Player then makes a fist with his right hand and thumps his torso three times. ""You got to keep this -- see? That's got to be HARD! Because your core holds your body together.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama broke his silence on the Colorado movie massacre Wednesday night and spoke out on the issue of gun control. ""I believe the majority of gun owners would agree ... that we should check someone's criminal record before they can check out a gun seller; that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily,"" said the president. ""These steps shouldn't be controversial. They should be common sense,"" he added. Shouldn't be controversial? Common sense? The president knows full well that Democratic strategists -- including those who run his re-election effort -- see gun control as political dynamite. They have since Al Gore lost the presidency by failing to win conservative states, an outcome many Democrats blame in part on Gore's push for gun control. For Democrats, gun politics are bad politics . Still, Obama is the party's leader. So we wanted to know whether his Democratic colleagues in Congress agree. ""I don't know how anyone could disagree with what the president said yesterday,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid agrees and he controls the Senate agenda. So he can do something about it. CNN's Ted Barrett asked the next logical question. Will Senate Democrats act? ""With the schedule we have, we're not going to get into the debate on gun control,"" Reid responded. ""But I'm very happy, I'm glad the president made the statement because it's something that needs to be done. But we're not going to address gun control."" he said flatly. So action won't happen this year. What about next year? Barrett followed up: ""If you hold onto the majority next year, would Democrats commit to making it part of your agenda?"" he asked. Reid smirked in a way that made clear he could see the political minefield ahead, and he wasn't going anywhere near it. NRA sends Democrats a message over AG contempt vote . ""Nice try. Nice try, OK?"" he glared. In the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was prepped and ready for questions about the president's comments on gun control, telling reporters she viewed his remarks ""a number of times."" ""I thought his comments were very thoughtful -- provided leadership when he said we need to build a national consensus to reduce violence in our country,"" she said. Unlike Reid, Pelosi does not control the House agenda, but she's never shy about using her microphone to make clear what Democrats want. She's also a seasoned politician who wants the House majority and her speaker's gavel back. That means retaking conservative districts where guns are popular. She danced delicately. ""There are important voices on all sides of this issue. We really need, we all recognize the importance of the Second Amendment and the need to, and also the need to reduce violence in our communities,"" Pelosi said. We then took the president's remarks to the halls of Congress and asked rank and file Democrats what they thought. Hill Democrats look to 'silent majority' on gun control . Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley is from New York City, where being anti-gun isn't very dangerous politically. ""It's harder to get cold medicine in Colorado or anywhere else than it is to get 6,000 bullets apparently over the Internet and I think that's, you know, a common sense conversation that needs to take place,"" Crowley said. But Arizona's Raul Grijalva is a Democrat from the kind of pro-gun congressional district his party is panicked about losing by pushing too hard on gun control. Still, he said he thought the presidents remarks were an ""an important ice-breaker."" ""It's been a muted conversation for too long. You know, not just the tragedy that happened in Colorado. It's a continuing cycle, and we don't talk about it, and I think there is rational discussion that needs to occur,"" Grijalva said. Being from an Arizona border district full of voters who cherish their gun rights, Grijalva said he was sure he would be hearing about these remarks from some upset folks back home. ""I think it's a tough thing, because the (National Rifle Association) carries with it a threat, a threat that if you speak against any point of gun control, you automatically face a political threat,"" Grijalva said. He is well-versed on the history of his party's retreat from the politics of gun control. ""Since 1994, after the Crime Act, that we lost the House in those years because of that, and there's been a reluctance to address it, and like I said, the perceived threat of the NRA,"" Grijalva said. ""I think the majority of the American people want us to have a rational discussion that protects their fundamental rights and the Second Amendment, but also protects the public safety. I don't that's a contradiction,"" he said. CNN's Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","Gun control steps shouldn't be controversial, Obama says .
Reid: ""With the schedule we have, we're not going to get into the debate on gun control.""
Pelosi: ""There are important voices on all sides of this issue""
Rep. Grijalva: Protecting Second Amendment rights and public safety not a contradiction ."

"(EW.com) -- Man, you give the guy a seat on the ""America's Got Talent"" judging panel and suddenly, he thinks he should take over everything. On his radio show this morning on Sirius XM, Stern casually mentioned how he's going to ""take over The Tonight Show"" when addressing the public drubbing that Matt Lauer has received over Ann Curry's departure last summer. Stern also refers to how Bob Greenblatt â€” NBC's Entertainment Chairman â€” told him how he's ""got to take over the show."" (To hear the exchange, click here). An insider told EW that no such talks are happening â€” which makes sense, considering how Leno continues to dominate at 11:30 p.m. During the February sweeps, The Tonight Show beat Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Late Show with David Letterman among adults 18-49 (1.003 million versus Letterman's 920,000 and Kimmel's 898,000) and attracted a bigger audience (3.5 million viewers versus Letterman's 3.2 million and Kimmel's 2.5 million). Still, rumors persist about a possible succession plan in 2014 that would involve Jimmy Fallon assuming the 11:30 p.m. time slot. 'Enlightened' canceled by HBO . Stern likes to talk trash about Leno. Last August, Stern claimed that reports about Leno taking a pay cut to limit staff reductions was not the entire truth. ""Jay wanted to cut staff. He's embarrassed to do it. He didn't want to come off as a bad guy. NBC took the hit for him, because they're a corporation...My bullsh-t meter is going off all over the place,"" he said. Stern also said he's been ""feuding"" with Leno for years. See the original article at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Growing up in Massachusetts, Joshua Pahigian was an automatic Red Sox fan, and going to Fenway Park was akin to a religious experience, with observed rituals. ""I would always order a sausage outside Fenway Park and wait for batting practice homers to fly over the 'Green Monster,' "" said Pahigian, author of ""The Ultimate Baseball Road-Trip: A Fan's Guide to Major League Stadiums"" and ""101 Baseball Places to See Before You Strike Out."" Now, he goes about the stadium experience a little differently. The only hard and fast rule for Pahigian: Never leave early. Staying until the very last out, like his father taught him, has created memories Pahigian will never forget. He will always cherish seeing the Mo Vaughn-driven Red Sox come back in the ninth inning on Opening Day 1998, but he'd like to erase that time the Sox lost to the New York Yankees, 22-1. Below, Pahigian shares his favorite stadiums and why you should take in a game at one of these parks. Fenway Park, Boston . It comes with the territory of being a Red Sox fan. ""I spent my summers making journeys into Fenway Park as early as 5 years old with my father, later with my college friends and then with my wife,"" Pahigian said. ""I'm prone to favoring older parks, and I love Fenway for that classic ballpark experience."" But Pahigian claims he doesn't let his team allegiance cloud his stadium judgment. ""Before I'm a Red Sox fan, I'm a baseball fan."" New Yankee Stadium, New York . By rights, Pahigian shouldn't like anything associated with the Yankees. But their updated stadium is worthy of admiration, no matter what team colors you bleed. ""They really did an incredible job with that place,"" Pahigian said. ""They spent $1.5 billion, which to me was inconceivable, but it looks amazing. It's really a palace. The façade outside is incredible, and all of the fan amenities and the sightlines are great."" Wrigley Field, Chicago . A fan of old-time parks rich with history, tradition and baseball lore, Pahigian enjoys the ivy-covered walls of Wrigley Field for the traditional experience the stadium offers fans. Like with Fenway Park, taking in a game at Wrigley Field is a must for any baseball fan, just for the honor of sitting in the 98-year-old stadium. Camden Yards, Baltimore . A newer stadium built in Baltimore in the early '90s, Camden Yards brings together the best of the classic and modern baseball worlds in Pahigian's book. ""There's something to be said for the so-called retroclassic ballparks that try to capture the aesthetics of the old-time yards but meld them with the fan conveniences and modern amenities that people expect,"" Pahigian said. ""This is the one that started the whole trend away from the multipurpose cookie-cutter stadiums and toward the baseball-specific old-time yards."" PNC Park, Pittsburgh . Pahigian likes PNC Park for its potential as a stage for baseball history, along with the current Pittsburgh Pirates roster. ""It's kind of a dark horse, and it's a small park,"" Pahigian said. ""But if the Pirates can have a contending team, I think it's a park that could get the credit it deserves for being pretty well-done."" Exploring baseball lore . If the history of the game is what captivates you most, go on your own treasure hunt for the relics of former stadiums. Pahigian recommends these three quirky locations. • Venture onto the University of Pittsburgh campus to relive a moment of baseball glory. Although Forbes Field has been replaced with academic buildings, the brick wall where Bill Mazeroski's famous home run beat the Yankees in the 1960 World Series still stands, field markers indicating the feet markings of the outfield. Home plate remains in its original spot, ensconced in the floor beneath glass. • If you're enjoying a day at the amusement park within the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, look up high next to the log ride. Yes, that's a stadium chair mounted on the wall, in its original location from when the Minnesota Twins' Harmon Killebrew hit the longest home run in old Metropolitan Stadium history. • In the early 1900s, when the Cleveland Indians were known as the Cleveland Spiders, they played in League Park. ""There's still a nice stretch of the old façade standing at the front of the stadium and the ticket office,"" Pahigian said. ""From the big league parks to the minor league parks to the now-abandoned parks that are standing in part, there are so many wonderful baseball sites out there,"" Pahigian said. ""Each one, from the nicest brand-new park to the most decrepit minor league yard out there, they all give me a special tingle when I walk through the ballpark gates.""","Baseball author shares his favorite stadiums and why they stand the test of time .

"(CNN) -- Marcos Ugarte was doing his homework when he heard the screams. Outside, the high school freshman saw flames shooting from a house several doors down. A man ran through the smoke with devastating news: A 7-year-old boy was trapped on the second floor. Marcos scaled a ladder, broke through a screen, forced open a window and carried the boy to safety. That was six months ago, less than three weeks into the 14-year-old's freshman year. It's not how you usually think of a high school student kicking off classes in the fall. And this week, Marcos is having a far-from-average spring break. The Oregon teen received a national award in Washington on Monday, picked in part by people who've won the prestigious Medal of Honor. Awareness of the medal Marcos won -- the Citizen Service Before Self Honor -- isn't as widespread. But organizers say they hope to turn the spotlight on ordinary Americans to show the acts of courage and self-sacrifice that they say symbolize the country's spirit. They describe the award as ""the most prestigious civilian award in America."" Marcos was the youngest person to receive the award, according to his high school, which hailed the news on its website. Candidates are nominated by police, fire officials, mayors, governors and everyday citizens. Recipients of the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award for valor in action, pick the winners. ""The honorees we celebrate today ... are seemingly ordinary Americans, but far from it, really,"" said Jim Miklaszewski, the award ceremony's emcee and the Pentagon correspondent for NBC News. ""They represent the true spirits of our country, going above and beyond for their communities, our nation and their fellow Americans."" Three other people were honored this year: . Jesse Shaffer III and Jesse Shaffer IV refused to give up in August of last year as floodwater rose and torrential rain pelted their Louisiana neighborhood, even though local officials had called off rescue efforts. The father-and-son team used their boat to rescue 120 people during Hurricane Isaac, according to award organizers, including a family of five that was clinging to the roof of a trailer. Monsignor Joe Carroll ran a transitional housing center to help homeless people get back on their feet in San Diego, helping more than 1,000 people every day. He ""has gone above and beyond to improve the lives of the homeless in Southern California, and by example throughout the United States,"" award organizers said. The annual awards, which officials from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation started giving out in 2008, do make a difference, Brandon Wemhoff said. The 31-year-old won last year for pinning a masked robber to the ground at a Walgreens in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2011. People are still giving him hugs of thanks. ""If more people cared about other people and they did things that were actually nice without expecting to get anything out of it, things would work out a lot nicer,"" Wemhoff said. ""We'd have a lot less crime and a lot less BS, excuse my language, and more people helping people."" As he prepared to head to Washington to receive the prestigious award, Marcos told The Oregonian newspaper that he'd told only a few of his friends. Some classmates, he said, have resented all the attention he's received. ""They think I've gotten too much fame from it,"" he told The Oregonian. ""I'm not trying to make it into a bigger deal."" In some ways, he's still a typical high school student.","A 14-year-old boy climbed a ladder to pull a child from a fiery Oregon home .

"(CNN) -- A standoff at a beachside Oregon motel ended Tuesday evening with the focus of the police's attention -- the suspect in his grandparents' deaths over the weekend -- being taken from his room and transported away in an ambulance. Members of a ""tactical team"" entered the Lincoln City, Oregon, room of 26-year-old Michael Boysen around 7 p.m. (10 p.m. ET), emerging with no injuries, said city police Chief Keith Kilian. The suspect had suffered apparently self-inflicted cuts, he added. The image of him on a stretcher being placed in a waiting ambulance closed a day full of drama at the WestShore OceanFront Suites. Boysen was taken into custody about an hour after authorities used water cannons to blast down part of the front door to the suspect's room, a move that showed authorities' intent to ""just kind of step ... things up a little bit,"" according to Kilian. ""We removed the front door for him to show him which way we wanted him to come out,"" the police chief told reporters a short time later. ""And he chose not to."" Boysen was released last Friday from the Monroe Correctional Facility in Washington state, where he served a year behind bars for burglary. His grandparents picked him up, drove him around running errands and held a gathering for family members at their home to welcome him back, said King County Sheriff John Urquhart. The next day, the grandparents were found dead. After Boysen and his grandparents did not respond to phone calls Saturday, his mother drove over with a key to the house in Renton, Washington, near Seattle, and found the couple's bodies. Boysen and his grandparents' car were missing. Authorities have not said how the victims were killed. A gun was not used, but the deaths were violent, they said. During the course of their investigation, detectives said they learned that Boysen had talked about killing his grandparents, acquiring guns and going after authority figures. He had searched the Internet for gun shows across the Pacific Northwest and Nevada. ""We need to do everything we can to get this man off the street as soon as possible,"" Urquhart said. ""His threats against authority figures make him very dangerous and unpredictable."" Boysen checked into the WestShore OceanFront Suites, situated along the Pacific Ocean, around 10 or 10:30 p.m. Monday, said Killian. The hotel clerk contacted police around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday after watching a news broadcast and identifying Boysen by face and by name. Police arrived soon thereafter, and an Oregon State Police SWAT team and hostage negotiator were on site by 10:45 a.m. With nearby roads blocked off, armored personnel trucks were stationed in the hotel's parking lot, while at least one sniper was positioned with clear sight of the suspect's room, according to video from CNN affiliates at the scene. The police chief said the suspect had barricaded his door, so even after the water cannons were used ""it didn't come down all the way."" ""His request was for us to go away and leave him alone,"" Killian said then of authorities' initial communications with the suspect. ""Obviously, we're not going to do that.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- State-run media in China has lambasted Apple Inc. for ""unparalleled arrogance"" over alleged complaints about customer service in China. The Wednesday opinion piece in the Chinese state-run newspaper, the People's Daily, is one of a series of attacks against the U.S. tech giant by Chinese media since a closely watched consumer affairs show aired on the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on March 15. CCTV alleged that Apple provides inferior service to Chinese customers, such as a warranty policy that is different from other countries. ""If you insist on challenging Chinese customers' love and patience, and continue to be heedless, then your business will eventually decline no matter how glamorous or successful your brand is,"" said the editorial, one of several articles published this week in the People's Daily critical of Apple. Apple declined to comment on the editorial. In a previous statement made Saturday after the CCTV exposÃ© aired, Apple said that its practices in China are ""completely legal."" ""We have been working to exceed consumers' expectations, and we highly value every customer's criticism and suggestions,"" the statement said. ""Apple's Chinese warranty is more or less the same as in the U.S. and all over the world."" Apple also says it provides a 90-day guarantee on repairs, which is three times longer than required under Chinese law. The People's Daily editorial also called for China to regulate the practices of foreign businesses and to protect its own consumers and the domestic market. Apple wasn't the only foreign company targeted in the CCTV broadcast. Volkswagen announced last week it would recall nearly 385,000 cars in China after the CCTV program questioned the safety of the direct shift gearbox in some Volkswagen models. READ MORE: Volkswagen to recall 384,181 vehicles in China . After the CCTV broadcast aired, Chinese celebrities posted comments on social media sites in support of the program. Children's literature writer Zheng Yuanjie wrote, ""I hope the missing part on Apple's logo isn't their conscience,"" according to the South China Morning Post. But a comment from the Weibo account of Taiwanese-American actor, Peter Ho, that included the words ""To be published around 8.20pm"" raised suspicions that the Chinese stars had been recruited to post negative comments. READ MORE: Chinese TV caught asking celebrities to bash Apple . Ho later deleted the comment and claimed his account had been hacked. Social media sites in China have been flooded with criticism against the negative media reports about Apple, claiming that the press is avoiding more serious problems affecting the country. Analysts say that the smear campaign could be linked to Apple's expansion in the Chinese market. China is Apple's fastest growing market and second largest after the U.S. Apple's sales in the greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, rose 67% last year to $6.93 billion from $4.08 billion in 2011.","Chinese media accused Apple of providing inferior service to local customers .

"New York (CNN) -- When the call came in that a pickup truck had slammed into a house, igniting a fire, volunteer firefighter Michael Cosgrove and his fellow firemen in the New York hamlet of Selden rushed to the scene. It was only when their fire trucks neared the street that Cosgrove realized that the fire he'd be fighting would be at his own house. ""He realized it was his address that was actually on fire,"" Cosgrove's neighbor Nelson Ortiz told CNN affiliate WCBS. ""So he jumped out, he left everything out of the vehicle, and he started work."" The firefighter's wife and two children, ages 9 and 7, were in the home and were able to escape unharmed. The fire started after the driver of a pickup truck, who authorities said was under the influence of drugs, lost control and crashed into a natural gas line at the house. The impact engulfed both the truck and house in flames, Suffolk County Police said. The driver of the truck was arrested. The call that came into the fire station was from the house next to Cosgrove's, leading firefighters to think that's where the fire was, Selden Fire Chief Joseph Leavens said. Last year, Cosgrove was named firefighter of the year for rescuing a man from a burning building as he waited for other firefighters to arrive.","The firefighter's wife and kids escape unharmed .

"(CNN) -- Things are finally looking up for beleaguered Boeing and its grounded 787 Dreamliner. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday approved the United States aircraft maker's proposed fix of the battery systems on the passenger jet once hyped as the ""plane of the future."" What this means is the world's largest airplane maker still has to prove its redesign of the plane's lithium-ion battery system is safe before the 787s can again take to the skies. ""The certification plan is the first step in the process to evaluate the 787's return to flight and requires Boeing to conduct extensive testing and analysis to demonstrate compliance with the applicable safety regulations and special conditions,"" the FAA said in a statement released Tuesday. In other words, now comes the hard part. No smoking gun in NTSB report on Dreamliner battery fire . ""This is no means the end of the story. Now it has permission to operate test flights. These will be lengthy and thorough and the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will have to be 100 percent confident the fix is sufficient before it allows the aircraft to fly again commercially,"" said industry expert Tom Ballantyne, the Sydney-based chief correspondent for Orient Aviation. ""This could still take a month or two, depending on how easy the fix can be applied to existing aircraft as well as planes already on the production line."" Boeing's Dreamliner nightmare started in January when the company's newest and most advanced commercial jetliner was grounded by regulators worldwide after two battery-related fires damaged 787s in Boston and in Japan. No passengers or crew were hurt in either incident. For now, there are 50 grounded Dreamliner wide bodies that were flying worldwide. Boeing has orders for several hundred more, making the issue a top priority given all the investment that's been put into the model's development. Japan's ANA replaced faulty batteries last year . What is the fix? This is how Boeing is planning to address the battery issue. To put it simply, the plan includes a redesign of internal battery components to minimize chances of a short circuit. It also involves better insulation of battery cells and adding a new containment and venting system aimed at preventing any overheating from affecting the plane or being noticed by passengers, Boeing said. ""This means if there is an issue any heat, smoke and fire will be well contained and vented outside the aircraft,"" explained Ballantyne. The FAA's approval of the plan allows for limited test flights for two aircraft equipped with prototype versions of the battery fix. Once the FAA decides the redesign is safe and meets federal safety requirements, only then will it approve the Dreamliner's return to the skies. How Boeing can bounce back . ""This comprehensive series of tests will show us whether the proposed battery improvements will work as designed,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. ""We won't allow the plane to return to service unless we're satisfied that the new design ensures the safety of the aircraft and its passengers."" Ray Conner, president and chief executive officer of Boeing's commercial airplane unit, said in a statement the company's focus has been on developing a permanent resolution. ""Working with internal and external experts in battery technology, we have proposed a comprehensive set of solutions designed to significantly minimize the potential for battery failure while ensuring that no battery event affects the continued safe operation of the airplane,"" said Conner. ""We have a great deal of confidence in our solution set and the process for certifying it,"" he said. More positives for Boeing . The news comes on the heels of other positive developments that have boosted Boeing's falling star in recent weeks. The airline maker is reportedly ready to sell a new version of its 777 jetliner, dubbed the 777x. According to Aviation Week, Boeing's board of directors is expected to decide as early as its next meeting in April whether to give the Commercial Airplanes division authority to offer the proposed 777X derivative to airlines. In other news, there are rumors Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will soon announce an US$18 billion deal to purchase up to 200 737 jets from Boeing, pushing the latter's stock up to a five-year high.

"Washington (CNN) -- When Russia asked the FBI in 2011 to check out Tamerlan Tsarnaev because of his shift toward increasing Islamic extremism, the bureau interviewed him and his family as part of a review that found no ties to terrorism. Two years later, Tsarnaev, 26, and his younger brother allegedly set off two bombs at the Boston Marathon that killed three people, then killed a university police officer and sparked a manhunt that paralyzed the city last week. Now members of Congress want to know how someone who was brought to the attention of authorities and who exhibited increasingly radical leanings never came under further monitoring or questioning. Graham backs off FBI criticism over bombing suspect . Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced Monday that the Senate Intelligence Committee she heads will look into the FBI's handling of Tsarnaev. The hearing with FBI intelligence officials, expected to be closed to the public and media, could happen as soon as Tuesday, said Feinstein, D-California. A look at Tamerlan's past . An aide to the House Homeland Security Committee said its chairman, Republican Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, also intended for the panel to examine the issue. The Tsarnaev case raised questions about the efficiency of overall security efforts, particularly involving people brought to the attention of federal authorities. Tsarnaev, who died after a shootout with police on Thursday night, was an immigrant from the volatile Caucasus region of southwest Russia who had legal residence in the United States and sought last year to become fully naturalized, like his brother Dzhokhar, 19. Bombing suspect's wife 'very distraught' However, the Department of Homeland Security rejected the citizenship request due to his past questioning by the FBI before a trip to Russia. An FBI statement said a foreign government -- later identified by legislators as Russia -- asked for information on Tsarnaev ""was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups."" In response, the FBI said, it ""checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history."" ""The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members,"" it said in the statement on Friday. ""The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011."" In addition, the FBI ""requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government,"" its statement said. That failed to satisfy Feinstein and other legislators. ""I have asked the staff director of Intelligence this morning to set a hearing, particularly with FBI intelligence,"" Feinstein told CNN on Monday, adding she hoped for answers about what Tsarnaev did during the trip. What was Tamerlan Tsarnaev doing in Russia? ""And when he came back to this country, why didn't it ring a bell with the FBI intelligence unit that he should be checked out and vetted again?"" she asked. Feinstein also noted that Homeland Security officials later denied Tsarnaev's application for citizenship, raising another question about who knew what about him. The purpose of the hearing was ""not to criticize, because I am a big fan of the FBI's, but to go back and see that we plug loopholes,"" Feinstein said. Timeline: A look at Tamerlan Tsarnaev's past . Tsarnaev, who's ethnically Chechen but came to the United States from Kyrgyzstan, spent six months in Russia, causing some legislators and analysts to speculate he may have received training during the trip. Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said Sunday the FBI may have dropped the ball in its investigation of Tsarnaev, began easing off that claim on Monday. The South Carolina Republican confirmed he talked to the assistant director of the FBI and learned how the bureau interviewed Tsarnaev, his parents and classmates in 2011. ""They put his name through the system and they sent back this information to the Russians and said, 'Do you have anything else?' And they never got a reply back,"" Graham said. Graham also noted that Tsarnaev wasn't flagged upon returning from Russia because of an apparent misspelling of his name by the Russian airline Aeroflot. ""It didn't get into the system because of a misspelling,"" Graham said. ""Now whether or not he intentionally changed his name or Aeroflot just got the spelling wrong, I don't know. That's to be determined."" As for apparent warning signs that occurred within the last year, such as YouTube postings of radical Islamists, Graham said the FBI told him ""they have limitations on what they can do."" Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows . ""So maybe it's the system failed, didn't provide the FBI with the tools, or maybe they didn't use it properly,"" he added. ""That's why maybe we need to find out what happened."" His comments sounded similar to those made by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, who defended the FBI on Sunday. Rogers told NBC the agency ""did their due diligence"" but Russian authorities ""stopped cooperating"" when the United States sought further clarification. Rogers also said he believed Tsarnaev may have traveled overseas using an alias. CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI official, said there was little the bureau could do once Russia failed to respond to its request for further details. 5 key questions . ""If they don't give you more, then everything that can be done has been done unless you know that there should be more to the story,"" Fuentes said. He detailed how the FBI employs what amounts to ""triage"" to deal with what he said were tens of thousands of similar inquiries a year that require some level of bureau investigation. ""If you are getting this from a hot place like Afghanistan or the tribal area of Pakistan or places where we have had specific training camps and people deployed on purpose to come and attack us, then that is the highest priority,"" he said. ""And even there, many of the people that go back and forth are visiting family. I mean, they are not always going back to be trained to be terrorists or always going back for refresher courses on terrorism."" Regarding Russia, Fuentes noted the ongoing conflict with Chechen separatists that may have caused Moscow's request for information on Tsarnaev. Lohr: What we know about Chechnya . ""That's been an ongoing fight, but it's been localized,"" he said, adding that he couldn't recall a case in which a Chechen trained at home came to attack the United States. However, Fuentes noted that al Qaeda had sent people to the Caucasus region for training that included bomb building. Now U.S. investigators need to find out if the Tsarnaevs ""had connections, were they deployed by a bigger group, and are there other terrorists in the United States,"" Fuentes said. ""Are there other explosive devices hidden somewhere or booby traps created, a cache of weapons?"" he wondered. ""That'll be the task."" de Waal: Suspects' culture of migration and machismo .

"(Mashable) -- Democrats who have donated to a presidential campaign this election are more likely than Republicans to have done so on the Internet, according to a new study. Nearly 57% of Democrats who contributed to the campaigns have done so online, while only 34% of Republican donors used the Internet to make their contribution, found the Pew Internet & American Life Project. Conversely, 87% of Republican donors have given money in person, over the phone or through snail-mail, while 57% of Democratic donors have contributed offline (The numbers don't total 100% because people can make multiple donations in various ways). Neither side is more likely to donate in general: Pew found that 16% of both Democrats and Republicans have contributed to a campaign in some fashion. While offline donations are still the most popular form of contributions, the Internet's a close second: of the 13% of adults who contributed to a campaign, 67% did so in-person, on the phone or through traditional mail, while 50% donated online or via email. What about cell phone donations? Democratic donors are more likely to send a donation via text message or app â€” 15% of them have done so compared to 6% of Republican donors. SEE ALSO: Now you can donate to political campaigns via text message .

"(CNN) -- Home to up to 10 percent of all known species, Mexico is recognized as one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet. The twin threats of climate change and human encroachment on natural environments are, however, threatening the existence of the country's rich wildlife. And there is a great deal to lose. In the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre's list of megadiverse countries Mexico ranks 11th. The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse. From its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea to its tropical jungles in Chiapas and the Yucatan peninsula and its deserts and prairies in the north, Mexico boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna. Some 574 out of 717 reptile species found in Mexico -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders. It is home to 502 types of mammals, 290 species of birds, 1,150 varieties of birds and 26,000 classifications of plants. Pronatura, a non-profit organization that works to promote conservation and sustainable development in Mexico, has selected six species which it says symbolize the problems faced by the destruction of nature. ""These are only some of the species which have some degree of conservation,"" says Eduardo Cota Corona, Director of Conservation at Pronatura. ""However, there is a countless number of species in Mexico which find themselves in danger of extinction."" Golden Eagle . It is the country's national symbol yet the Golden Eagle is close to extinction in Mexico. One of the largest raptors or birds of prey in the world, the Golden Eagle's wingspan can reach lengths greater than two metres. Only the Bald Eagle and the California Greater exceed it in size in North America. With its powerful hooked bill and long and sharp claws it can sometimes capture prey of a size that is surprising for its size, including crane, wild ungulates and domestic livestock, though more often than not it tends to feed off small mammals such as rabbits, hares, ground squirrels and prairie dogs as well as reptiles and small-to-medium sized birds. Primarily a solitary bird, the Golden Eagle pairs up to breed, building nests made of dry branches in cliffs and escarpments. The female typically lays two eggs which are incubated by both the male and female. Usually, only one of the hatchlings survives. The Golden Eagle can be found in Asia and Europe and mainly in the western part of North America. It was common in Mexico but in recent years has become a rare sight. Its demise has been attributed to the destruction of its habitat and the elimination of its natural prey. Human activity, in the form of hunting, capturing and commercial sale have also contributed to its decline. Pronatura has lobbied for legal protection of this bird that forms part of Mexico's flag and has launched conservation projects in its natural habitat, such as in the Cumbres de Monterrey National Park and the Cuatro Ciénegas Biosphere Reserve. Gray Whale . Pachico Mayoral, a Mexican fisherman form Baja California, claims to be the first person to have a friendly encounter with a gray whale. Up until then this enormous cetacean -- an adult can reach a length of 16 meters and weigh in at 36 tons - had been known as the devil fish for its aggressive behavior when hunted. The main group of gray whales is found in the northeastern Pacific. Each year a herd of 25,000 whales sets out on what is believed to be the longest migration in the animal kingdom - 12,500 miles - between their feeding grounds in the Bering and Chukchi seas off Alaska and their breeding territory in the warmer waters of the lagoons of Baja California. Over its lifetime, it is estimated that an Eastern Pacific gray whale will travel the equivalent of a return trip to the moon. A smaller herd of about 300 gray whales can be found in the Western Pacific between Korea and the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia. Excessive hunting in the 19th century pushed the gray whale to the brink of extinction but protection mandated by the International Whaling Commission in 1946 and the declaration by the Mexican government of Laguna San Ignacio in 1972 as a Gray Whale refuge means that it is one of the few success stories. Pronatura and the Aztec foundation have raised nearly $4 million with which they hope to guarantee the protection of 20,000 hectares of the gray whale's habitat in Baja California and ensure its survival in the years to come. Jaguar . It may be top of the food chain but this doesn't guarantee the survival of the jaguar in Mexico. The largest cat in the Western Hemisphere (it's nearest rival is the puma), the jaguar can be found anywhere from the southern United States to as far south as northern Argentina. In Mexico, it can be found mainly in the tropical forests of Chiapas and the Yucatan peninsula. With its tawny yellow coat speckled with black rosette-like spots for camouflage, the jaguar resembles most the leopard of Africa, although it has a stockier build which makes it adept at climbing trees, stalking through undergrowth and swimming. The jaguar's list of prey is long: it can hunt anything from white-nosed coati to larger mammals such as deer. Its unique anatomy -- it has an unusually large head and powerful teeth in comparison to other big cats -- gives it an abnormally powerful bite, meaning that it can take on armoured reptiles such as caiman, crocodiles and tortoises, while it often bites through an animal's skull to inflict a killer blow to the brain. It plays an essential part in maintaining a balanced ecosystem by hunting species which would put local environments out of kilter if they were to become too abundant. The jaguar is an important symbol in local Mexican culture. The Mayans believed it was a messenger between the living and the dead and Mayan kings often incorporated the jaguar into their name, while an elite group of Aztec warriors were known as ""Jaguar Knights'. In Mexico, the jaguar is a threatened species. Its decline is mainly due to the destruction of its natural habitat. For example, in the Ria Lagartos Biosphere reserve in northern Yucatyan state, Pronatura reports that only 20 percent of the original forest cover remains, the rest having been cleared for cattle-herding. Tourist development also plays its part; El Ocotal Natural Reserve, where cameras placed in the forest have captured images of six individual jaguars and pumas, is close to Mexico's tourism capital, Cancun. Pronatura estimates that if present conditions persist, the jaguar could become extinct in the northeastern part of the Yucatan within 30 to 40 years. Mexican Prairie Dog . Closely related to squirrels, chipmunks and marmots, the Mexican prairie dog is a burrowing mammal found in northeastern Mexico. It earnt its name from its distinctive call -- a mixture of barks and yips -- which is believed to be one of the most sophisticated languages in the animal world. The Mexican prairie dog feeds on the herbs and grasses of the plains of northeastern Mexico and lives in ""towns"" -- excavated colonies of up to 50 individuals which are ruled by a single alpha male. Listed as an endangered species since 1970, the prairie dog now occupies less than two percent of its former territory and can now only be found in southern Coahuila and northern San Luis Potosi -- an area of less than 500 square miles. While vulnerable to hunting from coyotes, bobcats, badgers and hawks, its largest threat is loss of habitat due to agricultural expansion. Mexican farmers have often viewed the prairie dog as a pest and it has often been hunted or poisoned. Pronatura Mexico fights for the legal protection of ""Los Llanos de Tokio"", an area of grassland in Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi and Coahuila and it has signed a conservation agreement with private land owners and ejidos (farming collectives) to protect 42, 000 hectares of land. Monarch Butterfly . Each year, between December and March, these orange and black-patterned butterflies, the size of an adult human hand, congregate in numbers of up to 250 million in a pine and oyamel tree forest in Michoacan in Central Mexico. They migrate approximately 3,000 miles from the border between northeastern United States and Canada and their gathering to breed in Mexico is considered one of the most extraordinary sights in the natural world. During its life cycle, which can be up to 20 weeks, the Monarch Butterfly goes through what is known as a complete metamorphosis, comprising four stages. From eggs laid by the female, a caterpillar is hatched. The caterpillar eats its own egg case and feeds off milkweed while storing energy in the form of fat and nutrients. It then spins a silk pad and hangs from a leaf or twig while it molts. Within its green exoskeleton, hormonal changes occur, converting the caterpillar into a butterfly. After two weeks a mature butterfly emerges. But in the last 20 years forest cover in its breeding habitat has decreased by an estimated 40 percent. Illegal logging, an increase in cases of forest fires and high levels of poverty in the region which put pressure on natural resources, have all contributed to a situation in which Pronatura believes the forest may disappear completely within 20 years. Pronatura and the non-profit organization The National Foundation for the Conservation of the Monarch Butterfly's Habitat have launched projects to promote sustainable development programs that help improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of the ""El Chapulín"" community and reduce the direct pressure on the natural resources. They also hope to reforest 30, 000 hectares of the Monarch Butterfly reserve with oyamel trees. Vaquita . The elusive vaquita (""little cow"") or cochito (""little pig"") is one of the smallest and most endangered cetaceans in the world. The only endemic marine mammal in Mexico, this porpoise can only be found in a small area in the upper Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. The vaquita can grow up to 1.5 meters and closely resembles the harbor porpoise in life span and breeding habits. It feeds on small fishes and squids. Only 50 years ago the vaquita was unkown to science and yet it is now classed as ""in critical danger of extinction"" by the World Conservation Union. The vaquita is difficult to monitor because it often dives when it hears motor boats approaching but generous estimates place its population at 600. However, a recent study put the number as low as 150. With an estimated 39 to 54 dying every year as a result of by-catches, it seems only a matter of time before the vaquita disappears completely. Its main threat comes from gillnets -- highly effective fishing nets used to capture the totoaba, an enormous fish with high commercial value -- in which the vaquita gets caught up and drowns. In 1983 the Mexican government established the Upper Gulf of California Biosphere Reserve to protect them but it would seem that more stringent fishing laws must be implemented if the vaquita is to survive.

"(CNN) -- Brian Steel was taught from birth that he was ""handicapped."" Singled out in school by policies and his peers, he grew up feeling unfairly judged because of the way his body worked. Steel was diagnosed with congenital fiber-type disproportion when he was 4 months old. People with this rare condition, also called short fiber syndrome, typically experience muscle weakness, particularly in the shoulders, upper arms, hips and thighs, and may have breathing problems, according to the National Institutes of Health. The NIH estimates that about 25% of people born with the disorder die during early childhood. Tired of the way people made up their minds before getting to know him, Steel decided to photograph other people with disabilities and tell their stories. The result was a photo exhibit called ""Impaired Perceptions"" that premiered in Atlanta late last year. ""We filter everything that we see through the lens of our perceptions, so it is not until we are able to step outside of our perceptions that we are able to determine what is real and what is not,"" the 33-year-old wrote. ""The portraits are traditional, empowering and show each person's humanity."" CNN asked Steel about his exhibit, the misperceptions he faces and how we can do more to accept others. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: How does this condition affect your daily life? Steel: It has made me physically weak, so it makes a lot of tasks more difficult. I can't lift or carry anything much over 5 pounds. I have a hard time getting out of low chairs because of my weak leg muscles. My weakened chest muscles have caused me to have sleep apnea and make me susceptible to pneumonia. Physically, it may have made me weak, but in other ways, it has made me stronger. It has made me more creative because I have had to find alternative ways to accomplish the same tasks that would otherwise come (easily) to my able-bodied counterparts. I have had short fiber from birth, so I haven't known any other reality. To me, it is just life, and I am very grateful for my life. Opinion: I'm a person, not a condition . CNN: What ""impaired perceptions"" did you face as a child? As an adult? Steel: As a child, I mainly remember being seen as different. People would often stare. I remember in my elementary music class, the teacher made us sit on the end separate from the able-bodied children, and we were not allowed to touch any of the instruments. Once I became fully integrated into the regular classroom, things were a lot better. The great thing about being a kid is that you are mostly around other kids, and children are generally very open about what they think and ask questions when they don't understand. I would have classmates ask me why I appeared different to them, and I would tell them about my condition. After I explained my condition, it was settled. As an adult, things are much more under the surface. Where children are young and trying to get a sense of their world, adults tend to think that they already have things figured out. Most grown people will not come out and ask me about my condition, so in order to make sense of me they have to either watch and gather information through observation or use their own preconceived notions. What I usually encounter from adults (is) people asking me who takes care of me or talking to me as though I were mentally challenged. It isn't too unusual for someone to be surprised that I can drive a car. I live a completely independent life. To be fair, people also tell me that I inspire them simply by living my everyday life, and that is a good feeling. Schools must provide sports for students with disabilities . CNN: What gave you the inspiration for this photo project? Steel: ""Impaired Perceptions"" started from something that had been welling up inside of me. Throughout my life, I have experienced many encounters where people doubted my intelligence and abilities because of my appearance. I was approaching the completion of my graduate education and preparing to enter the professional world. My concerns and frustrations regarding how I often felt perceived by strangers suddenly became more important to me. I began by writing phrases on my body that represented the misperceptions that I felt from others and photographing myself. (But) I didn't want the project to just be about my story, because I wanted the message to have a bigger impact. As I began interviewing different people with various physical impairments and hearing their stories, I realized that some individuals seemed to have more confidence and hope than others. I then became just as concerned with empowering others as I am with trying to change people's perceptions. People form a lot of their identity from how they feel perceived by others, and others often form their opinions ... from what that person thinks of him or herself. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate negative perceptions of people with impairments is to empower them. Amazing success fueled by act of discrimination . CNN: What do you hope people take away from it? Steel: The overall message is that you cannot tell what a person is capable of or what their life is like simply by looking at them. That is true regardless of ability, race, religion or orientation. Some of the people I photographed and interviewed for this project appeared to be perfectly able-bodied but actually have impairments that limited them physically. They are misperceived in a manner that is almost opposite to my experience. They talked about how judged they often felt because people could not understand why they weren't doing certain things that required more physical effort. On the other hand, I met people who had experiences where people felt compelled to help them because they were in a wheelchair, but those individuals are fully capable and have accomplished more than a lot of their able-bodied peers. My point is not to say that one group is better than the other but rather that you simply can't know what someone is capable of without getting to know them. The other part of the message that I hope makes a big impact is that you shouldn't let anyone tell you what you are capable of. There are many different kinds of ability and strength. My prayer is that some people who may have given up and accepted a role that they did not choose will find hope and work towards a life that they want. CNN: What do you think we need to do as a society to better accept differences in others? Steel: The best way is simply to teach and encourage people to individualize. Simply learning about different conditions or religions is not enough to know all of the people that have those conditions and/or practice those religions. In my project, I included interviews along with the portraits so that the viewer could get a real sense of who they were. I recently curated ""Inside the Outsider,"" a photography exhibition for Mason Murer Fine Art. The theme was about how we have all felt like an outsider in some way, and in that way, we are all the same. I think if we took that to heart, we would realize that there isn't anything that we are going through that no one else is and that no one is as different from us as we may think that they are. We have to teach ourselves to suspend our initial judgments and get to know a person before we form our opinion of them. What makes it difficult is that out of self-defense, we instinctively attempt to categorize people and things to avoid possible dangers. I am not suggesting that we ignore our gut feelings entirely but rather that we suspend our final judgments until we have more information.Deaf woman's eBay complaint highlights dispute over Web access for disabled .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A diplomatic showdown between Italy and India is escalating, with Rome saying that an Indian court order forbidding the Italian ambassador from leaving the South Asian country breaches international law. The dispute centers on Italy's refusal to send back two of its marines who are due to face trial in India over accusations they killed two Indian fishermen off the country's coast last year. Last month, the Indian Supreme Court allowed the two Italian sailors -- Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone -- to go back to Italy to participate in national elections after Ambassador Daniele Mancini gave assurances they would return in four weeks. When the two sailors failed to come back last week, the court temporarily barred Mancini from leaving India and demanded an explanation from him. On Monday, the court extended the travel ban until April 2. And Chief Justice Altamas Kabir suggested that by making a pledge before the court, Mancini had no immunity in the case, according to CNN affiliate IBN. The Italian foreign ministry responded strongly to the court's actions. ""The decision by the Supreme Court to block our ambassador from leaving the country without the court's permission constitutes an evident violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which codifies universally recognized principals,"" the ministry said Monday. Article 31 of the convention states that a diplomat enjoys immunity from the criminal, civil and administrative jurisdictions of the receiving state, except in certain cases related to private property, succession and unofficial professional and commercial activities. India said last week that the court order restricting Mancini's movements didn't contravene the convention. Opposing views . Italy insists the February 2012 shooting involving its marines happened in international waters and was therefore outside of Indian jurisdiction. Latorre and Girone say they mistook the fishermen for pirates. Rome said last week that the two sailors wouldn't go back to India, calling the situation ""an international dispute between the two states."" In its statement Monday, the Italian foreign ministry said it believes the case of the two sailors should be resolved under international law. The case has fueled anger in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warning Rome of consequences. ""Our government has already made it clear that these actions of the government of Italy are not acceptable. They violate every rule of diplomatic discourse and call into question solemn commitments given by accredited representatives of a sovereign government to our supreme court,"" he said in parliament last week. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Rome says Indian actions breach the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago last September, on the occasion of John Paul II's first visit to the U.S., two young priests appeared on the cover of US News and World Report with the title emblazoned across their chests, ""The Pope's Foot Soldiers."" I was one of those priests. Twelve years later, I left the priesthood and the Augustinian order to begin a doctoral program in clinical psychology. Today, I've exchanged my Roman collar for a white collar job consulting leaders and executives in global organizations, helping them to meet the challenges they face in the trenches of corporate life. As the College of Cardinals gathers in Rome this month to elect a new leader, there's no shortage of talk about the church's current troubles. Some have suggested that the corporate world might provide the new pope with valuable advice on how to navigate the Church through rough and uncertain waters. But perhaps the most relevant contribution that corporations can offer the papal conclave is how to avoid the mistakes of the recent past in choosing a successor -- specifically, the potential pitfalls of moving a No. 2 senior leader into the No. 1 role. Throughout the papacy of John Paul II, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who is now the former Pope Benedict XVI) served effectively as a tough minded ""COO"" reviewing church operations globally, checking the orthodoxy of seminaries and ensuring that his boss' vision of realigning the church around a deeply conservative agenda was effectively executed. By most accounts, he performed this job reasonably well. His success in managing church operations enabled John Paul II to become the ""people's pope,"" traveling the world and conferring with heads of state. When John Paul died, many saw Cardinal Ratzinger as the perfect successor. He seemed to be familiar with the Church's challenges, was well known and generally well thought of by his peers and his doctrinal orthodoxy seemingly ensured a smooth and stable transition. That, at least, was the hope. How the pope is selected . In fact, very early on in his papacy it became evident that Benedict lacked the vitality required to lead a scandal ridden church. He also did not have the necessary distance from the church's mismanagement to be a credible voice for change. In our CEO succession work, we find that organizations often assume that the COO or even the CFO, by virtue of their knowledge of the business and their familiarity to the board, are best positioned to take on the top role. In making this judgment, they may not be including in their calculus some essential qualities that can make all of the difference between a smooth and successful transition and a short-lived, rocky tenure that leaves the organization drifting and directionless. Either way, there is no mistaking the critical importance of the leader at the helm. A case in point is Jeff Bezos of Amazon. A few years ago, Amazon was struggling with a business model that wasn't working and a clientele that was flocking to new websites and product lines. His leadership, vision and commitment to innovation has energized his company and brought new life to the brand. The Church is at the brink of its own transition at the top that could have an enormous impact on its future vitality and direction. It represents a moment filled with opportunity and fraught with challenge. In that light, here are some of the questions that the last conclave should have considered and must be on their agenda this time around: . • What kind of strategic thinking ability has this leader demonstrated that suggest he will be able to pull together and communicate a compelling and unifying vision for the Church's future? • Has this leader demonstrated an ability to effectively govern a large and complex bureaucracy? Is he a good judge of talent and willing to delegate critical management roles to the right people? • Is this leader an extraordinary communicator, willing and able to utilize the electronic and social media to reach out to people across cultures and generations? • Has this leader developed strong relationships outside of the Church with other leaders, both religious and secular, that can be leveraged to break down barriers and forge new and dynamic partnerships? • How courageous and forceful will this leader be to push for changes that will cultivate broader ownership and participation in decision making among all members? • Is this person seen as a leader of unfailing integrity who has not in the past and will not in the future succumb to the temptation to compromise core values? These are the kinds of questions that the current College of Cardinals will hopefully be considering as they gather in Rome this month. They're similar to questions many corporations, confronted with compelling challenges and a need for new direction,have faced as they sought to consider who should fill their top role. The papal conclave represents a great opportunity for the Church to demonstrate that it's learned some important lessons from the recent past. They can draw from the experiences of other global corporations around them to see that avoiding faulty assumptions and asking the right questions can prevent their having to schedule another conclave in the near future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Frawley.","Brian Frawley: Cardinals choosing new pope could learn from business world .

"(CNN) -- Nearly two-and-a-half years after losing the title, Tiger Woods reclaimed the world No. 1 golf ranking when winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational tournament on Monday. The defending champion knew that only victory at Bay Hill would enable him to topple Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy. With thunder storms having pushed the final round of play in Florida into Monday, the 37-year-old defended the three-shot lead he held at the start of the day to finish 13 under par -- two ahead of second-placed Justin Rose. Can winning really take care of everything in Tiger Woods' life? ""It has been a by-product of hard work, patience and getting back to winning golf tournaments,"" Woods said of regaining the coveted top spot. As he tapped into the eighteenth, Woods became only the second golfer in history to win eight PGA titles at the same event -- joining the legendary Sam Snead, who achieved his tally at the Greater Greensboro Open (now called the Wyndham Championship). ""I play well here -- and that's as simple as it gets,"" Woods replied when asked the secret of his success at Bay Hill. While Snead needed 27 years to mark up those victories, Woods took just 13 -- nearly half the time -- to achieve the feat, having also managed to win three other tournaments on seven different occasions. The American's form suggests he will be the man to beat at next month's Masters at Augusta, the first major of the year -- with many pundits awaiting his first major since 2008 to consider his comeback complete. ""That's up to them -- that's their opinion,"" said a relaxed Woods after his success. ""I am very pleased with the way I am playing -- and that's enough for me."" Opinion: For Tiger, winning does take care of everything . The title, on one of his favorite courses, formally caps his return to the summit of golf -- which he spectacularly fell off when reports of numerous marital infidelities emerged in late 2009, whereupon he took an indefinite break from the sport. The following August, his divorce from his Swedish wife of six years, former model Elin Nordegren, who is the mother of his two children, was finalized. In October 2010, six months after returning to golf with such poor form that he failed to win a single event in a season for the first time since turning professional, Woods lost his world best crown to Englishman Lee Westwood -- ending a record run of 281 consecutive weeks at the top (which started in June 2005). A combination of further poor form, added to injury, meant that a man who had once seemed invincible on the golf course dropped to a barely credible 58th place in November 2011. But 29 months after losing his crown, Woods is back on top for the eleventh time in his career -- capping a fine month for both his game and private life, with the golfer having announced his relationship to skier Lindsey Vonn last week. He will now start to add to the record 623 weeks he has spent on top of the golfing world, a tally which is nearly double that of his nearest rival, with Australian Greg Norman racking up 331 weeks, while no other player has broken the 100-week barrier. The 2013 season may be in its infancy but the 14-time major winner has started in irrepressible form, winning three of his five tournaments -- after triumphing at Doral earlier this month and at Torrey Pines in January. His 77th PGA Tour victory also marked his 99th professional tournament win as Woods, who has won the Masters on four occasions, prepares his bid to wear the famous green jacket for the first time since 2005.","Woods returns to No. 1 spot after two-and-a-half-year absence .

"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy has taken a tragic toll on the residents of the mid-Atlantic's barrier islands. All along the coast, hundreds of homes were lost, and thousands of people still have no power after Sandy wreaked havoc. The impact is not unlike many other destructive recent storms in the United States, such as Ivan, Katrina and Ike. So what can be done? In their natural state, the barrier islands that line about half of the U.S. coast, including most of the region affected by Sandy, are mobile and change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides and sea level. In fact, these islands owe their very existence to storms and the long-term rise in sea level of the past several thousand years. But much of today's coastline is a complex hybrid of a natural, dynamic landform overprinted with decades of immobile human development. Taking the dynamic nature of these barrier islands into account as we rebuild after major storms can help reduce the vulnerability of the local infrastructure to the inevitable next big storm. Beaches and dunes are the first line defense from ocean waves and storm surge, protecting the island's interior. When dunes erode and fail, much of the sand is carried up onto the island as overwash. While a failed dune in a coastal community makes it more exposed to the next storm, dune failure can make an undeveloped barrier island stronger by adding elevation to its core. This is how the barrier islands were built in the first place. During Superstorm Sandy, broad swaths of the coastline from North Carolina to Massachusetts experienced dune failure and massive overwash. The sand washed onto and across the barrier islands, filling roads, yards and living rooms. This overwash sand instantly added several feet of elevation to the islands. On a natural barrier island, this new elevation reduces the chance of inundation from the next storm. And as New Yorkers learned, a couple of feet can make all the difference between inconvenience and catastrophe. As the army of bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment deployed along the coast suggests, current efforts appear headed to restore the islands to their pre-storm state. Pushing the sand off the streets and back onto the beach removes the elevation that would have added freeboard above future floods. On a developed shore, this excavation of the roads is absolutely necessary to regain the dunes that are the first line of defense. But, everyone must understand that by resetting the island back to pre-storm conditions, the long-term risks are increased. Then there is the issue of rising seas. Sea level has risen 6 to 9 inches along the New Jersey coast since the last big storm in 1962 (the Ash Wednesday storm). Some residents say the 1962 storm barely reached their doorstep, while this time Superstorm Sandy flooded them by a foot. Although Sandy and the 1962 storm differ in their details, 50 years of sea-level rise certainly allowed water to reach areas that would not have been reached otherwise. What we know about storms, sea-level rise and barrier island response can be applied to redevelopment of the New Jersey coast. We can either try to thwart the natural response -- requiring increasing investment in construction and maintenance of storm protection structures -- or adapt by relocating farther away from the beachfront and upward as the barrier islands move. There is historical precedent for adaptation by moving. In New Jersey, some pre-WWII beachfront communities had moveable houses. In 1888, the Brighton Beach Hotel on Coney Island was moved several hundred feet back from the ocean by six steam locomotives. There are difficult choices to be made in our response to Superstorm Sandy. Doing nothing other than rebuilding is an easy choice and least expensive in the near-term, unless the next ""superstorm"" comes next year, or even this winter. Hundreds of miles of the East Coast where dunes were eroded or no longer exist are now more vulnerable than ever. Protecting the entire coast with coastal structures like sea walls is not feasible or even desirable; there are aspects of coastal armoring that have negative consequences. A practical response will be a blend of all the realistic options. This requires identifying which areas can adapt best, prioritizing which will receive the most protection and which will receive the least, or even none. This will be a challenging process. But, if undertaken jointly by citizens, policymakers and scientists, it could be a refreshing response and yield a coastal environment that is more resilient and economically and environmentally sound. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of E. Robert Thieler, Nathaniel G. Plant and Hilary F. Stockdon.","E.

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- An international donors conference on reconstruction and development in Darfur ended Monday with donors pledging nearly $3.7 billion toward ""recovery, reconstruction and development of Darfur during six years."" The bulk of the pledges come from a commitment made by the Sudanese government to contribute $2.65 billion. The state of Qatar announced that it pledged $500 million, and the European Union said it would commit $35 million. The United States, which currently is the biggest donor to Darfur through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), said it would not make any new financial commitment and expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in Darfur. The 40 countries participating in the conference overwhelmingly expressed support for the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur as a base for peace in Darfur. Violence broke out in Darfur, a region of Sudan, in 2003 when non-Arab rebel groups took up arms against the central government in Khartoum, accusing it of neglect and discrimination. In response, the government of Sudan unleashed a massive counterinsurgency using militias known as the janjaweed. The violence that followed has led to the deaths of 300,000 people, according to United Nations figures from 2008. The Sudanese government says that 10,000 have died. The International Criminal Court as a result indicted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide allegedly committed in Darfur. One rebel group, the Liberation and Justice Movement signed a peace agreement with the Sudanese government in 2011 known as the Doha Document for Peace, but progress on the deal has been slow. Three other rebel groups have refused to sign the document. On Sunday, a splinter group from the Justice and Equality Movement, the largest Darfurian rebel group, signed a ""final peace agreement"" with the Sudanese government.","Violence broke out in Darfur, a region of Sudan, in 2003 .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Novak Djokovic has set his sights on a first French Open title after beating second-ranked Rafael Nadal in a epic five-set Australian Open final on Sunday. The Melbourne final was the longest ever played in one of tennis' four grand slams, as Djokovic claimed his fifth major crown and third in Melbourne with a 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-7 7-5 win in five hours and 53 minutes. When asked if this was his greatest win, the Serbian -- who has beaten Nadal in the last three grand slam finals -- told reporters: ""Yes. Right now, yes. ""This one I think comes out on the top because we played almost six hours ... I think it's probably the longest finals in the history of all grand slams, and just to hear that fact is making me cry. Can anyone stop champion Djokovic? ""I'm very proud just to be part of this history, part of the elite of the players that have won this tournament several times. ""I was very flattered to be playing in front of Rod Laver, in front of the all-time greats, and in front of 15,000 people that stayed until 1:30 a.m."" Australian legend Laver is the last man to hold all four grand slam titles at one time, having achieved that feat for a second time in 1969. Djokovic can match that if he wins the French Open for the first time in June, though his quadruple slam would be in a non-calendar year. The 24-year-old hopes to improve his performance at Roland Garros, where last year he was beaten in the semifinals by 16-time major winner Roger Federer to end a 43-match winning run. ""I'm prioritizing grand slams this year, as every year, and the Olympic Games,"" the 24-year-old said. ""I think that's one of my highest goals. ""So I want to do well and I want to get the first final at least in Paris. I have never been in finals there, and I have a feeling that I'm ready this year to achieve that."" Djokovic has now won seven successive finals against Nadal, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, but he gave due credit to the 2009 Australian Open champion after their marathon match. ""Unfortunately there had to only be one winner because we both gave it all. We both put 100% of our abilities on the court and played to the last moment,"" he said. ""There couldn't be two winners, but he definitely deserved to be a winner as well. I would be saying same thing if I was sitting here as a loser."" After an intensive fortnight of competition, Djokovic said he planned to ban his friends from talking to him about tennis. ""Please, yes,"" he joked when asked he was going to take a break from the game. ""I'm going to definitely try to get that message to them.""","Novak Djokovic is focused on success at the French Open and Olympic Games in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- The two women shot and wounded by Los Angeles police during the manhunt for renegade ex-officer Christopher Dorner are ""not doing well,"" their attorney said Thursday at a news conference to announce a resolution to the loss of their bullet-riddled pickup truck. Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, Emma Hernandez, 71, will receive $40,000 to replace the truck, Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich said. Carranza and Hernandez were shot as police searched for Dorner, a former police officer who was wanted for killing several people in early February. Dorner manhunt: A car chase, a gunfight and a fiery cabin . The two women were in a truck similar to the one authorities said Dorner was driving. ""They're not doing well,"" attorney Glen Jonas said. ""Margie is still very emotionally impacted by what happened. Emma is suffering as far as her injuries are concerned."" Hernandez was shot twice in the back, and Carranza suffered injuries from broken glass, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Trutanich told reporters that now that the issues with the truck are settled, lawyers can turn their attention to the personal injury issues. The lawyers said they had to find a creative solution to get the women a new truck because of tax laws. Essentially the $40,000 is for the value of the truck, Jonas' fees, compensation for the time the women have gone without a truck and other matters. Jonas waived his fees, which would have amounted to about $25,000, he said. ""We wanted to get this issue resolved because it is draining a lot of energy,"" Jonas said. He would not comment on how much the women will seek in compensation for their physical injuries and emotional distress. Dorner died February 12 while holed up in a cabin that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it. Days before, he had killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades before apparently taking his own life in the cabin.

"(CNN) -- Throughout American history, the annual celebration of family and gratitude known as Thanksgiving has been a central part of The White House and the U.S. presidency. This week, President Barack Obama kept the tradition alive by pardoning Cobbler, the National Thanksgiving Turkey, in a Rose Garden ceremony. His feathered understudy, Gobbler, was also allowed to live, and both birds will live out the rest of their days on display at George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens in Virginia.

"Washington (CNN) -- As it nears the 10th anniversary of the terrible events that led to its creation, the Department of Homeland Security is getting a report card of sorts. And the grade, to few people's surprise: Incomplete. In a massive 221-page report, the Government Accountability Office -- the investigative arm of Congress -- says DHS has ""made significant strides in protecting the nation, but has yet to reach its full potential."" CNN obtained a draft of the report, which is to be the subject of a Senate hearing on Wednesday. The GAO report is largely a compilation of previous GAO reports, and gives no new recommendations. But for Homeland Security buffs, it is a virtual catalogue of the work that has been accomplished since the department was formed in 2003, and the work that remains to be done. The GAO said the department has addressed about half of the 1,500 recommendations it has made over the years, and is working on other recommendations, but has left some untouched. Formed from 22 different agencies, the Department of Homeland Security is now the third-largest department in the federal government. It has more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget that has grown from about $39 billion in fiscal year 2004 to about $55 billion this year. Readers of the report will find a wealth of information about the department's accomplishments, and of woeful lapses, all organized in 10 areas of responsibility, such as ""aviation security,"" ""border security,"" and ""emergency preparedness."" In a written response to the report, the DHS accentuated the positive. ""America is a stronger, safer and more resilient country because of the work DHS and its many partners do every day,"" wrote DHS's Jim Crumpacker. Crumpacker wrote the GAO report neglects to mention some DHS accomplishments, such as improvements to terror watch lists and implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which requires documents from border crossers. The following is a summary of key areas in the report: . Aviation Security . The report says DHS has enhanced aviation security by improving the pre-screening of passengers, checkpoint screening, baggage checking and airport security. The Transportation Security Administration currently has about 54,800 people, and a $7.7 billion annual budget. But the GAO said it is unclear whether full-body imagers would have detected the so-called ""underwear bomb,"" which failed to ignite on Christmas Day of 2009 when passengers intervened. DHS also has not validated the science behind behavior detection officers. And it does not yet have a way to ensure that air cargo screening is being conducted at reported levels. Border Security . The report says DHS has deployed more than 600 miles of infrastructure, such as fencing, along the border, and implemented a program to verify the identities of foreign visitors to the U.S. But DHS has not implemented a program to track when visitors exit the country, nor has it fully followed up on plans to improve Visa security. Maritime Security . The report says DHS improved port security by tightening access to ports, conducting advanced screening of foreign seafarers entering U.S. ports and developing a security credential for truckers and other entering ports. It also developed a strategy for cargo container security. But the GAO noted that during covert tests, investigators were able to enter ports using counterfeit credentials or authentic credentials obtained fraudulently. And the U.S. has trouble tracking smaller, noncommercial vessels, it says. Further, DHS has not yet developed a plan to fully implement a requirement that 100 percent of U.S.-bound container cargo be scanned by 2012. Immigration Enforcement . The report says DHS increased resources to investigate people who overstay their visas, and alien smuggling operations, and improved E-Verify, a computer tool that allows employers to verify a person's authorization to work in the United States. It also expanded efforts to remove criminal aliens in jails and prisons from the United States. But key weaknesses remain in DHS's efforts, the report says. While DHS field offices had closed about 34,700 overstay investigations during the past six years, the cases resulted in about 8,100 arrests, a small portion of the estimated overstay population of 4 million to 5.5 million.","Government Accountability Office report: DHS ""has yet to reach its full potential""

"(CNN) -- David Beckham is the highest-paid soccer player in the world, according to prestigious magazine France Football. The former England captain, who recently joined Paris Saint-Germain on a five-month contract, attracts more cash than four-time FIFA World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. Beckham, who spent five years with the Los Angeles Galaxy between 2007 and 2012, is set to earn $46.5 million (â‚¬36 million) during the 2012-13 football season through his salary, endorsements and other business ventures. The midfielder's entire PSG salary, which is estimated to make up 5% of his total earnings, will be donated to a Paris children's charity. Second on the magazine's rich list was Barcelona's Messi, who will reportedly make $45.2 million this season, with $17 million coming from salary and bonuses. The Argentine has been in prolific form this season, scoring 42 goals in 28 Spanish First Division matches. The 25-year-old recently signed a new contract with Barca which will keep him in Catalunya until June 2018. Real's Ronaldo has so often trailed narrowly behind Messi on the pitch, and so it is the financial stakes. The forward is set to pocket $39 million, although his salary and bonuses are slightly higher than Messi's at $17.5 million. Ronaldo's coach and compatriot Jose Mourinho is the highest paid team boss on the planet, according to the list. The former Inter Milan and Chelsea coach will take home $18 million over the course of this season. Carlo Ancelotti, Beckham's coach at PSG, is set to earn $15.5 million, while his fellow Italian Marcello Lippi was given $14 million to lead Guangzhou Evergrande to the Chinese Super League title.

"(CNN) -- Four-time champions Barcelona will come up against rising power Paris Saint-German in the quarterfinals of the European Champions League. The draw for the last eight of Europe's premier club competition took place in Nyon, Switzerland on Friday, with Barca's match-up with Qatari-owned PSG the pick of the ties. The two teams met in the quarterfinals of the competition in 1995, with the French team progressing thanks to a 3-2 aggregate win.

"(CNN) -- It was Muhammad Ali who warned his opponents he would ""float like a butterfly and sting like a bee"". Now, perhaps Borussia Dortmund can claim similar after crushing Real Madrid 4-1 in the first leg of its Champions League semifinal Wednesday. Decked out in black and yellow, it swarmed around Real from the start with a buzz and infectious enthusiasm to be marveled at -- but it was left to one man to administer the fatal sting. Robert Lewandowski, the Poland striker, was already one of the most feared forwards in European football before his took the field. He left with his reputation enhanced four-fold, his asking price at an all-time high and his team within touching distance of next month's Champions League final. His four goals lit up an extraordinary encounter in which Dortmund went from young pretenders to serious contenders. Barring the prospect of miracles at Camp Nou and the Bernabeu next week, Dortmund will contest the first ever all-German Champions League final against Bayern Munich at Wembley on May 25. ""It was an unbelievable,"" Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp told Sky Sports. ""It was a great game by my team. It was so difficult today because they are so strong and fast and they are so brilliant on the counterattack. ""The first 25 minutes were great and then we lost a bit of our game. Not so much but enough to let them come up. ""They got (level) and at the break we told the players: 'Maybe you think there was a wrong decision by the referee but in the last game we had a wrong decision from the referee and we had the winner. Go back to the strong first 25 minutes'."" CNN Football Club: What would you ask Brad Friedel? Forget that Real, the nine-time winners and richest club in the world, was expected to qualify for the final. Forget that Real, boasting the mercurial talent of Cristiano Ronaldo, failed to produce their normal level of performance. Instead, focus on one of the most exciting and vibrant sides to have emerged in European competition for many a year. The fresh faced innocence, the youthful zest, the unbounded energy, all these traits have helped shape a Dortmund side, which is quickly winning the hearts of football fans across the globe. German football is enjoying a stellar spell in the spotlight with fan ownership, cheap tickets, high attendances and huge television audiences making the Bundesliga one of the most popular leagues in the world. If Bayern's 4-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday night was supposedly the beginning of a power shift from Spain to Germany, then Dortmund's dominance confirmed it. Everywhere you looked on the field, Dortmund was in control. Lewandowski led the line, a lone warrior refusing to be tamed by a Real defense appearing more and more desperate as the night progressed. The prodigiously talented Ilkay Gundogan, who shielded his defense with an authority and maturity way beyond his 22 years, ran the midfield. Mario Goetze, playing just over 24 hours since his $48 million move to Bayern had been confirmed, showed just why incoming manager Pep Guardiola was so keen to lure the gifted playmaker to the Allianz Arena. Alongside the fleet footed Marco Reus, the pair tore into a Real side which looked anemic inside the red hot atmosphere of the Westfalenstadion. Real would have expected Dortmund to start at breakneck speed, but even it was taken aback by the pace, power and ferocity of the German side. Just seven minutes had elapsed when the wonderfully talented Reus danced his way through the Real defense, before unleashing a rasping effort which was parried away by Diego Lopez. That was a warning of what was to follow and less than 60 seconds later the home side forged ahead when Goetze produced a sublime cross from the left for Lewandowski to poke home. The buzz and energy with which Dortmund played appeared to overwhelm the Spanish champion, which was swept away with consummate ease. But while Dortmund dominated, it was unable to add to its advantage and was made to pay as Real struck back with just two minutes of the half remaining. With the home players still appealing for a penalty for what they considered to be a foul on Reus, the visiting team took advantage in devastating fashion. A long ball was misjudged by Mats Hummels and Gonzalo Higuain ran clear to square for Cristiano Ronaldo to roll the ball home. Ronaldo's strike, his sixth in six consecutive Champions League games, appeared to have left Dortmund in a daze. But whatever Klopp said to his side at the break worked a treat as they produced one of the most enthralling second half displays in recent times. It was Lewandowski who led the charge, firing home his second within five minutes of the restart after taking Reus' deflected effort in his path. His third followed soon after, and when it came, it was worth waiting for. Marcel Schmelzer's cross-cum-shot found the forward inside the penalty area and the striker produced an exquisite turn before sending an unstoppable effort into the roof of the net. Dortmund were rampant and the hugely impressive Gundogan almost added a fourth when his fierce effort was brilliantly tipped away by Lopez in the Real goal. That fourth goal was not far away, however, and when Xavi Alonso fouled Reus inside the penalty area, Lewandowski stood up to power home from 12-yards. Not since the legendary Hungarian striker Ferenc Puskas in 1960 had anybody scored four times in a European Cup semfinal or final. That tally could have been greater but Lopez produced another stunning save to push the Pole's fierce effort over the crossbar. Real did rally late on with Ronaldo and Raphael Varane both going close, but Jose Mourinho's men must now hope for an incredible turnaround next Tuesday. Only once has a team emerged victorious after conceding a three goal deficit in a Champions League knockout stage. On that occasion, Deportivo La Coruna came back from a 4-1 defeat at AC Milan to win 5-4 on aggregate courtesy of a 4-0 home win. ""I think Dortmund were the best team by far,"" Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""They won every individual battle on the pitch, they were stronger physically and mentally so I think they deserve it. How did it go from 1-1 to 4-1? I don't know. ""Everything happened in a short space of time. We lost easy possession and we couldn't cope with their counter attack and their transition. ""We know everything about Robert Lewandowski, every detail possible and we lost him in three goals. It's very disappointing. ""When we lose and we don't deserve to lose, with me, it's a drama, when I do deserve to lose I accept it. Of course the boy deserves credit for what he did but we gave him every support for man of the match."" A 3-0 win would take Real through to the final and keep alive its hopes of winning ""La Decima"" -- the club's tenth trophy in the competition. But the task looks nearly impossible following its abject showing in Dortmund. ""It will be very difficult in the return leg at home but we must remain confident and try to react,"" Real captain Sergio Ramos told reporters. ""When the draw for the semifinals was made a lot of people thought this was going to be easy for us, but this is a German team we are talking about. They are a great side.""","Borussia Dortmund crush Real Madrid 4-1 in first leg of Champions League semifinal .

"(CNN) -- Only 10% of drugs cheats are being caught at the Olympics. former anti-doping chief Dick Pound told CNN on Wednesday. The London Olympics have been dominated so far by the displays of 16-year-old Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen, whose world record time in the 400 meter individual medley prompted questions about her performances. John Leonard, executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association described Ye's performances as ""disturbing"" but the young swimmer dismissed the allegations and Olympic officials insist that she is clean until proven otherwise. ""My results come from hard work and training and I would never use any banned drugs,"" she said. Pound, who retired from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 2008, said ""anecdotally, maybe 10% of athletes use drugs and we're catching one or two of them."" He warned that the issue of drug cheating was ""getting dumbed down"" as sports organizations become ""more worried about corruption."" ""People who have prepared in advance and used drugs coming here (to London) won't get caught,"" said Pound. ""If you get caught you fail two tests, a drugs test and an IQ test."" Dick Pound, also a former vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), warned that testers are always playing catch up with the cheaters. ""You'd be pretty ambitious to say London 2012 was a clean Games. There are drugs we don't know about yet so we need to keep finding them and hunting down the distribution networks,"" he said. ""We know what's going on, but if you're going to do disqualify someone you have to have evidence. We're going to need more resources and more commitment from the sports organizations."" ""Basically, they say it is too complicated, too expensive and they're more worried about corruption. It is getting dumbed down."" The IOC announced on Wednesday evening that Uzbek athlete Luiza Galiulina has been excluded from the Games after testing positive for furosemide. Furosemide is commonly used to stop racehorses suffering nosebleeds, but is banned by WADA because it can be used to mask other drugs. Galiulina wa provisionally suspended after failing pre-games testing on the 25h July. The 20-year-old's 'B' sample has confirmed the positive result, so the IOC have now expelled the gymnast from the Games. Galiulina is the second athlete to fail a drugs test at the games after Albanian weightlifter Hysen Pulaku tested positive for the steroid stanozlol, also in pre-games testing.","Former WADA chief Dick Pound claims only 10% of drug cheaters are being caught .

"Washington (CNN) -- Twelve persons were arrested Friday during an ""Occupy"" demonstration at the U.S. Supreme Court in which protesters were dressed like justices and sang songs of the Motown group The Supremes, officials said. One person was arrested in the building and the other 11 were apprehended on the courthouse steps and plaza, court officials said. The ""Occupy"" movement turned its focus on the nation's highest court as more than 200 people gathered around the building. The event was timed with the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which removed many limits to corporate spending in federal political campaigns, organizers said. The 2010 ruling made it legal for groups to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money for a candidate, as long as the group does not coordinate with the candidate or contributed directly to his or her campaign. It allowed for the rise of Super PACs, which can raise unlimited funds from corporations. Protests were also expected at federal courthouses in dozens of cities across the country, from Akron, Ohio, to Gainesville, Florida, to Honolulu, Hawaii. The one-day event, dubbed ""Occupy the Courts,"" was organized by the grassroots group called Move to Amend and was inspired by the Occupy Wall Street participants, organizers said. ""Move to Amend volunteers across the USA will lead the charge on the judiciary which created -- and continues to expand -- corporate personhood rights,"" the Occupy the Courts website states. The Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against what protesters consider the unequal distribution of wealth. CNN's Bill Mears, Stacey Samuel and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: One person is arrested inside courthouse and 11 others outside .

"(CNN) -- Two people have been detained in the death of a 43-year-old Montana schoolteacher last seen six days ago while out on a morning jog, law enforcement agencies said Friday. Sidney Public Schools, for which Sherry Arnold had worked as a math teacher at Sidney High School, announced that the school district learned of her death around 9:30 a.m. Friday. No other details were immediately available. Law enforcement officers have taken ""one adult male into custody, and another adult male is being questioned"" in relation to Arnold's case, the FBI said Friday in a statement. ""The investigation to determine what happened to Ms. Arnold continues,"" the federal agency said. Sidney Police Chief Frank DiFonzo told reporters later Friday that law enforcement officers in North Dakota -- including members of the Williams County Sheriff's Office, Williston police and the North Dakota Criminal Investigation Bureau -- helped arrest the first man, who is 47 years old. That man is now being being held in a Williams County, North Dakota, jail. The second male, age 22, has been ""detained for questioning"" in Rapid City, South Dakota, added DiFonzo. The police chief declined to offer further details or answer questions ""because this investigation is rapidly moving forward."" Arnold went running around 6:30 a.m. last Saturday in her small town in eastern Montana, but never returned home. Other than one of her running shoes found along her route, authorities had not indicated -- until Friday -- that there had been any sign of her. The woman's disappearance rocked Sidney, located about 100 miles south of the Canadian border. It has a population of just under 5,200 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A massive search effort involved hundreds of volunteers, as well as law enforcement authorities and National Guard members. Authorities on Wednesday ""determined the prudent course of action is to scale back the ground search."" ""We're such a small community, and crime is absolutely unheard of,"" said Christine Mullen, 26, a CNN iReport contributor who joined the search effort, even though she didn't know Arnold personally. ""We don't lock our car doors. (We're) completely shocked."" The FBI said Friday that ""dozens of tips were called into (a) tip line"" -- one of which led to the arrest and questioning. Sidney Public Schools said that all sporting events for Friday had been canceled and ""additional counselors (were) on hand"" to help students cope. In interviews with HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell earlier this week, the victim's husband, Gary Arnold, said he was hopeful even as he admitted that the disappearance has been ""very difficult"" on the couple's children. He said that he couldn't fathom why anyone ""would harm her in any way."" ""She is a good person. She's kind, she's sincere,"" Arnold said of his wife.

"New York City (CNN)  -- Who am I? I am an American from the soles of my feet to the hair that once adorned my bald head. An American whose black-skinned ancestors were stolen from their lives and cultures and piled in the holds of ships like so many sacks of skin. An American whose Jewish ancestors stowed their lives into the holds of later vessels running from a thousand years of anti-Semitism that was soon to blossom into a Holocaust. An American whose ancestors walked across the frozen waters from Asia to North America discovering a new world that would one day be stolen from their descendants. An English-speaking American whose language is also whispering French from my Louisiana relatives and sublime Spanish from the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans I rubbed shoulders with growing up in Southern California. A man whose music is the blues that became rock and roll and hip-hop, jazz that is the bastard and the heir of the unconsecrated coupling between Africa and Europe. Who am I? I am a man formed by history but oddly lacking in a clear perspective of the past. A man with so much to me that there is no clear identity to grab onto or claim. I might be related to Thomas Jefferson or any of 10,000 masters who raped and sometimes even loved their slaves. Who am I? I am the target of ad men and pollsters, census takers and the evening news. To some I am the enemy, both inside this nation and internationally. To some I am a brother. I can be at the same time invisible and yet profiled, counted and yet forgotten, imprisoned by circumstance and yet declared free by one of the great documents of political history. I am prejudged for my skin color, gender, age, education, and even for some things that I've done wrong. I am a minor shareholder in the great corporation of America and therefore responsible for everything good and bad that we've done in the name of business, things we did before I was born and events that shall occur after I'm gone. I am the amalgamation of all the ignorance, ambitions, yearnings for freedom, and religions of the world. I am -- have been -- brainwashed so many times that innocence is second nature to me. Contradictorily, America is what I am but not my history, not my identity. I am a new man almost every day. I and mine were once colored, Negro, black, Afro-American, African-American, brother, sister, Uncle Tom, revolutionary, good one, bad one, convict, malingerer, miracle, and so much more. In the end I can say with conviction that I am America. Through my veins run 10,000 years of history that touches every continent, deity, and crime known to humanity. This history is not composed of the false accounts of the past; it is the blood and the beat and the light that passes through my mind, and yours. I am your sibling whether you know it or not, whether you accept me or not. We, known and unknown to each other, form an identity that I can express but still not know, not completely.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A spate of suicides at France Telecom has put the spotlight on workplace stress and the devastating impact it can have on employees. France Telecom employees protest against work conditions following a colleague's suicide. There have been 24 suicides and 13 attempted suicides among France Telecom's 100,000 employees since the beginning of 2008. Labor unions blame restructuring and poor working conditions for creating a climate of stress. Last week a 51-year old father of two jumped to his death from a bridge. He was reported to have left a letter blaming his death on the ""atmosphere"" at work, according to media reports. The deputy chief executive of France Telecom Monday resigned in the wake of the staff suicides. Louis-Pierre Wenes said in a message to staff: ""Despite the hard edge of the technological and economic fight, especially in our business, nothing can justify men and women putting an end to their lives. Today, like before, I cannot accept it."" Patricia Pegg Jones is health and well-being program leader at the Work Foundation. She told CNN that the economic downturn has increased pressures on employees. ""In the current recession people have less control; there's more uncertainty and a lack of security,"" she said. She told CNN there is evidence that workers are more likely to suffer from stress in the recession and also a higher incidence of ""presenteeism"" -- when employees go to work despite being unwell. Pegg Jones says that a lack of workplace autonomy can also impact employees' health, with research showing that workers who have less control over their work are more likely to be ill. She said employers can help workers in times of uncertainty by being open and communicating effectively with them, explaining what changes are in store. ""Employers have to recognize that people take changes differently; some people can deal with the uncertainty and other people undergo a paralysis,"" she told CNN. ""It's important to recognize that workers don't all respond the same way to restructuring and the impact of recession."" Stress is one workplace hazard that can be detrimental to employees' health, but working too hard can be just as dangerous. In Japan, deaths among overworked employees are so common there is even a word to describe the phenomenon -- ""karoshi,"" or ""death from overwork."" Toshiro Ueyanagi is a lawyer specializing in cases of ""karoshi."" He told CNN that most deaths related to overwork are from heart attacks and strokes, and that overwork can also result in mental illness. Ueyanagi says it can be hard to prove that a death is the result of overwork and while the Japanese government recognized 377 cases of ""karoshi"" last year, he believes the number could be closer to 10,000. ""I think there are two reasons why ""karoshi"" is prevalent in Japan -- a hard-working tradition and very weak laws and regulation in the workplace,"" he told CNN. Ueyanagi says the word ""karoshi"" came into common use around 1990, when Japanese workers began working longer hours in response to competition from overseas and in response to the recession at the time. He adds that despite increased awareness of the dangers of overwork, de-regulation and increased global competition mean that Japanese workers are working harder than ever. ""Some workers have lost their jobs and workers who remain in the workplace have to work harder than before,"" he told CNN. In July 2008 a Japanese labor bureau ruled that a Toyota employee died from heart disease caused by overwork. His wife's lawyers said that in the two months leading up to his death he averaged over 80 hours of overtime per month. Ueyanagi says that in recent years there have been cases of ""karoshi"" among Japanese women, especially those working as schoolteachers and middle managers. As well as representing victims' families in ""karoshi"" cases, Ueyanagi has established a ""karoshi"" hotline, which receives between 400 and 500 calls each year from families seeking compensation and people asking how to prevent ""karoshi"" or deal with stress. But there are personal reasons behind Ueyanagi's crusade against ""karoshi."" ""I think my father died from cancer because he was too busy to see a doctor,"" he told CNN. ""It's one reason why I take this phenomenon seriously.""","24 suicides among France Telecom employees since the beginning of 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Mauritania's president was admitted to a French military hospital for treatment Sunday, hours after he took to his country's airwaves to say troops had shot him by accident. Doctors will treat President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz at a military hospital outside Paris, France's Defense Ministry said. ""I want to reassure all citizens of my well-being after the accident committed by an army unit on an unpaved road around Touela. ... Everything is fine,"" Aziz said in an interview broadcast on official Mauritanian television earlier Sunday. Troops shot the president late Saturday in what the government is calling a case of ""friendly fire"" -- though others believe it may have been something more sinister. Aziz's convoy mistakenly came under fire as it was heading back toward the capital of Nouakchott, the official AMI news agency reported. The gunshots came from a military unit stationed alongside the road in the west African country. French officials did not provide details about the president's treatment or prognosis. Mauritania: Slavery's last stronghold . Aziz said earlier Sunday that he had a successful operation to treat minor injuries. But witnesses said they believe the incident was an assassination attempt, because unknown armed men shot their guns at the president and ran away, according to the independent Mauritania News agency. The witnesses said the armed men ""directly"" targeted the president as he was returning from his farm in Inchiri province, near the capital, Mauritania News reported. Mauritania has a history of political instability and faces threats from al Qaeda militants. A former general, Aziz came to power in a bloodless 2008 military coup -- one of many such coups the country of about 3.4 million people has had since it gained independence from France in 1960. He ousted Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who had been the nation's first democratically elected leader, according to the U.S. State Department. Aziz was elected president in 2009. Still, the CIA describes the country's leadership as a ""military junta."" Security in Mauritania has been ratcheted up in recent weeks amid concerns about ""armed terrorist groups"" in nearby northern Mali, according to Magharebia, a website sponsored by the U.S. Africa Command -- a part of the U.S. military focused on the continent. The measures include a bolstered security presence on main streets, near embassies and by government buildings in Nouakchott, as well as stepped-up patrols, Magharebia said. No official reason has been given for the enhanced security, according to the report. But the publication, quoting terrorism experts and local news reports, said it may be related to threats posed by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In May, the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning for Mauritania because of AQIM activities.

"(CNN) -- An angry passenger used his mother's old Air France employee documents to con his way into the cockpit of a US Airways flight last week, according to the criminal complaint filed against him Monday in U.S District Court in Philadelphia. Philippe Jeannard, 61, had become disruptive Wednesday after being told that the airline could not accommodate his request to move up to business class during a stopover in Philadelphia, Brian L. Jones, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, described Jeannard in an affidavit as difficult and verbally abusive to a flight attendant and gate supervisor. Jeannard was wearing a white button-down shirt with an Air France logo over the pocket and a black jacket with four gold stripes on the epaulets, similar to one worn by pilots, the complaint said. He identified himself to the gate supervisor as an Air France pilot. As a courtesy, a flight attendant asked Jeannard if he would like to speak with the pilots, according to the complaint. Jeannard entered the cockpit, where two pilots were performing preflight duties, and told the pilots he was an Air France Boeing 747 pilot, it says. ""He identified himself as a pilot and started to sit in the jump seat. But he immediately had a problem getting strapped in and it was obvious to the real pilots that he couldn't be a pilot,"" Philadelphia Inspector Joseph Sullivan told CNN last week. ""He didn't know what he was doing."" The gate agent told Jeannard he would have to fill out paperwork to use the jump seat, but the man didn't have credentials, police said. The captain then told him to leave the cockpit area, and Jeannard became irate, police said. Jeannard was taken off the aircraft. He appeared to have had some drinks, but there's no indication he was drunk, Sullivan said. The flight departed, and a US Airways agent tried to book him on another flight to West Palm Beach, Florida, his final destination. According to the criminal complaint, after returning to the gate Jeannard covered his Air France shirt with a sweater and acknowledged to a US Airways manager that he was not an Air France employee. Jeannard was taken to the Philadelphia Police Department's airport holding cell and arrested on charges of trespassing, tampering with records, false impersonating and false identification to law enforcement authorities. Police discovered documents appearing to be Air France checklists and flight plans in Jeannard's briefcase, according to Jones' complaint. It said Jeannard admitted to having falsified his mother's Air France identification card, which the airline said was real. Jones said Jeannard had replaced his mother's information with his own name and photograph; it identified him as an Airbus A380 crew member. Air France spokesman Cedric Leurquin described it as a bad fake of an Air France crew badge. Jeannard, who is from La Rochelle, France, is a retired winemaker who was changing planes on his way from France to Florida, police inspector Sullivan said. Jeannard at one point remarked that he ""hated Americans,"" police said, but investigators have not found any link to terrorism, a federal law enforcement official said. US Airways declined to comment. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Michael Martinez and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","Passenger used mom's Air France ID to bluff way to front of plane, FBI investigator says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. authorities have issued a warning to U.S. citizens in Myanmar amid unrest between Buddhists and Muslims that has left at least 40 people dead in the past week. The violence that began last week in the city of Meiktila, in the central Mandalay region, has spread to other towns and fueled fears in the commercial capital, Yangon, that prompted stores to close in a popular shopping district Monday. The U.S. Embassy has responded to the violence and unease by warning U.S. citizens to avoid the Mingalar Market and Yuzana Plaza part of Yangon, the same area where the stores were shuttered Monday. ""A fight broke out in that area today as a result of ongoing tensions, resulting in a heavy police presence,"" the embassy said in a statement Monday. It said, though, that there were ""no known specific threats against U.S. citizens."" Authorities clearing up the wreckage from last week's riots in Meiktila have found eight bodies among the debris, increasing the number of dead from the previous total of 32, the New Light of Myanmar, a state-run newspaper, reported in its Tuesday edition. During the clashes in Meiktila, which were reportedly set off by a dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers, rioters set fire to houses, schools and mosques, prompting thousands of residents to flee their homes. A state of emergency . The government declared a state of emergency in the city Friday, allowing the military to help reinstate order. But as the situation there appeared to calm, authorities reported arson attacks by groups of Buddhists in other towns in the region over the weekend. The unrest highlights the fragility of ethnic relations in Myanmar as it emerges from decades of military repression. Authorities have released thousands of political prisoners and pursued peace talks with rebel groups in the past two years. President Thein Sein, who has overseen the country's initial moves toward democracy, vowed Monday ""to take action against those who led the violence and got involved in it and to expose those who flamed the conflict under the pretext of religion,"" the New Light of Myanmar reported. Thousands displaced . The U.N. humanitarian agency said Monday that the Myanmar government estimates that more than 12,000 people have been displaced by the unrest. ""They're barricaded in schools and in a monastery,"" said Ashok Nigam, the U.N. resident coordinator in Myanmar. ""They're currently receiving humanitarian assistance provided by the government."" A Buddhist monk was reported to be among those killed when the violence initially erupted in Meiktila last week. But Win Htein, an opposition lawmaker for the area, has said that he believes the majority of the victims were Muslims. ""Most of the Muslims' houses were destroyed and burnt down,"" he said Tuesday. ""Very few are left."" Police confiscated weapons such as swords and machetes from groups of Buddhists -- some of them monks -- who were roaming the streets last week, officials said. Win Htein said Tuesday that the situation was improving in Meiktila, but that he was concerned that some young Buddhists were ""organizing their own security"" despite government warnings not to carry weapons. Meanwhile, unsubstantiated rumors of unrest in other parts of the country such as Yangon are spreading via text messages and social media, stoking fears among residents. In one example, Si Thu, a Buddhist employee of the United Nations who lives in a mainly Muslim neighborhood of Yangon, said Tuesday he was moving his family to stay at a relative's home elsewhere in the city. ""I can't think of any political or religious aspects now,"" he said. ""I only know about how to protect my family."" The New Light of Myanmar suggested that such rumors are being ""circulated by those with ill will who want to harm peace and stability."" Concerns after previous unrest . The clashes in Meiktila and elsewhere have drawn expressions of concern from U.N. and U.S. officials. The sudden boiling over of tensions between Buddhists and Muslims in central Myanmar follows sectarian troubles that killed scores of people in the west of the country last year. Those clashes, in Rakhine state, took place between the Buddhist majority and the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic Muslim group. Most of the victims in that unrest were Rohingya. Tens of thousands more were left living in makeshift camps, and many of them have since joined those who attempt each year to flee to Thailand and Malaysia in flimsy boats.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan's robust economic recovery this year could put an end to a deflationary spiral that has sapped growth for some 14 years, says the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In its annual economic outlook, the OECD projects Japanese consumer prices will begin rising modestly by the end of this year, with the inflation rate reaching 2.4% by the end of 2014. ""Aggressive monetary easing could see deflation give way to moderately positive underlying inflation in Japan,"" the report said. In recession as recently as last year, Japan's economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5% in the first three months of 2013, much quicker than the 2.7% expected by analysts. The brighter economic outlook stems largely from reform efforts launched by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- a set of policies dubbed ""Abenomics."" As part of a three-pillar strategy announced in January, Japan has ramped up government spending and the country's central bank is injecting money into the economy on a massive scale. It hopes to bring the inflation rate to 2% and put to an end to a downward drift in consumer prices that has persisted for 14 years, undermining business and consumer confidence in the world's third largest economy. The moves have led to a rally in the Nikkei stock index and a slide in the yen that has made corporate Japan more competitive overseas. Also promised are structural reforms such as increasing the participation of women in the workforce. ""Reflecting a determined policy approach, the economic outlook has changed markedly in Japan in recent months,"" the report said. However, the OECD warned that Japan's economic recovery was ""surrounded by uncertainty"" given the country's high debt levels, which amount to more than 200% of gross domestic product (GDP). ""In Japan, the key risk is that the unsustainable fiscal position will eventually affect financial markets and provoke a crisis of confidence,"" the report said. ""Bringing the debt ratio back to safe levels from its current highs will be exceptionally challenging.""","OECD says consumer prices in Japan will begin rising later this year .

"(CNN) -- She added smart to sexy as a Bond girl opposite Pierce Brosnan's 007, and proved her dramatic and action credentials in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"" but for actress Michelle Yeoh, life and acting are both all about balance. Michelle Yeoh: ""There are reasons why you do movies. It's for the love of it."" ""I think it's very boring for my audience, just to see me in the regular roles. I love my action films. And I think right now, I have a nice balance,"" she told CNN's Talk Asia. Poise and balance are something that Yeoh is naturally blessed with. Her childhood dream of becoming a professional ballerina was dashed when she sustained an injury while training at the Royal Academy of Dance in London. However, she continued to study completing a degree in dance and a minor in drama, before serving as Miss Malaysia at the age of 21, which was more of an ambassadorial role for the country's tourism industry than bikini modeling. Making her film debut in an action movie in 1984, she made further appearances in Hong Kong action films doing her own stunts, until she married millionaire Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon in 1988 and put her career on hold. On giving up acting for the sake of her married life she said: ""At that time, it's very difficult to try and juggle a normal life, be where your husband is, try to start a family life, and filming months on end in another country. So I weighed my options. I am a person that believes, you have to give your all. There's no half measure in doing things. You do it well or at least you've got to give it your best shot."" The couple divorced three years later and Yeoh resumed her film career in 1992 in the Jackie Chan smash-hit ""Police Story 3."" While she continued to use her athleticism in her roles and do her own stunts, in the pursuit of playing good characters and that all-important balance, she credits the directors she has chosen to work with. ""I look at the scripts and you can understand where the story is going ... but it's a director with a vision that brings it to life,"" she said. ""There are reasons why you do movies. It's for the love of it or you're thinking of your paycheck. And you have to find your own balance."" When it came to doing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" Ang Lee was the essential ingredient. ""I did it really because I adore Ang Lee. That's a true film maker, where they move you, they bring you to places where you can't imagine but want to be."" But being an all-or-nothing person has taken its toll when it has come to the stunts she has performed. Yeoh tore her anterior cruciate ligament after the first sequence she performed for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which meant that only the dramatic scenes in the film could be shot until she had recovered. Yeoh has turned her attention to producing as well as acting and found it a challenging experience. ""As an actor you would be judged on how your performance is and so that's where your focus is. It's a very selfish environment and that sense, because as you know, you can't make excuses afterwards. But as a producer, you have to make sure everyone is well protected and everyone is safe. And if anything goes wrong, it's all on your shoulders,"" she told CNN. The films she produced, 2002's ""The Touch"" and ""Sliver Hawk"" from 2004 were panned by critics, but she makes no excuses: ""That's the nature of the business. You should never take these things personally when it works or doesn't work."" And when it comes to passing on what she's learned to young Asian actors, her advice is typically practical. ""For any Asian face, or any Asian girls that have dreams, aspirations or doing crossover work in Hollywood, you must have the language. These are your tools. And then afterwards, the right face, the right demeanor, and the right chemistry.""","Trained dancer turned to acting after injury at college .

"(CNN) -- World No.1 Novak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in the longest final in grand slam history to retain the Australian Open title in Melbourne. Djokovic has now won four out of the last five grand slams, beating Nadal in three successive finals, to underline his domination of men's tennis, but it took him seven minutes short of six hours to see off the Spaniard in an epic final. After hitting the winning shot for a 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-7 7-5 victory, Djokovic lay on his back in triumph before ripping off his shirt, pumping his chest in triumph as he walked to the players' box to embrace his coach. The match ended at 1.40 a.m. local time Monday and was 59 minutes longer than the previous record, the 1988 U.S. Open final between Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl. Can anyone stop champion Djokovic? It also broke the record for the longest match at the Australian Open, the five hours 14 minutes set by Nadal and Fernando Verdasco in 2009. ""Rafa, you're one of the best players ever,"" Djokovic said at the trophy presentation. ""We made history tonight, and unfortunately there couldn't be two winners. But I wish you all the best for this season and I hope that we will have many more matches like this and many more finals."" World No. 2 Nadal told the crowd: ""I will never forget this match. Even though I lost, it was something really special for me."" The Serbian was also involved in a near five-hour long battle to beat Britain's Andy Murray in the semifinals and when he fell behind after an opening set lasting 80 minutes, all the omens pointed to a Nadal victory. But the 24-year-old from Belgrade was not to be denied even after a stirring recovery which saw his opponent take the fourth set on a tiebreak to force a decider on the Rod Laver Arena at Melbourne Park. It was a bitter disappointment for Nadal who, having beaten arch-rival Roger Federer in Thursday's semifinal, was bidding for his 11th grand slam title. He had only lost once after winning the first set of a grand slam match since 2007, but in the end he succumbed to Djokovic's sheer persistence. Two breaks of service to one saw the Mallorcan claim the opener, but Djokovic broke in the fourth game of the second set to recover his composure. However, serving to level the match, Djokovic played a sloppy game and Nadal closed to 5-4. But Nadal showed his first sign of fallibility in the next game as he fell behind and facing set point contrived to double fault. With the impetus now in his favor, Djokovic dominated the third set, running Nadal from side to side and taking it 6-2 with two breaks of service. Djokovic forced three break points on Nadal's service, leading 4-3 in the fourth, but the World No.2 showed his famous fighting qualities by retrieving them and holding for 4-4. As the game was completed, a heavy rain shower caused a break in play as the roof on the arena was closed. When play resumed it was Nadal who came out the sharper and in the tiebreak which followed he upped his game to prevail seven points to five, pumping the air in trademark style as he leveled at two sets all. He looked set to complete the turnaround when he broke Djokovic to lead 4-2 in the decider. But it was not be be as the break was retrieved with Djokovic then looking the stronger. He finally broke through to serve for the match at 6-5. Still he was forced to save a break point, but he closed out the match on the first championship point to claim the winner's check for $2.4 million.","World No.1 Novak Djokovic wins Australian Open men's singles title .

"(CNN) -- The leader of the Nigerian secessionist state of Biafra, where haunting images of underfed children caught in a civil war shocked the world, has died at age 78, officials said Saturday. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu died in the United Kingdom, according to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. A government spokesman said Ojukwu died from effects of a stroke. The 1967-1970 Biafra civil war occurred after Yakubu Gowon took power in a coup d'etat in 1966. Ojukwu, than a military governor, and his followers rejected plans for reconciliation following violence against the Igbo people in the north and broke away. ""He cited as the principal cause for this action the Nigerian government's inability to protect the lives of easterners and suggested its culpability in genocide, depicting secession as a measure taken reluctantly after all efforts to safeguard the Igbo people in other regions had failed,"" according to globalsecurity.org, a public policy organization. Estimates of the number of dead from hostilities, disease, and starvation during the 30-month civil war are estimated at between 1 million and 3 million, according to globalsecurity.org. The war ended in January 1970, when Ojukwu fled and Biafra was reabsorbed by Nigeria. Multi-ethnic Nigeria has been plagued by religious and communal violence since independence from Britain in 1960. ""Chief OjukwuÂ¹s immense love for his people, justice, equity and fairness which forced him into the leading role he played in the Nigerian civil war, as well as his commitment to reconciliation and the full reintegration of his people into a united and progressive Nigeria in the aftermath of the war, will ensure that he is remembered forever as one of the great personalities of his time who stood out easily as a brave, courageous, fearless, erudite and charismatic leader,"" Jonathan said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Ah, fermentation. And distilling. Where would the world be without them? Yes, the Irish might have taken over the world had God not invented whisky, but what about rum, gin, vodka, beer and wine? We'll likely never know the answer to that question, but we can find out exactly how the drinks that rule the world are made. Whichever flavor you like to toss back, somewhere there's a booze tour with your name on it. From Belgium to Barbados, here are 10 of our favorites. Bourbon: Woodford Reserve Distillery, Kentucky . Kentucky's oldest and smallest distillery, Woodford Reserve lovingly crafts its bourbon in small batches. Maybe that's why it's the official bourbon of the Kentucky Derby. At the distillery, also a National Historic Landmark, visitors take a guided tour that explains the history of bourbon, the bottling process and how Woodford Reserve does something special with all five sources of bourbon flavor. For example, they don't just use water, they use deep limestone well water. Big difference (as they'll explain). Best of all, guests get to linger with the award-winning craft bourbon. On the Corn to Cork tour you can dive deeper into the bourbon-making process. Or you can just start serving up mint juleps. Cost: $7. Wine: Viña Errazuriz, Panquehue, Chile . Grape for grape, this family-owned estate 100 kilometers north of Santiago pumps out some of the best wine in South America. It helps that Viña Errazuriz has the perfect climate for it: cool, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. On the two-hour tour, visitors take to the underground cellars and walk the hillside vineyards, covering topics like viticulture, climate conditions and grape management. Then it's on to sampling four of the estate's Max Reserva wines. The Pinot Noir contains some amazingly smoky notes from oak aging. Cost: U.S. $34. Rum: Mount Gay Visitor Center, Brandons, Barbados . It's the classic rum stereotype -- turquoise waters, tropical island, white-sand beaches. And for a reason. As the birthplace of rum, Barbados is home to the oldest rum in existence, Mount Gay. Launched in 1703, Mount Gay is a smooth, medium-bodied rum combining notes of ripe banana, almond, vanilla, coffee and chocolate. It gets those last two from an aging process that involves Kentucky oak barrels that previously contained bourbon. At the Mount Gay visitor center in Brandons (near the capital, Bridgetown), travelers learn about these rum properties in the brand museum. Later, they snoop around a Barbadian rum shop and sample two of Mount Gay's finest rums in the official bar. An optional lunch is served outdoors, with a Mount Gay punch, naturally. Cost: U.S. $7-$50. Lager: Stella Artois Brewery, Leuven, Belgium . In 1926, the Artois brewery in Leuven, Belgium (which has been in existence since 1366), produced a beer so bright it was given the name Stella, Latin for ""star."" Which goes to show sometimes a company requires a few centuries to discover its true calling. Today, Stella Artois is sold in more than 80 countries. The hourlong tour at the Stella Artois brewery divulges all the beer's secrets (so they say). Visitors sample a cool Stella in the cozy Den Thuis bar before being guided to the Stella Artois shop, where they can stock up on chalices. And maybe a bottle opener. Cost: €8.50 (U.S. $11.30). Stout: Guinness Storehouse, Dublin . Guinness is like a beer milkshake and the tour of the brand's headquarters is just as filling. It starts in the atrium next to the world's largest pint glass, which rises up through the middle of the seven-story building. As the thorough and at times interactive tour moves up each floor, visitors learn about the beer's state-of-the-art brewing process, its ""cooperage"" (barrel-making) and how it's transported to more than 150 countries. Awaiting at the top is a pint of Guinness (certificate included) in the Gravity Bar, which affords visitors a 360-degree view of Dublin. There's a reason the Guinness Storehouse is the No. 1 attraction in Ireland. Cost: €16.50 (U.S. $22). Whisky: Glenfiddich Distillery, Dufftown, Scotland . Glenfiddich is the world's most awarded single-malt Scotch whisky, having claimed more big-time international medals since 2000 than any other single-malt Scotch. In the heart of the Scottish Highlands, its distillery is nearly as decorated. The free classic tour runs through 19th-century warehouses and mash rooms and includes three drams of Glenfiddich. For a more in-depth look (and more chest-hair-producing whisky samples), visitors can opt for the explorers tour or even the pioneers tour, where they can taste a 30-year-old whisky and procure a rare, cask-strength bottle of Glenfiddich. Cost: Free to £75 (U.S. $121). Tequila: Casa Herradura, Amatitán, Mexico . If premium tequila is your drink, Guadalajara, Mexico, and a locomotive known as the Tequila Express is your trip. In this case, the Tequila Express is a literal train. Thirty kilometers later, visitors arrive at Casa Herradura, home of the award-winning and picturesque Herradura Tequila distillery. Surrounded by mountains and agave fields, the tour takes in the original factory and a few 100% agave tequilas (silver, reposado, añejo). Throw in a mariachi band and a little Mexican folk dancing and it could be a wedding night. Cost: 100 pesos (U.S.$7.90) and up. Vodka: 45th Parallel Distillery, Wisconsin . About 50 miles east of Minneapolis, Minnesota, 45th Parallel is a small, family-owned distillery in New Richmond, Wisconsin. While their resources may be modest, they produce one hell of a vodka, ultra-clean and as neutral as Switzerland. It costs a mere $5 to take the distillery tour. Visitors observe the patient fermentation of mash and slow, small-batch distilling processes. Then comes a sample of their best stuff in the tasting room. These Midwesterners also churn out a pretty solid bourbon. Cost: $5. Cider: Healey's Cornish Cyder Farm, Penhallow, England . Healey's makes a number of ciders, most notably the Cornish Rattler, a cloudy cider with a hefty bite, hence the name and snake on the bottle. Visitors can explore the distillery, bottling facility, underground cellars and museum and learn about the process of making award-winning cider. Or, they can take a tractor ride through apple orchards in the valley below, have lunch and a slew of ciders in the restaurant, even pet the farm animals. It's all kid-friendly. Cost: £7.00 (U.S. $11). Gin: New York Distilling Company, New York City . OK, this isn't much of a distillery tour. The New York Distilling Co. is small; tours are informal and don't last long. The hook here is the distillery, located in the hip, converted-warehouse-heavy neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, attached to a fully functioning bar called The Shanty. In this laid-back, exposed-brick haunt, the distillery's hulking steel and copper still are seen through a large window. Cocktails are available, made with the distillery's two gins, the citrus Dorothy Parker and the strong (57% ABV) Perry's Tot. A distillery-produced rye is on its way. Cost: Free.

"(CNN) -- In amended charges presented Friday, U.S. military authorities accused Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales of illicit steroid and alcohol use in addition to 16 counts of premeditated murder for allegedly gunning down villagers in Afghanistan earlier this year. Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, responded to the changes by saying he is ""so relieved"" that military prosecutors ""came out publicly with the steroid use."" ""Steroid use is going to be an issue in this case, especially where Sgt. Bales got steroids and how he got steroids,"" Browne told CNN. Military prosecution faces major hurdles in massacre case . The U.S. military said that, in March, Bales left his outpost in Afghanistan in the middle of the night and single-handedly attacked two villages. The incident further riled relations between Washington and Kabul, intensifying the debate about whether to pull American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. Bales was taken into military custody soon thereafter, and subsequently charged with 17 counts of murder and six counts of assault and attempted murder. He is being held in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The new slate of charges detailed Friday by the U.S. Army -- which are defined as violations of the Uniform Military Code of Justice -- include 16 counts of premeditated murder, one of several changes that the military said were done ""to conform to developments in the ongoing investigation."" Karzai condemns photos of U.S. troops with insurgents' bodies . Bales still faces six counts of attempted murder, as well as seven counts of assault -- one more than previously. In addition, the Army sergeant is charged with two counts ""of wrongfully possessing and using a Schedule III controlled substance"" -- which the military, in its release from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state where Bales is based, defines as steroids. He is also charged with a single count of ""wrongfully consuming alcohol while deployed."" Under fire: Wartime stress as a defense for murder . Browne, Bales' lawyer, called that charge ""just a red herring. You don't got out and commit the type of crimes (murders) he is accused of because you took two sips of alcohol off of someone else's Gatorade bottle."" CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales is accused of leaving his post and attacking 2 Afghan villages .

"(CNN) -- The trainer at the center of a doping scandal that stunned the world of horse racing was banned for eight years Thursday by the governing body of the sport of Britain. Mahmood Al Zarooni, who worked at the world famous Godolphin operation in Newmarket, was handed the punishment by a disciplinary panel of the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), sitting in London. The 37-year-old admitted a ""catastrophic error"" in administering prohibited anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- to 15 leading thoroughbreds. Eleven of the horses tested positive when a doping control team from the BHA visited Godolphin's Moulton Paddocks Stables on April 9. Al Zarooni volunteered information about the other four. All 15 horses, including the former 1,000 Guineas favorite Certify, were banned from racing for six months earlier Thursday by the BHA. Zero tolerance . ""We believe that the eight-year disqualification issued to Mahmood Al Zarooni, together with the six-month racing restriction placed on the horses in question by the BHA, will serve to reassure the public, and the sport's participants, that use of performance-enhancing substances in British racing will not be tolerated,"" said BHA chief executive Paul Bittar. Godolphin, one of the world's most successful stables, is owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. He issued a statement Wednesday admitting he was ""appalled and angered"" by the revelations of doping in his racing empire and had ordered the lockdown of his British operation. ""I can assure the racing public that no horse will run from that yard this season until I have been absolutely assured by my team that the entire yard is completely clean,"" he said. Prompt action . Bittar acknowledged this prompt action: ""The next objective for BHA is to take the necessary steps to ensure that overall confidence in the integrity of the sport is not at risk. ""We welcome the proactive response of Godolphin and Sheikh Mohammed in announcing their intention to review the procedures of this stable and the need to ensure that all horses formerly trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni are tested and cleared before they race again."" Al Zarooni, who has trained a string of big race winners since joining Godolphin in March 2010, was charged with rule breaches related to prohibited substances, duty to keep medication records, and conduct prejudicial to racing. After the hearing, he gave his reaction in a statement: ""First and foremost, I would like to apologize to his Highness, Sheikh Mohammed, as well as all those involved in Godolphin and the public. Trainer apology . ""I accept it was my responsibility to be aware of the rules regarding prohibited substances in Britain. I can only apologize. I have made a catastrophic error."" Simon Crisford, Godolphin's racing manager, who accompanied Al Zarooni to the hearing, expressed his thoughts to gathered reporters. ""Mr Al Zarooni acted with awful recklessness and caused tremendous damage, not only to Godolphin and British racing,"" he said. ""I think it will take a very long time for Godolphin to regain the trust of the British public. We're shocked and completely outraged by the actions he has taken.""

The use of anabolic horses is permitted for out-of-competition use in Australian racing, such as helping to overcome injuries. ""While around the world, horseracing bodies quite rightly adopt a zero tolerance policy to the presence of anabolic steroids when carrying out post-race testing, the approach is not so consistent for horses in training.

"(TIME.com) -- Talk about a longevity strategy no man wants to pursue. A recent study published in the journal Current Biology finds that Korean eunuchs â€” castrated men â€” lived 14 to 19 years longer than other men, suggesting that male sex hormones play a role in life span. In the study, the researchers used a genealogy record called the Yang-Se-Gye-Bo that tracked eunuchs who worked in the Korean imperial court during the Chosun Dynasty, which ruled from the 14th to early 20th centuries. Researchers were able to identify 81 eunuchs, who were castrated as boys, and determined that they lived to an average age of 70, significantly longer than other men of similar social status. Even kings didn't typically make it to age 50. Three of the 81 eunuchs lived to 100, a centenarian rate that's far higher than would be expected in modern society. The current incidence of centenarians is 1 per 3,500 people in Japan, and 1 per 4,400 people in the United States, for instance; thus, the incidence of centenarians among Korean eunuchs was at least 130 times higher than that of present-day developed countries, according to the paper. TIME.com: Want to live longer? Don't try caloric restriction . ""Our study supports the idea that male sex hormones decrease the lifespan of men,"" the authors write. Based on earlier research, the authors argue that one explanation for this could be that male sex hormones may negatively influence the immune system and ""predispose men to adverse cardiovascular attacks."" They note further that the theory helps explain why females -- in many species -- live longer than males. But while animal studies have suggested that castration (which removes the testes, the source of male hormones) results in longer lives, studies in humans have been spotty. In one study of castrati singers, there was no difference in lifespan between them and non-castrated singers; in another study of institutionalized, mentally ill men, however, those who were castrated lived some 14 years longer than those who weren't. And there are other reasons that women may outlive men, including for example the presence of estrogen, which may help enhance longevity. Also, as ABC News reports: . ""Females may have an advantage in longevity because they have a back-up X chromosome, (Dr. L. Stephen Coles, a co-founder of the Los Angeles Gerontology Research Group,) said. A woman's body is a mixture of cells, half containing an active X chromosome from her mother and the other half from her father, he said. If there is a defect on one X chromosome, half of her cells will be unaffected."" TIME.com: Health checkup: How to live 100 years . Further, the longevity of the Korean eunuchs could be attributable to lifestyle factors the study didn't track, like diet, exercise and stress. The authors think the men's long lives can't be chalked up solely to a privileged lifestyle, however. ""Except for a few eunuchs, most lived outside the palace and spent time inside the palace only when they were on duty,"" study author Kyung-Jin Min of Inha University told Reuters. Meanwhile, they still tended to outlive other royalty who spent their whole lives inside the palace. Obviously, the study authors don't advocate becoming a eunuch. There are more sensible and reliable ways to up your chances of a long, healthy life: don't smoke, eat a healthy diet, get plenty of exercise. ""For better health and longevity, stay away from stresses and learn what you can from women,"" the authors said in a statement. TIME.com: Too good to be true?

"(CNN) -- An American aid worker and her Afghan driver who were kidnapped in Afghanistan a month ago are feared dead, according to their aid group. Cyd Mizell had been working on projects designed to help women and families generate income. Meanwhile, two Polish soldiers in the NATO-led force in Afghanistan were killed and one was injured by a roadside bomb, a military said Wednesday. Armed gunmen snatched Cyd Mizell and her driver, Muhammad Hadi, from a residential neighborhood in the southern Kandahar province on January 26. In a statement on its Web site, Mizell's organization -- the Asian Rural Life Foundation -- said it was ""deeply grieved to report the apparent deaths."" ""Although we have no confirmation of their deaths, we have received information over the past few days indicating that our two aid workers have been killed,"" the statement said. The statement did not say what led the organization to believe that its employees had died. The Kandahar provincial authorities told CNN they could not confirm the report. A spokesman for the Afghanistan Interior Ministry said officials were investigating. ""We are trying to make sure whether it is true or not,"" said Zemarai Bashary. ""We cannot confirm the death yet because our police do not have any reports regarding that she was killed."" CNN was not able to reach foundation Director Jeff Palmer early Wednesday. And no one answered the phone at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Mizell, 50, was born in California and grew up in Washington. She joined the foundation three years ago, and in that short time, learned to speak the local language fluently, Palmer has told CNN. The organization runs several projects in the Kandahar area, and also has a presence in about 12 other Asian countries. Mizell traveled around Kandahar in a burqa -- the traditional attire of some Afghan women that covers them from head to toe. At the time of her abduction, Mizell had been working on projects designed to help women and families generate income. She also taught English at a high school and embroidery lessons at a girl's school, the organization said. ""She went to Afghanistan just as a real concern for the people and the turmoil within the country, and just as far as trying to reach out to women,"" friend Tony Rodgers of Acworth, Georgia, told CNN earlier. Rodgers said he had known Mizell for almost two decades. The driver who was kidnapped, Hadi, has been with the organization for two years. He is the father of five children, all under 15. Soon after the abductions, some 500 to 600 Afghan women gathered at a wedding hall in Kandahar and implored government officials to find Mizell's captors. No group has taken responsibility for the abductions. Early this month, Mizell's father, George, issued an appeal to her kidnappers, pleading for his daughter's release in a statement. ""I'm confused why my daughter would be taken because she's a gentle, caring, and respectful person,"" he said. ""When we talk to Cyd, she tells us about the friends she's made and the kindness that's been shown to her and of her desire to help them."" While a spate of kidnappings have gripped Afghanistan recently -- including the abduction of 23 South Korean Christian aid workers and a German woman last year -- it was the first such abduction for the foundation. Two NATO soldiers killed . The deadly roadside bombing took place Tuesday in the Sharan district of Paktika province, along the rugged border with Pakistan. The wounded soldier is being treated at an ISAF medical facility. ISAF, or the International Security Assistance Force, is the NATO-led military force in Afghanistan. ""Our hearts and minds are with the family and other loved ones of the brave soldiers who died on patrol,"" said Brig. Gen. Carlos Branco, an ISAF spokesperson. ""These soldiers died honorably, helping bring security to Afghanistan."" Since the conflict began in late 2001, three Polish troops have died in Afghanistan. The bombing came as a prominent American politician said that the war in Iraq is distracting the United States from what's happening along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Sen. Joe Biden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, on Tuesday called the border region ""the most urgent need in the war on terror"" and ""a superhighway for extremists."" The senator from Delaware just returned from Pakistan, where he and Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Chuck Hagel, R-Nebraska, observed the election and also traveled in Afghanistan, India and Turkey. ""The main message I bring back is that Afghanistan is the forgotten war and Pakistan is the neglected frontier,"" Biden said at a Capitol Hill news conference. ""Afghanistan is slipping toward failure because it has never been a priority, and it has to become one."" E-mail to a friend .

"London, England -- The CNN World Sport team have had their vote -- now it is time to have yours; as the decade draws to a close, which sport people would you place in a top 10 of achievers from the last 10 years? It is a tough call to select the cream of the Noughties' crop, especially in a decade of enthralling sporting achievement, but after much thought, discussion and deliberation the World Sport team have had their say. The top 10 of Tiger Woods, Roger Federer, Michael Phelps, Michael Schumacher, Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Lance Armstrong, Annika Sorenstam, Kobe Bryant and David Beckham / Zinedine Zidane hold few surprises for sport aficionados, but what of those who did not make the final cut? Valentino Rossi and Sebastien Loeb dominated MotoGP and the World Rally Championship in the same vein as Schumacher ruled over Formula One since the turn of the century, yet they are left from the top 10. Similarly, though Bolt's smashing of the 100 and 200 meter men's world records was spectacular, who could say the athletic success of Ethiopian distance runner Kenenisa Bekele and Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva were less deserving of admiration. And though some sports are more international than others, is it right that careers such as those of cricketers Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, American football's Tom Brady or baseball slugger Barry Bonds have been overlooked in the final analysis? A surprise too maybe that soccer, despite its global popularity and its wealth of star names (Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Paolo Maldini, Ronaldinho and Ryan Giggs), secured only the last place in the official list. Criticism aside, however, some of the selections have been met with the approval of authoritative names from the world of sport. In a recent panel discussion with Laureus World Sport Academy members Sean Fitzpatrick, Sebastian Coe, Boris Becker and Michael Johnson, Johnson told CNN anchor Pedro Pinto that Bolt was worthy of his place: . ""When you look at Usain Bolt, when he first broke the 100 meter record, it was only the fourth time he raced at that distance.  He still has a lot to improve on, but he is extraordinary.  Every so often you have an athlete that comes along who is more naturally gifted than the rest of the field."" Becker also added that it was right for Federer to appear prominently in the list: ""After already winning 13 grand slams most tennis players would have been happy, but he went onto to win his first French Open title in 2009 before winning at Wimbledon again. ""I've played against (Jimmy) Connors, (John) McEnroe, (Bjorn) Borg, (Ivan) Lendl, (Andre) Agassi and (Pete) Sampras -- and it is amazing to be around someone like Federer who is rewriting all of the records set by these men,"" Becker added.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles Police Department can have access to personal tape recordings between Charles Manson follower Charles D. ""Tex"" Watson and his late attorney that investigators believe might hold clues to unsolved killings, a federal judge in Texas ruled Tuesday. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Schell ruled that Watson waived his right to attorney-client privilege in 1976 by allowing his attorney to sell the tapes for $49,000 to the man who co-authored Watson's memoir. LAPD investigators want the decades-old recordings between Watson and his attorneys because they believe the tapes could shed light on unsolved killings involving the ""family,"" as Manson's followers were called, according to court documents. ""We are continuing to monitor the case, and are prepared to send our detectives out to Texas to pick up the tapes as soon as they are available,"" LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith told CNN. ""It is our understanding that there is a 30-day window for appeal, and we will wait for that to time to transpire before we send our detectives to Texas."" The news of the judge's ruling came the same day that California Department of Corrections authorities said they arrested a Mason follower, accusing him of attempting to smuggle a cell phone to Manson at Corcoran State Prison. For more than four decades, authorities have speculated the Manson family was responsible for the rampage that left pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others dead, including Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Manson has claimed more people were killed, though he has repeatedly made fantastic claims that later turn out to be false. Gov. Brown nixes release of former Manson follower . Watson has long maintained there is nothing for authorities to gain with the recordings. In a June 5, 2012, letter to CNN, Watson wrote: ""There is nothing new on the tapes that was excluded from my book 'Will You Die For Me?' The book was co-authored to show delicate consideration when sharing the graphic details of the crime in order to show respect towards the families of the victims."" Watson, Manson and three others -- Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten -- were convicted of murder in the killings. In the letter to CNN, Watson asserted that ""there are no unsolved murders committed by the Manson Family."" The gruesome murders were chronicled in the best-seller ""Helter Skelter."" In the court ruling, the judge notes ""Watson expresses concern that the contents of the recordings may be hurtful to the families of his victims in the Tate-LaBianca murders."" Judge gives tapes to LAPD in 'Manson family' investigation . The tapes are about eight hours of recordings between Watson and his attorney from 1969, Bill Boyd of McKinney, Texas, according to court papers. Boyd died in 2009. According to court documents, Watson waived his attorney-client privilege to the tapes in 1976, and his attorney received partial payment for his legal fees when he gave a copy of the tapes to Chaplain Raymond G. Hoekstra, who subsequently co-authored the book, ""Will You Die for Me: The Man Who Killed for Charles Manson Tells His Own Story."" In court filings, Watson requested ""that the Tapes not be turned over to the LAPD, because they are not a creditor to my late attorney Bill Boyd, God rest his soul"" and ""because repercussions of the motion have not been fully considered by all parties concerned. Added Watson in court documents: ""... this case is high notoriety, with much media attention. For this reason, special consideration should be made with who takes possession of The Tapes, so they will not be misused for purposes unintended by the court and that could be hurtful to the families of the victims."" Charles Manson denied parole again . In 2008, Watson wrote CNN that he was aware of no bodies buried in a remote Death Valley, California, site called Barker Ranch, the last hideout for Manson and his family, when CNN did a report about a corpse-sniffing dog visiting the site. Watson, 66, was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder and has been denied parole 16 times. He will be considered again in 2016, according to the California Department of Corrections. 2011: Tex Watson denied parole . 2008: The results of dig at Manson ranch site .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece's main center-right party has failed to form a coalition government Monday, adding yet more uncertainty to the debt-ridden country's political situation. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said he did ""everything possible"" to form a coalition, but that none of the parties agreed to join with his party, which won first crack at forming a government after finishing first in Sunday's parliamentary elections. It will now be up to the leftist Syriza coalition, which opposes unpopular austerity measures imposed to secure a European bailout, to form a government. That group will have three days to form a government. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras left little doubt Sunday about what direction his party would take in a new government. ""European leadership and especially (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat,"" Tsipras said Sunday. He called the election results ""a message of a peaceful revolution."" Sunday's election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in Greece. A European Commission spokeswoman said Monday that Greece needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country's leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. ""The commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,"" spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. The center-right New Democracy party finished first in Sunday's voting, but with just 19% of the vote, giving it 108 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament. Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK -- New Democracy's socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government -- stripping the party of 119 seats. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue the coalition, requiring formation of a new government. ""I asked for a strong mandate, but people chose differently. I respect their message,"" Samaras said Sunday on state television. ""Today's result expresses people's disappointment toward the implemented dead-end economic policy that tested their limits and didn't include the necessary development policy."" PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos said after meeting with Samaras that his party would be willing to participate, but only in a coalition with a friendly view toward Europe led by a prime minister willing to renegotiate terms of the bailout deal with the European Commission. Last year, Greece's debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work. Furthermore, for the past two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth â‚¬130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. The Greek stock market was down about 6% Monday as concerns that Sunday's election could prompt Greek leaders to reconsider the deal resonated throughout Europe. Hansen, the European Commission spokeswoman, said Greece needs time to form a government and said the commission stands ready to continue its assistance. But she said it would need to be within the framework of the second bailout. Politicians have until May 17 to come up with a new working alliance or, if they cannot, set a date for another round of elections. Before New Democracy's failure to form a coalition, Samaras said his party's two priorities would be to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies, including stringent austerity measures, to ""achieve development and offer people relief."" ""I understand people's rage, but I will not let the country (exist) without a government,"" Samaras said. PASOK's Venizelos said he favors the formation of a unity government that is ""EU-oriented, regardless of what their take is"" on previously implemented measures. His party will have 41 seats in parliament, down from 160 before the elections. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures. Elections in Europe: Socialist wins French presidency . The radical leftist coalition Syriza passed PASOK with a strong second-place showing. Exit polls predicted it would garner 10% support, but instead Syriza garnered 16.7%, according to the results. That more than triples its parliamentary representation to 51 seats. The fourth-place finisher, the Independent Greek party, was founded in February by ousted New Democracy member of parliament Panos Kammenos. With 10.6% backing, this right-wing nationalist party, which opposes Greece's agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, will now have 33 seats in parliament. The Communist Party, which wants Greece to leave the single-currency eurozone, also saw gains in winning 8.5% support. And the far-right Golden Dawn party, which got 0.3% of votes in the previous election, ended up with 7% support on Sunday. That equates to a rise from zero to 21 parliamentary seats. Its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, gave a rousing speech after Sunday's vote, saying Golden Dawn will ""fight so that Greece won't be a slave of the memorandum and of the social jungle that illegal immigrants have brought in this country."" ""Everyone who betrays Hellenism should be afraid. We are coming,"" he said. Katerina Sokou, financial editor of the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini, called what happened Sunday ""a protest vote (against) the main two political parties of Greece."" Yet Sokou added that she expects New Democracy and PASOK again will be part of the ruling coalition government, even though there may be notable policy changes and challenges to come, including a ""renegotiation"" of the already approved austerity measures. ""I believe that these electoral results ... show that people need a coalition government,"" she said. ""They also want the parties to cooperate.""

"(CNN) -- FBI agents on Wednesday searched the former martial arts studio of a Tupelo man in connection with the investigation into ricin-tainted letters sent to President Barack Obama and other officials, the man's lawyer, Lori Basham, told CNN. Agents in hazardous materials suits had searched James Everett Dutschke's home on Tuesday, the same day prosecutors dropped charges against the man arrested last week on suspicion of sending the letters. Authorities have not called Dutschke a suspect and no charges have been filed. It was unclear what, if anything, they found. 'A train has been lifted off my shoulder,' former suspect says . Basham said Dutschke has not yet spoken to federal investigators. He did sign a consent form allowing the searches, she said. Dutschke no longer rents the taekwondo studio space, she said. Investigators are trying to determine whether someone attempted to pin the poisonous letters on Paul Kevin Curtis of Corinth, Mississippi, a law enforcement source told CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. However, Curtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, said Wednesday on CNN that she believes investigators are now focusing on the possibility that the letters were a direct attack on the politicians they were addressed to, not purely an attempt to get at Curtis. ""Kevin just happens to be the scapegoat for it,"" she said. In a court hearing Monday before the charges were dropped, Curtis said he was being framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit. Basham said Wednesday her client had nothing to do with the letters. Prosecutors initially arrested Curtis April 17 and charged him with sending a threat to the president after letters containing a suspicious powder triggered security scares around Washington. The letters -- sent to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi -- touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the bombing of the Boston Marathon. The two incidents were unconnected, officials said. The FBI said the letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses have been reported. Authorities dropped the charges against Curtis on Tuesday after new information became available, U.S. Attorney Felicia Adams said. McCoy said Wednesday that she does not believe Curtis is under any remaining suspicion. She said she believed investigators identified her client from constituent records maintained by Wicker's office and concluded he was responsible based on thin evidence. She believes Curtis had been framed by someone who used several phrases he likes to use on social media. The letters read, in part: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" They were signed ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" a source told CNN. Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. Basham said Dutschke used to work for Curtis' brother, but the two have had no contact since 2010. Curtis said Wednesday that he didn't even know what ricin is until he got out of jail and looked it up on the Internet. When police suddenly stormed his home last week, Curtis said an investigator asked him about ricin, and Curtis said he responded, ""Well, I don't eat rice, and I don't have any rice in the house."" While investigators didn't initially accept his claims of innocence, and he came close to losing hope during his week in jail, he said it's turned out as well as he could have hoped. ""This has restored my faith in our justice system,"" he said Wednesday on CNN. CNN's Victor Blackwell, Vivian Kuo, Bill Mears, Chris Cuomo, Ed Payne and Michael Pearson also contributed to this report. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- The American soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a shooting rampage is sitting in a military courtroom for the next week or more, hearing the evidence against him. The Article 32 hearing began Monday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state to determine if a trial is warranted for U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who could get the death penalty if convicted. The deadly shooting spree near a small U.S. base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province last March strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull out American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. ""He committed a mass killing crime, and we would like the court in the United States to implement justice and punish him according to the crime,"" Ahmad Zia Syamak, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, told CNN on Monday. Bales acted with ""chilling premeditation"" and was ""lucid, coherent and responsive"" when he left the remote outpost and went from house to house, gunning down villagers, Lt. Col. Joseph Morse, the Army's prosecutor, told the court. Women and children were among the 16 dead and six wounded, authorities said. ""Nothing really justifies killing women and children in a noncombat situation,"" Bales' attorney, John Henry Browne, told CNN earlier. ""But there may be explanations if that's true."" Read more: Stunned friends recall good deeds of Afghanistan killings suspect . The first soldier to testify Monday was Cpl. David Godwin, who said he watched a movie and drank Jack Daniels whiskey with Bales and another soldier, Sgt. Jason McLaughlin, just hours before the alleged attack. The soldiers drank moderately and did not get drunk, Godwin said. Godwin was awakened early the next morning and told Bales was missing from camp, he testified. The soldiers searched the camp for Bales, who re-appeared about 4:30 a.m. and was taken into custody, he said. Sgt. McLaughlin testified next, telling the court that Bales had awakened him at 2 a.m. and told him he had been in a nearby village and had ""shot some people up."" Mclaughlin said he didn't believe Bales and he told him to let him get back to sleep because he had to go on duty in an hour. ""I'll be back at 5,"" he said Bales told him. ""You got me?"" As Bales departed, he told McLaughlin, ""Take care of my kids,"" McLaughlin testified. When Bales approached McLaughlin and Godwin after he was taken into custody he asked them ""Did you rat me out? Did you rat me out, man?"" Godwin testified. Bales, who had blood on his uniform and face, said, ""I thought I was doing the right thing,"" Godwin testified. While waiting for helicopter to take him away, Bales told Godwin ""It's bad. It's bad. It's real bad,"" Godwin said. Capt. Daniel Fields, the third witness, said that when he asked Bales what had happened after he surrendered, he replied, ""I'm sorry I let you down."" A crowd of Afghan villagers gathered outside the camp as the sun began to rise that morning, Fields said. He was told their trucks were filled with people who had been shot, he said. ""Interpreters were spit on because the people knew they worked for Americans,"" so the U.S. soldiers stayed out of sight to avoid a confrontation, he testified. Browne said in a CBS interview that his client appeared to have memory problems predating the incident. ""He has some memories about what happened before the alleged event and some memories after the alleged event and some windows here and there into things, but he really doesn't have any memory,"" Browne said. Along with the 16 counts of premeditated murder, six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of assault, Bales is also charged with illicit use of alcohol and steroids. The steroid use will be a key factor in Bales' defense, Browne said. ""Steroid use is going to be an issue in this case, especially where Sgt. Bales got steroids and how he got steroids,"" he told CNN last spring. Bales, who served three tours of duty in Iraq before being sent to Afghanistan, may have been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, Browne said. Bales suffered a traumatic brain injury during a roadside bomb explosion and lost part of his foot in separate tours in Iraq, he said. ""Anybody that has seen what he's seen and done what he's done at the request of the military -- and I'm not talking about these allegations -- I think would have PTSD. ... Dragging parts of bodies around is not something you forget very often."" Read more: Soldier who allegedly killed 16 Afghans engaged in financial fraud . Following Afghan tradition, the 16 victims were buried soon after the deaths, before autopsies could be done. Some legal experts have told CNN that could present a difficulty for prosecutors. But there were photographs taken of the victims and survivors who saw it happen. Also, if any rounds were recovered from the scene and matched his weapon, they could be used as evidence against Bales. The Article 32 hearing, named after the section of the military code of justice that dictates how it works, is sort of a combination of a grand jury hearing and a preliminary hearing in a civilian criminal case. But there are significant differences. For instance, there will be significant testimony from many of the potential witnesses in the case, and unlike in a grand jury case, Bales and his attorney will be there and be able to cross-examine the witnesses against him or even present witnesses of their own.

This hearing, which is expected to last up to two weeks, will be even more unusual in that the courtroom will be linked by satellite to Afghanistan, where some of the witnesses will testify by teleconference. On some days, the hearing in Washington state won't even begin until dinnertime, when the day is just beginning on the other side of the world in Afghanistan. In one other difference from civilian court, the person who acts as the judge in the case will not make a decision about whether the case should go to trial in a court-martial. He or she will make a recommendation to the officer who ordered that the hearing be held. That person will decide which, if any, charges Bales will face at trial and also whether prosecutors will pursue the death penalty in the case. Under fire: Wartime stress as a defense for murder .

"(CNN) -- Just when many colleges have started sending out their acceptances, director Paul Weitz's ""Admission,"" a comedy set in a fictionalized Princeton University admissions office, has debuted in movie theaters across the country. The film is off to a so-so start at the box office, but its timing could not be better for drawing in high school seniors and their parents. Tina Fey, in the role of Portia Nathan, an admissions officer with a screwball love life, gives us a lot to laugh at in ""Admission,"" but as a college professor who has served on his school's admissions committee, I found myself doing more squirming than laughing as I watched the film. What had me squirming was the focus of ""Admission,"" Portia's efforts to gain entry into Princeton for Jeremiah Balakian, a brilliant student, who was a screwup at his local New Hampshire high school but who has found himself at Quest, a nearby progressive, prep school. Jeremiah is the classic diamond in the rough. He has gotten fives on all his advanced placement tests, despite never having taken an AP course, and he is near 800 (the top score) on his College Boards. But Portia, whose motives for helping Jeremiah are personal and professional, cannot convince her fellow admissions officers that Jeremiah is right for Princeton. After they vote to reject him, she takes matters into her own hands. In the middle of the night, she sneaks into the Princeton admissions office and changes Jeremiah's folder from deny to accept. The result is a blessing for Jeremiah but the end of Portia's career in college admissions. What worried me -- and will, I assume, worry high school students and their parents -- is the film's implication that the only way a diamond in the rough gets into a college such as Princeton is through an admissions officer willing to sacrifice her best interests. My Harvard undergraduate experience, as well as my current Sarah Lawrence experience, tells me that admissions officers are a lot smarter than ""Admission"" suggests. The admission officers I know find it easy to advocate for the student with great grades or the 220-pound halfback who likes physics or the cellist who has played in the local symphony, but their eureka moment comes in discovering the promising student everyone else has ignored. Still, I take the larger point of ""Admission"" -- namely, these days getting into a prestigious college has become a blood sport. As Portia tells herself in the Jean Hanff Korelitz novel on which ""Admission"" is based, ""The system as far as she was concerned was not about the applicant at all. It was about the institution. It was about delivering to the trustees, and to a lesser extent the faculty, a United Nations of scholars, an Olympiad of athletes, a conservatory of artists and musicians, a Great Society of strivers."" Colleges want students who will enhance their ratings and their brand, which means many worthy applicants get left behind. At the country's most selective colleges and universities, only 3 percent of the students come from the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Even worse, at all too many high schools, it is hard for aspiring students to get help on their college applications. A 2010 Public Agenda study found that across the nation the ratio of high school students to guidance counselors was 460 to 1. What are good students and their parents supposed to do then? Here ""Admission"" provides no checklist of answers, but its satire on the workings of a fictionalized Princeton (last year the real Princeton took in just 2,095 of the 26,664 who applied), provides solid, commonsense advice. ""Admission"" tells students and their parents that although the Princetons of America offer a great education, those who obsess over gaining admission to them are, in most cases, headed for disappointment. They are letting themselves play a game in which there are certain to be more losers than winners. Equally important, ""Admission"" asserts that landing a spot in a prestigious college (Portia is a Dartmouth graduate) does not guarantee a happy post-college life. Indeed, if there is an overriding message in ""Admission,"" it is: Don't lose perspective. The one truly shallow moment in the film comes when the director of Princeton admissions complains to his staff that U.S. News & World Report has lowered Princeton to No. 2 in its rankings. The director is deeply upset by the downgrade. He believes, as all too many parents and their children do in real life, that the quality of an education can be measured like a baseball batting average or the carats in a diamond ring. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Nicolaus Mills: New film starring Tina Fey exaggerates the plight of college admissions staff .

"(CNN) -- It's a cliche. After a shooting, reporters rush to find people who can talk about the accused. Almost always, neighbors, colleagues, friends and family shake their heads in disbelief. He was such a nice boy, they'll say, quiet. We can't believe he could have done something like this. Such has not been the case so far with Evan Ebel, 28, the man suspected of killing Colorado prison chief Tom Clements last week. People who knew Ebel invariably describe him as troubled. He was an ex-con, who spent years in solitary confinement because he was deemed too great a risk to the prison community. He was angry, violent, and seemingly incapable of accepting the sort of help his prominent family and others wanted to give. Ebel was lost. ""From the beginning, his son just seemed to have this bad streak, a streak of cruelty, and anger,"" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a longtime friend of Ebel's father, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""They did everything they could. They tried. They worked with Evan again and again, but to no avail,"" the governor said. ""He had a bad, bad streak."" Gun links Colorado prison chief's killing to Texas shootout . Tendency toward violence . Ebel grew up on a quiet street in Lakewood, Colorado, near Denver. He was the son of Jody Mangue and Jack Ebel, an attorney and former oil executive. By all accounts, Ebel came from privilege, but showed signs of trouble from a very early age. ""He just struck me as angry,"" said Lakewood neighbor Vicky Bankey. ""I could see him, he'd be running out on the front lawn to come out to a car with his friends and he would have screaming, obscenity-laced arguments with them sometimes,"" she said. As a teenager, Ebel was sent to a boot-camp-type program in Samoa, where according to one person who knew him there, almost everyone avoided him. ""He was quite a scary individual, especially by the end of the time. He had engaged in several fights with other students. One in particular he beat up with a broomstick,"" said Kurt Frey, who put Ebel's age at the camp somewhere between 15 and 17. ""He's gone through so many bad things in his life that really, it just didn't surprise me that he ended up being killed in a shootout with police."" Wanting to make 'Hitler jealous' Ebel was killed Thursday in north Texas after a battle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded. He died just two days after Clements was shot to death at his home outside Colorado Springs. Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car. Police have also said there is a ""strong connection"" between the killings of Clements and that of Nathan Collin Leon, a pizza delivery driver who was found dead in suburban Golden, Colorado. No clear motive has emerged in either case. Investigators, however, have said they are looking into all possible angles, including Ebel's onetime membership in the 211 Crew -- a white-supremacist prison gang. Clements earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on gangs. According to Frey, Ebel's behavior, even as a teenager, suggested he was interested in white supremacy. ""He was very proud of his Sicilian heritage, and he always talked about wanting to kill so many people that he'd make Hitler jealous,"" Frey told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""He really was racist, but at the same time he did hang around with African-Americans at the camp, so it was very contradictory."" 'We know a different person' A more nuanced picture of Ebel likewise emerges from his mother's accounts. Mangue writes about her children on a blog she originally started in memory of her 16-year-old daughter, who died in a car accident in 2004. The site is now also dedicated to the memory of her son. According to Mangue, Ebel's life took a sharp turn after his sister's death. ""Evan drifted into a dark period, he was struggling prior, but that event threw him over the edge, they were three years apart. He was the protective big brother and in this case, was unable to protect her,"" she wrote. ""His life deteriorated after that and he just became numb and lost his direction altogether, between using drugs and committing crimes, he was soon put in prison for 8 long years."" Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could. He got in shape in prison, became an avid reader and an advocate against using substances, she said. Mangue wrote about the bright moments of her son's childhood. Ebel was a funny boy, full of spunk and energy, she recalled. He wasn't afraid of anyone and loved animals. Once, after a sleepover at a friend's house, he brought home a small gray kitten named Sparkles. The family kept her for 15 years. ""So even though, he is depicted as depraved, evil, we know a different person who was loving, kind, thoughtful, generous and sensitive to many in his family and to his friends,"" Mangue wrote. ""As determined the media is in trying to pick apart our son, Evan for a good story, they will never succeed, he is out of their reach. He is not imprisoned anymore, his suffering has ended."" Anger at authority . Ebel was released from prison in January, after serving seven years -- three for felony menacing, robbery and assault, another four for assaulting a guard. It was his second stretch in prison, after doing one year of a three-year term for felony armed robbery. According to his mother and Gov. Hickenlooper, Ebel was in solitary confinement for much of his sentence. He was deemed too great a risk to be put with other inmates. Similarly, he spent time in isolation at the boot camp in Samoa. That time was hard for Ebel, Frey said, and it may have made things worse. ""He had a lot of anger towards authority. He never liked being told what to do and his time in isolation really only compacted that,"" Frey said. ""Everything was dictated down to the minute, and that really frustrated him."" Ironically, Clements -- the man Ebel is accused of killing -- was a champion of reducing solitary confinement for prisoners. One thing authorities might never know about Ebel is, simply, why? His alleged actions might not have a clear logic. But they at least appear to have a clear trajectory, said Rev. Leon Kelly, an anti-gang activist in Colorado. ""This kid here, who may have tried to find a sense of identity throughout the course of his life now ... in an evil, senseless way, he's found it."" CNN's Paul Vercammen, Casey Wian and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Evan Ebel, 28, is suspected in the death of Colorado's prison chief .

"(CNN) -- A Texas coroner declared the death of an adopted Russian boy accidental, prompting Moscow to demand a complete report from U.S. officials. Max Shatto, 3, who was adopted from Russia, lived in Texas with his adoptive parents. He reportedly died on January 21. Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concerns over the ruling about his death, saying it did not receive the information from U.S. officials, but from the media. It asked the United States to provide Russian consular representatives the relevant forensic documents, including a death certificate. ""We presume that this is not a final conclusion of the investigation. Still expect from the U.S. authorities -- both Texas and federal, including the U.S. Department of State -- the most complete information on the progress and results of the inquiry,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A medical examiner in Ector County determined the death was caused by a laceration of a small bowel artery due to blunt trauma to the abdominal area, said District Attorney Bobby Bland. After Texas boy's death, Russian official continues call for ban on adoptions . The bruising was consistent with a ""self-inflicted"" injury, according to Bland. Toxicology reports were negative and there were no substances found that could have contributed to the child's death. The sheriff's office said it is conducting more investigations with other agencies. The boy's death drew international attention after a Russian government child advocate said that the boy was ""killed"" or ""murdered."" At a news conference last week, Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death. He acknowledged he may have spoken too soon. Still, he wants his country to ban all international adoptions of Russian children. The boy's death aggravated U.S. State Department efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process to adopt a Russian child before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. Families in limbo after adoption ban . That law bans adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents. But others say the Russian move is in retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most popular foreign country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. foreign adoptions.","Russia's Foreign Ministry expresses concerns over the ruling about his death .

"(CNN) -- The death of Chinua Achebe represents more than the loss of a great writer. Achebe was perhaps the first to give voice with elegance, a poetic prose, and startling insight to the other side of the world which most Western readers encounter in Joseph Conrad. For the first time, through the success of Achebe's best-known book, ""Things Fall Apart,"" a world both distinctive and familiarly human as well as uniquely African won the hearts of an otherwise ignorant and insensitive and largely condescending reading public in Europe and North America, regarding African history and culture. It is a pity that not more of Achebe's prose is as well-known as ""Things Fall Apart."" At the same time, Achebe took his place in the pantheon of great writers with one acknowledged masterpiece, alongside Melville's ""Moby Dick"" and Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre."" But Achebe's contribution was not merely literary. Unlike most writers, he displayed few traces of narcissism. He was committed to his people and his community. He did not shy away from political controversy, and he did so in a manner that was unforgettable. He was soft spoken, gracious to a fault, generous. His charisma was one that mixed authority with kindness. He seemed to possess no limits to patience. He made his interlocutors and students feel that they were as important as he was. Unlike so many he did not internalize the brutalities and prejudices of oppressors only to visit the very same quality on others when the oppression vanished. Perhaps this was a function of his personality and his natural nobility and pride in his heritage. But it was also a function of his Christian faith and his commitment to the vocation of teaching and writing. Chinua Achebe came to Bard after suffering an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down. By coming to the United States he was able to secure the proper medical care, and at Bard he became a member of an academic community as teacher and colleague. He used his prestige and presence to ensure that African history and literature would take their proper place in the education of undergraduates. One of Achebe's most fervent admirers has been Nelson Mandela, who once described the sense of hope he derived from reading Achebe in prison. What Mandela saw in Achebe was the characteristic that inhabits all great literature: details that seem very particular retain their uniqueness in the hands of a great writer. But through the poetry of the prose what seems utterly foreign and unfamiliar becomes recognizable and profoundly thought-provoking. Time and place are transcended without the loss of authentic particularity. These qualities are what have made great writers great, whether they be George Eliot or Tolstoy. Achebe, drawing from his heritage and traditions, used his talent and gift of imagination to generate a visual and moral landscape entirely unfamiliar to most readers. His achievement was both historic and personal. If there was one dimension of disappointment that one could detect in Chinua Achebe, it was the fact that he was famous for one great book when in fact he had written a whole series of great books. He suffered the same frustration that is perhaps more common among composers who become associated with one piece to the exclusion of the rest of the music they have written. One hopes that Chinua Achebe's death will spark a renewal of interest beyond ""Things Fall Apart."" That novel will remain a staple of world literature. Readers should be encouraged to look at the novels Achebe wrote aftewards. The simplicity of his language, the disarming lyricism, and acuity of perception define his greatness. But in the end Achebe was in the best sense a moralist. Not a preacher, but a writer who drew his readers into contemplating the possibilities of how they might lead a better life with a greater commitment to justice, to civility, to respect, and to simple decency. The opinions expressed in this opinion piece are solely those of Leon Botstein.","Unlike so many, Achebe did not internalize the brutalities and prejudices of oppressors, writes Leon Botstein .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago man was sentenced Thursday to 23 years in prison for attempting to set off what he thought was a bomb on a crowded street near Wrigley Field in 2010. The plot was thwarted as the result of an undercover FBI operation. Sami Samir Hassoun, 25, was arrested shortly after midnight on a weekend night in mid-September 2010 after placing a backpack in a trash container in an area crowded with bars and restaurant patrons, authorities said. A concert took place that night at nearby Wrigley Field, home to the Chicago Cubs. Hassoun thought the bag contained a bomb, but it was an inert device given to him by men he didn't know were undercover FBI agents, prosecutors said. Hassoun, a Lebanese citizen living legally in the United States, pleaded guilty in April 2012 to two charges involving trying to set off explosives. He admitted telling undercover officers he wanted to set off bombs to destabilize Chicago and was willing to attack police officers, prosecutors said in a statement. The government said the undercover operatives explained the purported bomb was packed with ball bearings to inflict maximum damage and that the blast might destroy half a city block. ""The thought of what might have happened if it (the bomb) was real is horrific,"" U.S. District Judge Robert Gettlemen said at the sentencing in Chicago, according to the statement released by the U.S. Attorney's Office. The judge ordered Hassoun to be deported after he completes his sentence.","Sami Samir Hassoun was arrested in undercover operation .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray defended his appellate lawyer from ""a slew of disparaging remarks"" just days before she files the appeal of the doctor's involuntary manslaughter conviction in Michael Jackson's death. CNN has obtained sections of that 300-page appeal, including the defense argument that the trial judge erred by not allowing the testimony of Dr. Arnold Klein, a dermatologist the defense contended addicted Jackson to Demerol in his last weeks. Murray's appeal, which will be filed Monday, also argues that prosecutors never proved Jackson was hooked up to an IV drip of the drug that killed him. The defense theory was that Jackson had administered the fatal dosage himself while the doctor was away. The coroner ruled that Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol in combination with sedatives on June 25, 2009. Murray told investigators he used propofol to induce sleep because Jackson was suffering from insomnia. Murray served as Jackson's personal physician as the pop icon prepared for 50 shows that were to debut in London in July 2009, but his patient was fighting a battle for sleep between rehearsals. A wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's three children and his mother is set for trial next month. The family accuses concert promoter AEG Live of liability in his death by hiring and supervising the doctor, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 2011. Murray takes a side in lawyer dispute . Murray -- during a phone call to CNN Saturday from the Los Angeles County jail where he's been held since he was sentenced to four years in prison -- said he was ""impelled to stand up for"" attorney Valerie Wass, who has been involved in a personal dispute with Murray's trial lawyer Michael Flanagan. Flanagan was helping Wass, who wrote the appeal, until the two lawyers were involved in a jailhouse argument last January. Flanagan dropped Murray as a client after the incident, but the appeals court later ordered him to respond to requests from Wass for case files, which she said he had withheld. Murray, who witnessed the January incident between his attorneys, issued a strong statement of support for Wass in his call from jail. ""In recent weeks, I became keenly aware that a slew of disparaging remarks and personal information about my appellate attorney, Valerie Wass, were unjustly released to the media and the public,"" Murray said.  ""Because of this injustice, I am impelled to stand up for this woman, for whom I have the utmost respect and confidence."" Wass completed work on the appeal even though ""with the blink of an eye, all of her promised assistance vanished; they abandoned ship,"" Murray said. Responding to CNN on Sunday, Flanagan said he had no comment. ""Although she needed help, she did not quit, did not jump ship, nor did she succumb to pressure while others abdicated their responsibilities,"" he said.   ""She held steadfastly to her professional and moral conduct, which was bolstered by her amazing mettle of mind and spirit."" Murray said Wass ""stood up for me amidst a most arduous and challenging series of obstacles, and whose loyalty remains indisputable.  It is my belief that she took a personal hit for me, and I want to  let her know that I'll forever be grateful."" Murray's appeal: Jackson's Demerol addiction . Although Murray could be freed in about seven months, he is seeking to clear his name and get his medical license back by having his conviction overturned on appeal. The appeal contends that Los Angeles Superior Judge Michael Pastor wrongly prevented Murray's trial lawyers from making their case that Jackson was going through withdrawal from a Demerol addiction the day he died. ""The reason it sought to prove that Jackson was going through Demerol withdrawal on June 25th was to show his state of mind -- specifically, that his resulting physiological and psychological state, along with the pressure he was under from preparing for the upcoming tour, rendered him so desperate for sleep that he would take the extraordinary action of self-administering propofol when he was outside the presence of appellant,"" Wass writes. Defense experts testified at the trial that Jackson's insomnia could have been caused by the withdrawal. The defense wanted Klein and two staff members to testify about Jackson's 23 visits to their Beverly Hills clinic in the three months before his death, including five in June 2009. Jackson was given Demerol during those visits, the last time on June 22, three days before he died. ""Michael Jackson could not sleep because of the Demerol,"" the defense said in pretrial arguments. ""Dr. Murray did not know that. But Arnold Klein did. Michael Jackson needed sleep because he was withdrawing and addicted, both addicted and withdrawing from Demerol. That's important to our defense. In fact, it's absolutely vital."" Pastor, however, ruled that testimony from Klein and his staff would be a ""distraction and divergence"" in the trial. ""The defense was also unable to prove whether Jackson was addicted to Demerol and going through withdrawal at the time he died, because experts in the case articulated they could not reach conclusions based only on reviewing Klein's records,"" Wass writes in the appeal. If Klein or his staff had been allowed to testify at the trial, ""It is reasonably probable that at least one juror on the panel would have found appellant not guilty of involuntary manslaughter,"" the appeal argues. ""Accordingly, regardless of the applicable standard of review, appellant's conviction must be reversed."" Murray's appeal: No proof of IV drip . The prosecution's theory in the trial was that Murray hooked Jackson up to an unusual makeshift IV drip of propofol and then left him alone to make phone calls in an adjacent room. Murray was criminally negligent because he did not properly monitor his patient who later died from an overdose, they argued. The defense argued that the IV drip only sent saline into Jackson's leg to hydrate him and that Murray used a syringe to slowly push a safe dose of propofol into Jackson's blood while he watched him fall asleep. A frustrated Jackson could have awakened while Murray was away and administered the fatal dose himself, the defense said. ""The propofol infusion theory offered by the prosecution's expert was not supported by the evidence, and in fact, was so absurd, improbable and unbelievable that a rational trier of fact could not have concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant had placed Jackson on a propofol drip on the day of his death,"" the appeal argues. The prosecution built the IV drip theory based on testimony of one of Jackson's guards who said he saw a propofol bottle hanging above Jackson's death bed when he arrived to help revive him. An investigator also found a saline bag with a slit in it, which the prosecution contended was used to hold the bottle on the IV stand. Defense propofol expert Dr. Paul White testified such an IV drip set up was ""befuddling"" because a propofol bottle comes with a hanging device. The hanging tab on the bottle was not used, both sides agreed. ""The prosecution concocted the novel and ridiculous method of placing the vial into the bag through the slit, hanging the bottle upside down at an angle using the bag for support, and then hanging the bag from the IV stand,"" the appeal argues. A piece of tubing key to the IV drip was never found, but the prosecution suggested Murray could have slipped it into a pocket before leaving the bedroom to ride to the hospital with Jackson. Wass argues that is ""pure speculation, and the absence of evidence of a long IV line with propofol residue is fatal to the prosecution's theory."" ""If an IV line used in a propofol infusion had been placed in appellant's pocket, it would have been dripping propofol, and resulted in a messy wet pocket,"" the appeal argues. ""Such a result is not reflected in any photograph, testimony, or statement of any witness."" Murray's appeal: Jackson gave himself fatal dose . Michael Jackson got little sleep the morning he died, despite Murray's bedside efforts using sedatives, according to Murray. ""It is likely that Jackson's heightened insomnia on June 25th was exacerbated by his surreptitious Demerol addiction and the resultant acute withdrawal syndrome therefrom,"" the appeal says. ""Jackson's last Demerol injection was on June 22nd, less than 72 hours before his death, which could have been a peak period for the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms."" But he did fall asleep at 10:40 a.m after a single dose of propofol, he told investigators. After watching him for 15 minutes, Murray left him alone, the appeal says. ""The evidence is consistent with a scenario in which Jackson quickly self-injected the lethal bolus dose of propofol while appellant was outside the bedroom,"" the appeal contends. ""Based on the toxicology results, it appears that the rapid injection lead to cardiac arrest and a quick death."" He may have had access to a bottle of propofol without Murray knowing, the appeal says. ""Jackson was very familiar with propofol, as other doctors had administered propofol to him,"" Wass writes. ""It is conceivable that Jackson had obtained a secondary source for the drug, especially because Jackson had been receiving nightly infusions from appellant for the previous two months, and appellant had Sunday nights off."" If Jackson -- not Murray -- administered the final and fatal dose, then it was not the doctor's fault the patient died, the argument says. Murray's appeal disputes the prosecution argument that Murray was criminally liable even if Jackson had administered the fatal dose himself because Murray should have known that leaving the drugs near Jackson's bed posed a risk. The risk was ""not reasonably foreseeable,"" it said. The prosecution will have a chance to respond to Murray's arguments before the California appeals court makes a decision.","Murray calls from jail citing ""injustice"" done to appeal lawyer .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked police in eastern Afghanistan Tuesday morning, leaving five officers dead, police said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack that occurred in the city of Jalalabad. Six or seven civilians were also injured in the violence and five of the attackers died, according to Mohammad Sharif Amin, a local police spokesman. This attack comes a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Afghanistan for a trip to help repair strained relations with President Hamid Karzai. Kerry landed in Kabul on Monday afternoon and met with Karzai at the presidential palace. The attack, early Tuesday morning, happened some 145 kilometers (90 miles away) from Kabul. At least eight attackers stormed a police station in Jalalabad, authorities said, igniting two car bombs and firing at officers. The Taliban, which is known to inflate numbers of the dead in past attacks, said as many as 40 officers and 15 foreign trainers were killed. That tally was not verified by Afghan police.","Five officers killed in the attack .

"(CNN) -- Like a cat playing with a mouse, former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola teased his potential Premier League suitors on Wednesday by saying he wants to coach an English club ""in the future"". The 41-year-old Guardiola stepped down as Barcelona coach at the end of last season after four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs to take a year-long sabbatical. Even since, the Catalan has been linked with a number of English clubs -- notably Chelsea and Manchester City -- as well as a host of top European teams such as Bayern Munich in Germany and AC Milan in Italy. ""I've always found English football very fascinating, just for the environment, the crowd and the supporters,"" Guardiola told the English Football Association's website ahead of the FA's 150th anniversary. ""As a player, I couldn't realise my dream to play there but I hope in the future, I have a challenge to be a coach or a manager there and feel the experience of all the coaches and players that have been there. ""It is unique, to play in that league. I want to feel the supporters, the environment, the media and the style of the players and everything. ""I am still young, just 41, so I hope in the future I could be able to train there and enjoy that."" Guardiola's update on his future plans is likely to make uncomfortable reading for those coaches in charge of Europe's top teams, such as Chelsea interim manager Rafa Benitez and Bayern's 67-year-old coach Jupp Heynckes -- whose contract ends in June. City boss Roberto Mancini's contract runs until 2017, though there has been speculation surrounding the Italian's future following the appointment of former Barcelona vice president Ferran Soriano as the English champions' chief executive, who took up his new role in September, and the arrival of former Barcelona technical director Txiki Begiristain as director of football at the Etihad Stadium in October. Guardiola, who spoke to the FA from New York where he is currently living, joined Barcelona as a 13-year-old and won six La Liga titles and one European Cup as a player with the club. He won that European Cup, now known as the Champions League, at Wembley as a 19-year-old when Barcelona beat Sampdoria, who Mancini was then playing for.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Kurdish rebels handed over eight Turkish hostages to a Turkish delegation in northern Iraq on Wednesday, a lawmaker from the delegation told CNN. ""This is a very important step. ... This shows that there can be a democratic solution to the Kurdish issue,"" said Adil Kurt, a parliament member from Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party. Kurt spoke to CNN by telephone in northern Iraq, where he was traveling with the released hostages to the Turkish border. ""It is a show of goodwill that they were released without any preconditions."" The group had kidnapped the eight in various eastern Turkish provinces on different dates, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. Many observers and commentators in Turkey call the hostage release an important confidence-building step in a nascent peace process now under way between the Turkish government and rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist group. For the past 30 years, the two sides have been engaged in a bloody guerrilla war that has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. ""Yes, it's a concrete step, but it's a small step,"" said Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group, an organization that advises on conflict mediation. ""Although, I sincerely believe that both sides want a deal and all kinds of factors have come together to make this one of the best chances to resolve the dispute, I think both sides are very suspicious of the sincerity of the other in reaching a compromise."" For months, discreet discussions have been taking place between the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the PKK. Ocalan is being held in a Turkish jail on an island in the Marmara Sea. He launched the PKK's war against the Turkish state in the early 1980s, as part of a campaign to carve out a homeland in the Middle East for Kurds. The Kurds are the largest ethnic minority in Turkey, making up roughly 20% of the population. They have also long been subjected to policies of persecution and were referred to for decades as ""mountain Turks."" During Erdogan's decade as prime minister, however, Turkey has relaxed laws that prosecute the expression of Kurdish identity.","""This shows that there can be a democratic solution to the Kurdish issue,"" official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- If the Bush administration had known there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it probably wouldn't have decided to invade in 2003, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in an interview broadcast Sunday. Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program, Rumsfeld noted there were multiple reasons for attacking Iraq and ousting Saddam Hussein from power. However, intelligence reports -- now shown to have been false -- that Iraq possessed WMDs were the main reason for going in, Rumsfeld said. ""No question it was the big one,"" he said. Asked if the United States would not have invaded if the administration hadn't believed Iraq had the weapons of mass destruction, Rumsfeld said: ""I think that's probably right."" He criticized the source known as ""Curveball"" -- an Iraqi defector who admitted his claims that Iraq possessed WMDs were false -- but stopped short of condemning the U.S. intelligence community. ""The intelligence community talks to hundreds of people,"" Rumsfeld said. ""They have human assets, such as this man. Some are honest, some are dishonest. Some do it for money, some do it for self aggrandizement. Some do it, apparently, to lie."" Now peddling a book, four years after being replaced by Robert Gates as defense secretary following heavy Republican losses in the 2006 mid-term elections, Rumsfeld maintained the swagger and bravado that were his hallmarks when dealing with the media as a Cabinet member. He said said the Obama administration was ""wrong in attacking the Bush administration's structures that have kept this country safe for almost a decade now,"" including the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Barack Obama campaigned on the promise that he would close the facility known as Gitmo in his first year in office, but it remains open. ""They now have switched from the campaign mode, and they are keeping Guantanamo Bay. They are keeping indefinite detention,"" Rumsfeld said. ""They are keeping military commissions. So obviously, they've come to the conclusion that their campaign promises -- easier to campaign than it is to govern."" Rumsfeld also rejected the premise that the United States is viewed more favorably around the world with Obama as president. ""No, and I don't think there's data that supports that,"" Rumsfeld said. ""I think he had made a practice of trying to apologize for America. I personally am proud of America."" He was also critical of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded Obama in his first year in office in 2009. ""Well, he had not accomplished a thing when he got the Nobel Prize,"" Rumsfeld said. ""It was given to him on hope. Had to have been, because there wasn't anything that he'd done."" Despite receiving some boos when he recently was honored at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of conservative activists, Rumsfeld said the Tea Party movement has brought ""a lot of energy into public life and public affairs."" He said he was ""deeply worried about the budget"" and that the country needs to start saving money now. Some of those savings can come in the Pentagon budget he formerly oversaw, he said. ""My goodness, every year the Congress was stuffing $10 billion down the Pentagon's throat that we didn't want,"" Rumsfeld said. ""There's no question that there's money there.""","The former defense secretary says intelligence sources sometimes lie .

"(CNN) -- A Mississippi state lawmaker was found dead Sunday at the home of a former colleague, apparently the result of a suicide, a friend close to the victim told CNN on Monday. The victim is Jessica Upshaw, 53, of Diamondhead, Mississippi. A conservative Republican, she'd been a member of the state House of Representatives since 2004 and was chair of the House Conservation and Water Resources Committee. The incident occurred in Mendenhall, in Simpson County, located in southern Mississippi. Simpson County Coroner Terry Tutor said she died of a single gunshot wound to the head. He didn't elaborate and wouldn't say it was a suicide. The friend said she killed herself outside the house of former State Rep. Clint Rotenberry. Rotenberry and Upshaw, both single and divorced for a number of years, had been in a relationship, the friend said. Upshaw had been battling depression for several years and had been taking medication while under a doctor's care. Describing Upshaw as a fighter, the friend said she had been aggressively battling the depression. The incident shocked and saddened the state. Gov. Phil Bryant called Upshaw a ""unselfish and dedicated public servant."" ""This is a tragic loss for her family and all Mississippians,"" he said. Mississippi Speaker of the House Philip Gunn described Upshaw as ""an outstanding legislator and friend"" and said ""our hearts break for her family."" ""She was one of the brightest and most competent members of the House."" CNN's Brian Todd reported from Washington.

"Washington (CNN) -- Texas congressman Ron Paul now leads among Iowa Republicans and has tied Newt Gingrich for second in New Hampshire. Republican conservatives have cycled through a series of ""Not Mitts."" Is it now Paul's turn? Paul's core following has been small but fervid. However, Paul now is gaining a larger following, especially among younger voters attracted by his message of drug legalization and his comprehensive -- if utterly wrong-headed -- explanation of the country's economic crisis. Unexpectedly, young voters seem also to appreciate Paul's grandfatherly anti-charisma: his self-presentation as a good-natured old codger, charmingly baffled by the modern world. The ill-fitting suits, the quavering voice and the slack-jawed laugh all support the image of an anti-politician, the lone voice of integrity in a sullied word. There is however a flaw in this benign image of Paul: the now-notorious newsletters published under his name in the early 1990s. Paul collected nearly a million dollars in one year from newsletters suffused with paranoia, racial bigotry and support for the period's violent militia movements. Four years ago, Jamie Kirchick of the New Republic unearthed partial collections of the newsletters in the libraries of the University of Kansas and the Wisconsin Historical Society. From Kirchick's subsequent report: . ""Take, for instance, a special issue of the Ron Paul Political Report, published in June 1992, dedicated to explaining the Los Angeles riots of that year. 'Order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began,' read one typical passage. ""According to the newsletter, the looting was a natural byproduct of government indulging the black community with ' ""civil rights,"" quotas, mandated hiring preferences, set-asides for government contracts, gerrymandered voting districts, black bureaucracies, black mayors, black curricula in schools, black tv shows, black tv anchors, hate crime laws, and public humiliation for anyone who dares question the black agenda.' It also denounced 'the media' for believing that 'America's number one need is an unlimited white checking account for underclass blacks.' "" There's a lot more in this vein. Paul now claims that he did not write the newsletters, was unaware of their contents at the time and now has no idea who did write them. It's fair to say that almost no one who has followed the controversy believes that Paul is telling the truth about any of this. The authorship of the newsletters is an open secret in the libertarian world: they were produced by a community of writers led by Paul aides Lew Rockwell and Murray Rothbard, who wrote a newsletter of their own at the same time that expressed similar ideas in similar language. The racism of the newsletters -- and the elaborate lying subsequently deployed to evade responsibility for the newsletters -- say much about the ethics of Paul himself and the circle around him. Yet Ron Paul is something more (or less) than a racist crank. As Michael Brendan Dougherty aptly observed in the Atlantic last week: . ""As crazy as it sounds, Ron Paul's newsletter writers may not have been sincerely racist at all. They actually thought appearing to be racist was a good political strategy in the 1990s. After that strategy yielded almost nothing -- it was abandoned by Paul's admirers."" A fellow libertarian offers more detail on Paul's racism-as-strategy. Paul and his circle aspired ""to create a libertarian-conservative fusion ... [by] appealing to the worst instincts of working/middle class conservative whites by creating the only anti-left fusion possible with the demise of socialism:  one built on cultural issues. ... [The strategy] apparently made some folks (such as Rockwell and Paul) pretty rich selling newsletters predicting the collapse of Western civilization at the hands of the blacks, gays, and multiculturalists.  The explicit strategy was abandoned by around the turn of the century, but not after a lot of bad stuff had been written in all kinds of places."" Don't get the idea, however, that racism-as-strategy was some brief, futile dead-end for Paul. Paul exploited bigotry throughout his career, before as well as after the newsletter years. As Dave Weigel and Julian Sanchez reported in the libertarian magazine Reason, ""Cato Institute President Ed Crane told Reason he recalls a conversation from some time in the late 1980s in which Paul claimed that his best source of congressional campaign donations was the mailing list for The Spotlight, the conspiracy-mongering, anti-Semitic tabloid run by the Holocaust denier Willis Carto until it folded in 2001."" Crane is the president of the premier institution in the libertarian world. If his recollection is correct, Paul was appealing to consumers of Holocaust denial for political purposes half a decade before the newsletters commenced. Nor is it wholly accurate to describe Paul's strategy of appealing to the extremes as ""abandoned."" Ron Paul delivered the keynote address to the John Birch Society as recently as the summer of 2009. He is a frequent guest on the Alex Jones radio program, the central station for 9/11 Trutherism. As I can attest first-hand, anybody who writes negatively about Paul will see his email inbox fill rapidly with anti-Semitic diatribes. Not all the ""bad stuff"" of Ron Paul's newsletter period was racist, exactly. Some of it was just general-purpose paranoia, designed to trick money out of the pockets of the fearful and gullible. Reuters has unearthed an example of a solicitation letter for the Ron Paul newsletters: . The solicitation warns of the coming danger of ""new money"": . ""I uncovered the New Money plans in my last term in the US Congress, and I held the ugly new bills in my hands. I can tell you - they made my skin crawl! ""These totalitarian bills were tinted pink and blue and brown, and blighted with holograms, diffraction gratings, metal and plastic threads, and chemical alarms. It wasn't money for a free people. It was a portable inquisition, a paper 'third degree' to allow the feds to keep track of American cash, and American citizens."" [In an e-mail to CNN, Paul's campaign chairman Jesse Benton said, ""Dr. Paul did not write that solicitation and the signature is an auto pen. It does not reflect his thoughts and is out of step with the message he has espoused for 40 years."" He added, ""He should have better policed it and... he has assumed responsibility and apologized.""] . The daffy old coot side of Ron Paul's personality is genuine enough. The crank side is certainly genuine, as are at least some of the racial views. Even after Paul abandoned the crude race-baiting of his 1990s newsletters, he continued to engage in elaborate apologetics for the Confederate side of the Civil War. Also genuine, however, is the huckster aspect of the Ron Paul persona. That's the persona that terrifies people who had never before heard of ""diffraction grating"" that the government might use this optical scanning technology, which can detect counterfeiting, to wiretap their wallets. Ron Paul's admirers see him as a man of integrity. They are tragically mistaken about that. Despite his too-dotty-to-lie persona, Ron Paul is not in fact on the level. In evading responsibility for his newsletters, Paul has replied ""I don't know"" and ""I don't remember"" to queries whose answers he must know and surely remembers. The back story of the newsletters shows a man who, sufficiently saturated in racism and extremism himself, was ready to exploit the even greater racism and extremism of others for financial gain. Ron Paul is the Max Bialystock of monetary cranks -- and this latest presidential campaign represents the summit of his bunco artist career, his very own ""Springtime for Hitler."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says Ron Paul is riding high in GOP polls .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two more people infected with a rare strain of bird flu in China died over the weekend, as the number of human cases of H7N9 climbed to 60, state media reported Sunday. The two deaths, both in Shanghai, takes the death toll to 13, the Xinhua news agency said. Shanghai's health authorities have now reported 24 cases, after three men were diagnosed with H7N9 on Saturday. The virus also appears to have spread beyond eastern China for the first time. Two new cases were reported in central Henan Province on Sunday morning, while a child in Beijing in the north tested positive on Saturday. The H7N9 strain is normally found in birds and was never known to infect people until last month. The World Health Organization (WHO) said China had been infected with a new variation of bird flu. The agency said it continued to look for the source of the infection. ""Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing,"" the organization announced on Saturday. ""Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China."" So far, WHO said, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. A possible source for the infections is poultry markets, which have become the focus of investigation by China's health ministry and WHO. Several cities in eastern China have suspended trading in live poultry in an effort to contain the problem. Chinese scientists said the H7N9 virus probably came from migratory birds from East Asia that mixed with domestic fowl around Shanghai. The new variation of bird flu has genetic characteristics that make it well-adapted to infect humans, the New England Journal of Medicine said. CNN's Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report .","NEW: 13 dead from a total of 60 cases of bird flu in China, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Government military forces fired indiscriminately Monday from helicopters on a town on the outskirts of Jabal Al-Zawiya, inflicting scores of casualties on civilians and rebel forces, an activist told CNN. Ibrahim Swed, speaking from the town in northwestern Syria's Idlib province, said that the fighting between rebel forces in the Free Syrian Army and government forces continued for six hours and resulted in 32 deaths and more than 50 wounded. Opposition activists said at least 93 people were killed across the country Monday, 35 of them in Idlib. ""The regime is escalating the use of violent forces,"" said an activist in Idlib whom CNN is identifying only as Ahmad for safety reasons. ""We cannot believe that the world is watching us being killed ... we want military intervention."" Ahmad said more than 40 Syrians were killed Monday in Idlib province. Battle for largest cities may have begun . In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the attacks showed the government to be desperate. The use of helicopters to fire on civilians and the use of pro-regime thugs called Shabiha ""constitutes a very serious escalation,"" Nuland told reporters. ""What government voluntarily uses helicopters and fires from them on their own civilians if they're not desperate?"" she asked. ""What government depends on a bunch of thugs in trucks, irregulars, if they're not desperate? So, you know, clearly the government is under threat."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday that ""all options"" should be considered if the peace plan put forth by special envoy Kofi Annan fails to achieve peace. ""On 1st April, the Syrian regime committed itself to implementing the Annan Plan and on 12th April announced a ceasefire,"" Hague said in a statement. ""They have not kept either of these commitments."" Hague added that the plan ""cannot be used indefinitely by the regime to play for time. If the Annan plan is not implemented, we will argue for a new and robust U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at compelling the regime to meet its commitments under the plan, and requiring all parties to comply with it."" He continued, ""We do not want to see the Annan plan fail, but if despite our best efforts it does not succeed, we would have to consider other options for resolving the crisis, and in our view all options should then be on the table."" Hague's remarks came as Annan, the U.N.-Arab League joint special envoy, said he was ""gravely concerned"" about reports that fighting between Syrian government and opposition forces had escalated. ""He is particularly worried about the recent shelling in Homs as well as reports of the use of mortars, helicopters and tanks in the town of Al-Haffa, Lattakia,"" Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said Monday in a statement. ""There are indications that a large number of civilians are trapped in these towns."" The statement called for the protection of civilians and demanded that U.N. observers be granted immediate access to Al-Haffa. Nuland said U.S. officials joined Annan in expressing alarm over reports ""that the regime may be organizing another massacre, this time in the village of Al-Haffah in Latakia province, as well as in the towns of Dar Azure (ph), in Daraa, in Homs, in Hama and in the suburbs of Damascus."" She said U.N. military observers had been trying to reach Al-Haffah but had been blocked by government forces. In a note to correspondents from the spokeswoman for the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS), Sausan Ghosheh said U.N. observers reported heavy fighting in Rastan and Talbiseh, north of Homs, with artillery and mortar shelling and firing from helicopters, machine guns and smaller arms. Heavy artillery shelling and machine gun firing were heard and seen over the Homs neighborhood of Khaldiyeh, she said. ""UNSMIS has also received reports of a large number of civilians, including women and children trapped inside the town and are trying to mediate their evacuation,"" she said. An online video purporting to show live images of Homs on Monday showed more than a dozen explosions in an hour. Shells rained on Deir Ezzor province, where eight bodies were found after regime forces raided a city at dawn, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. In southwestern Syria, explosions and gunfire targeted the city of Douma as forces conducted raids and made arrests, the LCC said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported that 25 members of the army and law enforcement as well as one civilian who had been ""targeted by armed terrorist groups while they were in (the) line of duty"" were buried Monday. Over the weekend, the opposition Syrian National Council elected minority Kurdish activist Abdul Basit Sieda to unite dissidents seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Al-Assad defined by indecision, violence . Sieda, a native of Hasaka, Syria, who lives in Sweden, called on officials in Syria, Russia and China ""to think carefully about the situation now because the whole stability of the region -- if not the whole stability of the world -- is at stake here. We would like to call upon them to support the Syrian people."" Russia and China have blocked U.N. Security Council resolutions that many other nations said could have pushed al-Assad to stop the killing. The two countries, which have major trade ties with Syria, said they want more balanced resolutions that call for a cessation of violence on all sides. Russia is viewed as a key ally of Syria. While Western countries have criticized Russia for its arms trade with Syria, Russia has insisted it is not propping up al-Assad's regime. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Saturday there was no alternative to Annan's peace plan, despite evidence that it's being violated daily. ""The situation looks more and more grim,"" Lavrov said. ""For the first time since the beginning of this crisis, we see the question of foreign intervention. And our position remains unchanged. We will never agree to sanction the use of force in the U.N. Security Council."" The United Nations has said at least 9,000 people have died since the crisis erupted in March 2011. Opposition groups, however, say the toll is higher, with estimates ranging from at least 12,000 to more than 14,000. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or violence in Syria, as the government has restricted access by international journalists. Dozens of countries have recognized the Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrian opposition, though many members of the group's leadership are expatriates. Asked how he planned to bridge a gap between the Syrian opposition in exile and the opposition inside the country, Sieda said, ""We are in direct communication and contact with revolutionary forces inside. We are always communicating with them. ... The relationship between us and the forces inside has never been stronger."" But al-Assad has said he will not deal with opposition members influenced from the outside. While Sieda railed against the violence committed by al-Assad's forces, the regime itself announced a new stage in its argument that ""armed terrorist groups"" -- and not government forces -- are responsible for the violence. A program on state-run TV said ""that terrorists of various nationalities from the terrorist organization Jabhet al-Nasra, which is affiliated with al Qaeda, planned and carried out"" bombings in Damascus on March 8. The cars used in the attack were driven by a Jordanian terrorist and a Syrian Palestinian, ""and were trailed by an Iraqi,"" the state-run news agency SANA reported. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Holly Yan, Josh Levs, Salma Abdelaziz, Saad Abedine and Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","Firing from helicopters marks ""a very serious escalation,"" Nuland says .

"(CNN) -- The Soviet-made Mi-8 helicopter turns slowly in the blue autumn sky. It appears to be at an altitude of 3,000-4,000 feet, circling above the province of Aleppo in northwestern Syria. Suddenly, there's a streak of white and then an explosion -- as its engine bursts into flames. Off camera, there are yelps of joy. It is a rare success for the Free Syrian Army: a precious ground-to-air missile has found its target. Trailing black smoke, the helicopter makes a hard landing. It's not known what happened to the crew. In the last week, the rebels claim to have shot down one plane and two helicopters in Aleppo province. CNN's Arwa Damon went to the crash site of the plane Wednesday, and saw chunks of metal being carted off by locals. U.S. still weighing whether to arm Syrian rebels . At least one of the pilots appears to have been found unconscious by the rebels after ejecting from the plane. Videos uploaded to YouTube appear to show the pilot with a bandaged head wound. It's a sign that the rebels are beginning to use the weapons they've seized from military bases to good effect, and are gradually beginning to challenge Bashar al-Assad government's dominance of the skies. Damon reported Thursday: ""The FSA controls vast chunks of territory in Aleppo [province]. In a span of 24 hours they brought down a fighter jet and helicopter and took over a major base"" in the province. ""What was striking driving through Aleppo, and we were not too far from the city itself, was seeing villages and towns that two months ago one couldn't drive through,"" Damon reported. ""They now have children playing in the streets and shops opening."" ""There are some Free Syria Army checkpoints,"" Damon reported. ""This is significant; you see where Assad forces might have been and were but are no longer."" Rebels who recently seized the base of the 46th Regiment some 15 miles (25 kilometers) west of Aleppo told Damon they had captured as many as 300 MANPADs (man-portable air-defense systems), about half of which were in working condition. There is no way of confirming the number. Videos uploaded after the rebels overran the base showed at least 10 large crates of anti-air missiles, each of which would hold two MANPADs. Eliot Higgins, who tracks the Syrian conflict through dozens of YouTube channels on his blog Brown Moses, says that when the rebels capture ""a couple of dozen [MANPADs] it gets exciting; 100 would be quite amazing"" Rebels also showed off captured tanks and artillery pieces, as well as Chinese-made multiple rocket launchers, seized at the 46th Regiment base. As rebels appear to gain ground, Internet shuts down in Syria . Free Syrian Army brigades are producing ""instructional videos"" for handling and arming their newly acquired hardware. One video shows a rebel on a rocky hillside opening a large packing crate, assembling a SA-7. Inside, there are two long olive-green tubes with Cyrillic lettering. Over the next three minutes, the rebel assembles the tube and points it skyward. It is just one of dozens of anti-air missiles or MANPADs that the rebels are thought to have seized. They are mainly Russian-made SAMs -- some manufactured before the young fighters were born. Videos uploaded to YouTube and evidence gathered on the ground suggest most of the MANPADs in rebel hands are SA-7s, which the Russians call Strela 2s. It is hardly state-of-the-art, having been developed in the 1960s. There have also been occasional sightings of more advanced SA-16s in rebel hands, which Higgins says has a much better targeting system than the SA-7. But he notes that often these missile systems lack the all-important grip-stock or battery cooling unit, making them inoperable. Despite the rebels' gradual acquisition of heavy weaponry, much of it is in poor shape and of a certain age. There is no sign that rebel units have been using more advanced anti-aircraft missiles such as the Stinger. The Washington Post reported this week that rebels had acquired some 40 shoulder-fired missile systems in recent weeks, and some had been supplied by Qatar. CNN has been unable to confirm that. But, in October, a diplomatic source told CNN's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson that some rebel groups had a few Western-made anti-aircraft missiles under ""close control."" Even so, the government retains vast superiority in firepower. And opposition sources say it's using that firepower in ever more indiscriminate ways. Syrian rebels down jet, take video of bloodied pilot . Higgins notes from the hundreds of videos he has analyzed that ""rather than deploying all their most powerful weapons at once the air force appears to have escalated the air war."" He says ""L-39s [a Czech-made jet trainer that can also fly combat missions] and OFAB 100-120 bombs [Russian-made fragmentation munitions] appeared after the battle for Aleppo began, and cluster munitions appeared after the Idlib highway was closed."" On Thursday, videos emerged from the city of Aleppo of an airstrike against a neighborhood in rebel hands. They showed the bodies of men, women and children, caked in white dust and blood, being pulled from piles of rubble by frantic rescuers. Above, the top floors of an apartment block have been sheared off, raining lumps of concrete on the street below. Opposition activists estimated at least 15 people were killed. Other videos uploaded by opposition activists this week show the town of Maarat al Numan, captured by rebels in October, enduring a fourth week of air-raids. The town sits on the main highway linking Damascus with the north, an important artery that is no longer under government control. Fawaz Gerges, Professor of Middle Eastern politics and international relations at the London School of Economics, tells CNN: ""I think the opposition is chipping away at the government's position. I think the opposition strategy is a war of attrition to exhaust the government's forces."" After spending several days among rebel fighters, Damon says that ""On the one hand there's a certain sense of anger and frustration with the international community because they feel they have been abandoned. At the same time they haven't lost. They are making major progress and there is a sense of determination and belief that they can do this on their own.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Deputies handcuffed singer Bobby Brown and led him from a courtroom to a jail cell Wednesday morning, as Whitney Houston's ex-husband began serving time for a drunken driving conviction. Although the judge sentenced Brown to 55 days behind bars for his second conviction in a year for driving under the influence, he will likely be free in eight or nine days, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. Good behavior rules and jail overcrowding guidelines add up to a sharp reduction in actual time served for county inmates, Whitmore said. Brown was taken into custody at the Van Nuys, California, courthouse at 9:10 a.m., Whitmore said. Brown's sentence was stiffer because his driver's license was suspended after he pleaded no contest last summer to another charge of driving under the influence, Los Angeles city attorney's spokesman Frank Mateljan said. Brown, 44, spent time in a ""confidential rehabilitation center"" last August as part of his plea deal for the April 2012 arrest. Brown was not in court last month when his lawyer entered his guilty plea on charges of driving under the influence, driving on a suspended license and violating his probation for the earlier conviction. A lawyer for the singer said he has accepted responsibility, and is committed to his sobriety. ""Brown is pleased that the matter has been resolved,"" attorney Christopher Brown said in a statement. The judge imposed 10 days in jail for the drunken driving offense, 10 days for the suspended license conviction and 35 days for the probation violation, according to Mateljan. His probation was extended to four years, Mateljan said. A Los Angeles police officer smelled ""a strong scent of alcohol"" when he approached Brown during the Ventura Boulevard traffic stop last October, a police spokesman said. Brown was arrested after a field sobriety test, the spokesman said. Brown was previously married to Whitney Houston. They divorced in 2007. He has one daughter, Bobbi Kristina, from his relationship with Houston, as well as three other children. Houston died a little more than a year ago. Brown, who has been touring with his R&B group, New Edition, released ""Masterpiece,"" his first solo album in 14 years, last June.","Although sentenced to 55 days in jail, Brown could be free in 8 or 9, a sheriff spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The NFL draft, kicking off Thursday night, will always bring back special memories for me. It changed my life. I was fortunate to be selected in the first round by the Tennessee Titans in 2000. The first paycheck I received was for well over $700,000 and I had just turned 23 years old. This instantly made me the wealthiest person in my family. Starting tonight, hundreds of young men will be anxiously waiting for their phones to ring with an NFL head coach on the other end saying they were just selected to play in the league. That call validates all the hard work and understanding of the game, but it doesn't teach you how to manage the wealth and business decisions that come with it. My agent, the late Gary Wichard, made me well aware in my rookie year that the NFL is a business as well as a game. Gary would always speak about the business side of the game, league operations and the importance of ""not wasting your money."" He never advised me what to do with my money or who I should let oversee my accounts. His main emphasis was on saving as much money as I could so that when I retired I wouldn't have to change my lifestyle. He taught me that the average draft pick, even one who only plays the league average three to four years, should be able to live comfortably for the rest of his life. He might need to work, but doesn't need to settle for a profession he's not interested in. These talks were instrumental throughout my career and still play in my head today. I never felt the pressure of having to buy a big house, multiple cars, a ton of jewelry or everyone in my family a home. I took care of my simple needs -- a townhouse and the car I always wanted. The rest of that money I put directly into my money manager account, where I could monitor my funds until I found someone I was comfortable investing with. Whenever investment opportunities arise, I make sure the pitcher gets vetted by each layer of my team and I insist on a business plan or else we can't talk. This provides a solid form of checks and balances that allows me to make confident decisions when doing business. By making it to the NFL, you have defied major odds and will be rewarded for it. The top players in this year's draft will become instant millionaires and others will make hundreds of thousands with their salary and bonus. It's highly unlikely you will make that kind of money once your playing career is over. Bleacher Report's mock draft . The reality is that no matter how financially responsible you try to be, money will be wasted. It is unrealistic to expect an NFL rookie in his early 20s with equal amounts of testosterone and cash not to spend money recklessly at some point. For most draft picks, popping bottles in night clubs, picking up tabs for expensive dinners and taking friends and family on extravagant vacations becomes very expensive. I have been a part of all these scenarios, but this type of spending isn't generally how players lose all their earnings from the NFL. The majority of financial woes come from untrustworthy financial advisers, family members, poor business deals, second homes and other low-return investments like restaurants, bars, nightclubs and music studios . I have been fortunate to have received terrible financial advice only once causing me to take a loss. This advice came at a cheap price compared to the millions of dollars lost by players I know personally. Unfortunately, the people you should be able to trust the most can be the ones to cause you the most harm. You've got to keep it simple. I would estimate that 60% of the NFL players I've known over my 11-year career have had some type of money issue. I don't mean bankrupt, but they are unable to sustain the lifestyle they should be living after a successful NFL career. Many players never stop for a minute to think about the much smaller paycheck that comes after football. Even if you retire with a few million dollars in your portfolio, the boredom of no longer having a routine will get the best of you. Halfway through my career I got even more serious about educating myself for life after football. The NFL offers business, entrepreneurship and other educational workshops. Bleacher Report's full draft coverage . Right now I am enrolled in George Washington University's Star EMBA executive business program, which builds on the unique experience of individuals with personal brands and creates a customized degree in business education. I also co-host on SiriusXM NFL Radio and do color commentary in Nashville for Titans preseason games with my old teammate and friend, Heisman trophy winner Eddie George, who has already received his MBA. It was extremely important for me to be a student of my finances, business and other interests outside football. It led to the discovery of other interests and opportunities that I am pursuing now that I am retired. Now that I've set myself up financially, my ""simple"" filter has more of a focus on looking for opportunities that will help me continue to learn and grow. My football career gave me that opportunity, to be able to enjoy the rest of my life with financial stability and focus on things I'm passionate about. Thanks, Gary.

"(CNN) -- Police reports that the suspects in the deadly Boston bombings were planning to extend the killing spree to New York barely qualifies as news in our city. New Yorkers have lived through too much, too often, to get jumpy at the prospect of a failed attack by a pair of isolated maniacs. That might seem strange to outsiders, but New York has come to accept its status as the world's No.1 terrorist target -- and defiantly refused to cower or collapse. This is the place, remember, that recently marked the 20-year anniversary of the awful day when Kuwaiti-born Ramzi Yousef drove a rented truck into a parking lot beneath the World Trade Center and exploded a bomb. Six people were murdered, and more than 1,000 injured. With the hindsight of history, we now know the 1993 bombing was, in the words of the FBI, ""something of a deadly dress rehearsal""  for the terrible attack of 9/11 that destroyed the twin towers. But it was also a wake-up call to federal investigators, who uncovered a vast, frightening plot to wreak havoc in the city. In 1995, a jury convicted 10 men -- led by blind, Egyptian-born Omar Abdel Rahman -- of conspiring to bomb the United Nations, two major tunnels and a bridge, along with a federal office building. Had the plot succeeded, it could have killed countless thousands of innocent people. Ever since then, New York and federal authorities have been on a high alert that has never relaxed. New York is where the first Joint Terrorism Task Force was created in the 1980s; it combines personnel from different federal, state and local law enforcement agencies under the same roof to minimize conflicts and confusion in the effort. Year after year, New Yorkers have grown accustomed to press conferences featuring the FBI, customs officials, New York police and other agencies revealing startling plots to bomb bridges, subways, airports, banks, synagogues and other targets. In 2009, a tip to the task force broke up a ring that was planning to bomb the subways. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad was arrested less than three days after trying to explode a car bomb in the middle of Times Square. In 2011, a man named Jose Pimentel was arrested on terrorism charges in a plot to bomb various sites around the city (his trial is pending), and in 2012 a Bangladeshi-born student named Quazi Nafis tried to detonate a bomb in front of the New York Federal Reserve Bank (he pleaded guilty and now faces a life sentence). But even with one scary plot after another, New York has set record high numbers for tourism and residents. One of the most thriving neighborhoods, in fact, is the area near the World Trade Center, where a new, taller tower is nearly complete. One reason for the confidence of New Yorkers is the extraordinary visibility and ingenuity of the New York Police Department. For example, officers are permanently stationed at the entrances of the city's major bridges and tunnels, and police frogmen dive into city rivers every day, checking the bases of the bridges for bombs. Police regularly stage anti-terrorism drills in which dozens of officers from all over the city are directed to converge quickly on a central spot, a practice run to minimize confusion if they need to swarm into an area during a real attack. And the New York police have officers stationed in 11 cities around the world, tasked with tracking international anti-terrorism efforts and going to the scene of terrorist attacks. Their job, in the words of Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, is to ask ""the New York question"": What can we learn that will shed light on possible dangers in the city? The international team also directly relays information back to the New York Police Department intelligence division. So when Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a press conference to announce that the Boston Marathon bombing suspects were planning to travel to Times Square to cause further mayhem, New Yorkers pretty much shrugged it off. To an extraordinary extent -- and with good reason -- the city considers itself on permanent alert, with a high level of vigilance that is our best protection.

"Berlin (CNN) -- Insurers in Germany are not obligated to pay for Viagra or other sexual performance enhancing drugs, the country's federal social court has ruled. The decision Tuesday stemmed from the case of a man with multiple sclerosis who insisted his insurance company reimburse him for the cost of treating his erectile dysfunction, a potential side effect of the neurological disease. But the court ruled that insurers have no responsibility to pay for any ""quality of life"" drugs and that an insurer's refusal to do so was in no way discriminatory, even if the person in question suffered from an incurable disease. During the proceedings, defendants cited reforms to the country's health care system that were pushed through in 2004, under which insurance companies were exempt from paying for medication that primarily treated ""quality of life"" conditions. The list included medicines for treating impotence.","A court has ruled that insurers don't have to pay for sexual performance enhancement drugs .

"Washington (CNN) -- For Amanda Ihnat, a millennial and a conservative, Sen. Rob Portman's change of heart on supporting same-sex marriage was a much-needed â€” albeit tardy turnaround. For fellow conservative Peter Konetchy, a baby boomer, the Ohio Republican's switch signals a decided lack of principles. The two divergent views illustrate the kind of challenges facing the Republican Party as it undergoes a major makeover after losing the 2012 presidential election. The party is trying to figure out how to embrace and capitalize on the youthful energy of young members like Ihnat while not alienating long-standing members like Konetchy. Last year, a poll by the Pew Research Center found the percentage of Republicans between 18 and 29 who opposed same-sex marriage dropped to 30% from 48% in 2004. Among those 50 to 64, the percentage also dropped, but less dramatically -- 78% to 68%. ""Slowly, we are seeing a movement among some that identify as conservative that same-sex marriage is going to become a reality down the road,"" said Craig Rimmerman, professor of public policy and political science at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and author of ""From Identity to Politics: The Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States."" ""They are realizing that there are other issues that are much more important to them worth fighting,"" he said. ""Younger people who consider themselves conservatives just don't care. And these younger conservatives are more concerned with the state of the economy and whether they are going to have a job when they come out of school."" CNN Exclusive: One conservative's dramatic reversal on gay marriage . The generational split was especially stark at the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside of Washington on Friday. Some younger conservatives like Ihnat warmly greeted the news that after Portman's 21-year-old son, Will, told his parents that he was gay, Portman came to the conclusion that same-sex marriage ""is something that we should allow people to do."" Ihnat said that as a college student, she has a ""liberal stance"" on the issue. ""I think it is great for someone to come out and say they are in support of gay marriage. ... The party kind of needs to be more welcoming and involved, so I think it is a good step."" However, many older Republicans didn't share Ihnat's sentiments. ""I think it means that he has no principles, to be honest with you,"" said Konetchy, 58. ""He can support his son and love his son, but you have (to decide) something is either right or wrong."" Nationally, polls have shown growing support for same-sex marriage. A recent survey from Quinnipiac University found that 47% of those polled support same-sex marriage while 43% oppose it. The poll also indicates a wide partisan divide on the issue with Democrats supporting same-sex marriage at 65%, Independents 50% and Republicans 23%. Same-sex couples can now legally marry in nine states and the District of Columbia. The president and the nation have evolved on same-sex marriage . ""We've grown up with gay men and women being out of the closet. We have gay friends. It's not as shocking as it is for boomers,"" Amy Holmes, a CNN political contributor and conservative commentator said recently. ""Older conservatives recognize that a lot of younger conservatives are more socially liberal."" An upcoming, internal report by the Republican National Committee is expected to point to the wide popularity gap between Democrats and Republicans with women, minorities and young votersâ€”three critical voting blocs that helped President Barack Obama win re-election. The report comes as the U.S. Supreme Court considers two politically charged same-sex marriage cases. One involves the federal the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman and was supported by Portman. The other appeal involves a California law banning gay marriage. But when it comes to same-sex marriage, the Republican Party will still face opposition from many members. ""These latest, sudden changes in opinion are classic examples of caving in to political pressure,"" Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, said in a statement. Portman called fellow Ohioan and House Speaker John Boehner to inform him of his revised position according to a Boehner spokesman. ""Senator Portman is a great friend and ally and the speaker respects his position, but the speaker continues to think that marriage is between a man and woman,"" said Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman. Top Republicans sign brief supporting same-sex marriage . Hours after Portman announced that he had reversed his position on same-sex marriage, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he would not second-guess him. But he's not entirely embracing Portman's change of heart, either. Portman told CNN's Dana Bash that he wanted all of his children to experience the ""joy and stability of marriage"" that he and his wife have had for 26 years. This includes ""our son, who is gay."" Will Portman tweeted Friday that he is ""especially proud of my dad today."" Gingrich acknowledged on CNN's ""Starting Point"" that when an immediate family member reveals that he or she is gay, there are typically three responses. ""You can say, 'I believe my principles so much, I'm kicking you out.' You can say, 'I still believe in my principles, but I love you.' Or you can say, 'Gee, I love you so much, I am changing my principles,'"" Gingrich said. ""Rob picked the third path. That's his prerogative."" The former presidential candidate stands by his own belief that a marriage is between a man and a woman, and argued the traditional definition will stay in place ""no matter what politicians"" do. ""I don't think they have the power to change what is a religiously inspired definition,"" Gingrich said. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, a social conservative who ran for president in 2012, said Portman's about-face was personal and doesn't reflect the party's broader direction on social values. ""I'm not too sure the rationale behind what Senator Portman's doing is something that has broad application to the base,"" Santorum told CNN. ""The fundamental principles that attach to the institution of marriage really haven't changed as a result of that personal story. We need to look at what's right, what's right for the American public and more importantly, what's right for children. So we need to try and fight for those things."" Rimmerman said it will be up to younger conservatives who support same-sex marriage to help change views within the GOP. ""It's going to take younger conservative voters to send a message to their party elders that that message is unacceptable,"" he said. Some on the right, however, applauded Portman's decision. Gregory T. Angelo, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, said in a statement ""if there was any doubt that the conservative logjam on the issue of civil marriage for committed gay and lesbian couples has broken, Senator Portman's support for the freedom to marry has erased it."" ""(His) evolution on this issue highlights how personal it is for Americans -- whether they're the junior senator from Ohio or your next-door neighbor, all Americans have a gay friend, colleague or family member, and understand them to be as deserving as their straight counterparts of the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that are the promise of the United States,"" Angelo continued. CNN's Steve Brusk, Ashley Killough, Dan Merica, Paul Steinhauser Shannon Travis and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Some conservative millennials more accepting of same-sex marriage, polls, experts say .

"STANLEY, North Dakota (CNN)  -- Herb Geving unleashes a broad smile in his 11,000-square-foot mansion. The former cattleman, farmer and owner of a North Dakota garbage business is now retired, able to count the dollar signs brought in by three oil wells. Herb Geving worked his whole life, but says oil changed his life. ""You don't have to work at all."" ""Oil,"" he says, ""it's amazing. You don't have to work at all. You just walk to the mailbox and there it is."" The 74-year-old grandfather receives whopping checks at the end of every month for the oil. He'll never forget the time the first check came in January. ""Thousands, I guess you'd call it,"" he says. Geving chuckles when asked if it was for $2,000. Was it closer to $10,000? ""You can keep going up and up and up,"" he says from his home, decked out with a massive fire pit in the living room, semi-circular leather couch and bright orange shag carpet. He had worked on the home for more than 40 years. Now, he's expanding it -- just because he can.  Tour the mansion, meet Herb Geving » . Stanley, North Dakota, might seem an unlikely boomtown located in the northwest part of the state about 50 miles from the Canadian border. But the town is teeming with activity -- all thanks to rich oil deposits sitting deep below the surface. The town has grown from 1,250 people to more than 1,600 since the start of the year, says Mayor Mike Hynek. The oil has brought better paying jobs, raised real estate values and spawned millionaires.  Watch North Dakota town strikes it rich » . ""Practically everyone is being affected by it,"" Hynek says. It's not uncommon to hear stories of 20-year-olds with no job experience getting hired to work in the oil fields with starting salaries of $70,000 a year. Gary Dazell makes more than $100,000 a year hauling water to and from the oil fields. ""The oil field has blessed us,"" he says. Then, there are stories like Geving's where locals suddenly come into a fortune for owning the mineral rights. Geving says he's amassed so much money that 70 relatives will get sizable sums when he dies. The town sits in an area known as the Bakken Formation, a vast region below North Dakota, Montana and a portion of Canada that the U.S. Geological Survey says contains between 3 billion and 4.3 billion barrels of oil.  See a U.S. map of the Bakken Formation » . ""The continual amount of oil in North Dakota is three times as much as Texas,"" says Kevin Frederick, a geologist in the region. ""We're doing as much as we can to try and get it out."" Mayor Hynek says the region is so flush with oil that it's nearly impossible for an oil well to come up dry. Standing in the middle of a downtown street, he says, ""I'm fairly certain that if they drilled a well here, they'd have oil."" ""There's oil down there. No doubt about it,"" he adds. ""They just need to perfect how to get it out.""  Watch ""I never imagined this"" » . It's always been known there was oil in the region, but it wasn't always cost effective to drill for it or the technology wasn't good enough. When oil was cheap overseas, it also was easier for a company to import it, rather than explore for it, experts say. But that's all changed with high oil prices. Better drilling technology, some good oil finds in the area and the political push for oil exploration in the United States has spurred the boom here and in smaller nearby towns. ""I think we can be a positive impact for the whole country if we can figure this out,"" Hynek says. But the boom comes with a cost. The mayor says roads -- many of them gravel -- weren't built to sustain huge equipment being hauled to and from the fields; the town's one hotel is completely booked; and an RV trailer park is overflowing. Houses are hard to come by too, with the average price jumping from around $30,000 to about $100,000 in the last three years. ""We have a real housing shortage at this time. But eventually, it'll be OK,"" Hynek says. ""It's a good challenge. It's better than going the other way."" ""My biggest concern today is making sure our infrastructure is adequate for the growth that we'd like to maintain."" Nearby, at Joyce's Cafe, the topic of oil is thick as the coffee served at the communal gathering spot. Farmer Robert Western worked in the region's oil fields 48 years ago, but back then the boom never came. Soon, a well will be going on his property.  Watch farmer in field: ""I don't think it will change our life"" » . He never thought five decades ago he'd have an oil well of his own. ""I'd have said you were crazy. It wouldn't come to pass,"" he says, peering out from a weathered black baseball cap. He says if they find oil, it won't change him. He's lived frugally all his life, a survivor of the Great Depression. ""It's just kind of difficult to change a pattern of living,"" he says, adding he'd love to take a trip around the world and donate money to charity. Farmers Sheryl and Roger Sorenson spoke humbly too of the possibility of finding oil -- that in some cases a well brings in $2,000 a day depending on how much is found. They say they'd straighten out their finances; enjoy more free time; help children and take family members on a trip to Disneyland or Disneyworld. ""We're old enough now so we don't have great desires for bigger and better,"" Sheryl Sorenson says.  Watch oil is ""a gift"" » . Roger Sorenson says he thinks of all the old timers who lived hard-scrabble lives for decades but missed the modern-day boom. ""They always had the hope, but it never came,"" he says. ""It's kind of sad for them because they went through life and never got it. And now, it's coming."" As for Geving, he says when he was a boy, kids carried eggs and milk buckets, and people worked their ""tails off."" Now, he's building a brand new home for his foreman and his family of five. Geving -- who's nicknamed Jed Clampett by the locals after the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" character --  likes driving out at night to get a closer look at the wells. He said the wells stand for ""success. I'm glad I'm able to help my family."" What's he think of when he looks at the oil wells? ""Money,"" he says. ""I can't get tired of that. ... I just grin all the way to it and back."" CNN's Gregg Canes and Traci Tamura contributed to this report.","Stanley, North Dakota, becomes oil boomtown where a water hauler can fetch $100K .

"(CNN) -- For more than a year, Chris Bayer, a Canadian student, waited tables alongside Chinese migrant workers in a restaurant in Shanghai. While there he received an intimate glimpse of what work life is like for millions in mainland China. ""Nothing was ever really clear,"" said Bayer, who is now back in Canada. ""In the West, people state their mind. In China, there was no sharing of ideas. When it came to new processes, no one ever offered any input. There was no teamwork. People were so afraid of doing something wrong."" Though Bayer's circumstance in China was rare -- a foreigner working alongside migrant workers in local eateries is not common -- his experience in a Chinese workplace is one that experts say is common. Whether a restaurant or a massive company, businesses in China revolve around perplexing power structures, where innovative thinking is often stymied, partly by an education system that prioritizes rote memorization over creative thinking, and partly because employees are afraid of offering input that might insult the intelligence of their boss. ""It is still pretty much a hierarchical culture when it comes to office politics,"" said Helen Zhang, author of ""Inside the Chinese Mind: A Guide on How Chinese Think"" who believes that Chinese workplace culture is deeply rooted in Confucianism, an ancient philosophy centered on obeisance to authority. ""If you are in line with the boss and present a creative business plan, you can bypass a lot of the bureaucratic stuff,"" said Zhang. ""On the other hand, if you are not in that line of power, even if you have creative ideas you will not be able to gain access, so in a way that is limiting creativity in all parts of the company because of the hierarchical nature of the organization."" Regardless of whether or not the Confucian tradition continues to impinge China's ability to transition its economy to one based on innovation rather than manufacturing, office culture in the country is changing. More multi-national companies have established branches in the country and tech-savvy young Chinese are exposed to international norms via the internet. Most who work in fields related to management studies in China say that offices are becoming more democratized with traditional power structures fading away where employees are equals and ideas can be shared and criticized openly. ""It is difficult to tell how fast it is evolving,"" Han Jian, an associate professor of management at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said. ""We need to first define with what group of employees."" The group of employees who appear to be the most influential are those born in the 1980s and 1990s. According to Han members of China's ""Generation Y"" are less loyal to their employers, are seeking jobs that are fulfilling and are seeking to become a part of something bigger and more meaningful. ""Not only the white collar workers, even blue collar workers, they are expecting more fair status, more learning opportunities. They want their supervisors to be more advisors rather than just a boss,"" Han said. ""Performance evaluation has been over-focused on growth, an emphasis on the results and the numbers instead of the process,"" she said. ""As a result, people have been treated as human resources, which is not a very good term to refer to people. If you focus too much on growth, you ignore the relationship side of the team, the softer side of people. Many companies are trying to adjust to this problem."" Adjusting to this problem means finding leaders who break from the status quo and can foster a new culture of ""empowerment and trust-based management,"" said Elisa Mallis, an executive coach at Management Development Services Ltd. in Beijing. ""The older managers, the command-and-control style management, that was in the past,"" she said. ""Organizations are looking for creativity and innovative thinking, and these younger employees are thirsty to be providing that. The trick is how to have a culture to unlock that creativity. There is a catching up that needs to be done. Catching up is a possibility, but we can't expect it to happen overnight."" In Zhongguancun, a technology hub in Beijing, it does seem that change has happened almost overnight. Only a couple of years ago, debates especially among foreign executives and investors working there complained of the dearth of innovation and lack of skilled entrepreneurs in China. Now there are more start-ups than ever, with some growing into major companies with operations overseas. A number of these new businesses as well as big Chinese internet companies, like Baidu, China's top search engine, say they have been directly influenced by the open, collaborative work environments pioneered by the likes of Google and Yahoo. Yet while the two U.S. tech giants have had a major affect on IT companies in China, they have suffered their own well-publicized failures in the country because of what many have said was an inability to adjust to local cultural norms both in business and in office politics. ""We did learn a lot from Silicon Valley companies,"" Mike Li, senior director of business development for Happy Elements, a Chinese social gaming company that has grown from six employees to more than 500 and operates internationally. ""The management style changed and had to change. Now we need to respect every single employee because they are aware they are the top talent in the industry.""","Office life in China typically dominated by complex power structures .
Obeisance to authority comes from Confucianism, says experts .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A group representing international companies in China has warned members that police in Beijing, Hebei and Shandong have required international firms to purchase Internet monitoring devices or risk having their connections cut. The Quality Brands Protection Committee (QBPC), a group aimed at safeguarding intellectual property rights in China, sent an email to its 216 members late last month warning of the police visits, saying it ""would cause serious concerns from our members."" The emailed alert, copies of which were provided to CNN, raise particular concerns for international businesses operating in China because many companies often use private networks that allow employees to skirt China's so-called ""Great Firewall"" of censors. But, based on the QBPC alert, it appears firms in some areas are being asked to install a device within their private systems to track all internet activity-- and that information must be made available to police, looking for ""illegal activity."" ""It has come to our attention that three of our QBPC members reported that local police units in Beijing, Hebei and Shandong approached them, forcing two members to purchase Internet security software from the police designated suppliers,"" wrote Ron Davis, chairman of the QBPC membership services committee, in the email obtained by CNN. ""Reportedly, if they failed to do so, the police threatened to cut off their Internet connection and fine them."" Another QBPC member company received a questionnaire from the local police unit asking about its Internet security measures, according to the QBPC email. ""Given that if the local PSB (public security bureau) initiative were carried forward, it would cause serious concerns from our members, we are attempting to determine if any of our other 200-plus member companies have faced this same situation or know other member companies who have,"" Davis wrote. The email doesn't detail which companies were targeted. The QBPC membership represents a broad swath of international firms with operations in China, including technology companies like Apple, Nokia and Emerson, consumer product makers such as Anheuser-Busch, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, and automotive companies Toyota, Audi and Volkswagen AG. Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, is also a member. Davis has confirmed that he sent the email obtained by CNN. A spokesperson for QBPC said, so far, the group has received 15 replies from its members. Three member companies were asked by police to install internet logging equipment and two reported police requests to inspect their internet security measures. The others reported no contact from police. QBPC wouldn't name the members who were approached. ""The three companies are in different industries,"" the spokesperson said. ""Based on the members' response, it seems the police visits are isolated incidents."" QBPC has reported the incidents to the Ministry of Commerce and ""had informal discussion with various departments of the MPS (Ministry of Public Security)."" Thomas Parenty, an information security specialist and former employee of the U.S. National Security Agency, said the devices could be used to spy on foreign companies and creates industrial espionage concerns. ""From an information security perspective, something like this in place in a company's network could be used for exploratory attacks into the network itself,"" Parenty said. ""It's a Trojan horse that fits in a computer rack. ""If you're concerned about IP (intellectual property), you might as well roll up your tents because it's essentially game over,"" Parenty said. Copies of Shandong province police orders provided to CNN require companies to purchase the equipment from one of two equipment providers, Netbox Info-Tech and Shanghai Pronetway. Shanghai Pronetway could not be reached for comment. When CNN called Netbox's sales center in Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, a man who identified himself as Zhao-- but declined to give his full name or position-- said the company is cooperating with the Shandong Public Security Bureau and providing devices to cities around the province. Zhao said many Chinese companies have received police notifications and have purchased the equipment, including a number of foreign joint venture companies, but he declined to name them. The Shandong order notes that businesses ""are often used to disseminate pornography and superstitious information, online fraud and gambling, or used by hackers to jeopardize national security and people's interests."" Companies reached by police ""must install the Internet Security Censor Managing System, and connect with the Public Security Bureau's server and make sure all the data collected is uploaded accurately to PSB's system so the PSB will be able to prevent and control the illegal information,"" the order says. International companies aren't the only ones in the spotlight. The Beijing police order includes government offices, clubs, hotels and company offices. CNN surveyed Chinese companies in a neighborhood surrounding Tianhua Road Police Station in Beijing, one of the stations that issued the Internet surveillance order. Staff members at the Beijing Jin Jiang Fu Yuan Hotel told CNN that they were told by police to purchase Internet monitoring equipment. An owner of a photo studio in the area said in June she was asked to attend a police meeting on Internet security, but was not asked to purchase surveillance equipment. Shandong and Beijing police didn't respond to interview requests. Police in Heibei and Changsha, which have issued similar orders, also didn't respond to CNN interview requests. CNN also contacted China's Minister of Public Security, which oversees local police departments nationwide and has a role in internet security. They said they had received faxed questions from CNN and would look into it. Word of the Internet monitoring order comes as China prepares for its 18th National Congress of the Communist Party, scheduled in the latter half of this year. Beijing will select its new party leadership to guide the nation forward. The country has seen public security officials step up moves against dissent ahead of the congress, such as the summer crackdown on illegal expatriates living in Beijing, closure of web sites and the suspension of China's major microblogging sites for several days earlier this year. The sites closed were ""punished for allowing rumors to spread"" of a coup attempt in Beijing, state-run media reported at the time. The rumors spread after the shocking March dismissal of Communist Party politburo member and Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. His wife, Gu Kailai, was found guilty of murdering a British businessman and received a suspended death sentence on Monday, though she'll likely be jailed for life. Three years ago, international businesses and Chinese netizens led a successful fight to stop content filtering software ""Green Dam Youth Escort"" from being required on all computers sold in China. International chambers of commerce and other trade groups decried the filtering plan, which was marketed as a means to protect young online users from pornography, but criticized for leaving businesses vulnerable to cyber attacks. In 2000, the government stepped back from laws restricting importation of encryption software that would have banned Web browsers such as Microsoft Explorer, which include encryption functions. In 2004, the government backed down on developing its own wireless Internet standard when Intel threatened to ban sale of its chips in China as a result.

"(CNN) -- Costa Rica's appeal against its recent 1-0 defeat by the United States played out in a snowstorm has been blown away by soccer's global governing body FIFA. The Costa Rican Football Federation complained to FIFA following last week's 2014 World Cup qualifier in Colorado, which was played in blizzard-like conditions. Costa Rica argued the markings on the pitch were not visible, while also suggesting the snow affected the ""physical integrity"" of the players and hampered the movement of the ball. But the protest has been dismissed by FIFA on the grounds that Costa Rica failed to follow official regulations in its protest, meaning the U.S. team's first win of the North and Central American and Caribbean qualification competition is secure. Pedro's Point of View: Juventus Europe's dark horses? ""FIFA received a letter via email from the Costa Rica FA on 24 March 2013 with regards to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier played on 22 March between USA and Costa Rica,"" said a FIFA statement. ""FIFA has examined the content of the letter and, taking into consideration article 14, paragraph 4 of the 2014 FIFA World Cup regulations, has confirmed that the conditions established in the regulations for an official protest have not been met by the Costa Rica FA. ""Therefore, the result of the match played on 22 March stands and is considered as valid."" The Costa Rican federation had also called for the officials at the match at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City to be sanctioned. The win was vital for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who had come in for criticism following a 2-1 defeat to Honduras last month. The victory lifted the U.S. into second place, behind leaders Honduras. The U.S. face another huge match on Tuesday against southern neighbors Mexico in Mexico City. The Americans first ever win in Mexico came in a friendly match last August. The top three countries from the group will qualify directly for next year's tournament in Brazil, while the fourth-placed team will play off against the Oceania group winners New Zealand. Costa Rica are bottom of the North, Central America and Caribbean group with just one point.","FIFA rejects Costa Rica's appeal over 1-0 defeat to United States .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Cathay Pacific, the world's largest carrier of air cargo, will stop shipping unsustainably sourced shark products in a move marine conservation groups characterized as a big step forward in efforts to protect the animals. ""We believe that we now have compelling evidence that the majority of shark fishing is incompatible with our position on Sustainable Development,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement. ""Due to the vulnerable nature of sharks, their rapidly declining population, and the impacts of overfishing for their parts and products, our carriage of these is inconsistent with our commitment to sustainable development,"" the airline said. The ban will apply to Cathay Pacific and its subsidiary Dragonair, both major players in the transport of air cargo to Hong Kong and China. Shark's fin soup remains a popular delicacy for weddings and banquets within China. In order to obtain these fins, fishermen catch sharks, cut off their fins and throw the sharks back into the water to die. More: China plans banquet ban on shark fin . Environmentalists say this wasteful practice puts several shark species at risk of extinction. An estimate 50% of the shark fin trade comes through Hong Kong. Stanley Shea, from the marine advocacy group Bloom Association, believes Cathay Pacific's move sends a message to other Hong Kong corporations. They are ""showing other corporates they understand the issue and making change happening in Hong Kong."" The airline says it will take three months to implement the new policy, but it will stop accepting any new contracts immediately. More: Shark fin off the menu at top hotel . Cathay's decision came after the airline received a July letter from more than 40 international environmental organizations, requesting it set an ""aggressive timeline"" to stop carrying shark's fin. In the letter, the group estimated Cathay Pacific carries between 20-50% of all the air cargo trade in shark's fin. Shea said they are also targeting the shipping lines, which are still responsible for carrying the majority of shark products worldwide.","Cathay Pacific will stop shipping unsustainably sourced shark products .

"(CNN) -- Two mayors and two state legislators are among 11 public officials arrested in New Jersey as part of a corruption investigation, the U.S. attorney's office in Trenton announced Thursday. Passaic Mayor Samuel Rivera  is among 11 officials arrested Thursday in a corruption probe. Prosecutors say the state officials accepted cash bribes -- ranging from $1,500 to $17,500 at a time -- from insurance brokerage and roofing companies and in return awarded the companies with public contracts. ""To those officials engaged in corruption or thinking about corruption, I will want to tell you you need to think again,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Weysan Dun during a news conference Thursday. ""Those who think they can abuse the positions of trust they've been put into to line their own pockets need to think again,"" he said. ""Those who think they have found some clever way to conceal a bribe or believe that the nature of their bribe is insignificant need to think again. There is no safe haven for public corruption,"" Dun said. State Assemblymen Mims Hackett Jr. and Alfred E. Steele -- both Democrats -- and Passaic Mayor Samuel Rivera are among those arrested. Steele also is undersheriff in Passaic County, just outside Newark. Hackett is also mayor of Orange.  Watch who is involved » . Also arrested were Keith O. Reid, the chief of staff to the Newark City Council president; Passaic Councilman Marcellus Jackson; and former Passaic Councilman Jonathan Soto. Five current and former school board members in Pleasantville, just outside Atlantic City, were arrested: Jayson G. Adams, James T. McCormick, James A. Pressley, Rafael Velez and Maurice Callaway, who also is on the City Council. A private citizen, Louis Mister, was caught in the sting as well, officials said. ""In most cases, the defendants sought to establish and perpetuate a corrupt relationship with the cooperating witnesses to continue receiving bribes,"" a statement from the U.S. attorney's office alleged. Steele, Hackett and Rivera are charged with accepting bribes totaling $15,500, $5,000 and $5,000, respectively, for arranging insurance brokerage contracts in New Jersey. Steele was also allegedly promised a 15 percent cut of the insurance brokerage business, Hackett an additional $25,000 payment and Rivera a $50,000 payment to an offshore bank account. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 20 years in federal prison. Steele's and Hackett's offices declined to comment after the arrests. The Newark City Council president's office issued a ""no comment"" in response to Reid's arrest. According to the criminal complaints against the officials, the FBI set up a phony company to persuade the suspects to do business with them. Covert recordings were apparently an integral part of the investigation, as the criminal complaints quote or paraphrase each official -- some at length -- about what they were willing to do to help the fake company, what they expected in return and the importance of keeping the arrangements hush. For instance, Reid allegedly coached a cooperating witness on how to surreptitiously accept bribes, warning him not to ""let a lot of people in the kitchen"" and adding, ""You need a buffer or something,"" according to the criminal complaint. The complaint against Soto states the councilman often spoke in code when talking to cooperating witnesses in the case, once sending a text message in November 2006 about an anticipated bribe: ""Any word on that cake?"" The following month, Soto allegedly sent a text message to another cooperating witness, saying ""Will need that green broccoli for the 1st entree,"" according to the complaint. Rivera allegedly was more overt, according to the complaint against the Passaic mayor. He often boasted of how he could snare council votes ""easy, easy, easy,"" the complaint says. The complaint also states that when a ""key employee"" of the city questioned him about the phony company's presentation, Rivera allegedly warned him, ""I make the [expletive] decision, and the council. And believe me, I've got the four [expletive] votes on the council. So let's stop [expletive], and let's get this thing rolling."" The probe began in mid-2006, ""amid evidence of corruption in the Pleasantville School District,"" according to the statement. ""In response, the FBI established an undercover insurance brokerage company purporting to employ the government's two cooperating witnesses and undercover agents,"" according to the U.S. attorney's office. Pleasantville school board members allegedly accepted thousands of dollars in bribes from the cooperating witnesses, the release stated. The Pleasantville school board members also referred undercover agents to public officials in northern New Jersey, who accepted bribes as well, according to the release. The northern New Jersey officials referred the undercover agents to ""still other corrupt public officials,"" the news release stated.

""I don't think I'm much different than Medal of Honor recipients Sergeant First Class Petry and former Staff Sergeant Giunta and feeling conflicted with this medal I now wear.

Romesha said he accepted ""this tremendous honor on behalf of all soldiers who have served with me that day."" ""This award is for the eight soldiers that didn't make it and for the rest of the team that fought valiantly and magnificently that day.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Helena Hesayne used to be an architect, but she gave up her successful career for her passion: looking after mistreated animals. It is not a popular cause in her native Lebanon, a country still healing from years of civil war. Here, unemployment, poverty and political stability are more pressing concerns for most people. Hesayne, 47, is a vice president of a shelter on the outskirts of Beirut for 250 animals that have survived abandonment and cruelty. Among the animals she cares for are Burni, a dog who survived being doused in gasoline and set alight, Savana, who was dumped from a car and then hit by another car, and Corra, a Labrador who was shot in the face. Her shelter once even took in a lion cub, which had been living on bread and dirty water in an abandoned building. Hesayne cries as she explains why these animals had to come before her career, but says she has no regrets. ""I left my career for that,"" she said. ""I care because that's the only thing I care about. There is no more nature in Lebanon. It's all about money. And animals are ... they give me everything."" Her organization, Beirut for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or BETA, has looked after more than 1,500 dogs, cats and other animals since it opened in 2004. ""It started with passionate women who were feeding cats and dogs on the streets, and they met around a garbage bin and they decided to join forces and to help,"" said Hesayne. Also on Inside the Middle East: Lions, tigers become problem pets in the Gulf . Now it risks losing its temporary shelter in a smart district overlooking Beirut because of complaints from neighbors. ""We have villas behind us and they are suing us. They want us out,"" said Hesayne. ""Now we have to find a land. The problem is nobody wants to have dogs around them."" Hesayne and her colleague Sevine Zahran have lobbied the Lebanese government to increase its animal-protection laws. Lebanon is one of a few countries not signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), making it an easy transit point for wildlife smugglers, and it has few domestic animal-protection laws. Zahran, a social-affairs volunteer at BETA, said she has met government officials a few times but found they had different priorities. She agrees that there are many other priorities in Lebanon, but believes animal rights and human rights go hand in hand. ""Humans are a priority and animals are also a priority,"" she said. ""We cannot forget about something if there's something else going on in the world. She added: ""Studies show that animal abuse is very, very extremely related to human abuse."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Saudi foodies ditch fast food for fine dining . Zahran and BETA would like to see more education about animal abuse. ""A lot of things are not ethical in treating the animals in Lebanon -- we see all kinds of abuse,"" she said. ""What we witness on an everyday basis is very hard to share. I try to educate and raise awareness among the people."" BETA has begun a pioneering program with Oumnia, a charity for sick and disabled children, to introduce dogs to young patients. Dogs from BETA are taken into Oumnia's center in an attempt to help boost the children's self confidence and independence. Marie-Gabrielle Phares, vice-president of Oumnia, said: ""We had some children who didn't speak at all and with the dogs they really started to manage and to speak ... and to speak to others and to play. It was fantastic really. I think dogs therapy is a very good thing for children.""","Beirut for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has cared for more than 1,500 cats and dogs .

"(CNN) -- Gareth Bale has enjoyed an astonishing season -- but the Welsh wing wizard faces a nervous wait to find out whether he will be back in action any time soon. Tottenham star Bale injured his right ankle while going in for a challenge with Basel's David Degen on a frustrating night for the home team as it came from two goals down to rescue a 2-2 draw in the first leg of its Europa League quarterfinal. The 23-year-old has enjoyed an outstanding season, scoring 22 goals in 38 appearances for a Tottenham side chasing a place in next season's Champions League. ""It shouldn't be as bad as it looks on the image,"" manager Andre Villas-Boas told the BBC after still television pictures had shown a painful looking blow. ""There is a big, big possibility if we stay positive that he will be fit for the Man City game (on April 21) and it will only take him out of two games."" ""We still have a big squad and the ability to adapt (without Bale). ""We just have to play against Everton (at the weekend) and see when these players get back to make us even stronger."" Bale's injury capped a frustrating night for Tottenham, which failed to produce the kind of performance its fans had been expected. Not since 1984 has the club won a European trophy -- on that occasion it defeated Anderlecht over two legs to win the now defunct UEFA Cup. But any thoughts supporters might have had of reaching the final in Amsterdam were well and truly shattered as Basel started at breakneck speed. Swiss champion Basel, which knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League in 2011, grabbed a 30th minute lead when Valentin Stocker fired home from close range after Marco Streller's effort had hit the post. With White Hart Lane stunned into silence, Basel took full advantage with Fabian Frei heading home just four minutes later. Tottenham, currently third in the Premier League, hit back before the break when Emmanuel Adebayor poked home with Gylfi Sigurdsson's deflected effort ensuring the game finished level. Across London, Fernando Torres scored twice as Chelsea claimed a 3-1 win over Russian side Rubin Kazan at Stamford Bridge. The Spain striker, wearing a face mask to protect his broken nose, opened the scoring on 16 minutes before Victor Moses added a second to give Rafael Benitez's men a measure of control. Bebras Natcho's penalty reduced the arrears, but Torres plundered another goal after the break to seal the win. ""It's good for his confidence,"" Benitez told ESPN following Torres' double. ""His work-rate was really good. I'm pleased for him. I have said before, he's training well. It was a question of time. ""He scored two goals today and hopefully it will be the same in the next game."" Elsewhere, Benfica came from a goal down to claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle at Estadio da Luz. Newcastle grabbed a 12th minute lead through Papiss Cisse and almost extended its advantage further only for the same player's strike to crash against the post. Benfica hit back when Rodrigo lashed home from close-range following a mistake by Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul. But the visitor continued to threaten and the post once again denied Cisse much to the frustration of manager Alan Pardew. That frustration was increased when a defensive error by Davide Santon allowed Lima to fire Benfica in front with 25 minutes remaining before Oscar Cardozo rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot. ""If we'd taken 2-1 you'd like to think we'd have a fantastic chance but it's an uphill chance now,"" Pardew told ITV4. ""I think the away goal could come into it if we get the first goal (in the second leg). If we can get the first goal we only need one more. ""They are a quality side and we have to give them respect, but we showed tonight if we are ambitious we can hurt a team."" In Turkey, Fenerbahce scored twice in the final 12 minutes to claim a 2-0 win over Italian side Lazio. Pierre Webo and Dirk Kuyt were both on target for the home side in Istanbul, which proved too strong for a Lazio team forced to play with 10-men after Ogenyi Onazi was shown the red card three minutes after the break. Meanwhile, Barcelona confirmed it has lodged a formal complaint with UEFA following the performance of German referee Wolfgang Stark during Tuesday's 2-2 Champions League draw at Paris Saint-Germain. The La Liga leader was unhappy that the official failed to stop play during the quarterfinal first leg tie while Javier Mascherano and Jordi Alba were both left prostrate following a collision in the penalty area. ""The club has written to UEFA due to a series of incidents on the pitch in the understanding that objectively speaking it was evident that the referee did not apply the rules of the game,"" Barca spokesman Toni Freixa told a news conference Thursday. ""When two players from the same team are on the floor the referee should stop the match, which did not happen. ""What's more he then obliged them to leave the pitch, in contravention of the rules. ""An incident that is sufficiently serious in a competition like the Champions League to bring to UEFA's attention so that it does not happen again."" Barca also made public its annoyance at the failure of the officials to rule out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's strike, which came with the forward in an offside position. The Swede's 79th minute effort, which made the score 1-1, was fiercely contested by the Barcelona players. ""We are fully conscious of the possibility of errors in refereeing and we do not consider ourselves badly treated,"" Freixa said. ""But it surprises us that in a high-level competition a referee does not know the rules. ""We are not judging the work of referees but the basic principle that a judge should know the law. We hope it does not happen again.""","Tottenham's Gareth Bale suffered ankle injury in 2-2 draw with Basel .

"(CNN) -- Do you know the mascot for South Dakota State? Can you come up with the all-time record for No. 16 seeds? How about the starting backcourt for the Michigan Wolverines? No? Well, to prepare you for Selection Sunday and the three weeks of March Madness, here is an A to Z primer on the NCAA Tournament that will cap a wildly unpredictable season in college basketball. A is for Anyone, which is pretty much who can claim the NCAA title. That doesn't mean you should pick Liberty -- which brings a 15-20 record into the tournament -- in your office pool. But unlike one year ago, when Kentucky was heavily favored from the start of the season, there are a dozen teams that can legitimately say they have a chance to clip the nets in Atlanta in three weeks. B is for Big East, which is splitting into three directions next year. The seven Catholic members are retaining the name and plan to add a few other top basketball schools. Syracuse and Pittsburgh are joining the Atlantic Coast Conference next season. And the remaining schools are combining with several newcomers to form a yet-to-be-named conference. Will the league that gave us Patrick Ewing and Villanova's upset and the three Connecticut championships go out with one last hoorah? As usual, it will have a lot of chances, with as many as eight members in the field of 68. C is for Creighton, and if you're looking for a reason to pick the Bluejays in your office pool, look no further than Doug McDermott. The junior forward is the second leading scorer in the nation with 23.1 points a game. D is for Duke, which will be looking for its fifth national title under Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski -- and might be favored to get it. The Blue Devils went 27-4 despite missing center Ryan Kelly for seven weeks. Kelly scored a career-high 36 points in his return against Miami, the league's regular season champion. If the Blue Devils were good without him, imagine what they might do with him. E is for Eagles, which is the mascot for a lot of teams, of course, including NCAA Tournament newcomer Florida Gulf Coast. The Fort Myers, Florida, school was established in 1991 and had its first classes in 1997. The Eagles didn't make the full transition to Division 1 athletics until 2011, in fact, so their arrival on the national stage this soon might be most surprising. F is for Fuller, and that's what the F in Stephen F. Austin stands for. Austin was known as the ""Father of Texas,"" and the college that bears his name is back in the tournament for the second time after winning the Southland Conference with a 26-3 record. Bleacher Report: NCAA Bracket 2013 Predictions . G is for Golden Eagles, the nickname for Marquette. They tend to fly under the radar in the Big East, but once again colorful head coach Buzz Williams had them tied for the regular-season title. It seems like a matter of time before he takes this program back to the Final Four. Is this the year? H is for Harvard, and after ending a 65-year NCAA Tournament drought last season, the Crimson is back in the field again. ""I just feel like the basketball gods have been on our side,"" Crimson player Christian Webster said, and Harvard might need them: The Ivy League has a 31-59 record in the tournament since 1957. I is for Indiana, and this year, the mighty Hoosiers have stormed back on the national stage under head coach Tom Crean. They are the second in the nation in scoring at 80.8 points a game, led by sophomore forward Cody Zeller at 16.8 points and 8.1 rebounds. Will that mean a Final Four trip? If so, it'll end an a long drought for one of the most loyal fan bases in the sport: The Hoosiers have just one Final Four appearance (2002) in the past 20 years. J is for Jackrabbits, and while they do not normally inspire fear, if the matchup is right, they could make noise as a higher seed. South Dakota State is in the tournament for the second straight year. K is for Kentucky, the defending national champs and most prominent bubble team in years. Are the Wildcats in? Or are the Wildcats out? Unless they win the SEC Tournament this weekend, they'll be sweating out the selection show in Lexington. (Our guess: They're in -- barely.) L is for Louisville, that other national power in the Bluegrass State. Can the Cardinals keep the NCAA title in-state? They're certainly on a roll. They entered the Big East Tournament with wins in 10 of their last 11 games, and that single loss was to Notre Dame -- in five overtimes. Bleacher Report: Projecting Cinderella Teams That Will Make a Deep Run . M is for Michigan, and if you're wondering why the Wolverines are back in contention for a national title, look no further than the backcourt. Trey Burke is a national player of the year candidate averaging 19.2 points and 6.8 assists a game, while Tim Hardaway Jr. adds 14.8 points and 4.7 rebounds. N is for Notre Dame, and if you see the Fighting Irish in the tournament field, you're probably going to wonder: What are they wearing? Adidas has provided several teams, including Cincinnati, Kansas and UCLA, with outfits that the Wall Street Journal described as ""the wrong kind of crazy."" You'll have to see for yourselves. Just don't stare for long. O is for Orange, and Syracuse is back in the field under head coach Jim Boeheim, as usual. But how many more years will the 68-year-old Boeheim, who won his 900th game, keep coaching? ""I never think about the next season until after the season,"" he said at the Big East Tournament, ""because during the season I want to quit every single game, even when we win."" P is for Porter, as in Georgetown forward Otto Porter, the Big East Player of the Year. Porter is one of the best stories in college basketball, a 6'8"" forward from a small Missouri town who had never stepped on an airplane before visiting the school's Washington campus. Can he lead the Hoyas their first title since 1984? Q is for Quixotic, which has been the quest for Quinnipiac to take its quintessential place as the Q in the A to Z. Come on, Bobcats. Get it done! R is for Rameses, the horned mascot for North Carolina, who will be making an appearance this tournament after all. It didn't look good for the perennial power Tar Heels for much of the season, but a six-game winning streak late in the season should ensure that head coach Roy Williams' team is back in the field. S is for Sixteen, and if you're an amateur bracketologist, you know that no No. 16 seed has ever won a game in the NCAA Tournament since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Is this the year of the upset to end all upsets? ""I think this is the year that a 16 could possibly beat a 1 for the first time,"" Louisville coach Rick Pitino said. Before you make that pick in your office pool, remember: The 16s are 0-112 all-time in the tournament. T is for triple digits, and if you're wondering how a James Madison team that is 234th in scoring, 254th in rebounds, 253rd in assists and 240th in field-goal percentage made the tournament field, well, that's March. The Dukes got hot and won the Colonial Athletic Association Tournament. U is for UCLA, which will be back in the field during the 75th anniversary of the NCAA Tournament. Sports Illustrated recently ranked the top 75 players in tournament history, and Nos. 1 and 2 belonged to the greatest dynasty in its history: Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton. V is for Valparaiso, a Cinderella of old that's back in the tournament for the first time since 2004. The Crusaders are coached by Bryce Drew, who hit the remarkable buzzer-beater to stun Ole Miss in the 1998 tournament. His father, Homer Drew, was the coach that year, and his brother, Scott Drew, coaches Baylor. Bleacher Report: Breaking Down Top Sleeper Teams to Watch . W is for Western Kentucky, back in the NCAA Tournament field, and while its stay might not last long, its lovable amorphous mascot Big Red will have a chance to make One Shining Moment montage that airs after the national title game. And that is where he belongs. X is for Xavier, which is in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament after reaching the field in 11 of the last 12 seasons. The Musketeers, who reached the Sweet 16 a year ago, are 17-13 this season in the Atlantic 10. Y is for Youth, and as usual, plenty of young stars are on the top teams. Marcus Smart was voted Associated Press freshman of the year for leading Oklahoma State back to the NCAA Tournament after a two-year absence. Shabazz Muhammad (UCLA) and Ben McLemore (Kansas) are two other talented rookies to watch this year. Z is for Zags, the unofficial nickname of the Gonzaga Bulldogs, and that won't be a typo in your bracket. Once a plucky underdog, they are expected to be one of the No. 1 seeds when the field is revealed. Will they prove the selection committee was right with a run to their first Final Four? That will be determined over the next three weeks. That's what makes this tournament so much fun.","The NCAA Tournament brackets will be revealed on Selection Sunday, March 17 .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Friday ordered a North Carolina teacher to remain in custody until her trial over an alleged plot to behead witnesses who testified against a would-be terrorist. Nevine Aly Elshiekh was arrested with Shkumbin Sherifi on January 22. Just nine days earlier, the man they were allegedly in collusion with -- Hysen Sherifi, who is Shkumbin Sherifi's brother -- was sentenced to 45 years in prison for being part of what prosecutors called a ""violent jihad"" that had conspired to kill people overseas and kill a federal officer. A criminal complaint alleges that Elshiekh and the Sherifi brothers tried to pull off a plan to ""murder and behead"" three people who testified against Hysen Sherifi at his trial last year. Facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Elshiekh is on leave as director of special education at the Sterling Montessori Academy in Morrisville, North Carolina, a Raleigh-Durham suburb. The man listed in court documents as her lawyer, Charles Swift, did not immediately respond to messages Friday for comment. A longtime friend of Elshiekh's said the charges don't reflect who she is. ""It's hard for me to imagine that she could be involved with anything crazy or shady. She's not the type of person to get involved in stupid stuff,"" Sahar El Shafie said. ""Anyone who knows the woman would tell you no way. It's so out of character for someone who is a special education teacher."" Prosecutors said Hysen Sherifi -- a native of Kosovo who is a U.S. legal permanent resident in North Carolina -- and as many as eight others were part of a homegrown terrorism ring between 2006 and 2009. In Hysen Sherifi's case, officials say that involved taking part in paramilitary training and conspiring to attack U.S. military service members and their families at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. He was arrested in 2009 and convicted in October of conspiring to kill a federal officer or employee, plotting to kill people overseas, conspiring to provide material support for terrorism and two firearms charges. According to the 10-page federal complaint, confidential informants told the FBI that Hysen Sherifi expressed a desire to hire someone to murder three witnesses who testified against him during his federal trial. He also targeted an inmate who he believed had ""defrauded"" him out of money concerning his federal charges, documents state. ""During conversations ... he wants photographs taken, and provided (to) him, of the dead bodies and severed heads,"" an FBI special agent in charge noted after reviewing recordings between Hysen Sherifi and an informant. ""Sherifi, in sum and substance, explained he wants the witnesses to completely disappear so they cannot testify against him, and others, at any future trials."" The complaint said that an informant was told to use the photos depicting the decapitated bodies to ""convince other potential witnesses not to testify against him, or his co-conspirators, at future proceedings."" Elshiekh visited Hysen Sherifi in a North Carolina jail in December, at which point Sherifi gave her a message to pass on to someone else, the criminal complaint states. In subsequent months, she had repeated contacts with the jailed man, his brother Shkumbin Sherifi and the FBI's informants. Then, in January, Elshiekh allegedly gave an informant $750 as initial payment to kill one of the intended victims. Shkumbin Sherifi gave the same informant the other $4,250 of the agreed-upon fee, the complaint states. A Raleigh, North Carolina-based group called Our Ummah, One Body is urging people not to make assumptions before hearing all sides of the case. ""Allegations are not facts,"" the group said on its website. ""Facts are not known yet. As a community, we have known good from both. We remind the Muslim and non-Muslim community members that, according to the law, both are presumed innocent until proven otherwise.""

"(CNN) -- It's not easy being a Chechen. The family of Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bombers, have, like all their ethnic kin, led lives marked by violence and deportation. Chechnya is a small land in the Caucasus mountains that was one of the last places to be conquered by the Russian empire in the 19th century. Chechens are also Muslims. In February 1944, Joseph Stalin added them to his list of ""punished peoples,"" whole ethnic groups who were deemed disloyal to the Soviet Union and subjected to wholesale deportation. Every Chechen -- man, woman and child -- was packed into freight cars and shipped to the freezing steppe of Soviet Central Asia. The republic of Chechnya was erased from the map. Around a quarter of the 400,000 deported Chechens died in the process. It was only 13 years later, after Stalin's death, that they were miraculously forgiven and allowed to return home. But some, including members of the Tsarnaev family, stayed on in places like the republic of Kyrgyzstan. Fifty years later, in 1994, the year after Dzhokar Tsarnaev was born, the Russian government unleashed a new wave of violence, sending in the army to crush a turbulent independence movement in Chechnya. The Russian defense minister of the time predicted it all would be over in 24 hours. Ten years later, after two savage wars, the Chechen city of Grozny was in ruins, tens of thousands of Chechens were dead and many more in exile once again. From 2002, Chechen extremists began to wage terrorist acts against Russian civilian targets, most horrifically against a school in the town of Beslan, where nearly 300 people were killed. The region is outwardly much more quiet now, but a low-level Islamist insurgency continues in and around Chechnya that takes dozens of lives each year and is mostly out of the headlines. The two young Tsarnaev boys were the children of the war generation, displaced from their homeland, growing up as a reviled Muslim minority. In their biographies we can see some typical characteristics of Chechen life. Where are Chechens from? Not the Czech Republic . The first is the migrant life. Maybe one-fifth of Chechnya's pre-1994 population of 1 million has fled to different parts of the world, the vast majority of them to various European countries. A second is an aggressively macho culture. Chechnya has a warrior tradition and many Chechen males and their fellow Muslims from the Caucasus seek to compensate for discrimination by excelling in martial arts. Tamerlan and Dzhokar took up boxing and wrestling respectively. A third characteristic is that, as refugees from a misunderstood minority group associated with ""terrorism,"" they apparently found solace in the Islamic Internet, the multiplicity of devout or jihadist websites that linked them with similarly alienated Muslims around the world. What makes these two different is that their alienation turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Resentful of being labeled terrorists, they apparently turned to terrorism. What also differentiates the two brothers is that, unlike most Chechen migrants, they ended up in the United States. Most of the refugees who end up in this country see it as a safe haven. But in this case, a virulently anti-Western streak appears to have followed the two into exile, or caught up with them here. Opinion: What we know about Chechnya . In Chechnya, Russian Cold War suspicions fused with militant Islamic rhetoric. Chechnya's first pro-independence president Dzhokhar (or Jokhar) Dudayev was a Soviet general turned Chechen nationalist who hated NATO as much as he did the government in Moscow. In the 1990s, at the height of post-Cold War rapprochement, ordinary Chechens blamed Washington for turning a blind eye to President Boris Yeltsin's war against them. More recently, the local warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, whom Moscow has installed as leader of Chechnya, implausibly blames the West for backing the jihad against Russia. Members of a wandering wounded generation, the Tsarnaevs seem to have been all-too-typical Chechens in the tribulations of their lives, but one-offs in the way their journeys ended. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas de Waal.","Tom de Waal: Boston suspects are Chechen, a minority group that has suffered under Russia .

Suspects lived a typical Chechen life of migration, he says, part of a macho culture .

"(CNN) -- Audiences will be getting a new look at Abraham Lincoln this weekend with the wide release of director Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" and they'll be seeing a lot of America, too. The film, which recreates the former president's life through the crucible of the Civil War, was filmed at several historic locations. Lincoln's life took him through a number of states before and during the war, which gave Spielberg and his crew a wide geographic canvas. It was while shooting ""War of the Worlds"" in Rockbridge County, Virginia, that Spielberg began discussing returning to the state, said Andy Edmunds, interim director of the Virginia Film Office. Edmunds worked with production designer Rick Carter for nine years, helping him scout locations across the state. Yet there is so much more to Lincoln than the movie that bears his name. For history and film buffs looking to explore Lincoln's life, here are five locales that go beyond a trek to the National Mall. DON'T watch these 11 movies on a plane . City Point: Hopewell, Virginia . One of Spielberg's Virginia stops was City Point, now Hopewell, which served as Ulysses S. Grant's headquarters during the Siege of Petersburg. Lincoln spent two weeks there in 1865 with his family, traveling aboard the war ship River Queen, which filmmakers replicated in full, said Rita McClenny, chief executive officer of the Virginia Tourism Board. From there, Lincoln watched the fall of Petersburg, later visiting the city, which was also shot on location, Edmunds said. Indeed, many pivotal wartime decisions ""were made on Virginia soil,"" McClenny said. Tailing James Bond: 007 destinations . Capitol Square: Richmond, Virginia . Filming in Richmond was a win-win for both the state and the filmmakers: Spielberg dressed up Richmond's capitol building as its national counterpart, and he used the capitol square as a sort of backlot for more than two weeks, Edmunds said. Tourism officials, in turn, organized city tours, turning the location shoots into opportunity. While filming, locals consumed the star sightings. A local restaurant even debuted a salad named after one of the movie's stars: the Sally Field of Greens. Did co-star Tommy Lee Jones really eat at Bistro Bobette? Yes, and fans can too, McClenny said. With any luck, they'll sit in his seat. Old State Capitol and Lincoln/Herndon Law Offices: Springfield, Illinois . Springfield, Illinois, was the nucleus of Lincoln's career, political and otherwise, before he headed to Washington. It was there in 1858 that he gave his ""House Divided"" speech. It's also home to the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln worked as a legislator, and to the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices. Both sites are crucial, according to Dave Blanchette, public information officer at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, the former because ""it looks as though the General Assembly just met there yesterday rather than 150 years ago."" Adding to the historical sense visitors get while touring, it feels now as it felt then. But Lincoln was also a lawyer for 25 years, ""longer than anything else in his life,"" Blanchette said. The law offices -- the only of their kind, as no other buildings remain where Lincoln practiced law -- provide a necessary perspective on the president's professional experiences. New Salem State Historic Site: Petersburg, Illinois . Lincoln spent some of his most formative years growing up in New Salem, Blanchette said. And the township is at the heart of the ""log cabin"" image that has crystallized around the 16th president. The site was recreated in the 1930s and '40s using the remaining foundations. ""You can stroll through the log village and try and imagine what life would have been like in the 1830s,"" Blanchette said, which lets visitors experience a period when Lincoln transformed himself from a ""young man with no real direction in life"" to someone with ""purpose and a vision."" Abraham Lincoln Birthplace: Hodgenville, Kentucky . The president's birthplace is ""literally the first memorial of any kind of Abraham Lincoln,"" said Bill Justice, superintendent of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Park, which has its origins in an early 20th-century project by the Lincoln Farm Association. The park, designed by John Russell Pope years before he began work on the Jefferson Memorial, includes two sites: the Memorial Building, which stands on the farm where Lincoln was born in 1809, and his boyhood home at Knob Creek. It was at his boyhood home that Lincoln formed his earliest memories, Justice said, such as planting pumpkin seeds between the farm's corn rows. At Knob Creek, visitors get a more hands-on idea of what those early years were like: The field is ""pretty much unchanged,"" Justice said. A favorite activity of his at the park is visiting the creek. ""The best thing to my mind, it gives me goose bumps when we go over there, is to stand there,"" he said, ""and look down on the field and contemplate that you're pretty much looking at what Abraham Lincoln saw.""

"Washington (CNN) -- James Freudenberg had a reputation as a safety-conscious helicopter pilot. But when he prepared for a medical flight in August of 2011 -- while simultaneously engaging in a private text conversation -- he set into motion events that led to the deaths of four people, including himself. His actions could re-write the rules on when pilots can send private messages or make personal phone calls. Federal safety officials on Tuesday blamed Freudenberg's crash in Mosby, Missouri, on fatigue, training, and, distracted texting. To the amazement of safety officials, Freudenberg evidently sent several text messages with one hand while flying the helicopter with the other. But those text messages in the air -- which ended 19 minutes before the crash -- turned out to be less consequential than text messages he sent and received while on the ground. Investigators believe Freudenberg engaged in an extensive text conversation with a colleague about dinner plans while he was conducting mandatory pre-flight checks of his helicopter. Because of those distractions, Freudenberg missed two opportunities to detect that his helicopter did not have sufficient fuel for his mission, investigators said. When Freudenberg finally noticed his fuel was low, he was half-way through the first leg of his flight. He arrived at the hospital, picked up the patient, and looked for an alternate, closer destination to refuel. But his 13-minute stop was again disrupted by a private text conversation, and he took off after miscalculating that he could reach his destination. The LifeNet helicopter ran out of fuel a mile short of the destination -- within sight of the Midwest National Air Center. The copter crashed into a pasture in mere seconds, killing Freudenberg, the patient he was transporting, and two medical personnel. The National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday the crash illustrates that the dangers of distractions are found on the ground, as well as in the air. The board voted to send a Safety Alert to pilots warning them about the hazards of texting during the planning and pre-flight stages. And the NTSB is recommending the FAA prohibit the non-flight-related use of portable electronic devices while in flight and during safety-critical planning operations on the ground. The standard would significantly expand the FAA's so-called ""sterile cockpit rule,"" which prohibits pilots from engaging in non-flight-related conversations during take-offs and landings. In the Freudenberg crash, Freudenberg and a colleague exchanged 85 text messages during a 12-hour shift. A lot took place as Freudenberg prepared the helicopter for the flight, the NTSB said. ""It is easy to imagine that some of these interruptions could have led to forgetting of steps, including checking the fuel level, performing the preflight,"" said Bill Bramble, an NTSB aviation expert. Investigators determined the engine had run out of fuel, but that the fuel gauges were working properly. Freudenberg apparently misled his company's communications center that he had adequate fuel for the mission, radioing from the hospital that he had 45 minutes of fuel when he had only 30 minutes. Asked by NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman if Freudenberg could have been mistaken, investigators responded, ""We do not believe so."" Freudenberg, a former Army helicopter pilot who served in Iraq, had worked for the company just under a year, and probably wanted to avoid revealing that he had taken off with inadequate fuel, which is a violation of FAA regulations, investigators said. The NTSB said other factors leading to the crash included the pilot's inability to perform a crucial flight maneuver known as autorotation after he ran out of fuel. In the helicopter he was flying, the pilot must transition to autorotation in two seconds to avoid a crash. The investigation found that the autorotation training the pilot received was not representative of an actual engine failure at cruise speed, which likely contributed to his failure to successfully execute the maneuver. And the pilot likely was fatigued, having failed to take advantage of his adequate off-duty hours to get sleep, the NTSB said. One NTSB member voted against the proposed safety alert, saying it diminished other alerts. ""This will be looked at by the (aviation) community as an overreach,"" said member Earl Weener. ""It doesn't make sense."" To read a synopsis of the NTSB report .","Medical helicopter crashed in Missouri in 2011, killing pilot and three others .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It would be news enough in itself -- the departure of one of business education's brightest young stars to the private sector -- but Joel Podolny's announcement that he is to stand down as dean of the Yale School of Management carries a wider impact. Back to school? An Apple store in downtown Munich, Germany . Podolny, still only 43 and credited with helping applications to the school rise by 50 percent in his four-year tenure, is leaving to become the first ever dean of the so-called Apple University. The computer and tech company has yet to say exactly what Apple University is -- an Apple spokesman called it only an ""exciting new project"" -- but many people assume it is likely to be an in-house executive education and training facility for employees. If confirmed, Podolny's move highlights the way in which increasing numbers of corporations set up their own ""corporate universities,"" designed to provide tailor-made training to staff. According to one academic study of the phenomenon, by 2001 there were already around 2,000 corporate universities around the world. These are not necessarily intended to replace MBAs or EMBAs at traditional business schools. They tend instead to be far more narrow in focus and specifically geared to the individual needs of the corporation in question. And yet, corporate universities have increasingly borrowed ideas and methods from business schools, a trend which with Podolny's departure has now apparently extended to poaching staff. Podolny was seen as a hugely successful dean for Yale, overseeing a revamp of the school's curriculum as well as a notable boost to its reputation. In an email to staff and students announcing his departure, Podolny spoke of his regret but said he had long harbored a passion for all things Apple. ""While there are many great companies, I cannot think of one that has had as tremendous personal meaning for me as Apple,"" he wrote. ""I remember writing my first computer program on an Apple II, remember pulling an all-nighter to watch the Laserwriter (attached to my 128K Mac) print my undergraduate thesis at seven minutes per page."" So what will the former professor of economic sociology, who was at the Stanford and Harvard schools before Yale, be doing at Apple? The Yale Daily News quoted unnamed Apple ""company insiders"" as saying Podolny would mastermind executive education programs within the computer company. This would not be a first for Silicon Valley. While the most famous corporate universities have been in industry and the service sectors, most notably the 47-year-old Hamburger University, which has trained generations of McDonald's managers, technology firms have taken this idea a stage further. Animation film studio Pixar -- where Apple boss Steve Jobs was formerly CEO -- runs a huge range of courses for staff at its own corporate university. Pixar University is intended to teach more than just the nuts and bolts of modern day computer animation, but to inspire employees' creativity with a wide range of classes, more than a dozen a week, which staff are permitted to miss work to attend. ""We offer the equivalent of a B.A. in fine arts through our courses,"" says Pixar University's dean, Randy Nelson.","Joel Podolny, dean of Yale School of Management, is to step down .
He is to head ""Apple University"" at the tech firm of that name .

"Washington (CNN) -- Thieves must have something against Justice Stephen Breyer. The Supreme Court confirms the 73-year-old justice's Washington home was burglarized earlier this month. It follows a February incident in which Breyer, his wife and a guest were robbed in his Caribbean vacation home by a machete-wielding intruder. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said no one was home during the May 4 burglary, which was discovered by a housekeeper. No court-related materials were stolen from the residence in the Georgetown section of Washington, Arberg said, but she could not say what else may have been taken. Breyer had no comment on the latest incident, which was first reported by the Washington Post. Police on the island of Nevis had earlier arrested and charged a local man for the separate armed robbery of the vacationing Breyers. The justice, his wife Joanna, and another guest were in the couple's second home February 9 when an armed man broke in and robbed the occupants of about $1,000. Officials said no one was hurt in that incident, either. The male assailant fled the scene, according to Arberg. The robbery was reported to local authorities shortly after it happened. Nevis is part of the West Indies chain known as the Leeward Islands, located about 350 miles southeast of Puerto Rico. The court does not talk publicly about specific security arrangements for the justices, either when they are at home or on their frequent travels. The court building is protected by a special Supreme Court Police force. The U.S. Marshals Service provides protection for members of the high court when they are traveling domestically. The justices return to public session Monday morning to release orders and opinions. Breyer was nominated to the high court in 1994 and is known as one of the most active and engaging members of the court. The couple also owns a home in the Boston area -- where Joanna Breyer works as a clinical pediatric psychologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute -- as well as another vacation property in western New Hampshire.","The May 4 burglary occurred when no one was in Breyer's Washington home .

"(CNN) -- When I saw the headlines about Sean Hannity getting into a shouting match with a Democratic congressman this week, I assumed the combative and conservative Fox News host had just gone off on him. I was wrong. Hannity was trying to conduct what we in journalism call an interview. But from the first words out of his mouth, Rep. Keith Ellison came prepared to pick a fight. It was good television, I suppose, but it's hard to say it was enlightening. Ellison began insulting Hannity from the get-go, Hannity pushed back, and the pugilistics were under way. After I criticized Ellison in an online video, Fox-bashers, Hannity-haters and others started with the nasty tweets. But it was Ellison, not Hannity, who had started throwing verbal punches. Said one tweet: ""Even psychotic liberal Howard Kurtz thinks Keith Ellison was out of line with Sean Hannity."" (For the record, I consider myself reasonably sane.) Go look at the video and decide for yourself. I've never been shy about criticizing Hannity for mangling the facts or spouting the GOP's talking points. But in this case, he wasn't at fault. This wasn't a situation where both sides were engaged in an argument that grew more heated. Watch: Why media are savaging Marissa Mayer over Yahoo work policy . Why would the Minnesota lawmaker launch a premeditated assault? Perhaps it's good politics for a liberal Democrat to force a confrontation with Hannity. He can brag to his base about beating up on one of Fox's most popular pundits. In fact, at least one liberal group is already trying to raise money off the incident -- another example of how unbridled partisanship can be profitable. Ellison told me: ""I stood up to Sean Hannity because of what the sequester will mean for millions of Americans who have already been forced to work harder while they get by with less. If these devastating cuts in the sequester go into effect at the end of this week, three-quarters of a million jobs will be lost. ... ""I have constituents in Minnesota who will lose their jobs because Republicans in Congress are unwilling to close loopholes for yacht owners. The president is not being an 'alarmist in chief' or 'President Panic' when he talks about these cuts; he is leading."" Watch: Why Sean Hannity wasn't a 'yellow journalist' in face-off with congressman . A person close to Ellison, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, told me that the congressman allowed Hannity to get under his skin because he felt the host had taken President Barack Obama's words out of context. Here's how it got going: Hannity had played a series of brief clips of Obama and began with this highly partisan comment: ""If and when the Obama sequester takes effect on Friday, it's because the president is more concerned with fear-mongering than finding a solution to the problem that he himself created."" No sooner did he tell Ellison, ""Welcome back, sir,"" than the congressman took, shall we say, vigorous issue with Hannity's opening. ""Quite frankly, you are the worst excuse for a journalist I've ever seen,"" said Ellison, who then accused him of ""yellow journalism."" Hannity's not a journalist, he's a commentator paid for his conservative opinions, but let's not quibble. Ellison was getting revved up again when Hannity tried to make a factual point. ""What the president said was dead-on accurate, and for you to say the president is to blame here is ridiculous. I was there August 2011 when the Republicans, your party, which you shamelessly. ..."" Watch: Did White House e-mail really threaten Bob Woodward? Hannity interrupted: ""I'm not a Republican, let me correct the record."" ""You are nothing but a Republican,"" Ellison said. Hannity got out that he is a conservative, not a registered Republican, whereupon Ellison accused him of being ""a shill for the Republican Party."" Hannity -- who does carry the party's water most of the time -- allowed Ellison to go on for a couple of minutes. Then he tried to ask a question and the congressman repeatedly talked over him. That is pretty much how it went for the rest of the segment, with Ellison at one point calling Hannity ""immoral."" Ellison accepted the invitation to come on and then showed more interest in name-calling than having a dialogue. Watch: Overreaction? Conservatives rip Michelle Obama's Oscars moment . The shout fest was, perhaps, a microcosm of what's become of our media and political dialogue. There is so much noise in Washington that those who want to break through sometimes feel compelled to keep boosting the decibel level. Debate is reduced to each side yelling at each other rather than engaging on the issues. How different was the Hannity/Ellison clash than House Speaker John Boehner telling the Senate to ""get off their ass"" and pass a budget? Obama and the Republicans have kept hurling accusations of bad faith at one another until the automatic budget cuts that both sides once deemed unthinkable loomed. The thinking seems to be: If there's no possibility of compromise, why not just take potshots and try to win the news cycle? Most cable news anchors and political players don't descend to that level. But can anyone deny that the media have contributed to a coarsening of the political culture? Hannity, who finds new reasons to attack Obama every day, is hardly the poster boy for bipartisanship. But in this instance he did invite a politician with liberal views and attempt to be civil. Maybe they both end up benefiting from standing their ground against a fierce opponent. But it's viewers who lost out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Sean Hannity-Keith Ellison dust-up made for good TV .

"(The Frisky) -- We were laying side by side, both face deep in our iPhones -- checking our email one last time before going to sleep, setting our alarm clocks for the next morning, basically saying goodbye to the day. I turned to him, his face lit by the tiny screen, and watched him scroll through his Facebook newsfeed. ""Anything exciting?"" I asked. ""My cousin really loves Drew Barrymore. Check out the exclamation marks."" ""Should we change our relationship status?"" I asked, as if that were the natural follow-up. We had only been dating for two months, but we had been writing partners for seven months, so it felt like a perfectly normal and logical next step to broadcast our love on Facebook. Plus, we had both been single for the past three years and had never had a little graphic heart next to our names. This was going to be fun. ""Um,"" he started to mutter. The Frisky: 10 biggest dating mistakes on Facebook . Oh no. Not another guy who didn't want to claim me. I had been engaged to a man, who upon proposing, told me he wanted to ""wait to feel joy"" before getting me a ring. A year and a half went by -- no ring, and apparently no joy. ""What? You don't want people to know you have a girlfriend?"" I asked, sitting straight up in bed. ""No, Kimberlee, that's not it. It's that I don't have anything up right now. No personal information whatsoever. I'm not listed as single or anything. So it seems weird to change it."" ""I'm listed as single,"" I said in a hands-on-hips kind of way. ""That's not good,"" he said, thinking about it for a second. ""OK, let's do it."" Just like that. He clicked on his personal information and answered all the prompts. There were two options. He could choose: ""in a relationship"" or ""in a relationship with Kimberlee Auerbach."" If he wanted to put me down as his girlfriend, I would have to approve. That seemed fair. ""Done,"" he said, turning to me. ""Now you."" The Frisky: 25 guys types who are hot, but why? I tried to log in, but every time I did, it logged me out, in true buggy iPhone fashion. He jumped out of bed and brought in his laptop. ""We're doing this,"" he said and handed it to me. I followed the same prompts, and voila we were an Internet couple! I started to laugh. ""So, that just happened."" ""Let the commenting begin,"" he said, and kissed me goodnight. I figured I might get one or two ""likes,"" maybe a comment here or there, but when I woke up in the morning, I had six thumbs-up and four comments with smiley faces and tons of exclamation marks, trumping his cousin's love for Drew for sure. By the end of the day, I had 21 ""likes"" and 13 comments. Wow. I was not expecting that. I switched over to his page and saw that no one had commented on his relationship status change. Not one person. Not one ""like."" Weird. People commented on his posts and updates all the time. I really didn't understand. I checked back the next day and he had one comment from an old teacher: ""She must be very special to merit this announcement."" Hmmm. Interesting. I liked that she was happy for him, but it still seemed weird that no one else had hopped on the ""YAY!"" bandwagon. The Frisky: Travel as a couple without killing each other . A few days later, we were eating quinoa pasta, when I turned to him, and asked, ""Can you believe everyone's crazy response to my relationship status change?"" ""Well,"" he said, ""You are beloved."" ""So are you,"" I insisted. He grinned and nodded in concession, as if I had just won a popularity contest. ""I really think it's because I'm a woman."" I really did think that. Men aren't told they're not going to be OK without a girlfriend or wife. If they're still single, no matter what age, it's considered socially acceptable, cool even. I tried to look at the facts. We had both been single for the past three years. Check. He is 32. I am 37. OK, that's a big difference. Being a 37-year-old woman definitely has its pressures, not only from overactive, pleading ovaries, but also from random old ladies. ""So, are you dating anyone? You know you should really think about freezing your eggs."" He sure didn't have anyone telling him what he should do with his sperm. I guess the biggest difference between us is that I survived a broken engagement. But I was the one to break it off, so it was more of a victory than defeat. I had gotten to the point where I truly, in my heart, knew I would rather be alone for the rest of life than to be with a man who didn't want me. It was a hard transition though. I went from sleeping in on Sundays with someone wrapped around me, to not being able to go to bed until four in the morning from anxiety about what my life was going to look like. But slowly that changed. I started to enjoy my time alone. I liked being able to have my out-of-town girlfriends spend the night on the couch in old-school, slumber party fashion and that I could go to the movies and sit wherever I wanted and that I could visit my family without having to worry about someone else being bored or stressed out or having nothing to say. It was just me and myself, and I loved it. I had even come to peace with the fact that I may never get married or have children. Sure, I wanted that, but I could find ways to love in the world. I started counseling 8th grade girls. I had tons of friends. I had a lover here and there. I was going to be just fine. So, why was everyone so over-the-moon happy for me? The Frisky: Celebrity ""Groomzillas"" I could look at it one of two ways. I am a loving person and friends were happy that I had finally found someone to really love me back. Or, whether people admitted it or not, they felt relieved that I was no longer alone, as if everything were going to be OK now, because, for as far as we've come, there's still the underlying belief that a woman needs a man to be complete. I am certainly happy to have a boyfriend I love and who loves me back, but honestly, I would have preferred if friends and family had celebrated my Facebook single status with the same gusto. Learning to love being alone is hard, and, in my opinion, is worth way more ""likes"" than an added ""heart"" next to your name. Too bad there isn't an icon that indicates: ""I'm single, just went to a yoga class, bought some flowers, and feel really good about myself these days.""

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- A former Kaufman County, Texas, justice of the peace -- whose home, one day ago, was searched by authorities investigating the deaths of two Texas prosecutors -- is under arrest, law officers said Saturday. Eric Williams was arrested by sheriff's office members in Kaufman County and charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a ""terroristic threat."" Authorities have not said if Williams' arrest is related to the investigation into the deaths of Mark Hasse and Mike McLelland. Hasse, Kaufman County's chief felony prosecutor, was shot and killed on January 31. McLelland, the county's district attorney, and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead March 30 at their Forney, Texas, home. Federal, state and local authorities looking into Hasse's and the McLellands' deaths executed a search warrant at Williams' home on Friday afternoon, FBI spokeswoman Katherine Chaumont said. On Saturday, sheriff's deputies, Texas Rangers and FBI agents went to a storage facility in Seagoville on a search warrant also tied to the prosecutors' deaths, according to Chaumont. It was not immediately known if this new search has anything to do with Williams, who is being held on $3 million bond -- $1 million for each charge he faces -- according to the sheriff's office. Williams has a history with law enforcement authorities, including the Kaufman County District Attorney's office. Last year, he was sentenced to two years' probation after a conviction for burglary and theft by a public servant. Hasse prosecuted Williams' case. Hours after the McLellands' bodies were found, authorities met with Williams at a local Denny's restaurant, Williams' attorney, David Sergi, told CNN earlier this month. Investigators took swab samples from Williams' hands to test him for gun residue, according to the lawyer. Results were not made public by officials, but Sergi said the tests came back negative. Sergi did not respond to CNN's attempts Saturday seeking comment about the latest arrest. On Friday, Sergi released a statement saying that Williams ""has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice."" Williams told North Texas TV station KXAS earlier this month that he understands why authorities wanted to meet with him. ""If I was in their shoes, I would want to talk to me,"" he said. ""In the investigators' minds, they want to check with me to do their process of elimination."" Williams said he has no ill will toward prosecutors -- he said he believes they were ""doing their jobs"" -- and has cooperated with law enforcement. ""I certainly wish them the best in bringing justice to this incredibly egregious act,"" he said. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities probing the prosecutors' deaths search a storage facility, the FBI says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department faces questions over whether it prematurely ended interrogation of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzohkhar Tsarnaev before a court appearance at his hospital bed. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said he was ""concerned that these proceedings, which included mandatory administration of Miranda rights, could have been conducted in a manner that prematurely cut off a lawful, ongoing FBI interview."" Tsarnaev faced a judicial ""first appearance"" on Monday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center three days after being taken into custody for the April 15 bombing that killed three people and injured more than 260 others. A government source familiar with the first appearance says the Miranda warning, which advises criminal suspects of their constitutional rights against self-incrimination, were first administered while a magistrate judge presided over the hearing. Government officials indicated Tsarnev, 19, was not immediately apprised of those rights after his capture late last Friday, under what is called the ""public safety"" exception. That allows for limited questioning by law enforcement of a suspect to determine if there as imminent danger to the public of attack. The weekend interrogation period from Saturday evening into Monday morning was 16 hours, but questioning was off and on because of suspect's medical condition, according to the government source. Tsarneav, who sustained a gunshot wound, reportedly gave investigators specific information about the marathon bombing. Was New York next target? Two sources tell CNN he has since not answered ""substantive"" questions from investigators about his alleged operational role in the attack. Authorities allege Tsarnaev bombed the famed road race along with his brother, Tamerlan, 26, who died early Friday morning following a violent confrontation with police. There were indications that Dzohkhar Tsarnaev was offering more basic personal information not related to the investigation -- such as his family and work history. But Rogers, a Michigan Republican, told CNN the cooperation has stopped. ""Once they walked into the hospital room and offered the lawyer and Mirandized, the subject has not continued to cooperate with authorities and that's a huge problem,"" said Rogers in an interview that aired Thursday on CNN's ""Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" Tsarnaev only began ""responding"" to government law enforcement investigators Saturday evening under the ""public safety exception"" allowing interrogation without Miranda rights. Suspects' mother expresses doubts about bombing . Formal charges were filed under seal on Sunday, but the questioning continued. Tsarnaev faces one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction, namely an improvised explosive device, against persons and property within the United States resulting in death. He also was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. The Justice Department must decide whether to seek the death penalty. One government source said the court and federal public defenders were notified of the charges and it was arranged for the judge, defenders, and prosecutors to meet the next morning to have the court appearance in the hospital room. The U.S. attorney's office coordinated with the hospital staff when the suspect would be available, since he had earlier been under sedation. A spokeswoman for that office, Christina Dilorio-Sterling, said Judge Marianne Bowler followed legal protocol and scheduled a hearing ""without unnecessary delay"" as the law requires. It is unusual but not unprecedented for a judge to preside at bedside for an injured defendant. Dilorio-Sterling stressed the judge is obligated to set a hearing as soon as the criminal complaint is filed because the accused is entitled to an initial appearance and to be provided legal counsel, which Tsarnaev received. Sources dismissed earlier media reports the judge had ""barged"" into an ongoing FBI interrogation, and that the team of interrogators were caught off guard by the court proceeding about to take place. A source said the interrogation had wrapped up about an hour before the court session began, and that all parties were advised of the mandatory court appearance. There was no reaction from the court or Bowler's chambers. The Justice Department said it would look into Rogers' concerns. Rogers said the FBI may have been too quick to end the questioning, and criticized the judge's actions. ""That is highly unusual for a judge to intervene so hastily and make the decision not based on the facts of the interviews and the public safety exception, but what they perceived was happening based on what they saw on television,"" he said. ""It's a dangerous precedence setting that I think we need to change and correct right away. And we still need more answers on this particular question."" Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd also confirmed the U.S. attorney's sequence of events. ""Following the filing of the criminal complaint in this matter on Sunday, the court, that evening, scheduled an initial appearance for Monday, which it then coordinated with the prosecutors, federal defender, court reporter, U.S. Marshal Service and the hospital. ""The Rules of Criminal Procedure require the Court to advise the defendant of his right to silence and his right to counsel during the Initial Appearance. The prosecutors and FBI agents in Boston were advised of the scheduled initial appearance in advance of its occurrence,"" Boyd said in a statement. Generally, suspects charged with crimes in an initial criminal complaint are to be brought before court within ""one business day,"" even those hospitalized like Tsarnaev. The public safety exception does not set a hard time when questioning must stop and the suspect must be taken into court, but it's generally understood to be about 48 hours. The government would have to justify holding anyone longer than that under the exception. The court case is U.S. v. Tsarnaev (13-2106). CNN's Jessica Yellin, Deborah Feyerick, and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Bombing suspect Dzohkhar Tsarnaev questioned before court appearance .

"(CNN) -- Last week Germany levied a fine against Google for one of the biggest wiretapping violations in history. The fine? Less than $200,000. Google's net profits in 2012? More than $10 billion. Imagine a driver of a fancy car caught for speeding and then asked to pay a nickel. Google got off easier. Over several years and in countries around the world, Google drove cars with cameras mounted on the roof through communities and residential neighborhoods. Google said that it was gathering images to improve its ""Street View"" mapping program. But Google was also secretly collecting information about Internet access points in private homes and intercepting personal communications across wi-fi networks. A privacy official in Germany had suspected that this was happening, but was repeatedly reassured by Google that it wasn't. When the official actually removed the hard drive from a Google vehicle, the true story came out. Investigations were launched in more than a dozen countries. ""Street View"" became ""Spy-Fi."" The Canadian privacy commissioner determined that the company had obtained medical records and financial records, private e-mails and passwords. In the United States, a group of attorneys general levied a $7 million fine against the company, after federal agencies in Washington failed to act. Google apologized, stopped collecting the wi-fi data (but not the location data) and promised to improve its privacy practices. Last week, the German official who triggered the original investigation announced the 145,000-euro fine, almost the largest amount allowed under European law, though insignificant for a company the size of Google. The public official was clearly unhappy about the outcome and told The New York Times, ""As long as violations of data protection law are penalized with such insignificant sums, the ability of existing laws to protect personal privacy in the digital world, with its high potential for abuse, is barely possible."" As the public concern about privacy is increasing, the failure of public agencies to take forceful action is becoming a problem. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission announced important settlements with Facebook and Google back in 2011, but it has been reluctant to take any meaningful enforcement action since. Even after Google consolidated all of the data from across its 60 plus services last year into one data policy to ""rule them all,"" the FTC remained silent. The Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation of Street View but levied only a $25,000 fine, even less than the amount in Germany, and that was for Google's obstruction during the investigation. Increasingly, Internet companies are advocating ""self-regulation"" and weak-willed politicians are telling users, ""check your privacy settings, be careful what you post."" In other words, you are on your own. That is terrible advice coming from those who know that users can do little to protect their data. User data is gathered surreptitiously, few users have the ability or time to know how it is collected, and even good privacy policies change quickly. It was only Mr. Casper's persistence that made it possible to challenge Google's data collection practices. It would have been impossible for those whose wi-fi communications were intercepted to know that their data was gathered by Google, let alone enforce privacy rights against the company. That is why it is important for officials to pursue investigations, enforce laws and impose significant penalties when warranted. The failure to enforce privacy laws is bad not only for Internet users, but also for smaller companies and innovative firms that are developing services that comply with privacy law. The success of ""Privacy by Design,"" and other new approaches, depends on countries enforcing their laws. If they see their larger competitors get away with cutting corners, the message will be that they, too, can ignore the laws. This will lead to a vicious spiral that governments must avoid. In Europe, governments recognize the need to update and strengthen privacy laws. Efforts are under way to improve privacy protections. That will help consumers and Internet users all around the world as companies adopt better safeguards for personal data. In the United States, President Obama has called for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and recommended the adoption of new privacy law. It is a good, forward-looking proposal that builds on existing law and addresses a key concern of Internet users today. Another proposal now in California would give Internet users the right to know the information private firms collect about them. It is a clever approach to privacy that does not restrict data collection; it simply makes companies more accountable to users. But it is not easy to enact new laws, particularly when large companies have so much influence over the political process. Still, there are many public officials who must share the frustration of Mr. Casper. Privacy protection without enforcement is no protection at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marc Rotenberg.","Marc Rotenberg: Germany levied small fine on Google for gathering people's private info .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea stayed on course to add the Europa League to their Champions League triumph of last season with a dramatic 2-1 win over FC Basel in their semifinal first leg match in Switzerland Thursday. Chelsea put on a display in Basel's St. Jakob stadium which had echoes of their commanding performances in Europe's premier club competition 12 months ago and grabbed a last gasp victory thanks to an injury time goal from David Luiz. The English Premier League side had led after an early goal from Nigerian international Victor Moses, but the home side drew level with a late Fabian Schar penalty. The equalizer sparked a late Chelsea charge and Brazilian star Luiz found the net from a free kick, his low shot eluding Yann Sommer in the home goal. ""It's difficult to win here and to score the second goal with the last kick of the match was amazing for us,"" a delighted Luiz told ITV Sport after his dramatic late intervention. In the other semifinal, Turkey's Fenerbahce will take a 1-0 lead to Portugal for the second leg after beating Benfica. Fenerbahce dominated the match and Christian saw his penalty in the first half strike the base of the post. They also hit the woodwork with two other efforts until Egeman Korkmaz made the breakthrough in the 72nd minute with a strong header from a corner. Benfica's best effort saw Nicolas Gaitan strike the post with a curling shot and they will be looking to retrieve the narrow deficit in their home tie in Lisbon. Famous fan . Basel had reached the last four by beating another English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur on penalties, but watched by tennis maestro and football fan Roger Federer they found Chelsea a tougher proposition. Moses headed the visitors in front in the 12th minute from a Frank Lampard corner and they might have added to their advantage before the halftime interval. Basel improved after the break and Valentin Stocker hit the post with a shot with Petr Cech beaten. At the other end Fernando Torres also struck the woodwork after a cut back by Eden Hazard. But late on Cesar Azpilicueta's seeemingly innocuous challenge on Stocker saw the home side awarded a surprise penalty. Schar kept his nerve to beat Cech but Chelsea responded with a series of telling attacks and John Terry was left shaking his head as Sommer saved his point blank headed effort. But Rafa Benitez's men reserved the best to last as Stocker fouled Ramirez 25 meters out and Luiz performed his late heroics. It left Chelsea in an excellent position to finally capture a trophy under the interim reign of Benitez, having exited after the group stages of their defense of the Champions League.","Chelsea beat FC Basel 2-1 in their Europa League semifinal first leg match .

"(EW.com) -- After months of speculation surrounding the ""Boy Meets World"" reboot, ""Girl Meets World,"" it seems like the pieces are finally starting to come together. Early last week, EW broke the news that 11-year-old Rowan Blanchard was cast to play the series' Girl, Riley Matthews. Since then, producers have also filled the spot of Riley's best friend, Maya (Sabrina Carpenter), and announced the addition of two more roles (including one, Shamus Farkle, who sounds a whole lot like ""BMW's"" resident geek Minkus). So, who else can we expect to see on Girl Meets World? And what will Cory and Topanga be like now that they're all grown up? Entertainment Weekly spoke to ""Boy Meets World"" creator Michael Jacobs, who is exec producing the ""Girl Meets World"" pilot for Disney, to get the scoop on what fans of the coming-of-age classic should expect. On why ""Girl Meets World"" almost didn't happen: When execs at Disney first approached Jacobs with the idea of revisiting Boy Meets World, he promptly nixed the idea. ""There's a natural reticence to want to try and attempt something that you've been really lucky enough to do once,"" explains Jacobs. But after mulling it over, Jacobs decided that he wanted to create a show for the ""new generation of kids that live in a much more difficult world."" The only catch? Jacobs was dead set against doing a sequel, which he felt would amount to nothing more than a reunion show. ""A reunion show that's one and done,"" says Jacobs, who instead suggested centering the pilot on Cory and Topanga's daughter, Riley. ""But to actually take the children of Cory and Topanga and watch on two levels [as they] grow up and as Cory and Topanga keep growing up, I can't resist that. I can't resist that and I'm very hopeful the audience won't resist it either."" On his vision for Girl Meets World: Like its predecessor, Jacobs says he hopes the pilot for ""Girl Meets World"" captures ""the confusions about growing up and what we are supposed to be and what we are supposed to aspire to be."" As for Jacobs' own aspirations for the show, he says, ""There's a column that I want to play in and that column contains The Wonder Years and Happy Days. That was always the column that I wanted Boy Meets World to be included in and I want Girl Meets World to be in that column as well."" 'Saved By the Bell': 'Today' mini-reunion . On Cory and Topanga as parents: They may have two kids, but don't expect Cory and Topanga to have it all figured out. ""Topanga has always been much more certain that Cory. Cory has always been confused. That would never stop,"" says Jacobs, who explains that the long-time sweethearts will have differing points of views on parenting. ""Now he's a father. Cory Matthews doesn't know how to be a father."" Cory will also be grappling with his decision to become a teacher. ""He's following in the footsteps of [Mr. Feeney], the most influential character in his life,"" says Jacobs. ""Should he be? Will he succeed? Can he influence children like Feeney influenced children? What is Topanga's observation of that? How does she help? And what is Topanga's life? And what has she become? You'll remember we left the series and they were in Philly and they were going on an adventure to go to New York. Did they succeed? Did it work? All of that will be answered in the pilot."" On Riley's personality: Will the youngest Matthews be more like her dad or her mom? Jacobs won't say, though he will reveal that ""she is going to be much more like one than the other but that second parent will pop up in ridiculously unexpected times and places and add to the confusion of who this character is."" As for who she's isn't? Jacobs says that Riley will not aspire to be an actress, singer, or dancer as many fans have speculated. ""That was never Boy Meets World and it's the farthest thing that this show will be."" Chris Christie chews the fat with Letterman . On whether or not other Boy Meets World cast-members will make an appearance: While Jacobs says many of the supporting characters, including Riley's brother and her rebellious best friend, will be reminiscent of old favorites like Shawn, Eric, and Minkus, he also adds that the door is ""wide open"" for those originals to make an appearance on the series if the pilot gets picked up. ""I think there's more than a chance,"" says Jacobs, who explains that he's spoken to many of the former cast members and that they've all expressed interest in being apart of the project in some capacity. ""I think there's a strong chance,"" he says. On reuniting with Savage and Fishel: Though Jacobs has stayed in touch with both Savage and Fishel, he says reuniting with them for Girl Meets World has been ""the greatest possible thing that can happen."" Jacobs, who refers to the actors as his surrogate children, is hoping fans will feel the same. ""[Hanging out with them] is gratifying and rewarding and what I'm hopeful for is that there will be a vast audience who wants to hangout with them again as well.""

"(CNN) -- In a decision announced Wednesday, Australia's high court upheld the plain packaging act, which says that tobacco products must be in plain packaging without logos and bear graphic health warnings as of December 1. The government immediately hailed the ruling, calling it a ""watershed moment for tobacco control around the world."" ""The message to the rest of the world is big tobacco can be taken on and beaten,"" Attorney General Nicola Roxon said in a statement. ""Without brave governments willing to take the fight up to big tobacco, they'd still have us believing that tobacco is neither harmful nor addictive."" Opinion: Australian packaging laws misguided . Australia is the first nation in the world to require ""plain packaging"" for tobacco. Only the brand and variant name will differ against a drab, dark-color background. Other government initiatives against tobacco have included a 25% excise in 2010, restrictions on Internet advertising, and more than $85 million in anti-smoking social marketing campaigns. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco kills nearly 6 million people a year, 10% of them from secondhand smoke exposure. The WHO says the death toll could rise to more than 8 million a year by 2030 without urgent action. Tobacco companies, including Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris Limited and British American Tobacco, had challenged the act as unconstitutional, saying the government was unfairly taking its intellectual property. The high court posted the decision on its website, but not the full opinion. That will be published at a later date, it said. ""Any company in similar circumstances, when faced with the loss of brands worth billions of dollars, would challenge such laws,"" said Sonia Stewart, spokeswoman for Imperial Tobacco, an Australian company, in a statement. ""Our biggest concern is the effect plain packaging will have on illicit trade,"" Stewart said. ""Plain packaging will make Australia a magnet for the growing black market in tobacco, which already costs the Australian Government nearly $1 billion per annum in lost revenue."" In a similarly worded statement, British American Tobacco said only organized crime gangs will gain from an illegal market. The policy, said spokesman Scott McIntyre, ""will actually increase smoking rates particularly in young people who'll have greater access to cheap illegal cigarettes."" Imperial Tobacco and PML said the legal fight was not over, citing challenges by three governments -- Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Ukraine -- within the World Trade Organization. PML is also suing Australia for breaching the Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong. Public health advocates, however, hailed the ruling, which conforms with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to which Australia is a party. Richard Daynard, a professor at Northeastern University School of Law in Boston and president of the school's Public Health Advocacy Institute, called the Australian ruling ""extraordinarily encouraging."" ""It means that governments are pretty much free to do what they feel is necessary to protect their population from tobacco marketing, including marketing on packages. In other words, it's a blow for public health."" Daynard said Philip Morris has taken the lead in litigation against governments that take strong anti-tobacco control measures. ""They have a case against the government of Uruguay for requiring that 80% of the packages have warnings on them,"" he said in a telephone interview. Beyond Australia . Last year the United States unveiled nine graphic health warning labels that must cover half the area of cigarette packages by this September, joining 41 other countries that mandate pictorial warnings. Tobacco use is the nation's leading preventable cause of death, responsible for about one in five deaths -- or 443,000 -- a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, cigarette smoking is responsible for $96 billion in direct medical costs and $97 billion in lost productivity each year, according to the U.S. government. Should smoking trigger an R rating? Five tobacco manufacturers, including R.J. Reynolds, have challenged the requirements, saying they violate First Amendment rights. In February, a federal judge sided with the companies, and the Obama administration's appeal is pending. In a report last year, the CDC found in a 14-nation study that graphic health warnings on cigarette packages have led a ""substantial"" number of smokers to consider quitting. The World Health Organization says 19 countries meet the ""best practice for pictorial warnings,"" which include warnings in the local language and which must cover at least half of cigarette packages. Less than 11% of the world's population is protected by comprehensive national smoke-free laws, it says.

"(CNN) -- During the first presidential debate Wednesday night, the candidates talked a lot about how they would lower the cost of your medical care. Heavy on data and large numbers, the debate may not have been the easiest to follow for Americans interested in the subject. Ken Thorpe, an Emory University economist who specializes in health care costs, may have been one of the few excited by all these numbers. ""It was about as substantive a debate as I think we've ever seen,"" Thorpe said. ""The problem is, even after this debate, I don't think people truly understand the similarities and the differences in what these candidates are proposing for health care."" Fact Check: Would repeal of Obamacare hike seniors' drug costs? Here are five things you should know about what the candidates said about health care in last night's debate: . 1. You do pay more for health insurance, but Obama's policy isn't totally to blame. The first mention of health care came about six minutes into the debate. Discussing how ""middle-income Americans have been buried"" financially under the president's policies, Republican challenger Mitt Romney said health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Each year, health care costs have gone up during Obama's administration -- that is true. But experts say the increases have not been due to policy, but because of the rising cost of health care. The figure Romney used is not quite right. The Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducts an annual survey of health care costs, found that since 2008 the average family premium has gone up about $1,698. For context, that is the total cost that you and your employer pay -- it's not $1,698 out of your pocket. In fact, the report said the increase you personally pay was not ""statistically significant."" Rising health care costs are a significant problem, though. The same survey found that the average premiums for family coverage have increased a whopping 113% since 2001. That means the trend started long before President Barack Obama took office. Romney takes debate to Obama over economy, health care . 2. Medicaid and Medicare fraud is a huge problem and more needs to be done. Obama's first specific reference to health care described how the administration pursued medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid ""more aggressively than ever before,"" which saved the system tens of billions of dollars. Medicare and Medicaid fraud is what one expert called ""one of the most profitable crimes in America."" It costs taxpayers billions of dollars annually -- $60 to $90 billion a year, based on government estimates. That's money that could be better spent on taking care of actual health care costs. Fact Check: Would Romney bankrupt Medicare by 2016? Historically, it was up to states to police this problem, but the fraud grew too big for them to handle. A Republican-backed bill called the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 created the Medicaid Integrity Program, which gives the federal government the ability to oversee and support states' anti-fraud efforts. The Obama administration launched several key programs to protect against fraud. They have saved taxpayers billions; however, a Government Accountability Office investigation concluded that while progress has been made under Obama, more could be done. In a report this June, in fact, it found at least one of the major programs -- an audit conducted by the government -- costs taxpayers $102 million, but only found $20 million in excess payments. ""They have certainly been increasing their work in this area,"" Thorpe said. ""A certain kind of focus definitely did help eliminate some of this fraud."" Health care act's glaring omission: Liability reform . 3. Sending Medicaid back to the states would save the federal government money, but cost states more and adversely impact those using the benefits. Obama criticized Romney's idea of sending Medicaid back to the states. He argued that this would mean a ""30% cut in the primary program (for) seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities."" The plan GOP vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan, as the head of the House Budget Committee, suggested in April -- which Romney adopted as his own -- would cut $1.4 trillion in Medicaid in the next 10 years. It would accomplish this by converting the program into a block grant that would in large part shift costs to the states, which Romney argued would give states more flexibility to do what they deem best to help their Medicaid population. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office conducted an analysis of the proposal, which found that it would save the federal government a significant amount. Medicaid costs would be 49% lower by 2030 than current spending under Ryan's plan. That's because the block grant spending caps the cost and makes fewer adjustments. The CBO concluded that while the federal government would save money, the states would ""face significant challenges in achieving sufficient cost savings."" In Wednesday night's debate, Romney spelled out how he would adjust spending behind these block grants. ""I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, 'You're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1%, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best,' "" he said. That formula doesn't account for rising health care costs (remember the cost of health insurance has gone up 113% since 2001), nor does it account for the aging population. With ""baby boomers"" getting older, there will be 63 million more people over 60 by the time 2030 comes around, according to U.S. Census projections. Health care costs would go up significantly to accommodate this 20% increase in the number of people over 60 who will need more health care. Nor does Romney's formula account for economic downturns where more people would qualify for the Medicaid program, like the current government formula -- which would leave the states in a much more uncertain position. The CBO analysis concludes about these block grants that these proposed cuts would ""likely force states to scale back their Medicaid programs considerably."" Since poor people, seniors, and people with disabilities make up the majority of those who receive Medicaid, ""they'd be hit the hardest."" New report compares Obama, Romney health care plans . 4. Romney's accusation that Obama cut Medicare by $716 billion is misleading. In the debate, Romney said 10 times that Obama was paying for his health care package by taking the money from Medicare recipients' pockets, cutting $716 billion out of the program. ""To balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake,"" Romney said. In his closing statement, he promised to restore that amount. Dozens of bipartisan fact-checkers say that number, often repeated by the Romney/Ryan campaign, is misleading. Where does it come from? It's the figure mentioned in a letter from the Congressional Budget Office sent to House Speaker John Boehner in July. Boehner had asked for an analysis from the CBO if Congress could repeal Obamacare, something Romney said he would do if elected. ""Spending for Medicare would increase by an estimated $716 billion"" over the next decade, the analysis said. That means Medicare would cost the government more. Obama's health legislation does not mean people will see cuts to their benefits. Hospitals and health care providers will, but that's what they agreed to in exchange for the Affordable Care Act's mandate that people have health insurance. If more people have health insurance, hospitals will have to care for fewer of the uninsured. Uninsured patients cost significantly more to care for than patients who are insured. It is unclear what impact the cuts would have on the Medicare program. Romney argues providers will accept fewer Medicaid patients. In the debate he said, ""Some 15% of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take any more Medicare patients under that scenario (Obamacare)."" Medicare's own independent actuary, which it uses to analyze changes in the program, has warned that these planned cuts to pay providers' bills will force some doctors to stop accepting Medicare patients. 5. The Cleveland and Mayo Clinics do it better. The candidates agreed during the debate that more needs to be done to control the cost of health care. Obama praised the Cleveland Clinic as a model for new ways of controlling the cost of care. ""They actually provide great care cheaper than average,"" he said. ""And the reason they do is because they do some smart things."" One approach he highlighted was the collaborative approach of the clinic's doctors. Instead of each doctor ordering a different test, they meet and decide as a team how to approach the patient's problem. This prevents duplication. The team of doctors also provides preventive care. Obama has held the clinic up as a model throughout his time in office. He visited it in 2009. It is a top-ranked teaching hospital that attracts patients from around the world. An analysis done by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care found that the Cleveland Clinic did treat Medicare patients for tens of thousands of dollars less than many other medical centers. One of the big differences between the Cleveland Clinic and other hospitals is that it and other multi-specialty clinics like the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota employ their own doctors and can create these teams. In most traditional hospitals, doctors are independent private practitioners who are left to making their own choices. Cleveland Clinic's success secret . Because Cleveland Clinic's doctors are paid fixed salaries, there is less incentive to do unnecessary tests or procedures compared to a doctor who works on a fee-for-service basis. As of right now, Medicare acts a lot like those traditional hospitals do, Thorpe said. ""If you take the typical patient who is chronically ill, they will be overweight or obese, they suffer from bad cholesterol, hypertension, asthma and diabetes -- that means they take 10 to 15 medications and there is no team-based care,"" he said. ""Going to separate doctors with their own plans is expensive. These integrated group plans work well and the ongoing preventive care they provide -- working with doctors, nutritionists, nurses, nurse practitioners and the rest -- ultimately save on costs.""

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- SeaWorld employees on Tuesday testified at a federal job safety hearing that, while the behavior of killer whales is is extremely predictable, the job of working with a 6-ton marine mammal carries a calculated risk. The hearing, before the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Review Commission, resumed Monday after a two-month hiatus. It was convened to look into the death of SeaWorld Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, in February 2010. OSHA attorneys called three witness -- all from SeaWorld San Diego, including the California park's vice president. SeaWorld strongly objected to the California employees being called as witnesses in a case involving only the Florida theme park. The administrative judge allowed the questioning to go forward, but reiterated his final ruling would only concern the SeaWorld Orlando's operations. SeaWorld employees testified that trainers of killer whales are taught to recognize ""precursors"" -- odd behaviors that could lead to aggression. OSHA attorneys reviewed multiple SeaWorld incident reports in which trainers missed aggressive behaviors. Tuesday, while testifying about a 1999 incident involving SeaWorld San Diego killer whale Kasatka, trainer Ken Peters testified how the female killer whale grabbed his foot and pulled him underwater. ""Yes, she could have drowned me"" if she wanted to, Peters said. Peters acknowledged the dangers of his job. ""Yes -- it's a calculated risk of dying tomorrow,"" but trainers can predict killer whale behaviors 99.9% of the time, he said. OSHA says training alone is not enough to keep trainers safe. After a lengthy investigation, OSHA cited SeaWorld of Florida, Inc., in August 2010 for willfully endangering employees by not taking proper safety precautions. The citation said the park allowed its employees to work with Tilikum, a 12,000-pound animal with ""known aggressive tendencies"" who had previously been involved in the 1991 death of a trainer at a marine park in Vancouver, British Columbia. OSHA said the SeaWorld Orlando did not provide barriers, decking, oxygen supply systems or other types of protection for the trainers. In the case of Brancheau's death, the trainer was sitting on the Shamu Stadium's pool edge during a private show when Tilikum pulled her into the water, drowning her. Since Brancheau's death, SeaWorld has forbidden trainers from entering the water with killer whales. Trainers are required to sign a document in the standard operating procedure manual that acknowledges the calculated risk -- government attorney John Black called the document, ""a release waiver."" Michael Scarauzzi, SeaWorld San Diego's Vice President of Zoological Operations, was deemed a hostile witness by the judge for giving brief and evasive answers, and OSHA's attorneys were allowed to ask more leading questions. OSHA is expecting to wrap its case on Wednesday. It is unclear how many witnesses SeaWorld will call. The hearing is schedule to conclude Friday. After court was adjourned, Dawn Brancheau's family issued a statement through their attorney, saying their ""interest in the case is the safety of the current and future SeaWorld employees and their hope (that) no other family will have to suffer like we have had to,"" said attorney John Mills. The family has acknowledged that SeaWorld surveillance video showing the trainer's death might be shown during the trial, but they hope it will not be released to the public.","Employees testify in OSHA hearing into the death of a killer whale's trainer .

"London, England (CNN) -- When people think of Venice, three things come to mind: gondolas, art and sinking buildings. The watery city, a treasure trove of Renaissance art and architecture, is not normally associated with cutting-edge cool. But recent developments show that the city is in fact thriving -- due in large part to the many artists and designers who have chosen to make the city their home, and because each year it is host to exciting events such as the alternating architecture and contemporary art biennales, and the Venice film festival. The yearly influx of creative professionals, in addition to the vast numbers of tourists visiting the city, is starting to forge a different, more contemporary vibe. Getting off the beaten tourist track and into local Venetian haunts can also yield some pleasant surprises. CNN's arts and culture show, icon, has dug beneath the city's old-world veneer, and come up with a guide to the cooler side of Venice. SEE: If you want to see contemporary art outside of the Biennale, which takes place every two years in the Giardini Pubblici, look no further than the Punta della Dogana and Palazzo Grassi. Both were developed by French billionaire and art collector Francois Pinault to showcase his impressive contemporary art collection, which includes work by artists like Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst and Takashi Murakami. The Punta della Dogana, located between the Grand Canal and the Guidecca Canal, was developed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, and the interiors are sleek and almost industrial in comparison with the ornate palaces normally associated with the city. Other contemporary art spaces to visit include the Peggy Guggenheim Collection on the Dorsoduro, which hosts a changing schedule of exhibitions in addition to a permanent collection and a shop selling artist's books, posters and gifts. Currently the museum is hosting a show of work by American abstract expressionist painter Adolph Gottlieb and the Restaurant Terrazza Danieli is serving dishes inspired by the artist's work until the beginning of January -- so if you can't take a piece of work home, you can at least eat one. Otherwise, check out the Fondazione Querini Stampalia, a stunning palazzo in central Venice that hosts temporary art exhibitions alongside a permanent museum of fine art and antiquities. Every two years the foundation teams up with Italian fashion brand Furla to award a prize to a young Italian artist, encouraging local creativity and attracting artists to live and work in the city. STAY: French product designer Philippe Starck, who has lived on the Venetian island of Burano for 25 years, has designed the interior of a luxury hotel called the Palazzina Grassi. A far cry from the typical Venice hotel experience, the rooms feature floor-to-wall mirrors, Pop-art inspired chairs and a minimal palette of white and chrome. If you are on a lower budget and craving something other than the heavy brocades and four poster beds prominent in many of the hotels here, head to the light and modern Ca' Pozzo Inn in Cannaregio. It's handily located near the rail and bus stations, and is in one of the more typically ""Venetian"" parts of the city. Featuring modern and contemporary art on its walls and simple, modern furniture, it's a calm, minimal oasis for Baroque-weary visitors. DRINK AND EAT: Venice is known for its mouth-watering food and elegant drinking establishments. Harry's Bar -- once a drinking hole for the likes of Ernest Hemingway and Charlie Chaplin -- remains a popular haunt for celebrities and the art crowd, as does the bar at the chic Bauer hotel, which becomes inundated at Biennale time. If you want to get away for an evening, a water-taxi trip will take you to Burano and the restaurant Da Romano, one of Philippe Starck's favorites, and an excellent purveyor of delicious fresh seafood. For partying, Piccolo Mondo is one of island's most frequented clubs, a pit-stop for students and tourists as well as celebrities. Though the city has acquired the nickname La Serenissima (in English, The Most Serene) for its ordinarily quiet nightlife, it becomes a party hotspot during the film festival and biennales. Events take place in grand palazzos, on yachts moored near the Giardini and even in an art deco aircraft hangar out on the Lido -- if you can bag an invite, these are the places to see and be seen. SHOP: The aesthetic in Venice is smart, chic and understated. Though not ideal for bargain-hunting, the city is teeming with boutiques. Max Mara, Prada and Furla -- Italian designers known for their classic designs, and all three patrons of contemporary art -- are the brands to wear for casual bellini drinking and museum hopping.","Venice's old-world image hides some hip contemporary galleries, hotels and eateries .

"Washington (CNN) -- A pilot in Minnesota who was preparing to fly a commercial jet halfway across the country was arrested after a security agent smelled alcohol on him and he failed a preliminary breath test, airport police said Friday. The arrest of Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, 48, happened Friday morning as American Eagle Flight 4590 was preparing to take off from Minneapolis-St. Paul International for LaGuardia Airport in New York. Officers and a Transportation Security Administration agent ""detected the odor of a consumed alcohol beverage as they passed by Kristiansen waiting to enter the elevator,"" according to a Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport Police Department report. The pilot was taken to a hospital for blood tests, airport spokesman Patrick Hogan told CNN. He was released to airline personnel and charges are pending, according to the airport police report. Fifty-three passengers were scheduled to be on board the Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet for the flight. However, Hogan said none were aboard at the time of the arrest. ""American Eagle has a well-established substance abuse policy that is designed to put the safety of our customers and employees first,"" American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told CNN in a written statement. ""We are cooperating with authorities and conducting a full internal investigation."" The pilot is being withheld from service until the investigation is completed, he said.

"(CNN) -- A imprisoned former Mexican general has been released for lack of evidence nearly a year after his arrest on corruption charges. Retired Gen. Tomas Angeles Dauahare, along with three other high-ranking military leaders, was accused of ties to drug traffickers. He was arrested in May and formally charged in August. The arrests shook confidence in the military, which under former President Felipe Calderon had done the heavy lifting in the offensive against drug cartels. The military was chosen to go after the cartels because it was seen as less corruptible than local and state forces. At the time of the arrests, lawmakers lamented what they said could be one of the highest-level corruption cases in Mexico's recent history. Since then, a new president and new attorney general assumed posts, and in January prosecutors said they had no evidence to incriminate Angeles Dauahare. A judge on Wednesday ordered the retired general's release, and the attorney general's office agreed with the order. Angeles Dauahare walked out of prison Wednesday night wearing gray sweats and tennis shoes. The accusations against him were defamatory and false, he told reporters, calling himself ""a victim of the last (presidential) term."" Other generals who remain in custody for alleged ties to organized crimes will also be freed, he predicted. Angeles Dauahare was arrested last year together with Brig. Gen. Roberto Dawe Gonzalez, retired Lt. Col. Silvio Isidro de Jesus Hernandez Soto and retired Gen. Ricardo Escorcia Vargas, a former deputy defense secretary.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A massive car bomb tore through the heart of a bustling marketplace in Peshawar, Pakistan, Wednesday, killing at least 100 people -- including many women and children -- and injuring at least 200 others, officials said. A vehicle packed with 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives detonated at the Meena Bazaar, a labyrinth of shops popular with women. The impact destroyed buildings, burying people underneath the rubble, and sparked massive fires in the shops, mosques, and homes. In a year of seemingly endless militant attacks in Pakistan, this was the deadliest. Those who survived described a narrow escape: . ""I ducked quickly and when I looked up it was complete darkness,"" said Imdad. ""I couldn't see anyone. The cars and the van were lying upside down."" Are you there? Send your photos and videos to iReport . Fareed Ullah, a student at a nearby mosque, was injured when he fell from the second floor as he tried to escape a fire ignited by the blast at the Meena Bazaar. ""We only saw a red blaze and nothing else,"" he said from his hospital bed. ""My friends and I fell from the second floor. We didn't know where we were."" The remote-controlled detonation killed at least 100 people and injured as many as 200 others, hospital and government officials said. The deaths include 68 males and 32 females, including 10 children, the head of the main hospital in Peshawar said. The car bomb left a 10-foot-wide crater, and the flames spread quickly through stores selling highly flammable fabric. Residents and shopkeepers expressed outrage that militants were able to carry out the attack in broad daylight, the latest in a string of militant attacks targeting civilians in Peshawar. ""What kind of security alert is this? It was an explosives-packed car,"" a middle-aged shopkeeper at Meena Bazaar said. ""Look at the mosque, it ceases to exist anymore. For God's sake, do something!"" ""Increasing chaos"" in Pakistan . The Peshawar car bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on Pakistan since the October 2007 attack on a homecoming rally for former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. More than 135 people were killed in the suicide bombing in Karachi. Bhutto escaped harm, but she was assassinated two months later. Wednesday's bombing happened hours after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, to shore up U.S. support in nuclear-armed Pakistan, as it battles a rising Taliban insurgency. Clinton condemned the strike, and dared the militants who were responsible to put down their arms and appeal to the Pakistani people through the political process. ""If the people behind the attacks were so sure of their beliefs, let them join the political process, let them come forth to the people and make their case that they don't want girls to go to school, that they want women to be kept back, that they believe they have all the answers,"" Clinton said in a joint news conference with her Pakistani counterpart in Islamabad. ""They know they are on the losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is,"" she said of those responsible for the car bombing in Peshawar. Read more about Clinton's comments on blast . Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also condemned the deadly attack, offering his condolences to the victims and their families and directly addressing the attackers. ""We will not buckle, we will fight you because we want stability and peace in Pakistan,"" Qureshi said. ""You are on the run and we know that. We defeated you in Swat and Malakand. You think by attacking innocent people and lives you will shake our determination? No, sir, you will not."" The attack is the deadliest terrorist attack carried out in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province which has been the site of five militant strikes this month alone. A suicide car bombing on October 9 in Khyber Bazaar killed at least 49 people and injured 135 others. And, just last Friday, a car bomb exploded outside a banquet hall in Peshawar, wounding at least 15 people. The massive casualties in Wednesday's bombing prompted a state of emergency at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, where most of the injured were treated. The hospital appealed to other medical centers -- and to the public -- to donate blood, hospital officials said. North West Frontier Province is bearing the brunt of the massive civilian displacement from Pakistan's military offensive in the neighboring tribal region along the Afghan border. More than 180,000 civilians have fled to North West Frontier Province from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, according to the United Nations. Pakistan's military offensive is currently focused on South Waziristan, where the government believes the Pakistani Taliban has masterminded numerous attacks, including the October 10 siege of Pakistan's army headquarters in Rawalpindi, outside Islamabad. That siege and other attacks outside the tribal region have raised concerns about the ability of government forces to maintain control. President Obama signed legislation this month providing an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years. The White House is working on a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Peshawar is a strategic city for both Taliban militants and the U.S. and NATO military, who are waging a battle against Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. Located about 100 miles (167 kilometers) northwest of the capital, Islamabad, Peshawar sits on the main supply route into Afghanistan and is the gateway to Pakistan's ungoverned tribal regions.

"(CNN) -- From a young basketball hopeful in Accra, Ghana to fifth overall pick in the NFL Draft for the Detroit Lions. Ezekiel ""Ziggy"" Ansah's journey to the top of gridiron has been sprinkled with more than a hint of stardust. When the 23-year-old, who also played soccer as a child, moved to the United States in 2008, he couldn't have dreamed of what came to pass in New York on Thursday on the opening day of the Draft, when the NFL's 32 teams pick up young college talent. ""I've worked hard toward this and I actually earned it,"" Ansah, who only began playing football in 2010, told reporters on a conference call after being drafted by the Lions. ""It's been a humbling experience and a crazy journey."" The 23-year-old Ghanaian arrived in the U.S. on an academic scholarship with the Brigham Young University in Utah, which is owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints -- more commonly known as the Mormon Church. Keen to pursue his hoop dreams, Ansah tried out for the basketball team, but after failing to make the grade, he took up athletics because of his sprinting speed. Ansah ran the 100 meters in 10.91 seconds and the 200m in 21.89 secs, according to the official website of the Lions. When you couple that athletic speed with an imposing six feet five inches frame -- Ansah weighs 275 pounds -- it is not hard to see why he appealed to the school's football team. Despite his lack of playing experience, Lions general manager Martin Mayhew suggested he can be an immediate asset for the team. ""I do see him as an impactful player right away,"" said Mayhew. ""Sacks come when they come ... but he's going to be a guy that will play a big role for us on defense."" Ansah's adjustment to life in the NFL might be made all the easier as he has already worked with Lions head coach Jim Schwartz at the Senior Bowl -- the annual game which pits the best Draft prospects against each other. ""It will be a lot easier. I'm really comfortable with them,"" added Ansah, whose mother Elizabeth was flown over to join her son at New York's Radio City Music Hall, where the Draft is held. ""I know how our coach is so, you know, just like giving me that chance is going to make it a lot easier. ""It doesn't matter the experience that I've got. All I know is I've just got to produce and work on my technique and I know that the Detroit Lions are willing to work with me. ""I'm not going to make any promises. All I have to do is work hard and see what happens."" Schwartz, who coached a team of prospects from schools in the south in the Senior Bowl, has been impressed with what he saw from Ansah. The Lions coach will be hoping Ansah, who was the Senior Bowl's most outstanding player, can improve a Detroit team which had a losing record of 4-12 in 2012. ""We watched him get better every single day,"" said Schwartz. ""He's an inexperienced player, but he's a very instinctive player. We liked everything about him. We had a good feel for him. ""He's inexperienced, but he's not a developmental player.""","Ezekiel Ansah is picked fifth overall in the NFL Daft in New York .

"(CNN) -- Austin Reed Sigg must face trial on 18 of 20 counts related to the slaying of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway and an attack on a jogger last year, a spokesman for Colorado's courts said Friday. Rob McCallum made the announcement after the 18-year-old Sigg appeared before Jefferson County Judge Stephen Munsinger in a preliminary hearing. The arraignment is set for March 12; Sigg remains on no-bond hold. The student was charged last October with kidnapping, sexual assault and murder in the death of Ridgeway, whose body parts were found in a park in a Denver suburb. Sigg, a student at Arapahoe Community College, also was charged with attempting to kidnap, sexually assault and kill a female jogger last May. Sigg, who lived about one mile from Ridgeway's home in Westminster, was 17 at the time of the killing; he is charged as an adult. He was accused of strangling Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing some of her body parts in a crawlspace under his family's home. Police found parts of her body at a park five miles away five days after the bespectacled blonde girl disappeared while walking to Witt Elementary School on October 5. A break in the investigation came when Sigg's mother called 911 and handed him the phone. Sigg, police said, confessed.","Break came when Sigg's mother called 911 and handed him the phone .

"(CNN) -- Minutes after the death of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was announced, scores of his fellow citizens made their way to El Arepazo, a Venezuelan restaurant outside Miami. The colors of the Venezuelan flag -- red, blue and yellow -- predominated among the crowd of about 200 people, many of whom cheered and waved tiny flags as they bellied up to a buffet stocked with ""pabellon criollo,"" the traditional Venezuelan dish of rice, beans, shredded beef and stewed black beans. ""We shouldn't be partying,"" said Ernesto Ackerman, a Chavez opponent and president of the Independent Venezuelan-American Citizens, a non-profit organization that helps Latinos become U.S. citizens. ""We're only half of the country; the other half still supports Chavez. We should be asking (for) democracy, democracy, democracy, constitution. This is a most critical moment."" Borger: U.S. open to 'more constructive relationship' with Venezuela . As he spoke, more people -- many of them wearing Venezuelan baseball caps -- entered the restaurant, which advertises itself as ""your little piece of Venezuela in Doral,"" Florida. As Spanish-language television blared out the news, they sat down to plates piled with shredded gouda cheese, plantains and stuffed cornbread patties. Some took pictures to memorialize the moment. One elderly man clutched six tiny flags in his fist. In Washington, politicians reacted almost as quickly as the South Florida crowd. ""Hugo Chavez ruled Venezuela with an iron hand and his passing has left a political void that we hope will be filled peacefully and through a constitutional and democratic process, grounded in the Venezuelan constitution and adhering to the Inter-American Democratic Charter,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Menendez called for ""free and fair elections"" so that ""Venezuela can begin to restore its once robust democracy and ensure respect for the human, political and civil rights of its people."" The chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, was harsher, calling Chavez ""a tyrant who forced the people of Venezuela to live in fear"" and adding, ""Good riddance to this dictator."" But the news was not red meat to all U.S. politicians. Hugo Chavez's death draws sympathy, anger . Former President Jimmy Carter noted that he had gotten to know Chavez while observing elections in Venezuela. ""We came to know a man who expressed a vision to bring profound changes to his country to benefit especially those people who had felt neglected and marginalized,"" he said in a statement. ""Although we have not agreed with all of the methods followed by his government, we have never doubted Hugo Chavez's commitment to improving the lives of millions of his fellow countrymen."" He said that poverty rates were cut in half during Chavez's time in office but also noted the divisions that were created in the drive toward change. ""His focus on the issues faced by the poor and disenfranchised in his country made him a truly revolutionary leader in the history of Latin America,"" said Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-New York. ""He understood that after 400 years on the outside of the established power structure looking in, it was time that the poor had a chance at seeing their problems and issues addressed. His core belief was in the dignity and common humanity of all people."" Serrano cited Chavez's sale of home heating oil at discount prices to poor families in the Bronx as an example of the Venezuelan leader's largesse. ""Though President Chavez was accused of many things, it is important to remember that he was democratically elected many times in elections that were declared free and fair by international monitors,"" he said. ""Even today, people in North America seem unable to accept that Venezuelans had taken our admonitions to have democracy to heart and elected the leader of their choice. President Chavez carried out the programs that his constituents wanted enacted, and won re-election. This too was revolutionary in the history of Latin America."" Citizens Energy Chairman Joseph P. Kennedy II lauded the same program. Chavez used force of personality to win votes, influence leaders . ""President Chavez cared deeply about the poor of Venezuela and other nations around the world and their abject lack of even basic necessities, while some of the wealthiest people on our planet have more money than they can ever reasonably expect to spend,"" he said in a statement. ""There are close to 2 million people in the United States who received free heating assistance, thanks to President Chavez's leadership. Our prayers go out to President Chavez's family, the people of Venezuela, and all who were warmed by his generosity."" Human Rights Watch criticized Chavez's 1999-2013 presidency, saying it was ""characterized by a dramatic concentration of power and open disregard for basic human rights guarantees."" The rights group said Chavez enacted a constitution ""with ample human rights protections in 1999"" but began to amass and centralize power after surviving a coup d'etat in 2002. He grabbed control of the Supreme Court and limited the ability of journalists to report freely, it said. ""By his second full term in office, the concentration of power and erosion of human rights protections had given the government free rein to intimidate, censor, and prosecute Venezuelans who criticized the president or thwarted his political agenda,"" HRW said. But Sean Penn mourned Chavez's death. ""Today the United States lost a friend it never knew it had,"" the actor and activist said in a statement. ""And poor people around the world lost a champion. I lost a friend I was blessed to have."" iReport: Share your reactions .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- A shooting and a fiery crash left three people dead in the neon heart of the Las Vegas Strip on Thursday, and police scrambled to find out who triggered the carnage. The bloodshed closed the Strip for about a block and a half around some of its biggest draws, leaving tourists gaping at a wrecked Maserati, a burned-out taxi and four other vehicles. ""First time in Vegas, and then, like, the whole thing, what you know from movies only -- I was shocked,"" Christine Gerstenberger, who was visiting the desert gambling mecca from Germany, said Thursday afternoon. She and her brothers debated going back to the hotel ""because I'm totally scared,"" but ""We're too curious,"" she said. See iReporter's video of fire . One of those killed was Kenneth Cherry Jr. -- a rapper also known as Kenny Clutch -- his attorney Vicki Greco said. According to his Facebook page, Cherry is from Oakland, California, and lived in Las Vegas. Cherry's death was shocking, Greco said. ""Out of everyone I know in the rapping industry there is no way I would have ever, ever expected to find that he was shot on the Las Vegas strip in such an aggressive manner,"" said Greco, who said Cherry had two kids. ""He didn't have a (criminal) record or a history. He was just a good kid trying to make it and be a good father."" Four of the Nevada city's biggest casinos -- Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo -- are nearby, and police collected surveillance-camera video from them to help the probe. Also killed in the incident was a cab driver named Michael Boldon, CNN affiliate KVVU reported. His family is devastated by the death of the 62-year-old cab driver, his brother Tehran Boldon told the affiliate. ""It is gut-wrenching,"" a tearful Tehran Boldon told KVVU. ""My life mission would be to see them punished and brought to justice for the senseless thing they did."" It started around 4:20 a.m. with a dispute in the valet lot of the Aria Hotel, about a block away, Sheriff Douglas Gillespie said. Investigators haven't confirmed the cause of the altercation, but he said it spilled onto the street as someone in a black Range Rover Sport fired several shots at the Maserati as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. When the driver was hit, the Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire. The sports car's driver, the cab driver and a passenger in the taxi all died; a passenger in the Maserati and three other people in the resulting pileup were hurt, Gillespie said. The Maserati's passenger and other witnesses are helping detectives piece together what happened, he said. And the ""top priority"" for police is to find the Range Rover, which sped away from the intersection, and those inside it when the shooting happened. ""This act is totally unacceptable, and we are going to make a very clear message to these individuals in regards to that,"" Gillespie said. Police in neighboring states have been asked to look for the sport-utility vehicle, and Gillespie warned the occupants should be considered armed and dangerous. ""Clearly, the suspects have no regard for the lives and safety of others,"" he said. The Range Rover had an out-of-state dealer plate, tinted windows and large, black rims, Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan said. The block around the crash remained closed off into Thursday afternoon. John Lamb, who was inside Caesars Palace, told CNN affiliate KLAS he heard the commotion and saw the taxi on fire from a window. ""There was a loud bang, and I hear two other booms. I looked out my window at Caesars Palace ... and could see the fireball,"" he told KLAS. Man kills 3, himself in Southern California shooting .

"New York (CNN) -- The barefoot, apparently homeless man depicted in a widely publicized photo of a New York police officer offering him a pair of boots is not really homeless, according to the head of a city agency. On the frigid night of November 14, police officer Lawrence DePrimo, a two-year veteran of the NYPD, was on patrol in Times Square when he came across a man in bare feet with ""blisters ... about the size of my hands."" ""My heart went out to this man,"" DePrimo told CNN. ""I just went toward him and asked him if he wanted a pair of socks."" Opinion: Shoes a start, but homeless need far more . DePrimo then headed to a nearby shoe store and -- after asking the man his size -- bought winter boots and helped the man put them on his feet. Unbeknownst to DePrimo, Jennifer Foster, a tourist from Florence, Arizona, had been close by and captured the moment of DePrimo helping the man. The NYPD posted the picture to its Facebook page, where it has garnered hundreds of thousands of comments. Since then, the barefoot man, once thought to be homeless, has been identified by the New York Times as Jeffrey Hillman, 54. That name was confirmed to CNN by Hillman's older brother, Kirk. ""Seeing him on the street, the way I saw, that was a shock at that particular time with no shoes and in the cold,"" Kirk Hillman, 62 of Allentown, Pennsylvania, said, recalling the first time he saw the photo that went viral on the Internet. ""My brother has been homeless for a while now, he's been on the street for many, many years of his life."" But according to the city, Jeffrey Hillman has housing -- an apartment in the Bronx. Seth Diamond, commissioner of the New York City Department of Homeless Services, says that Jeffrey Hillman has been on the city's radar for years. ""He has housing and that's one of the most important elements for a stable lifestyle,"" Diamond told CNN. Read more: 'I knew I had to help,' cop says . Jeffrey Hillman, who served in the military, is eligible for support through the federal Housing and Urban Development's Veterans Affairs Support Housing program, Diamond said. Thanks to that program, Jeffrey Hillman has a Bronx apartment that has been paid for outright, Diamond said, emphasizing there was no need for the man to ""panhandle on the streets to pay rent."" Diamond would not give any details about Jeffrey Hillman's use of the apartment. CNN was unable to locate Jeffrey Hillman. But Diamond described the situation as being one that his agency deals with regularly with the city's homeless population: ""At times, he's receptive and at times he's more restive, and that is not atypical."" And Diamond said he remains steadfast and vigilant in this case, as in others. ""Mr. Hillman needs to be living a better and healthier life. We have incredibly dedicated people who do not take no for an answer,"" Diamond says, ""We just have to keep at it."" Read more: Dear New York, what's up with the niceness?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Events in London's art world last weekend sent out contrasting signals as to the future of the global art market. Will the bubble burst? ""Perpetual Void"" by artist Petroc Sesti, fit the current mood of uncertainty. Mid-season contemporary art auctions at London's Sotheby's, Christies and Phillips confirmed fears that the art market might be the next victim of the financial crisis. While sales figures were still significant, they brought in considerably less than the presale estimates that had been put together when the future of global finance looked less bleak. The auctions showed that a readjustment of prices might be necessary in an art world that just a month ago saw artist Damien Hirst making £111 million for 218 of his works. Sarah Thornton, who has written a book ""Seven Days in the Art World,"" explained that those art buyers who have now dropped out of the market are the speculators. ""Those who continue to buy art are the real art lovers; they are not willing to relinquish that passion,"" Thornton told CNN. ""I have just heard of someone who fired their chauffeur to continue funding an expensive art-buying habit,"" she added. Some artists are also going to extreme lengths to continue their trade. At the annual Frieze art fair in London's Regents Park, Argentinean gallery Appetite, literally blended their art with the credit crunch. The artists and gallery owner Daniella Luna ate remnants of visitors' food and slept only when a visitor was kind enough to offer them a roof. But the fair showed that the larger public's interest in contemporary art remains robust. Frieze brought in thousands of visitors from around the globe and most gallery owners seemed content with sales. Roger Tatley from the Hauser & Wirth gallery, based in Zurich and London, told CNN: ""We were a little anxious, but this fair turned out to be the best we've had."" Houser and Wirth sold almost all its works in the booth including a Henry Moore piece for $2.7 million.  Are you still buying art? Whilst Moore's art represents the higher end of prices at Frieze; most works at the fair are cheaper than at auction houses, therefore reflecting a wider art-buying audience. Rudolphe von Hofmannsthal, Director of Dicksmith gallery, a hip and relatively new gallery representing young artists fresh from their Masters degrees, said that while there was less of a rush to buy the gallery's works-- priced at around $6000 to $40,000-- this year, he remained confident about investment in art. ""I believe art is still an absolute necessity,"" von Hofmannsthal said, adding; ""this economic crisis might kill the mad hype in the art world, but there is still interest in new ideas and new works."" Blair Taylor, who works for Los Angeles and Berlin gallery Peres Project, agreed that while people might be slower to rush into buying unknown art, the outcome for the art world is not necessarily a bad one. ""I notice there is more of a conversation going on now before a collector decides to buy something"" Blair said. ""This climate might allow artists to focus more on what they are making. If it's not anymore about quantity, the focus will come back to the art object."" Some artists might beg to disagree. Angry with his financial situation, one of the artists at Appetite gallery, Diego de Aduriz, caused a frenzy when he ran around the fair naked. ""We have to learn how to survive these difficult times"" says Daniella Luna. Her words ring especially true as Appetite did not sell any of its works-- it seems the art public might not be ready to hear the words ""survival"" just yet.","Sales at London's top auction houses failed to achieve the low presale estimates .

"Chicago (CNN) -- In the wake of Apple's patent infringement victory over Samsung, many are asking: ""What are the practical implications and repercussions of the verdict?"" For now, the verdict should be viewed as a victory for consumers, industrial designers, design rights and the patent system in general. I recognize there are some who disagree with this position. These skeptics, painting a gloom and doom picture, argue that the decision will stifle innovation, yielding fewer product choices for consumers, and worse yet, leading to higher prices as Apple will levy an ""Apple tax"" on all electronic devices. They don't stop there. They then grouse that a party should not be ""forced"" to change its product ""just to avoid a patent."" The rhetoric then typically concludes with a flurry of complaints, which, if taken to their logical conclusion, are nothing short of a call to arms to abolish the entire patent system. Lest we forget, the authority to grant patents is expressly engrained in the U.S. Constitution. Expect daring new designs . To understand the epic patent dispute between Apple and Samsung, one must appreciate that there were two distinct breeds of intellectual property rights at play in the case: Utility patents and design patents. Roughly speaking, utility patents protect the function of an item, while design patents protect the appearance of an item. Design patents were at the core of this case. Apple's competitors, including Samsung, will now need to steer clear of Apple's designs. They need to step beyond the shadow of Apple's designs (where they have largely resided for years), and create products that are unique, appealing and distinctly different in visual appearance. The jury spoke loud and clear: Design rights need to be respected. This verdict should be viewed as a much needed opportunity for Apple's competitors to ""go back to the drawing board."" This, in turn, will mean consumers can expect new, exciting and even daring designs. Thankfully, consumers will be spared a lifetime of watching Apple release new products only to have competitors react by seeing how close they can get without crossing the design line. It is entirely possible that consumers, in time, will get tired of the same-old Apple designs, and actually prefer the new creations. It then will be Apple who will need to innovate (again). This will keep prices in check. Are Apple's competitors ready? Apple's competitors are ready -- provided their decision-makers give the industrial designers (the visual geniuses who create new product designs), more creative license. The best way to compete with Apple's designs is not to emulate but to out-design. Across the globe, there are highly talented industrial designers bursting with creativity who are ready, willing and able to create new, exciting and different looking designs. Samsung to fight ruling . Samsung already employs an accomplished industrial design squad that has received many design accolades, including at the prestigious 2012 International Design Excellence Awards from the Industrial Designers Society of America. During the course of the trial we learned Samsung's business folk were calling most of the shots on product design, rather than its design professionals. Samsung's all-star industrial design team will likely now retake the reins -- again, this bodes well for consumers. How did Apple do it? Apple and Samsung are prolific users of the U.S. design patent system. In 2001, Apple was issued ten U.S. design patents while Samsung was issued eight. This year, Apple is on pace for 160 U.S. design patents, and Samsung is tracking toward 500. With Apple's design patent rights carrying the day, the silver lining for Samsung is that its investment in its large design patent portfolio has been fortified. But Samsung brass may still be left scratching their heads as to how Apple scored this latest triumph. Apple ruling will hurt -- but not for long . Apple's playbook for success in this case boils down to four things. Firstly, the company has top-down understanding of the importance of design in the consumer's purchasing decision. Secondly, it has top-tier industrial design team who created appealing designs that drove product demand so much so they created an insatiable desire to emulate. Thirdly, the company has a sophisticated and aggressive design patent acquisition program. Finally, it has a desire to expend significant effort and resources to enforce and defend product design. It will be interesting to see which Apple competitors seek to emulate this strategy for success. For now this case will serve as an ordinary example of how our patent system was designed to work. Company A innovates and patents; in response, Company B advances the arts and sciences beyond the efforts of Company A. Soon, Company A will be chasing Company B and so on and so forth. All along, the public is the beneficiary of the advancements and innovations. Let the designing begin.","Lawyer Christopher Carani: The Apple verdict is a victory for consumers, design rights and the patent system .

"(CNN) -- A body found Tuesday in Rhode Island's Providence River has been identified as that of Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student who had been missing since mid-March, police said. No foul play is suspected, police said, citing the state medical examiner's office. It might take two months to determine the cause of death of the 22-year-old philosophy major, said Dara Chadwick of the Rhode Island Health Department. The identification was made through forensic dental examination, Chadwick said. His relatives' search for Tripathi was detailed on a Facebook page, ""Help us find Sunil Tripathi."" They had temporarily taken down the page after they were inundated by ugly comments when he was falsely identified on social media as a possible suspect in last week's Boston Marathon bombings. Tripathi was last reported seen early March 16, on a security video walking south on Brook Street in Providence, near his home. His last recorded computer activity was shortly before that sighting. ""He was seen on the 15th, Friday, hanging out with his friends, talking to family members, all normal activities, nothing out of the ordinary that anyone detected,"" his brother Ravi told CNN affiliate WPRI on April 10. Tripathi had been on leave from the Ivy League school, meaning he was granted time off but remained a student there. He was trying to figure out what he wanted to do, Ravi told WPRI. He described his brother as a quiet person who enjoyed the little things in life. His preferred food was vegetarian, and he was a talented saxophonist, the family said.

The operation was conducted at a place of worship in Dar Ul-Arkam in southern Moscow, state-run RIA Novosti reported, citing information from law enforcement agencies. Members of Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, carried out the raid along with police. Russia Today, a state-funded television network, said the FSB issued a statement about the raid. This site has been visited in the past by suspected radicals -- some from the North Caucasus region, which includes Chechnya -- the RIA Novosti report said.","State news: The operation targeted suspected members of Islamic extremist groups .

"(CNN) -- Southwest Airlines passenger Matthew Harper says he was singled out because of his weight before a recent Chicago to Denver flight, told by a flight attendant that he could be removed from the aircraft, according to CNN affiliate KDVR. ""We're people too. I get out and I work every day. You know, it's discrimination,"" said Harper, who weighs 340 pounds. ""We sincerely regret Mr. Harper's unhappiness over his experience,"" said Southwest in an e-mailed statement. ""We have personally called Mr. Harper to offer him our apologies and better understand his concerns. It's important to clarify that he did travel as scheduled -- we did not deny him boarding. Our employee informed him of our policy, and he proceeded to travel as scheduled."" Airline squeeze: It's not you, it's the seat! Southwest's ""customer of size"" policy suggests that customers purchase a second seat in advance if they know they'll need it on the flight. The rule of thumb: not encroaching on ""any part"" of the neighboring seats. ""The armrest is considered to be the definitive boundary between seats; width between the armrests measures 17 inches. The purchase of additional seats serves as a notification to Southwest of a special seating need, and allows us to adequately plan for the number of seats that will be occupied on the aircraft."" The airline will refund the cost of the second seat after the flight. As airlines pack more passengers into their aircraft and charge for amenities like legroom and first-on-board boarding rights, how do you think people who don't fit into those seats should be treated by the airlines?

"Experts are predicting a record voter turnout for tomorrow's presidential election. Long lines greeted early voters in Miami, Florida, last Thursday. That means long lines, and many people stewing over the amount of time they have to wait to cast their ballots. We all get angry at times, but it's what sets us off and how we manage that anger that set us apart. ""It's hard to say that anger is normal or not normal,"" said Mark Crawford, a Roswell, Georgia-based clinical psychologist. ""It's how angry you allow yourself to become that's either healthy or unhealthy."" The American Psychological Association said anger may result in physiological and biological changes. ""It's a flight or fight response,"" Crawford said. ""Basically, my heart rate gets high or my blood pressure gets higher. Adrenaline and noradrenaline start secreting and it's energizing me to do something."" He acknowledged that mismanaging anger can have a negative effect on health including increased cardiovascular problems such as heart attack and stroke, as well as poor lung function. Among his patients, Crawford revealed that he usually sees two extremes of anger: those who get too angry and those who ignore it all together. ""It's a good thing to become angry if someone is mistreating you, if you're being exploited, if someone is cheating you or someone is abusing you in a relationship,"" he said. ""That is a healthy response."" What's not healthy, he said, is ignoring a troubling situation and holding in your emotions. That can lead to depression and anxiety. Similarly, he doesn't recommend giving full vent to your anger and ""letting it all hang out."" ""If you found yourself breathing fast and really pushing to get your words out and your voice keeps rising, you're getting too angry and you need to de-escalate,"" Crawford suggested. Professional therapists can help you determine whether your temper is out of control. One way is to undergo psychological testing that determines the intensity of anger and how you deal with it. ""Professional therapists can give you tools to get things under control. Not to make it go away, but to help control anger,"" he said. He typically asks his patients whether they are using the anger to make positive changes or are ""you letting it hijack you so you're reacting in an overly aggressive way?"" Crawford said some may find relief on their own and conduct their own version of anger management. ""The most effective thing is to slow your breathing down,"" Crawford said. ""Take nice, slow, deep breaths. Just de-escalate your heart rate."" The American Psychological Association recommended breathing from the diaphragm. Shallow breathing from your chest won't be as relaxing, the group said. Another way to cool off is to repeat calm sounding words or phrases such as ""relax"" and ""take it easy,"" the APA suggested. Crawford also touted the benefits of hitting an imaginary pause button during an angry situation and calling for a time out. Redirecting your thinking can keep your temper from rising, he said. Avoiding stimulating chemicals such as caffeine, alcohol and nicotine might make a difference. ""A lot of times I'll find people who are constantly angry and hot headed are ramped up on caffeine so their heart rate is already pretty high,"" he said. Finally, Crawford urged his patients to review their past and consider whether they are harboring a grudge. ""You need to go back and see if there is anyone you need to forgive because...that can really make you angry at other things.""","Anger is normal but what sets us off and how we react make a difference .

"(CNN) -- The bombing of the Boston Marathon has been described by some as another wake-up call. Regrettably, it seems we've hit the snooze button too many times to say that this time we've really woken up. Our vulnerability to attacks such as the one at the marathon has been well known for some time. We have long been concerned that attackers would focus on soft targets in which many people gather in open and easily accessible areas. Moreover, these targets lack the sophisticated security measures that one would find at a chemical plant or federal building. Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, are one of the biggest threats to the United States. The bombs used in the Boston Marathon cost less than $100 to make from materials that can be commonly purchased and with instructions found on the Internet. Opinion: Don't ignore the threat of IEDs . Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero, director of the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization at the Department of Defense, stated in his July 2012 testimony before the U.S. House of Representative Homeland Security Committee that: ""It is clear the IED is the primary weapon of choice for threat networks globally and is one of the enduring operational and domestic security challenges for the foreseeable future. ... The domestic IED threat from both homegrown extremists and global threat networks is real and presents a significant security challenge for the United States and our international partners."" The Boston Police Department was about as well prepared to address this threat as any police department could be. Boston has had a number of high profile events in the past years to be ready for unexpected events. The city has received millions of dollars in Homeland Security grants and the police force recently conducted a DHS sponsored multijurisdiction IED training program. Still, at least two suspects were able to exploit the vulnerability of the marathon. The important questions now are not just who was responsible for the attack, but how can we prevent similar attacks? We have to concede that it takes money and resources to prevent and fight attacks. But it's harder in this belt-tightening time. For example, the budget for the Office of Bombing Prevention, a Department of Homeland Security office charged with the mission of leading the department's ""efforts to implement the National Policy for Countering Improvised Explosive Devices and enhance the nation's ability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and mitigate the terrorist use of explosives ...,"" has had its budget cut or reallocated with rumors of further cuts in 2014. To be fair, the Office of Bombing Prevention isn't the only federal entity that deals with IEDs. The Transportation Security Administration, FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives all have efforts aimed at helping the private sector and law enforcement agencies prevent IED attacks. However, the Office of Bombing Prevention has an important mission of enhancing counter-IED capabilities through coordination of bombing prevention efforts. Rather than cutting its budget, we should increase it. Barbero's department requested a $1.9 billion budget for 2013. It is a highly effective organization that saved many lives through the use of intelligence, technology and equipment in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now that we have withdrawn from Iraq and will be doing so from Afghanistan, we should reallocate some of those resources to focus on domestic threats and to prevent attacks at home. IEDs are a low-cost high-consequence type of weapon that will take significant financial and personnel resources to defeat. The alternative will be the loss of more lives and millions of dollars in investigative and recovery efforts if more attacks happen. We need to increase the Office of Bombing Prevention budget so we can train state and local law enforcement and private sector security, because they are the front line in our defense. Above all, we should never submit to the fear that deranged minds may attempt to instill in us. The people of this country are too strong and resilient to ever cower before acts of terrorism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert P. Liscouski.","Robert Liscouski: Improvised explosive devices are one of the biggest threats to the U.S.

"Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- A parolee believed responsible for killing Colorado's prison chief racked up more than two dozen disciplinary charges behind bars, including threatening to kill a guard and make her ""beg for her life,"" according to prison records released Thursday by the state Department of Corrections. The documents paint a portrait of 28-year-old Evan Ebel as a volatile and, at times, dangerous inmate, who threatened guards, fought with other inmates and disobeyed orders. The release of the records came the same day that a Colorado law enforcement official told CNN that Ebel left prison after serving the entirety of his sentence wearing tracking ankle monitor. The official, who examined Ebel's prison file, spoke on condition of anonymity. It is not immediately clear from the official's statement how long Ebel was supposed to wear the monitoring device or whether he was wearing it when authorities say he killed Colorado Department of Corrections director Tom Clements. Clements was shot to death at his home outside Colorado Springs on March 19. Ebel was killed two days later in northern Texas in a gun battle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded. Texas authorities: Bomb-making materials found in car . Prison records show that almost from the moment Ebel was locked up he proved to be a problem. He was written up at least 28 times on disciplinary charges that resulted in additional days on his original seven-year sentence for robbery and menacing -- infractions that saw him serve more than five years in maximum administrative segregation. Among his more serious offenses was on September 17, 2005, when he threatened to kill a female guard, saying he would ""kill her if he saw her on the streets and that he would make her beg for her life,"" according to the records. As punishment, he was put in lockdown for 59 days and stripped of visitor privileges. Over a two-year period also beginning in 2005, he threatened to kill two other prison guards as well as an inmate. Ebel's prison sentence was extended by four year after he attacked a correctional officer. He was released from prison on mandatory parole, meaning he served his entire sentence, in January. Investigators have said they are looking into whether Ebel might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements. The corrections chief earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on prison gangs, including the white supremacist 211 Crew, who once counted Ebel among their ranks. On Thursday, a 22-year-old woman appeared in court to answer charges that she purchased the gun that Ebel used in the killing of Clement and pizza deliveryman Nathan Leon. Gun links Colorado prison chief's killing to Texas shootout . Stevie Marie Vigil of Commerce City is accused of buying the gun from a weapons dealer and giving it to Ebel, who could not purchase his own gun because he was a convicted felon, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Vigil was charged with one count of unlawful purchase of a firearm. If convicted, she faces up to a maximum of 16 years in prison. It is unclear how Vigil knew Ebel, and authorities have declined to detail how the two knew each other. The gun was bought at High Plains Arms in Englewood, Colorado, the shop owner told CNN. Authorities said that the business apparently followed all Colorado laws in the sale. Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car. Investigators also found a pizza box and a pizza delivery uniform jacket that they believe links Ebel to the death of Leon, who worked as pizza delivery driver. Authorities have speculated that Ebel may have killed Leon for his uniform -- to use it as a disguise in the killing of Clements, who was gunned down after he opened his front door. In Texas, Ebel was driving a black Cadillac, a car which matches a description that witnesses in Clements neighborhood said they saw idling near Clements' home the night of his slaying. Authorities have told CNN that the Cadillac was legally purchased, and they are interviewing individuals who accompanied Ebel at the time of the purchase to learn more. CNN's Jim Spellman reported from Centennial, Colorado, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Carma Hassan, Dana Ford and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: Evan Ebel was written up 28 times for disciplinary issues, according to records .

"(CNN) -- It seems like the opposite of what you'd expect, but my cancer diagnosis -- a staggering Stage IV colon cancer diagnosis, delivered to me at the age of 28 -- gave me a new lease on life. It has changed me, and enriched my life, in ways that I never could have imagined. Even in the moment I learned of my diagnosis, and the grim prognosis that followed, I wasn't afraid. I wasn't sad. I didn't feel sorry for myself, and I wasn't angry. I was ready. I was ready to fight this disease head-on and show myself -- and everyone else -- what I was made of. I believed that my will to survive, to thrive, to love and laugh and enjoy my life -- would carry me through any physical challenge. And it has. Forty-six rounds of chemo (and counting), three surgeries, 10 rounds of radiation, and here I am. I am still fighting. And I will continue to fight until cancer gives up, because there's no way I will. My fighting and competitive spirit has served me well, but my ability to be open to learning has been equally valuable. Throughout my time battling cancer, I have learned so much about taking care of my body, mind, and spirit. Just months after my diagnosis, I made the jump to strict veganism. I drink green juice, not alcohol. I exercise daily. I manage stress levels and I make sure I always get enough sleep. I've done acupuncture, reiki and guided meditation. I take deep breaths. I smile and laugh and listen to great music and appreciate beautiful things. I soak in my life and I am constantly grateful. Becoming sick was the way I learned how to be well. 'On Looking': The world you're not seeing . By far, the best part of my cancer-killing adventures has been becoming a part of a community of cancer warriors and their loved ones. My fellow patients are more than just friends. They are my brothers and sisters in this fight. When they do well through treatment, I celebrate with them. And when they struggle -- or die -- I am just as upset about it as if they were a part of my family. That's because they are. My best friend in the cancer world, a fellow warrior and a phenomenal woman named Annette, passed away at the end of last year. Losing her has been one of the most difficult things I've ever had to endure. But her fighting and undefeatable spirit, and my desire to honor her, have helped fuel the fire in my belly. It has helped me push forward with my mission: My mission for the cure. It's called The Wunder Project. A simple but revolutionary initiative that sees every penny donated going to cutting-edge research that I hope will get us to the cure for colon cancer in under 10 years. It sounds crazy, right? The cure. But this is real. And I'm betting my life on it. Several months ago, I asked my doctor -- a world-renowned oncologist and researcher at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center named Heinz-Josef Lenz -- a series of simple questions. If you had all the money in the world, could you cure colon cancer? Do you know what steps to take to cure the disease? Is money the only thing standing in the way of the cure? The answer to all of those questions was an emphatic yes. Lenz and his dream team -- scientists and researchers from the United States and abroad -- are sure that they can find the cure for colon cancer if they have the funds to do the necessary large-scale research and drug development that the team has long been known for. KISS frontman: I'm deaf in one ear . It's my job, and my mission, to lead the movement to raise those funds so they can do their work. It's my job to start something unprecedented, a global uprising against cancer, focused solely on supporting the groundbreaking research necessary to change the face of cancer forever -- for all of us. The goal of The Wunder Project is to raise $250 million in two years. Through that funding, we hope to have the cure in under 10 years. It sounds like an impossible goal -- to find the cure for cancer -- but it is possible. It is within our grasp. And I will make sure that we seize this opportunity. For Annette, for myself, and for my fellow cancer warriors. From the moment I was diagnosed, I knew it wasn't the end of the line for me. I think that I always knew, deep down, that it was the end of the line for cancer. And through The Wunder Project, I know it will be.","Gloria Borges was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer at 28 .

"(CNN) -- The daughter of Peter Kalikow, the former owner of the New York Post, has been arrested after allegedly trying to sell 30 bags of heroin, court documents show. Kathryn Kalikow, 27, and Brian Whelan, 28, were charged Monday with possession of drugs with intent to sell after allegedly advertising the drugs on Craigslist as ""high quality diesel pain relief."" On Sunday, undercover police detectives in the Bronx, New York, responded to the Craigslist post, which referred to the heroin as ""stamps, diesel, H train, dope, bundles, tickets, dog food."" They set up a meeting through text messages, one of which said, ""It'll be $400 and an extra $40 to deliver it."" Kalikow and Whelan agreed on an address, arrived in a blue Volkswagen and texted an undercover detective, who went to the vehicle and questioned the couple, the documents say. Kalikow said, ""Yes I have drugs. He's my boyfriend, I was holding on to it for him,"" the records show, and she gave the detective three plastic bags, each containing 10 small bags of a tan, powdery substance. The court documents say Whelan told officers that it was his idea to post the ad on Craigslist because he needs treatment. ""I am a heroin addict,"" he said, ""and to afford the drug, I agreed to sell some of the drug on consignment for the person I buy from."" Whelan and Kalikow pleaded not guilty at their arraignments Monday and were released on their own recognizance. They are expected to return to court on May 14, said Melvin Hernandez, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney. On Monday evening, just after the arraignment, Whelan's family admitted him voluntarily to a drug rehabilitation facility, Whelan's attorney, Marvin Ray Raskin, said Tuesday. Kalikow's attorney did not immediately return calls to CNN. Her father purchased the New York Post in 1988 and sold it in 1993, and was the chairman of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority from 2001 to 2007. He now operates a real estate business based in his 49-floor skyscraper, 101 Park Avenue. He said in a statement that he and his wife ""are very concerned, and all we are concentrating on now is helping our daughter.""","Police say they responded to a Craigslist ad, received drugs from a couple .

"Washington (CNN) -- Is the clock ticking on gun control? While support for many gun control policies remains high in the wake of the horrific shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, polls conducted over the past few weeks suggest that three-and-a-half months after the tragedy, public backing for major new gun laws overall appears to have dropped significantly. A CBS News survey released earlier this week indicated a 10-point drop in the public backing of stricter gun laws, from 57% immediately after the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in December when a heavily armed gunman killed 20 young students and six adults, to 47% now. That poll was in line with a CNN/ORC International survey released last week that indicated a nine-point drop in the percentage of Americans who favor major restrictions on guns or an outright ban on gun ownership, from 52% following the shootings to 43%. Opinion: Did we learn nothing from Newtown? Other polls have shown changes within their sampling error but in the same downward direction. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in mid-March showed support for stricter gun laws moving from 54% to 52%. That two-point margin was within the survey's sampling error. And a Fox News poll released last week indicated majority backing -- but some slippage -- in support for specific proposals like banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips. ""Opinion on gun control was fairly steady over the past few years, but seemed to spike after the Connecticut shootings,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""The big question is whether support for major new gun laws has simply dropped back down to that previous level or whether the slide will continue even further."" So what's causing the drop in support? The surveys, including CNN's, offer clues. Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . ""Support for stricter gun control has fallen dramatically among two groups -- older Americans and people who live in rural areas,"" Holland said. ""In the immediate aftermath of the shootings in Connecticut, the number of rural Americans who supported major gun restrictions rose to 49% but now that support has dropped 22 points. Support for stricter gun laws dropped 16 points among Americans over 50 years old in that same time."" The new polls suggest that federal lawmakers pushing for gun control might have waited too long to act. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced late last week that he would move ahead on a bill that would expand background checks for gun sales and stiffen gun trafficking penalties when the Senate returns from the two-week recess it's currently taking. While national polling indicates extremely strong support for background checks, Reid's bill could face a very tough go of it in Democrat-controlled Senate, let alone the GOP-dominated House.","Public support for new gun measures has fallen dramatically since Newtown massacre .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is open to a ""more constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government"" following the death of Hugo Chavez on Tuesday and the expulsion of two military attaches. However, the action against the United States is ""not a sign of strength,"" according to a senior Obama administration official, describing the move as an internal political ploy to stir nationalistic fervor. The official said Venezuela's vice president, Nicolas Maduro, ""is not charismatic"" and is trying to sustain the Chavez legacy and win an election by advancing ""conspiracy theories."" Chavez died of cancer, Maduro said. President Barack Obama said in a statement that the United States ""reaffirms its support for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship"" with Venezuela's government. ""As Venezuela begins a new chapter in its history, the United States remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles, the rule of law, and respect for human rights,"" the statement said. Maduro assumes the interim presidency and elections will be held in 30 days, Venezuela's foreign minister, Elias Jaua, said during an interview aired on state-run broadcaster VTV. The Obama administration wants the election to be ""free and fair and credible,"" according to the administration official. Hugo Chavez's death draws sympathy, anger . Maduro made no mention of running for election in his public comments on Tuesday. But he is widely expected to be the United Socialist Party of Venezuela's candidate and is considered the frontrunner by Latin American experts. The United States will stay out of the election. And the administration official said it remains open to restoring diplomatic relations with an ambassador regardless of the winner. However, given what occurred on Tuesday regarding charges by Venezuela against two U.S. Embassy attaches, the official said ""we need to see more than we saw today."" The Americans were accused of plotting to destabilize the country, which the State Department dismissed. The administration official believes, however, it is ""counterproductive to be at odds"" with the Venezuelan government. Another administration official said expulsion of the U.S. military aides was a sign the Venezuelan leadership is feeling ""uncertain, unsure and weak,"" and that a more constructive relationship with the United States was ""really up to the Venezuelans if they want that."" But senior American officials don't expect the relationship to change dramatically in the short term primarily because Chavez's system still exists. Opinion: Chavez used force of personality to win votes, influence leaders . The United States, these officials say, will want to see a break with that and movement toward a democratic process. The officials believe that Chavez adherents led by Maduro will want to maintain the same approach, but could be more pragmatic and less confrontational. However, there are strong anti-Venezuelan views on Capitol Hill and it would be difficult to confirm an ambassador. That could change if there is cooperation on issues like counter-narcotics or counter-terrorism, the officials said. The Obama administration is expected to try and get Venezuela to impose sanctions on Iran, which the country has repeatedly violated, they added. Latin American experts believe Chavez's death could change the dynamic in the region, not only between the United States and Venezuela, but also among Latin American countries. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Chavez ruled ""with an iron hand"" and his death has left a ""political void that we hope will be filled peacefully."" ""With free and fair elections, Venezuela can begin to restore its once robust democracy and ensure respect for the human, political and civil rights of its people,"" the New Jersey Democrat said. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Chavez a ""destabilizing force in Latin America"" and an obstacle to progress. ""I hope his death provides an opportunity for a new chapter in U.S.-Venezuelan relations,"" the Michigan Republican said. iReport: Share your reactions .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Galaxy star David Beckham will be leaving the team after its MLS Cup game December 1, team officials announced Monday. The famed English midfielder joined the Galaxy in 2007, raising the profile of Major League Soccer in the United States and helped lead the team to the league title in 2011. Monday's announcement comes 10 months after he signed a new two-year contract with the team, turning his back on a number of offers from leading European clubs. The statement gave no indication where Beckham was headed, but in a statement released by the team, he said he ""wanted to experience one last challenge before the end of my playing career."" ""I don't see this as the end of my relationship with the league as my ambition is to be part of the ownership structure in the future,"" he added. Beckham has played six seasons with Los Angeles. The team played in the MLS playoffs four times during his tenure and reached the league title game three times, including the upcoming rematch against the Houston Dynamo. The 37-year-old had a celebrated career playing for Manchester United and Real Madrid and captained the England national team before coming to America. He sought a spot on the British Olympic football team this year, but failed to make the cut. He has been a global icon of the sport for years, inspiring the 2002 movie ""Bend It Like Beckham.""

"(CNN) -- The LPGA Tour is seeking a new leader after controversial Commissioner Carolyn Bivens handed in her resignation following a display of player power. Commissioner Carolyn Bivens became increasingly unpopular with the LPGA Tour's playing members. It announced on Tuesday that Rear Admiral Marsha J. Evans, a member of the board of directors, would stand in until a replacement could be found. Retired former world No. 1 golfer Annika Sorenstam will be helping the board in its quest. ""We'll soon have in place a Commissioner to lead us into 2010 and beyond, but until then, it's important that we immediately appoint an Acting Commissioner whom we know and trust,"" chairman Dawn Hudson said. ""As a board of players and independent directors, we wanted an Acting Commissioner with experience leading large organization, one who appreciates and listens to our player members and tournament owners, understands sponsors and their challenges and needs, and has a track record that commands respect."" Bivens stood down a day after the U.S. Women's Open was won by South Korea's Eun Hee Ji, with the build-up to the tournament having been largely overshadowed by the row. World No. 1 Lorena Ochoa had been among 15 leading players who a week earlier signed a letter to the tour's board of directors calling for Bivens to step down. The 56-year-old had been in charge since 2005, when she became the first woman to hold the role in the LPGA's 55-year history. The appointment was not popular, with seven high-ranking LPGA executives quitting in her first eight months in charge. She courted controversy last year when she announced an ""English-only"" speaking policy for players on the tour, which has become increasingly international with 45 players from South Korea alone -- and many have been claiming regular victories. The LPGA was forced to backtrack following storms of protest and bad publicity. In May, Bivens was criticized after being quoted as saying that players should use the social networking Web site Twitter during tournaments to keep fans updated with their progress. The LPGA quickly released a statement claiming she had been misquoted, but it raised the ire of the players. With difficult economic times, the tour has lost some key sponsors and tournaments -- there are only 10 events scheduled in the U.S. for next year. During Bivens' tenure, the LPGA acquired the developmental Duramed FUTURES Tour and ownership of two tournaments: the LPGA Championship and the ADT Championship, which this year was canceled due to its sponsors' financial problems. Bivens secured photo licensing rights in a deal with Getty Images and brokered TV rights contracts with two channels.","The LPGA Tour seeks new Commissioner after Carolyn Bivens stands down .

"(CNN) -- A deadly earthquake that struck Taiwan on Wednesday may have occurred on a ""blind fault"" and that fault could produce a far stronger earthquake in the future, the head of the country's Seismology Center said. Wednesday's 6.1-magnitude temblor killed one person and left 19 others injured, according to reports from the state-run Central News Agency. The U.S. Geological Survey put the quake's magnitude at 6.0 and its epicenter at a depth of 20 kilometers (about 13 miles). Aftershocks from magnitude 4.3 to 3.7 were reported. Seismology Center Director Kuo Kai-wen said Wednesday's quake may have been the third large quake on a blind fault east of the Chelungpu Fault, which produced a 7.3-magnitude quake in 1999 that left more than 2,400 people dead. Blind faults are not on the country's fault maps, Kuo said. Interactive: Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes . ""Those faults cannot be seen with the naked eye and can only be determined through special instruments or exposed by earthquakes,"" he said in the Central News Agency report. Besides Wednesday's quake, temblors of magnitudes 6.7 and 6.1 struck the area in 2000 and 2009, respectively, pointing to the existence of the blind fault, Kuo said. He said the blind fault may be more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) long, making it capable of producing a quake of more than 7.0 magnitude, which is could do serious damage. ""The longer the fault, the stronger the earthquake,"" he said. In Wednesday's quake, a 71-year-old woman was killed when a temple wall collapsed on her, the news agency reported, citing Taiwan's National Fire Agency. The 19 injuries included students who were hit by books falling from shelves at local schools and a plant worker hit by a falling piece of machinery, the report said. Other damage included cracks in buildings and goods shaken from store shelves, reports said. The temblor stopped service on 90 trains, affecting 17,000 passengers.

"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) -- The sister of De'Marquise Elkins, one of the two teenage boys accused of fatally shooting a 13-month-old baby in Brunswick, Georgia, has been arrested on an evidence tampering charge, the Glynn County Sheriff's Office said Thursday. Sabrina Elkins, 19, was named in a grand jury indictment released Wednesday, accused of helping her mother get rid of the gun authorities say was used to kill the child during an attempted robbery on March 21. Authorities did not reveal her alleged role in disposing of the gun, which police found in a pond 2.3 miles from where 13-month-old Antonio Santiago died. Baby's death marks second time mom loses a son to violence . ""She was part of that, and that's the most I can answer of that question right now,"" Glynn County police Chief Matt Doering said. The grand jury also indicted Elkins' mother, Karimah Aisha Elkins, 36, and aunt, Katrina Latrelle Elkins, 33, on charges of making false statements or writings, among other things. They had been arrested earlier. None of the women are accused of involvement in the actual shooting. Police say their relative, De'Marquise Elkins, 17, and another boy, 15-year-old Dominique Lang, were. The same grand jury that indicted the women also accused De'Marquise Elkins and Lang in the shooting, prosecutors announced Wednesday. Elkins is accused of malice and felony murder, along with other charges. Lang is accused of felony murder. CNN is identifying Lang because he is charged as an adult and media in the community have been naming him since he was arrested. Investigators are looking into the possibility of a gang tie to the shooting, Doering told reporters Thursday. ""That's being explored, whether a gang involvement was part of this. And that's all that I can say right now,"" he said. He declined to say whether more arrests were possible. He said investigators remain in the field, working leads and searching for evidence. The shooting occurred on March 21 while the baby's mother, Sherry West, was walking her son in a stroller. Two teenagers approached her, and one pointed a gun and demanded money, she said. The boy with the gun said, "" 'Give me your money or I'm going to kill you and I'm going to shoot your baby and kill your baby,' "" West said. She said the boy tried to grab her purse and opened fire when she told him she had no money. He then shot at her -- hitting her in the leg and grazing her head -- then shot the baby in the face, she said. West tried in vain to resuscitate her son as bystanders called 911 for help. Sabrina Elkins, who is being held without bond, will appear before a magistrate at the Glynn County Detention Center on Friday, said April Smith, deputy clerk at the Glynn County Magistrate Court. Mom to teenage son accused in baby shooting: 'I love you' Victor Blackwell reported from Brunswick, Georgia; Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; and CNN's Chris Youda contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigators looking into possibility of gang tie to shooting, police chief says .

"(CNN) -- Despite what people think, The Great White Way isn't a vast wasteland filled with has-been stars, television talent competition show rejects and washed-up celebrities; it's actually a draw for high-wattage thespians who want some fat on which to chew. It is a popular belief that major stars only do Broadway shows after they've lost their luster in Tinsel Town. But shows are featuring major, current box-office draws. There's ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe, who recently played to sold-out audiences in the Broadway revival of ""How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying."" And there's ""Avengers"" hottie Scarlett Johansson, who won a Tony Award for her acclaimed debut in the 2010 revival of '""A View From the Bridge."" More and more stars seem to be trading in the Hollywood high life for the big, bright lights of Broadway, even it's for a limited time only. When celebs such as Denzel Washington ('""Fences'""), Hugh Jackman ('""The Boy From Oz'""), Kevin Spacey (""The Iceman Cometh""), Julia Roberts (""Three Days of Rain""), Al Pacino (""The Merchant of Venice""), Samuel L. Jackson (""The Mountaintop""), Nicole Kidman (""The Blue Room"") and even Madonna (""Speed the Plow"") show up on the boards of Broadway shows for their usual short engagements, it's viewed as once-in-a-lifetime events. Gallery: Bradley Cooper and other stars on stage . For good reason, too. While snooty theater purists might bristle at the thought of ""outsiders"" infiltrating their community, Hollywood stars joining shows usually cause a media frenzy and bolster box office sales. ""I think everybody wants to be in a good show,"" longtime theater industry insider Irene Gandy told CNN. ""I mean, these are great playwrights, and you have to have some chops to do this material."" For Broadway: A moment in the sun . Gandy, who along with producer partner Jeffrey Richards, oversees two of this season's biggest shows: the masterful musical ""The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,"" adapted by Pulitzer Prize winner Suzan-Lori Parks, and ""Gore Vidal's The Best Man.'"" Outside of the fact that both best-selling productions share the same producers at their respective helms, the shows also feature actors who have become household names from their television work: Audra McDonald (""Private Practice"") and David Alan Grier (""In Living Color"") have both been nominated for Tony Awards for their roles in the fabled musical about hard living in 1920s South Carolina. Broadway royalty Angela Lansbury (""Murder She Wrote""), Candice Bergen (""Murphy Brown""), John Larroquette (""Night Court"") and Eric McCormack (""Will & Grace"") are hitting high marks with the political thriller about the double-dealing and dirt-digging surrounding a presidential election. James Earl Jones also stars in the play, directed by Michael Wilson. Throughout the years, Gandy and Richards have also worked on a string of shows starring major TV actors including: Tom Selleck (""Magnum PI"") in ""A Thousand Clowns""; Alan Alda (""M*A*S*H*"") in a revival of ""Glengarry Glen Ross""; ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Will Ferrell's George W. Bush parody ""You're Welcome America""; a revival of ""Speed the Plow'"" starring Jeremy Piven (""Entourage""); and David Mamet's short-lived ""Race,"" which starred James Spader (""The Practice""), Dennis Haysbert (""The Unit"") and Kerry Washington (""Scandal'""). 'Something for everyone:' Broadway embraces new audiences . So what's the allure of procuring big name talents and bringing them to the theater world? ""I would say that we go after names to get people in the seats and help the box office,"" Gandy said. ""Theater has changed, and audiences like to go see people that they've never seen live before and that they are familiar with."" And audiences can't feel more familiar with a celebrity than seeing them in their homes every week on television. Take the five-time Tony Award nominated play ""Other Desert Cities,"" for example. Most of the cast members are actors renowned for their work in television: Stockard Channing (""The West Wing""), Judith Light (""One Life To Live,"" ""Who's The Boss?""), Rachel Griffith (""Six Feet Under,"" ""Brothers & Sisters"") and Stacy Keach (""Mike Hammer""). Same goes for the steamy multiracial reworking of Tennessee Williams' beloved play ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" which boasts Blair Underwood (""LA Law""), Nicole Ari Parker (""Soul Food"") and Wood Harris (""The Wire"") in its cast. Elsewhere on The Great White Way, popular current and former TV stars are serving their talents to hundreds of theatergoers eight times a week: . Linda Lavin, who starred in the CBS sitcom ""Alice"" for nine seasons after cutting her teeth on Broadway, is back again in ""The Lyons,"" playing a Jewish matriarch of a family coming apart at the seams. ""That's So Raven"" and ""The Cosby Show"" star Raven-Symone making her debut in the Whoopi Goldberg-produced ""Sister Act: The Musical,"" based on the hit 1992 movie. ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" star John Lithgow stars in ""The Columnist,"" about a powerful Washington insider with skeletons of his own. ""Sex and the City"" star Cynthia Nixon recently received rave reviews and a Tony Award nomination for her stellar work in ""Wit,"" about a scholar undergoing experimental treatment for cancer. The passion of Broadway, behind the scenes . ""High School Musical"" star Corbin Bleu taking on the role of Jesus in a revival of the 1970s spiritual spectacle ""Godspell."" ""The story, itself, is such a beautiful, beautiful story ... everybody can connect with this show,"" Bleu said. ""Godspell"" is the Brooklyn native's second stint on Broadway. He joined ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks as replacements in the Tony Award winning ""In The Heights"" in 2010. ""Broadway is the true test of an actor,"" Bleu said. ""That is the original form of acting -- theater."" ""That means that there are many film and television actors who, one, feel that they are fulfilled by that or challenged by the fact that there is no yelling of 'Cut!' "" he said. ""But also it's very strengthening to be able to stand in front of the entire audience and get that automatic feedback and have that living, breathing thing in your hand. It's a beautiful thing there."" Jim Parsons, the two-time Emmy Award winning star of CBS' ""The Big Bang Theory,"" returned to Broadway this season with the play ""Harvey."" Like Bleu, this is Parsons second go at Broadway, but his is during his hit show's summer break. Last year, he played opposite Ellen Barkin, who nabbed the Tony Award for best featured actress in a play, in the HIV/AIDS drama ""The Normal Heart."" ""I was so excited to do theater again,"" Parsons told ""CBS This Morning."" ""For me, it's nothing like it.""","A veritable host of TV actors and actresses are appearing on Broadway .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Car bombers targeted throngs of Iraqis on Wednesday as they spilled into Baghdad streets to cheer a national soccer victory, killing at least 50 people and leaving scores more wounded. Iraqis carry the coffins Wednesday of relatives killed Tuesday in a suicide car bombing in Hilla. Attacking revelers in the Mansour district of western Baghdad, a suicide car bomber killed at least 30 people and wounded 75, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Later, in the southeastern neighborhood of Ghadir, a second car bomb killed at least 20 and wounded at least 60, the official said. The attack is near an Iraqi army checkpoint. Thousands of fans had filled the streets of the capital after Iraqi athletes competing in Malaysia defeated South Korea, catapulting the nation to the Asian Cup finals for the first time. In addition to the dual Baghdad bombings, random gunfire across the capital led to the deaths of two people and the wounding of 12, the ministry said. Iraq defeated South Korea 4-3 in a penalty shootout in a semifinal game Wednesday night in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. There had been street violence Saturday after Iraq won its quarterfinal game. Three people died and 25 were wounded during raucous celebrations in which people fired guns into the air. Iraq and Saudi Arabia play for the championship in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Sunday. Meanwhile, the top U.S. commander in charge of troops in northern Iraq says that a coalition troop presence will be needed in his region over the next year and a half. But Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon told CNN on Wednesday that it is possible the number of troops in the north could drop by sometime next year. ""As I look at my area, I certainly can see we will need some level of troop presence by well into 2009. The numbers will depend on the situation,"" said Mixon, who has 23,000 troops under his command. Mixon reported strides in Operation Arrowhead Ripper, the major offensive in and around Baquba that began last month: ""We have taken Baquba back from the enemy. We have pushed them into the Diyala River valley and are continuing to attack them in the Diyala River valley."" A U.S. soldier with the 13th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) died Tuesday of a ""non-battle related"" cause, the U.S. military said Wednesday. The death put the total U.S. military personnel killed in the Iraq war at 3,637, including seven civilian contractors of the Defense Department. The number of American troop deaths for July is 58. Also Wednesday, morning raids in three cities by coalition forces targeting al Qaeda in Iraq detained 20 suspected terrorists, according to a U.S. military statement. ""With every operation coalition forces conduct we are further degrading and destroying the al Qaeda in Iraq network,"" said Maj. Marc Young. ""Al Qaeda and its foreign leadership seek only to bring violence and fear to the Iraqi people in its attempt to prevent a secure and democratic Iraq."" The raids took place in Baghdad, Mosul and Tarmiya, according to the statement. At least 18 slain bodies were found across the capital on Wednesday, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said. The total number of such deaths this month stands at 504. Iraqi authorities suspect the fatalities are the result of sectarian violence. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- The arrest of a Christian man accused of making remarks against the Muslim prophet Mohammed wasn't enough to appease an angry mob in Pakistan this weekend. More than 100 homes of Christians were set on fire by outraged Muslims in the Badami Bagh community in Lahore on Saturday after police arrested Sawan Masih, a Christian in his mid-20s accused of speaking against Mohammad, officials said. ""Mob wanted police to hand them over the alleged blasphemer,"" said Hafiz Majid, the senior police official in Badami Bagh. The mob also looted some shops run by Christians, he said. Majid said Christians have fled the area for fear of being killed. If convicted, Masih faces the death penalty. He denies the allegations made by the two men who filed the blasphemy complaint against him with police on Friday, Majid said. Masih says the three got into an argument while drinking and that the other two men threatened to publicly accuse him of blasphemy, according to Majid. ""The attack is yet another shameful incident against a vulnerable community and further confirmation of the slide toward extremism in society on the one hand and, on the other hand, the apathy and inaction that has become the norm among the police,"" the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said in a statement. The group accused police of arresting Christians in the incident ""while those who went on a rampage and can easily be identified from television footage have gone scot-free."" Pakistan's blasphemy laws were first instituted to keep peace between religions. But they have been criticized by human rights advocates who say the laws enable legal discrimination against religious minorities. At time, the laws have been misused to settle personal differences between Muslims and Christians. There have been about 1,400 blasphemy cases since the laws were first enacted in 1986, according to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. There are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan, and more than 50 people have been killed while facing trial for the charge, according to the organization. Last year, a Pakistani court dismissed blasphemy charges against a Christian teenager whose case prompted international outrage. Her detention stirred up religious tensions in the predominantly Muslim country. It also generated fierce criticism of Pakistani authorities and renewed debate over Pakistan's blasphemy laws. President Asif Ali Zardari issued a statement Saturday on the most recent ""unfortunate incident."" He noted that the country's constitution protects the rights of all Pakistani's, and that ""such acts of vandalism against minorities tarnish the image of the country.""","Dozens of Christian homes are set afire by Muslims .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek lawmakers on Sunday agreed to cut thousands of government workers to secure another 8.8 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in bailout funds. The vote clears the way for 15,000 civil servants to be fired by the end of 2014, the first time Greece's cash-strapped government has said it will cut its workforce of about 700,000. The right to a permanent position once hired by the public sector had been protected by the Greek constitution before Sunday, and about one in four Greeks is on the public payroll. Cutting that figure is part of the loan agreement between the government and its creditors, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. But the layoffs will be coming when unemployment has skyrocketed to more than 27%. Previous austerity measures have cut pay for public workers as much as 30% and reduced pension benefits. CNNMoney: Jobless misery deepens in Greece and Spain . Sunday's 168-123 vote came after heated debate in parliament and with protesters gathered outside. The civil servants union ADEDY said the measure will signify the end of the country's welfare state, but the three parties that make up the country's ruling coalition supported the layoff bill. ""We are going through a very difficult path, but this is going to be a success story,"" Prime Minister Antonis Samaras told reporters after the vote. EU and IMF officials said earlier this month that Greece is on track to reach its bailout targets. But each round of austerity measures has fueled sometimes-violent demonstrations, and critics argue the tax increases and spending cuts imposed by struggling eurozone economies have driven up unemployment without spurring growth. 28 migrant workers wounded in shooting over wages in Greece .","NEW: ""This is going to be a success story,"" prime minister says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Jill Kelley's legal team is launching a full-court press to defend her reputation in response to damaging reports from the scandal involving former CIA director David Petraeus, according to sources close to Kelley. Kelley's legal team is alleging that ""government sources"" are responsible for the leaks to the media about her personal life, starting with her name. A letter from Kelley's lawyer obtained by CNN asks whether the Department of Justice is investigating these alleged leaks, which Kelley's attorney Abbe Lowell refers to as potential violations of the Privacy Act. In the letter, Lowell opens the door to legal action, writing ""we are researching these issues to advise (the Kelleys) of their right to pursue these issues civilly."" CNN could not reach the Justice Department for comment. Other documents obtained by CNN indicate that Lowell is filing a complaint with the Attorney Consumer Assistance Program in Florida against a lawyer who once represented Kelley.

"(CNN) -- An Ohio jury on Monday will begin the sentencing phase for convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell, ultimately deciding whether he should receive life in prison or the death penalty for killing 11 Cleveland-area women between 2007 and 2009. Jurors on July 22 convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. The sole not-guilty verdict came on an aggravated robbery charge. During the sentencing phase, Sowell will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office. The defense can also call expert witnesses to discuss Sowell's background, including his childhood and his military service. Sowell has been classified as a ""sexually violent predator,"" meaning parole is not an option, Miday said. If jurors decide to recommend that Sowell die for his crimes, the judge can overrule that recommendation and impose a life sentence. But if jurors decide to spare Sowell's life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, said Greg Popovich, Cuyahoga County court administrator. Sowell's convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as ""a normal guy."" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant, where at one point one in five homes was in foreclosure and at least a third of the residents received food stamps, according to a 2010 study by Case Western Reserve University's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing. In late 2008, a woman named Gladys Wade told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer, and when she declined he punched her in the face several times. Wade said he then attempted to rape her, dragging her toward his home, and that she escaped after ""gouging his face."" Police investigated Wade's complaint, and one police report noted the presence of blood droplets on Sowell's walls and steps. But officers told CNN affiliate WKYC that the case was dropped after Wade declined to press charges. Six more women disappeared after her complaint. The first bodies were discovered after a 36-year-old Cleveland woman told police a story similar to that of Wade, as well as the woman whose 1989 account led to Sowell's attempted rape conviction. She said he had invited her into his home for beer, punched her in the face and began performing oral sex on her -- letting her go only after she promised to return the next day. Most of the women whose remains were found in and around Sowell's home had been strangled by ligature, which can include a string, cord or wire, and at least one had been strangled by hand, officials said. Seven women still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. A skull was all that remained of one victim; it had been wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home's basement. At Sowell's trial, his defense rested without calling any witnesses or presenting any evidence, according to CNN affiliate WOIO. His defense attorneys have declined previous requests by CNN to explain their case.","Anthony Sowell will receive life in prison without parole or the death penalty .

"New York (CNN) -- The solutions to America's long-term budget deficits are surprisingly simple, but they're politically unthinkable in today's Washington, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. America's failure to deal with its growing budget deficit is hurting its image internationally, according to Zakaria. President Obama proposed a $3.8 trillion budget Monday, projecting a deficit of more than $1.5 trillion this year and nearly $1.3 trillion for the 2011 budget year. Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria: GPS,"" spoke to CNN Wednesday. CNN: So the president released his budget this week, projecting deficits almost as far as the eye can see. What do you make of it? Fareed Zakaria: The real problem is not the current deficits that the president has projected. These deficits are to a large extent inescapable because of the financial emergency we find ourselves in, the rescue of the financial system, the stimulus package to jump-start the American economy. But it's worth understanding why this gets us to 10 percent of GDP, the worst deficit since World War II. And it is because, as the president points out, the budget was broken in the first place. It was broken by three decisions made during the Bush administration. The first was to have massive tax cuts, which was a decision made in the wake of the Clinton surpluses. The second decision was to have a massive new entitlement program -- prescription drugs for the elderly -- which took the fastest growing part of the American population and joined it to the fastest-rising costs in American health care, which is prescription drugs. It was therefore a marriage made in budgetary hell. And the third, of course, was to have two wars that were going to be funded without any tax increases, the first time in modern American history that that decision was made. ... A partial exception was Vietnam, which produced an economic catastrophe in the 1970s. And then you add to it the fact that we were in a financial and economic crisis and needed to spend money to get out of it, and you have the current budget problem. CNN: Right now the United States has a triple-A credit rating and the dollar is the reserve currency for the world. Do you think America's financial stability is threatened in the short term? Zakaria: Not in the short term. These are understandable choices America has to make. The entire industrialized world is facing very similar budget deficits. We have probably five years to try to bring our budget into some kind of manageable situation. And if we can't do it within five years, it suggests two things. One is that the trends at that point become so deep that fixing them at that point becomes very difficult. And the second thing is that it becomes a signal to the world that we really cannot get control of our budget. And at that point, I do think that America's reputation, its credibility, its ability to borrow vast amounts of money all will come into jeopardy. CNN: Do you think that President Obama should have taken more dramatic steps to curtail spending? Zakaria:  If he were to cut spending at this point, the economy would quite likely go into a second recession, a double-dip, and then frankly everything collapses. If you don't have growth, you have no prospect of getting out of this budgetary situation. ... But he must in a year begin really to address the serious issues that make up the budget crisis that we have. The most significant one is health care costs. ... Obama's health care plan, while it has some cost control measures, is mostly about expansion and adding to the costs. ... There has to be a much, much more serious focus on costs. The second is a number of sacred cows in the federal budget which are very large but which frankly make no sense. We have a $250 billion a year hole in the federal budget because employers are given a tax deduction for health care plans. This is actually bad for health care, because it is one of the factors that contributes to these out of control costs, because it's an invitation to have inflation in the system. CNN: Are there other large ""sacred"" budget items? Zakaria: Another is the deduction of mortgage interest, which is taken in America as some kind of great measure that has enabled Americans to own homes, whereas we have the same rate of home ownership as Britain and Canada, neither of which have interest deductions for their home mortgages. What it is really is a subsidy for homeowners to take on debt. ... We take on more debt than people in other countries and we can see that has been part of the distortion of the market that has produced the financial crisis that we've just gone through. That deduction is a hundred billion dollars. When you hear people talking about freezing this or that federal program, there you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, occasionally a billion dollars. But the real big money is in all these middle class entitlements that are regarded as sacred cows. And the third part is taxes. You're not going to bring the budget into balance unless you talk about tax increases. The only real question is what kind of tax increases. If we were to have a modest value added tax, the kind we have in Europe, it would probably raise $150-$250 billion a year. It would discourage excessive consumption, it would encourage savings. ... CNN: So if the solutions are so simple, why aren't they happening? Zakaria: If you take those three things -- health care, middle class entitlements and taxes -- we have effectively solved America's budget crisis. So the good news here is that we have a $14 trillion economy. There's more than enough money to have a very substantial federal budget, moderate taxes (we are still at the low end of the industrialized world in terms of taxes as a percentage of GDP). So it really is worth thinking about how strange it is, that a fairly sensible set of discreet measures could put us back into a situation where we would be the envy of the world in terms of our fiscal condition. The steps I outlined are economically simple and sensible and yet they're political dynamite. If we were to raise the retirement age on Social Security, modestly and on a sliding scale so that it was phased in. If we were to trim the benefits very slightly ... the program would be solvent for the next 75 years. And yet think about it. That simple commonsensical fix is politically absolutely impossible in Washington today. CNN: Why do you think that is? Zakaria: Because we have a political structure in Washington today, that if one side proposes any solution to these problems, the other side does not ask itself: How can we have a compromise that solves this problem? Instead they think: How can we demagogue this issue to fundraise, to win votes, to scare people, to polarize the political climate and gain advantage from it? It's almost that the entire strategy now is how can we take any proposal that anyone makes and turn it into a fundraising opportunity for our extreme wing. And if you do that, you're never going to actually solve the problems of the country because every proposal can be demagogued. CNN: You just came back from Davos. What's the view of world leaders of this American budget problem? Zakaria: There is great unease not just about the numbers ... the real unease is about the sense that Washington is no longer working, that you cannot count on the United States to be able to make hard decisions, to sort its own internal affairs out. One European CEO said to me, what worries us more than anything else is that problems you're facing now are the same problems you were facing 10 or 15 years ago. They don't seem to go away. In other words, we keep kicking the can down the road.","President Obama proposes a budget for 2011 with a deficit of nearly $1.3 trillion .

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Spain regained control of their qualifying destiny for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil when beating France 1-0 in a crucial encounter in Paris. A home win in the Stade de France, where France lifted the 1998 World Cup, would have given coach Didier Deschamps' side a five-point margin with just three qualifiers remaining. Such a scenario would have potentially banished Spain to the ignominy of having to qualify for Brazil via the playoffs but now it is their vanquished foes who appear set for such a fate. In a tight encounter, both sides wasted fine openings -- with Franck Ribery at fault for the hosts while Xavi was unusually wayward for the visitors -- before Pedro bundled home after 58 minutes. The victory takes Spain to 11 points in Group I, one more than France, with the other teams in the group -- Georgia, Belarus and Finland -- seemingly out of contention. ""I am happy because the three points put us in a good situation, but also because we stuck to our style,"" said Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque. ""We could have won by a greater margin in the end."" Only one team automatically qualifies for the World Cup from each of the nine European groups, with the eight best runners-up going into a playoff in November. The defeat was the first in a competitive match as French coach for Deschamps, who saw young Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba sent off for two yellow cards. Like the French, Roy Hodgson's England also had to settle for second place on an evening when plans for group supremacy were ripped up. The English had been looking to inflict a first Group H defeat for leaders Montenegro, a country of little more than 600,000 inhabitants, but the Balkan nation retained their two-point lead over the visitors when drawing 1-1. Wayne Rooney, who was sent off on his last visit to Podgorica, thought he had atoned when heading the 1966 world champions into an early lead only for the hosts to dominate the second half and deservedly equalize through Dejan Damjanovic. ""We're still confident we can finish top of the group,"" said England captain Steven Gerrard, whose side could be five points adrift before they host Moldova in September. Group rivals Poland and Ukraine, who co-hosted the 2012 European Championship, also won, beating San Marino and Moldova respectively, to close the gap on the Group H leaders. Elsewhere, Israel -- the only country to have played World Cup qualifiers in five different continents -- boosted their chances of returning to the finals for the first time since 1970 when winning 2-0 in Northern Ireland. The victory takes them to 11 points, level with a Portuguese side who beat 10-man Azerbaijan 2-0 in Baku, as both sides battle for second place behind Fabio Capello's Russia, who lead the group with 12 points having played two games less. Russia, who drew 1-1 with Brazil in a friendly on Monday night in London, are one of only two European sides to boast 100% records, with Holland maintaining theirs on Tuesday as the Group D leaders thumped Romania 4-0 at home to earn their sixth straight win. Group rivals Turkey, who finished third at the 2002 World Cup, endured a disappointing night as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home by a resurgent Hungary, with a team that reached the 1954 World Cup final continuing to suggest signs of a long-overdue revival. Having gifted the visitors their equalizer, the Turks trail the Dutch by 11 points with only four qualifiers left. Between them, Germany and Italy have won the World Cup on seven occasions -- and both maintained control of their groups with comfortable victories on Tuesday. Mario Balotelli continued his recent hot streak by scoring both goals in a 2-0 win in Malta, to keep Italy -- who have a game in hand -- three points clear of second-placed Group B side Bulgaria. The Germans -- who lead Group C by eight points -- defeated Kazakhstan 4-1 but the visitors had a moment to savour when Genrikh Shmidtgal found the back of the net after 46 minutes, only the Kazakhs' second goal from their six qualifiers. One of the most intriguing battles for automatic World Cup qualification comes in Group A where both Belgium and Croatia are tied on 16 points apiece, after their first six matches. Heralding a special group of players including Eden Hazard, Christian Benteke, Moussa Dembele and Vincent Kompany among others, the Belgians beat Macedonia 1-0 at home as Chelsea midfielder Hazard settled the contest shortly after the hour. The goal looked as if it could be decisive as Croatia trailed to an early Gareth Bale penalty in Wales with thirteen minutes left, before goals from Dejan Lovren and Eduardo turned the Swansea clash around and ensured Group A is likely to go all the way to the wire.","World champions Spain beat France 1-0 in Paris to regain Group I control .

"(CNN) -- Last week offered a grim parade of perspectives on the nature of terror and danger in the United States and in the modern world. The Boston Marathon bombings, the Texas fertilizer plant explosion, the earthquake in China, to name but a few. But the week also offered a glimpse of the way we have come to understand violent acts that affect us: Here in the United States we observe a hierarchy of terror. It works like this: The media and seemingly the rest of the U.S. public care most when a terrorist is successful, foreign, Islamic, and thus resonant with what has become the touchstone of our views on terror: 9/11. For such cases, no coverage or government action is too excessive. We care when casualty tolls, as measured in American lives, are high and the villain is easy to point a camera at, easy to fit into our predetermined definition of what a villain is (see point 1.) When the terrorist is a crank or is unsuccessful, we care less. When the terror happens to Iraqis or Syrians or others far from us, we care less. When the terror is not perpetrated by an individual but is perhaps the result of the actions or inactions of a company, a government body, a special interest group or nature, our concern does not approach the level it does when there is a bad guy, a foreign connection, an experience that recalls earlier terror experiences (no matter how tenuous). There has been an extraordinary panoply of tragedies in the past week on which to test this theory. On Monday we witnessed in horror the attack on the Boston Marathon. Within a day we learned of ricin-laced letters targeting members of the U.S. Senate and later in the week, the president himself. By Wednesday afternoon, the perpetrator in the letter attacks was arrested. Around 8 p.m. that evening, an explosion at a fertilizer plant in Texas devastated a town of 2,800, killing 14 and injuring 200 others. By Thursday evening, the manhunt for the Boston bombers had resulted in the identification of the two bombers, the gruesome end of one of them and, sadly, the death of another victim, a 26-year-old MIT police officer. This news rocked us, but it should also have been put into perspective by events elsewhere. The same day as the Boston Marathon attack, scores of ordinary people were killed in coordinated terror bombings across Iraq. On Saturday, an earthquake rocked Sichuan province in China, injuring at least 11,000 people and producing a death toll that at this writing was approaching 200. On Sunday alone the violence that tears daily at Syria left more than 500 people dead, most in a single town. Finally, while America was galvanized by the swift action of authorities in responding to the Boston Marathon attacks, we also saw midweek starkly contrasting government inaction in the face of a much bigger threat: that posed by gun violence in America. More than three times as many Americans will die in gun homicides this year as died on 9/11 and more than 10 times as many will die of gun violence of one sort or another. Yet, the United States Senate demonstrated this week that it does not see this as a problem of any great urgency. Truly, it appears not all terror is created equal. But this is not all we've learned about terror this past week. We saw anew that we cannot ever eliminate its threat, but that when cities react calmly and with courage, the impact of attacks can be limited and the goal of the terrorist to produce mayhem can be defeated. And we saw in the well-trained first responders, effective mail screening facilities and impressively swift law enforcement pursuit of wrongdoers that the investment we have made in preparation has paid off. The Boston attack has also compelled us to consider terror's hidden costs. In debating whether or not to read Dzhokhar Tsarnaev his Miranda rights and in shutting down an entire city in search of a single 19-year-old, we brushed up again against debates that have raged throughout this past decade. What is a proportional response to terror? When would it be better to treat a threat as a criminal matter to be handled within our basic system of laws and when should it be treated more aggressivelyâ€”even to the point of suspending basic elements of due process, as in the suggestion by some to treat Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant? Or do we do damage to our national reputation and character as we did in the decade past with the contra-constitutional provisions of the Patriot Act or our actions at Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo? In short, once again we must ask, how much damage are we doing to ourselves in our efforts to stay safe or pursue justice? Terror and terrorists are real and their stories are compelling, but we ought to remember that by far the biggest threats we face come from elsewhereâ€”from what might be corporate negligence or greed; from natural disasters or the heedless abuse of the environment; from people who find it far too easy to get their hands on guns or from leaders who twist their interpretation of the Constitution to overreact to one threat even while ignoring and exacerbating another.

"(CNN) -- ""Damn it, I knew I needed to get in touch with George when I'd heard he was ill, that he had been admitted to the hospital for respiratory ailments. How did I let this happen?"" Those where my initial thoughts sitting on the tarmac at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport reading the texts and e-mails about George Jones's death Friday morning. George was a friend, a country music legend, an influence to me and to countless other musicians. If you aren't able to fully hear and appreciate George Jones' voice, you really can't fully appreciate country music. His voice opens up country music's depth and power. You feel it or you don't. It helps to have done some living and to have had your heart broken, like George did. And it really helps if you can hang around one of its greatest singers, which I was fortunate enough to do over the years. During a show at the Ryman Auditorium in the mid-'90s, I heard the great bluegrass singer Peter Rowan say that if you have a musical hero, you should do anything you can to be near that person. For him that meant driving Bill Monroe's tour bus. For me, it meant hanging around Terry Eldredge, my hero when I moved to Nashville, and the lead singer of a band called ""The Sidemen,"" which played Tuesdays at the Station Inn. Stars react to legend's death . Terry idolized George Jones. It was through him that i began to ""hear"" George, not just listen to him. There is a big difference between listening and hearing. I had listened to George growing up with my dad, a big country fan. I had listened to him in high school again, when I discovered Hank Williams Jr. and found out Hank also loved George. But it wasn't until I was in Nashville and hanging out with Terry that I finally heard George Jones. I finally got it. The tone and the ache of his voice clicked. I heard how every word George sang was first filtered through a broken heart. We became friends eventually. From time spent together backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, visits at the home of George and his wife, Nancy, dinner at his favorite O'Charley's or Logan's Roadhouse, I cherished every moment in his presence, getting to hear firsthand accounts of stories I had read, the jokes and the laughter, the love between him and Nancy. Having the opportunity to sing to George from the Opry stage for his 75th birthday in 2006 and to record in the studio together are unforgettable highlights of this crazy honky tonk dream. People will always say that ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" was George's best song and perhaps the greatest country song of all time. I certainly wouldn't disagree. But do yourself a favor and dig a little deeper. One of those nights when you are feeling down or lonesome, instead of going to the usual modern day distractions, grab some whiskey and listen to ""A Picture of Me (Without You),"" ""The Cold Hard Truth,"" ""A Good Year For The Roses,"" or my favorite, ""The Door."" Put your heart in George's hands and trust that he will take care of it. That is what great country music (at least my favorite kind) and great country singers do; that is what country is all about: consoling the lonely, letting you know someone else has been there and has felt the way you do. It's about walking you through the hard times. My dad was a member of this country's greatest generation. He grew up in The Depression and fought in WWII. There aren't many left. George is a member of country music's greatest generation. And there are only a handful of those men and women left. Go to their shows, talk to them if you can. Let them know how much you appreciate their music and if you are lucky enough, their friendship. Let them know the impact their singing or songwriting has had on your life. But don't do it for their sake, do it for your own. So that when they are no longer with us, you might feel just a little less sad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dierks Bentley.","Dierks Bentley: His friend and inspiration, country music legend George Jones has died .

"(CNN) -- The body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev lies unclaimed in a state morgue. Authorities had not yet determined a cause of death on Wednesday, and no one had stepped forward to claim the body, said Terrel Harris, a spokesman for the Massachusetts state medical examiner. The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said she wanted her son to be buried near a Cambridge mosque and told CNN earlier in the week that family members had arranged for a funeral on Tuesday or Wednesday. But the Islamic Society of Boston said Wednesday that the family had not contacted local mosque officials with any funeral requests. The leadership of mosques in Cambridge and Roxbury have discussed the issue and decided that they will hold a funeral for Tsarnaev if they are asked by the family, said Nichole Mossalam, a spokeswoman for the executive director of the Islamic Society of Boston. In Islam, she said, ""we don't have excommunication. ... This is our obligation."" Suspects' mother shares doubts about bombing . Usually, Muslims are buried the same day as their death. But in addition to the delays required by an autopsy and the massive investigation into the bombings, several Muslim leaders in the Boston area have said they would not perform funeral rites for a man accused of committing so much violence. Since several of the top Imams in the Islamic Society of Boston are not comfortable with presiding over the funeral, they would probably have a ""layperson"" do it if asked, Mossalam said. That would be done by an organization that does body-washings and funerals for several mosques in the community, she said. The FBI says Tsarnaev and his 19-year-old brother, Dzhokhar, were behind last week's double bombing at the Boston Marathon, which killed three people and wounded more than 260. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died early Friday after a shootout with police, while the wounded Dzhokhar faces federal charges that could lead to a death sentence. ""I don't care who or what these criminals claim to be, but I can never recognize these criminals as part of my city or my faith community,"" said Yusufi Vali, executive director of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the largest mosque in the Boston area. Russia asked U.S. twice to investigate Tamerlan, official says . ""All of us Bostonians want these criminals to be brought to justice immediately,"" Vali said. ""I am infuriated at the criminals of these bombings for trying to rip our city apart. We will remain united and not let them change who we are as Bostonians."" Tsarnaev attended prayers periodically at the society's Cambridge mosque, and his younger brother occasionally came along, the group said in a statement issued Monday. After he interrupted sermons twice, in November and January, to criticize the speaker, volunteer leaders ""gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed,"" the statement said. He complied. ""While these suspects did express views counter to our mosque's philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior,"" it said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has told investigators that his brother was the mastermind of the April 15 bombings and that the two were self-radicalized by the Internet, a U.S. government official said Tuesday. Investigators are trying to corroborate his account, the official said. Friend 'brainwashed' bombing suspect, uncle says . But Imam Talal Eid of the Boston Islamic Institute said this week that he questioned media accounts describing Tamerlan Tsarnaev as a devout Muslim. ""A person who is devoted does not kill innocent people,"" Eid said. The suspects' mother has said she believes her sons were framed. ""Tamerlan was the most gentle, the most nicest, the most loving boy. ... They killed him. They killed him,"" she said. ""I think now they will try to make my Dzhokhar guilty, because they took away his voice, his ability to talk to the world,"" she added. ""They did it because they did not want to truth to come out."" CNN's Brian Todd, Caitlin Hagan, Jonathan Wald, Moni Basu and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","Dead suspect's mom wants son buried near Cambridge mosque .

"LONDON, England -- Croatia demolished England's dreams of a place in the Euro 2008 finals with a dramatic 3-2 triumph at Wembley that sent Russia through as Group E runners-up. Croatia players celebrate their astonishing victory at Wembley which sent England crashing out. England coach Steve McClaren saw his selection gamble backfire in a big way when rookie goalkeeper Scott Carson handed Croatia a crucial early goal. And McClaren paid for the multi-million pound defeat with his job after England proved second best on the night in almost every department. McLaren sent on David Beckham for his 99th cap along with Jermaine Defoe at the start of the second half and they briefly featured in a revival that saw England draw level. At that point they were back on course for the finals with only a point required, but Croatia struck again -- and Russia confirmed their qualification with a slender 1-0 victory in Andorra. Dmitri Sychev scored the all-important goal just before the break to give Guus Hiddink's side victory. But the Russians survived a missed penalty from Denis Kolodin and the late sending-off of Andrei Arshavin to secure their ticket to the Alps. There was an expectant atmosphere inside Wembley following the life-line thrown to England by Israel after their win over Russia on Saturday. But all that changed after eight minutes when a glaring error by 22-year-old keeper Scott Carson handed Croatia the lead on a pitch left partly waterlogged by a torrential pre-match downpour. Niko Kranjcar tried his luck on the unpredictable surface with a speculative 25-yard effort and Aston Villa's Carson allowed the dipping drive to bounce in front of him and skid into the net. Carson was surprisingly thrown into the deep end by McClaren in place of regular keeper Paul Robinson having only made his debut in last Friday's friendly international in Austria. The home fans were stunned by Carson's howler but England tried to retaliate in a positive manner. Crouch set up a great chance Shaun Wright-Phillips but his angled drive from 10 yards was straight at keeper Stipe Pletikosa. The wasted opportunity was put into sharp focus after 14 minutes when another breakaway saw Ivica Olic double Croatia's lead. Eduardo da Silva made a weaving run to the edge of the England box and the Arsenal player timed his pass to perfection as Olic beat the offside trap. He kept his cool and calmly rounded Carson before sidefooting the ball into the left-hand corner. McClaren sat shell-shocked in his dug-out as England looked to be throwing away the life-line handed to them by Israel after their win over Russia -- and they left the field at half-time to a chorus of boos. England's plight became more desperate with the news that Russia were leading in Andorra and McClaren made a double substitution, bringing on Beckham and Defoe. Wright-Phillips and Gareth Barry were the men replaced. And Defoe was quickly into the thick of the action, earning England a penalty after 56 minutes when he had his shirt tugged by Simunic inside the box. Lampard kept his cool and sent Pletikosa the wrong way as he steered his spot kick into the left hand corner to spark an unlikely comeback. Croatia twice came close to regaining their two-goal advantage in the space of 60 seconds. First Bridge was relieved when his attempted clearance under pressure from Olic went over the head of Carson and clipped the top of the crossbar. Then Carson partially atoned for his earlier error with a fine save from point-blank range to keep out a header from Olic. England were again fortunate when Olic got the better of Bridge but this time Carson was able to cling on to his low drive away to his right. After 65 minutes, Wembley erupted when Crouch brought England back on level terms with his 14th goal for his country, superbly chesting down a superb cross from Beckham drilling past the keeper. A draw was enough to put England through, but back came Croatia to cruelly smash their dreams with a long-range third goal from substitute Mladen Petric after 77 minutes, which Carson got a hand to but failed to keep out.

"Hamid Dabashi is the author of ""Iran: A People Interrupted."" He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York. His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/ . Hamid Dabashi says protesters in Iran would be harmed by U.S. aid to ""promote democracy"" in that nation. (CNN) -- On a number of occasions and in perfectly pitched and calibrated statements, President Obama has expressed his unequivocal support for the civil rights movement in Iran without appearing to interfere in Iranian domestic affairs. This has been particularly admirable given the pressure that is coming his way from a U.S. Congress that -- up until the night before the Iranian presidential election -- was discussing even more severe economic sanctions on Iran, which would have hurt precisely the young men and women the legislators now seem too eager to support. Obama can help this budding seed of hope for civil liberties even more emphatically by altogether cutting the budget ""to promote democracy in Iran,"" evidently channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development. Ken Dilanian of USA Today reports, ""the Obama administration is moving forward with plans to fund groups that support Iranian dissidents."" This financial aid is not only a waste of taxpayer money under these severe economic circumstances, but is in fact the surest way to kill that inborn and grassroots movement. It mostly will be abused by expatriate and entirely discredited opposition groups ranging from the monarchist supporters of Reza Pahlavi to the members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, and it will in turn strengthen the hand of the regime to denounce the Green Movement as funded by Americans. The U.S. government shouldn't give a penny to these groups or any other outlet dedicated to promoting ""democracy in Iran"" from the sunny coasts of California to the green suburbs of Washington. As the whole world is now a witness to it, the civil rights movement in Iran is a nonviolent demand to exercise people's constitutional rights to participate in the democratic aspirations of their homeland, turned bloody only by the custodians of an Islamic republic who seem to be too conscious of their own illegitimacy. This movement has been decades, if not centuries, in the making. And it needs no American money to sustain itself. The only thing it needs is the moral voice of the American civil rights movement to come to its aid. Just one quote from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. (or more accurately from the prominent 19th century abolitionist Theodore Parker) about the arc of the moral universe being long, but ultimately bending toward justice, will go a long way toward supporting this movement. If I were the president, I would reallocate that budget and spend it on enriching inner city public schools, enabling them to develop courses on modern Iranian and Islamic history. I would convene a national convention with the first lady presiding in which public high school teachers would be brought together to think through curricular changes that would teach the next generation of Americans more about the world in which they have to live. From the same fund I would establish an annual prize for 100 best essays on a contemporary Islamic society written by a junior from a public high school. A prize could be applied to college tuition. I would call it the Rosa Parks-Neda Aqa Soltan Prize for Non-Violent Civil Rights Movement. Not just one but four swords of Damocles are now hanging over the Iranian civil rights movement. One of them, the severe crackdown by the custodians of the Islamic republic, has already dropped ruthlessly. Iranians are more than capable of dodging it and continuing with creative ways of civil disobedience and nonviolent strategies of pushing forward from their versions of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott of 1955-1956 to their Civil Rights Act of 1968. But the other three swords are held over this movement from outside Iran, in fact from the United States government. These are 1) the misappropriation of funds to promote democracy in Iran that will in fact abort it; 2) the fear of even more severe economic sanctions that will do nothing to the ruling elite except exacerbate its belligerence while hurting the very brave men and women daring the brutality of their government; and 3) the threat of military strike that, should it materialize, will have this hopeful uprising as its very first target while creating the condition of an open military coup in Iran, turning it to another Pakistan. The United States can only lead, if it must, by example, by practicing what it preaches. Our inner schools cannot suffer from unfathomable poverty of educational tools while we allocate millions of dollars to useless, ineffective, discredited ""oppositional"" forces. Whatever the fate of the Islamic republic, the noble cause of civil liberties will remain constant in Iran and will emerge as a model for the region. By wedding the freshly cut flower of Neda Aqa-Soltan's young life in the fertile soil of Rosa Parks' memory, Iranians and Americans will finally come together in their common dreams of basic human decency. And what better president to have a hand in that union than the man who is a beneficiary of the courage and imagination of Rosa Parks and a witness to Neda Aqa Soltan?

"(CNN) -- The Manhattan nightclub where singer Chris Brown and rapper Drake allegedly clashed has lost its liquor license because of violations cited by the New York State Liquor Authority. Brown and several others were cut by flying bottles and fists in a melee at the W.i.P. nightclub in the early morning hours of June 15, according to Brown's representative. ""The SLA will not tolerate violent bars that break the law,"" State Liquor Authority Chairman Dennis Rosen said. ""This should serve as a message that this agency will not hesitate to take immediate action when licensees pose a threat to public health and safety."" The liquor authority voted Tuesday to impose an emergency suspension on liquor sales and consumption at the club because of ""a string of violent incidents,"" including a ""large brawl"" when Brown and Drake were there, agency spokesman William Crowley said in a written statement. The club faces charges on 17 alcohol license violations involving drug activity inside the club, lack of supervision, becoming a drain on police resources, and using the name ""W.i.P."" without the authorization of the liquor authority, the agency said. In total, the club was charged with 17 Alcoholic Beverage Control Law violations. The club owner can request a hearing before an administrative law judge to get the liquor license back. San Antonio Spurs guard Tony Parker is suing the club for $20 million because of an eye injury he claims he suffered during the June 15 fight. Parker claims he suffered ""a corneal laceration of the left eye and other injuries"" and those injuries left him ""unable to attend to his usual duties and vocation,"" according to the lawsuit. The suit cites media reports in alleging ""an altercation"" between Brown and Drake, though Drake's representative has maintained that the rapper wasn't involved ""in any wrongdoing of any kind"" that evening at W.i.P. Brown, who suffered a cut to his chin at the nightclub, has asserted he is a victim and is cooperating with New York authorities, his representative said. Parker was ""sitting at a separate table, apart from Drake and Brown,"" the suit said. ""As a result of the altercation at the club that night, (Parker) was caused to suffer severe personal injuries."" The suit alleges that the owners and operators of the nightclub were ""negligent in permitting Drake's entourage and Brown's entourage to be in the club at the same time despite known tension between the two"" and contends the owners failed to provide ""sufficient and efficient security."" Brown representative Jeff Raymond said a ""brutal attack"" injured Brown, his girlfriend, model Karrueche Tran, and his bodyguard. Brown and others in his group have been interviewed by New York police, Brown's spokesman said last week. A New York Police spokesman also confirmed last week the department was investigating the incident. Brown was partying with friends in the VIP section of the South Village club while the rapper Drake and his friends were nearby, according to statements from the artists' representatives. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","The liquor authority ""will not tolerate violent bars that break the law,"" the chairman says .

"(CNN) -- The moon disappeared from view along the U.S. West Coast on Saturday amid a total lunar eclipse. Images from Seattle, Washington, showed the moon's crescent waning from a Cheshire cat's grin to a shadowy sliver before disappearing entirely in the night sky. All of the United States was able to see some portion of the event, though the West Coast had ""a more complete view"" and was able to see the totality -- the time when the Earth's shadow completely covers the moon. The totality on the West Coast was timed as the moon sets and the sun rises, NASA said. It lasted 51 minutes. ""A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth is directly between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's rays and casting a shadow on the moon. As the moon moves deeper and deeper into Earth's shadow, the moon changes color before your very eyes, turning from gray to an orange or deep shade of red,"" the NASA website said. ""The moon takes on this new color because sunlight is still able to pass through Earth's atmosphere and cast a glow on the moon. Our atmosphere filters out most of the blue colored light, leaving the red and orange hues that we see during a lunar eclipse. If there are additional dust particles in the atmosphere, the moon will appear to be a darker shade of red,"" NASA said. CNN iReporter Bob Cronk took time-lapse video images of the eclipse from his condo on the 17th floor in Portland, Oregon. ""I thought it was pretty cool,"" Cronk said. ""I really wanted to see it turn red."" Instead, the moon disappeared behind fog. Watch iReporter's time-lapse images of the eclipse . NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which is orbiting 31 miles above the moon, got a front-row seat to the lunar eclipse, the last of the year, NASA said. The orbiter was to record how quickly certain parts of the moon would cool off during the eclipse, NASA said. The next opportunity to view a total lunar eclipse from the United States is April 15, 2014. CNN's Michael Martinez and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Viewers on the West Coast were able to see the total eclipse .

"North Chungcheong Province, South Korea (CNN) -- It's not everyday someone asks you if you'd be prepared to ride in a fighter jet but when my producer put the question to me several weeks ago I jumped at it. Roaring engines, heat haze on the tarmac, fighter pilots in Aviator sunglasses: What's not to like? The South Korean Air Force was offering CNN rare access to its T-50 -- a training fighter developed in South Korea in conjunction with U.S. military contractor Lockheed Martin. In 1997, just before the Asian financial crisis hit, the government in Seoul made a decision to develop its aerospace industry. The intention was to develop and produce military aircraft to protect the nation's national security and create a lucrative export industry. The T-50 is their first supersonic training fighter jet. Indonesia has already purchased 16 and at least half a dozen other countries, including the United States, are also interested. Top Gun . But my Top Gun moment in this $25 million dollar jet would have to wait until I completed a tough preparatory course at the South Korean Aerospace Medical Training Center based in North Chungcheong Province. This is where the country's fighter pilots come to train. A group of instructors greet us and take us into a briefing room where they run through the checklist for the next four hours. Then after a series of medical questions, my blood pressure is tested and I'm put into a contraption similar to the ""Gravatron,"" an amusement park ride I went on as a kid that spins and sucks you to the wall, to test my body's aptitude for the pressures of flying at supersonic speeds. ""If you don't pass 6Gs in the simulator you won't be able to go up in the fighter jet,"" my instructor informs me matter-of-factly, referring to the simulator's force of acceleration -- six times that of the normal force of gravity. Extreme forces . Dressed in my pilot's fatigues, I follow the instructor along the long corridor to a room housing an enormous contraption that looked like something belonging NASA. It was a capsule suspended on a long arm pinned to the floor in the middle of room. The basic idea was that it would spin really fast in one direction creating extreme forces of gravity I would have to endure while strapped in. The instructor runs through the bizarre breathing exercises required to help endure the G-forces and stop me blacking out. ""Do this ... say the word 'HICK' ... hold your breath for 3 seconds ... then quick breaths in and out. Now you practice,"" he orders. My attempt results in a choking sound that send me into a fit of giggles, provoking a concerned look from my instructor. After reassuring him that I would keep practicing, I climb the stairs of the simulator and am strapped into the seat with my helmet on. Ahead of me on the screen, I'm presented with an enormous virtual runway, the horizon and a vast blue sky spanning 270 degrees. I was ready to fly. At least that's what I thought. Take off . The commander in the control room speaks to me through my headset. He can see me in his monitor. ""Now don't forget to clench your body and breathe,"" he says. The capsule starts moving as a computer-generated voice counts down to ""take off."" Suddenly I'm spinning and there's an enormous weight on my body. I'm trying to breathe but the pressure is overwhelming. Then the room goes black and my head jolts forward -- I've lost consciousness. The simulator grinds to a halt, and I awaken to the concerned voice of my instructor. ""Are you alright? Coren can you hear me?"" I come to and ask him what happened. ""You got to 6Gs but you only lasted two seconds before you blacked out,"" he informs me. ""You need to last 20 seconds to pass the test."" As I climb out of the simulator feeling sick, the instructor smiles at me with a knowing look. ""Don't worry this is normal. Everyone blacks out the first time. You'll get it on the next go -- trust me."" Utter dread . Twenty minutes later I'm back in the simulator but this time there's no sense of excitement, just utter dread. I take deep breaths as the capsule picks up speed. ""3,2,1 ... HICK ... breathe, Coren keep breathing!"" my instructor's voice commands. I'm trying to breathe but it feels like a building has collapsed on my chest. I'm gritting my teeth, clenching my body, desperately trying to fight the G-forces and stop the blood rushing from my brain but I can't hold on. I black out again -- this time my eyes roll back in my head. ""Coren, Coren are you ok? That was better ... you got to 10 seconds,"" the voice in the control room says. Only 10 seconds? How the hell am I going to do this? As I climb down from the simulator with my legs shaking, the instructor suggests a break and some other tests. I head for a pressure chamber where I have to sit for 40 minutes breathing through a mask to simulate a climb to 25,000 feet. But I'm feeling cold, struggling to breathe, feeling anxious and desperately fighting the panic that wants to invade my mind and body. Once we reach the desired altitude, the control room asks me to write my name continuously on a piece of paper. By the seventh attempt my writing looks like that of a five year old. I have no control over my hand and I feel like vomiting. But all I can think about is having to get back in the simulator and battle the G-forces. The team decides that I should watch the video of myself during the G-force test to see what I'm doing wrong. I'm shocked as I watch the footage of me blacking out -- it's disturbing. First test passed . Determined not to let this happen again I climb back in the simulator. ""Are you ready Coren? Let's do 5Gs and see if you can make it,"" the voice from the control room suggests. One less G could make the difference. My heart is racing -- I have no choice -- I have to do this. The capsule starts moving and the computer-generated voice is back again. ""3,2,1..."" The spinning becomes intense within seconds. ""You're at 5G, let's go to 6G ... push back Coren ... hold it, breathe, push back!"" The seconds pass so slowly, the capsule feels like it's spinning out of control and I'm seeing stars. Suddenly the instructor yells ""Release! Coren you've made it. You held on for 23 seconds. Good job!"" I'm overwhelmed with relief. I finally passed the test and conquered my fear. But the real test was still to come -- up in the heavens.

"(CNN) -- What's in a nombre? Apparently, for some Latinos, er, I mean Hispanics, it matters a lot. When researchers asked a group of people with roots in Latin America what they wanted to be called, they got a variety of responses. According to a new survey by the Pew Hispanic Center, the preferred term for many is ""Hispanic."" People prefer that word over ""Latino"" by a two-to-one margin, 33% to 14%. But the study also revealed that most Latinos/Hispanics (51%) don't use either term and couldn't care less what they're called. Also, in a fascinating trend, the survey found that for those who want to affix their own label, the first preference is tied to an individual's country of origin or that of their parents. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed said they describe their identity by using country of origin. Surprise. Come to find out that we're not ""Hispanics"" or ""Latinos"" after all. We're Dominicans, Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Brazilian and a couple dozen other possibilities drawn from this hemisphere. The more specific, the better. According to the survey, only 24% of respondents said they use catchall phrases like ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino."" And in a finding that will almost certainly rattle the nativists, even fewer -- only 21% -- say they typically describe themselves simply as ""American."" What does all this mean for the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States? Aside from Madison Avenue advertising firms, government bureaucrats and the political parties, it shows not many people seem to be all that fond of all-encompassing umbrella terms like ""Hispanic"" and ""Latino."" There is no Latino/Hispanic voting bloc or even one central experience that these people are all going through in this country. The concept of Latino/Hispanic unity is probably overrated, as we are reminded whenever there is an outbreak of ethnic infighting. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. The U.S. Latino/Hispanic population tends to close ranks whenever it feels attacked, harassed or marginalized, as with the immigration debate. That issue more directly impacts Mexicans and Mexican-Americans than, say, Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. And yet, in Congress, you see Puerto Rican and Cuban-American lawmakers pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. Perhaps this is because they understand that much of the ugly rhetoric on the other side is aimed at all Latinos/Hispanics -- not just Mexicans and Mexican-Americans -- and that we're all in this together. In fact, the same is true for Americans in general. We may look different, but many of us are living essentially the same lives. We need to spend less time trying to label each other, and more time looking for opportunities to empathize with one another and work together for the common good. No one asked me, but, when it comes to ethnic labels, here's my preference: ""I don't care."" The 50.5 million Latinos/Hispanics in this country have many more important issues to deal with. This is the Dickensian era for America's largest minority, representing both the best of times and the worst of times. When Latinos/Hispanics aren't being pursued by marketing agencies and Fortune 500 companies hungry for a slice of more than $1 trillion in annual buying power, they're being hounded by nativist mobs, racist politicians and the perpetrators of hate crimes. It is all mixed together. Amid all these challenges, politics and government aren't usually the solutions; more often, they're part of the problem. Those on the left should be concerned that President Obama, a Democrat, has deported more than 1.2 million people, most of whom were Latino/Hispanic. Those on the right should worry about mending fences between Latinos/Hispanics and making the Republican Party more inclusive before it goes the way of bell bottom pants. And with all this happening around them, it's foolish for Latinos/Hispanics to get passionate about the labels that others slap on them. What they are called is a petty concern. Calling for respect, calling attention to their issues, and calling out injustice wherever they see it: These are more important battles to fight. Let's get to it.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Despite the fact that some of the effects of climate change are still imperceptible to all but the most highly trained eyes, there can be no doubting the alarming picture painted by glacier melt. The iPhone application includes audio, video, slideshows and a documentary film. As these rivers of ice retreat back up the valleys they carved out, so scientists' knowledge of climate change advances, in turn helping us recognize the signs of a warming world. Now a new iPhone app is helping visitors to the Swiss Alps understand how climate change is altering the landscape. Developed by the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Bern in Switzerland and Swiss software company, Texetera, the Jungfrau Climate Guide is an interactive guide to glaciers and climate change. For a fee of 20 CHF (around $19) visitors to the Jungfrau Alpine region can hire an iPhone loaded with the app. Kaspar Meuli, Head of Communications at the Oeschger Center, told CNN what people can expect from the device. ""There are many different levels to the application. Audio pieces -- like the ones you might expect to find in a museum guide which guide you through paths on seven different trails."" At different stages along each trail, the phones -- aided by the built-in GPS -- alert visitors to particular points of interest by sounding a yodel. ""For example,"" Meuli explained, ""if you are standing in front of a glacier you will be told why it is no longer as big and provided with images of what it looked like 100 years ago, and what it might look like in the future."" There are more than 40 audio guides, plus a range of multimedia offerings including videos, slide shows and a documentary film. There are also sections which describe the various flora on the trails along with information on biodiversity. ""Everyone who tries it is quite fascinated by it,"" Meuli said. ""People are realizing that climate change is real when they see the consequences."" The Jungfrau region is home to the upper and lower Grindelwald glaciers, which have retreated rapidly in recent years. In 2008, the World Glacier Monitoring Service reported that glaciers in some regions of the world were melting away at a rate of more than a meter a year recently. Responding to the 2008 report, Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the U.N. Environmental Program, said: ""Millions, if not billions, of people depend directly or indirectly on these natural water storage facilities for drinking water, agriculture, industry and power generation."" ""There are many canaries emerging in the climate change coal mine,"" Steiner added. ""The glaciers are perhaps among those making the most noise."" In the future, Meuli says the University hopes to produce features that can be used by teachers in preparation for taking classes to the glaciers.","New iPhone app is helping visitors to Swiss Alps understand glacier melt .

"(CNN) -- We hear a lot about children with autism. But adults on the spectrum face their own set of challenges. One of the big ones? Finding and getting a job that fits their unique talents and temperaments. CNN recently profiled Sarah Still, a woman with Asperger's syndrome (a high-functioning variant of autism) who has had a tough time finding the right career environment. Her story seemed to bring up as many questions as it answered, so we enlisted her, along with a couple of experts, to address them in a live Facebook chat. Joining Still in the chat were Dave Wellman of Myriad Genetics, who has worked with and managed employees with autism as well as having a son with Asperger's, and Becky Ketts of Nobis Works, which provides job training for those with disabilities and other barriers. You can read the full transcript of the chat on Facebook, or scan through the highlights below to find out how people with autism can confront the challenges they face when finding a job. Some responses have been edited for clarity. What is the No. 1 challenge you see with those on the spectrum trying to find employment? Ketts: The No. 1 challenge our agency faces when trying put someone with a disability to work is either lack of work experience or a gap in employment. With the job market being so competitive, it is difficult to sell people as the most qualified and capable when the work history does not reflect this. This is why our agency focuses on giving people that we serve an advantage over others by training them to be excellent employees to match local employers' needs. Still: The No. 1 challenge would be to find places that are not invading all the senses at one time: too many people, bright fluorescent lights and sudden chaotic noises, where there is no room to breathe and be yourself. Those are major challenges. Many (people with autism) are extremely sensitive and it gets to us much more than regular people. For me sudden and loud abrasive people and places really do not sit well. I have to leave really fast when it gets too overwhelming. I have to go be by myself and cover my ears often. What do you wish employers knew about those with autism and Asperger's? Wellman: People with autism have unique talents and they can be some of your best employees. Get to know them. They don't need to be micro-managed or get special treatment. Simply give them a challenge, the support that they need and then get out of the way. Ketts: Employers need to be flexible when working with people with all disabilities. Most of the time, it is not as important how something is done as that it is done safely and correctly within the set time frame. Our focus is to make sure that someone is equal and not ""special"" in the workplace. Sometimes this takes some accommodations, but people with disabilities should be expected to be able to perform the essential functions of the job. I hired someone with Asperger's -- now what? Are there careers that Aspies excel in more than others? Wellman: One of the most important things is to pick the right career. Sales and marketing may be a bigger challenge because those fields need people who are more socially adept, but mathematicians and engineers need a gift for logic and reason. Just help them pick a field that is better suited for people on the spectrum. Is there a list of ""disability-friendly"" employers? Ketts: Usually agencies like mine develop those regionally. It's all about relationships and supportive employers. There are some that are large national chains and some are mom and pop operations. We try to focus on finding a job for each person based on what they would like to do rather than trying to fit people into certain jobs/employers. As a person with autism, would it be safe to tell employers during the interview that you have autism? Wellman: I would wait to tell your employer. Every employee is unique and has strengths and weaknesses. During the interview process, focus on your strengths and what it is you can offer your employer. Once you land that job, build up trust with your manager, and then if you feel comfortable with sharing that you have autism, do so, but be prepared to help them understand what it means to have autism, including the opportunities. I have Asperger's and I'm just like you . It's hard enough to get a job, and Asperger's does sometimes get in the way. Any advice on how to get jobs? Wellman: There is no question that finding a job can be a challenge for any of us. For those with Asperger's, my advice is that a little interview coaching can go a long way. One of the key things employers look for is someone that is a cultural fit to the company and team. It's a hard process for everyone involved in the interviewing process. An interview coach can help with how to answer questions and present the best you that you can be. Check with your local university or community college: Schools often host interviewing workshops for the public, and you don't need to be a student or a graduate. What can parents of those on the spectrum do to help prep their children for the workplace? Ketts: It is important for parents to realize that autism does not make it impossible to work, by any means. It may mean that someone will need a specific environment that fits their needs. It is also important for everyone to realize that employers (as well as the general public) will eventually expect someone with any disability to be able to function in the world. I think it is very natural for parents to want to protect or shield their child from anything unpleasant or uncomfortable, but it will be something that will happen eventually. Having expectations of responsibility, chores, school work, etc. is important for any child to transition from school to work. Wellman: One of the most important things is to help your child pick the right career. Spend time exploring different careers. Mathematics, computer science, graphic design are all great options for people on the spectrum. My brother always says I need to get my son into the best business school I can because of how he loves to organize things. Growing up autistic . Have you found it important to speak out publicly on workplace issues? Wellman: Yes, I feel that it has been very important to speak up. People can make harsh and often incorrect judgments about those on the autistic spectrum. If we, who understand the challenges of those living on the spectrum, don't speak up now, then the day may come where we wish we had, but can't. Ketts: I find it's important to show success stories about people on the autism spectrum going to work and successfully keeping a job. If nothing else, it gives people hope.","Experts weigh in on how people with autism can find the right career environment .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- On a foggy morning in Holmby Hills, one of this city's most gilded neighborhoods, a silent standoff is taking place outside the mansion where pop music superstar Michael Jackson breathed his last breath. It has become a familiar ritual for the players: A burly man sits in a black SUV parked in the driveway in front of a closed gate. Across the street, a woman in a white jacket and fedora camps out in a lawn chair shaded by a beach umbrella, a cooler at her side. He watches her. She ignores him. A series of lime green placards saying ""* HOT * Star Maps Here"" leads drivers from the winding curves of Sunset Boulevard into this manicured oasis of wealth and privilege -- and to the woman locals call the Star Maps lady. Her name is Linda Welton, and she was on the corner of Sunset and Carolwood Drive long before Michael Jackson arrived. She remembers well the days when he stood on a balcony of the rented chateau-style mansion and tossed autographed pillows to screaming fans. She remembers that he ordered pizzas for them and that his father, Joe Jackson, would come visiting but wouldn't be let in. She also remembers the hordes that descended in June 2009, when Jackson died on the eve of his comeback concert tour. His doctor, Conrad Murray, was tasked with making sure the King of Pop stayed healthy and showed up for rehearsals. Now he is on trial, accused of giving Jackson a lethal dose of an anesthetic to help him sleep. On the weekend before the doctor went on trial for manslaughter, Carolwood Drive was nearly deserted. Despite the property's notoriety and the looming criminal trial, there was no pilgrimage of Jackson fans, not even a lone ""looky-loo,"" as people in Los Angeles call curiosity seekers. It was just the security guard and the Star Maps lady. And the Star Maps lady was feeling shy. ""I can't do an interview,"" she said, bolting up from her lawn chair. She scurried to her white SUV and drove off, leaving a taciturn assistant to deal with the nosy visitor. A third-generation purveyor of the dishy tourist maps, Welton has good reason to be skittish. The owners of the mansion, fashion executive Hubert Guez and his wife, Roxanne, have taken her to court. The homeowners filed suit in June, calling Welton's Star Maps business ""a highly visible eyesore"" and charging that she is tanking their property value. They are asking a judge for an injunction kicking the Star Maps lady off the corner. A hearing has been set for October 18 before Judge Gerald Rosenberg in Santa Monica, according to the court file. Welton's family has sold Star Maps from the corner since the 1930s -- long before such things as tour buses, paparazzi and TMZ. They survived past attempts to shut them down or make them move. And Welton has long been a Michael Jackson fan -- so much so that she traveled the 90 minutes to Santa Barbara a dozen times to attend his 2005 child molestation trial. She celebrated when he was acquitted. On August 28, the eve of what would have been the pop star's 53rd birthday, Welton was chattier when she received a visit from a crew with ""In Session,"" a show that features Murray's trial and other court cases and airs daily on CNN's sister network, truTV. Jackson could have lived anywhere in the world, she said, but he chose the mansion on her Star Maps corner as he prepped for his ""This is It"" tour. ""It came alive in a way no other place came alive through the years of map selling or that kind of thing,"" she says. ""It's Tourist Central. Really, nobody lived there except Sean Connery, a while ago."" The fans came because Jackson engaged them, she said. And then there was the live music that poured out of the house every time Jackson practiced in his studio, which was often. ""We all heard the music that came out from behind those walls,"" Welton said. ""So a lot of fans would park their cars here. They were trying to hear the music, but they didn't really tell a whole lot of people because they didn't want Michael to stop playing. So we had the time of our lives. This was actually the biggest thrill we'll ever have. The music was absolutely beautiful."" She was on her corner on June 25, 2009, when an ambulance took Jackson away. Although he usually went to Cedars Sinai Medical Center, the ambulance turned right, toward Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, she recalled. It was followed by several dark Cadillac Escalade SUVs, and she suspected something was seriously wrong. She says a CNN producer told her that Jackson had died, and soon hundreds of weeping fans came. She gave her maps away then, telling people, ""Michael wouldn't want you to cry."" Even now, she says, ""It's like a tourist magnet. It's like a historical landmark that's not quite noted as one, but everybody knows where it is. It's the first place people really want to see when they get off that plane."" Welton says many people who stop don't even buy a map. They just want to know where Jackson's last home is. The homeowners' lawsuit makes no mention of their most famous tenant or the notoriety of the address. As far as the lawsuit is concerned, Welton's Star Maps business is what draws the gawkers. The legal action opens a new chapter in an age-old L.A. story, rekindling tensions that can arise in a city built on the culture of fame and populated by people eager to cash in on the fantasy. The case also pits two of California's most cherished values -- individual property rights and free speech -- against each other. ""It is unpleasant and inconvenient to constantly be forced to navigate illegally stopped traffic in front of the plaintiffs' home and to be daily and frequently forced to view defendant's business activity,"" the lawsuit states. The couple is trying to sell the mansion and, the lawsuit charges, Welton's presence is hurting their chances. ""The property is made unattractive,"" the suit charges. ""Potential buyers are bothered upon approach by the quite visible and annoying constant illegal stopping and/or parking of cars in front of the home that would otherwise be on a quiet residential street."" Welton, who is representing herself, considers the lawsuit ""harassment"" and argues in her court papers that the law was settled decades ago in her favor. Her mother fought similar attempts by the city of Los Angeles to shut down her Star Maps business through the 1970s. She took the fight all the way to the California Supreme Court. A copy of the court's 1978 opinion is included in the court file as Linda Welton's response to the most recent lawsuit. According to the opinion and several newspaper clippings attached to it, Welton's grandfather obtained a copyright during the 1930s for what would become the oldest continuously published map of the places where the stars live, shop and eat. Her mother, Vivienne Welton, ran the family business for 40 years before handing it down to her daughter, who has been hawking the Star Maps for more than two decades. It was during Vivienne Welton's watch that the epic court battle was waged. The city of Los Angeles declared her stand, on a grassy corner at Sunset and Baronda, a public nuisance under the municipal code and obtained a court injunction in 1973. She fought it on freedom-of-speech grounds, but the city contended that she was engaged in commercial activity not protected by the First Amendment. She lost the first round, appealed, and five years later, the case wound up before the California Supreme Court, which struck down the city's ordinance, saying it was unconstitutional. ""Battling public nuisance cannot be pursued by means infringing personal liberties when less restrictive alternatives are available,"" the court found. Attorney Jeffrey Korn, who filed the 2011 lawsuit, was in trial in another case and was too busy to talk about the Star Maps case, an assistant said. But the Guezes' civil suit is likely to fail because it cites the ordinance that already has been struck down by a higher court, said Douglas Mirell, a First Amendment attorney in Los Angeles. ""Once a court has found an ordinance to be unconstitutional, it sort of follows, as night follows day, that one cannot invoke the same ordinance and seek to have it enforced,"" Mirell said. And, he noted, last month, a federal appeals court struck down a similar ordinance in nearby Redondo Beach, which sought to stop day laborers from soliciting employment on public streets. Whatever happens in court, the scene on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Carolwood Drive has already changed. The man and his music are gone. But not the Star Maps lady. Not yet, anyway.

"London, England (CNN) -- On Friday in London's Trafalgar Square, 5,000 members of the public were served a free hot curry, free apple juice and an array of fresh groceries. The lunchtime feast, dished up by volunteers -- including the Bishop of London and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson and -- was made entirely from ingredients that otherwise would have been wasted, such as fresh but cosmetically imperfect ""wonky"" fruit and vegetables that fail to meet the supermarkets' strict cosmetic standards. The event demonstrated how easy it is to reduce the unimaginable levels of food waste both in the UK and internationally, and how governments, businesses and individuals can all help to change the way waste has become rife in our globalized food chain. Putting on an event of this scale has involved hundreds of volunteers and numerous partner organizations and charities. Before the event, over 300 volunteers have given their time to wash, peel, chop, cook and serve the delicious curry. The ingredients themselves have been sourced from farmers who donated several tons of vegetables and fruit. During the event, FoodCycle, a charity which serves up community meals made from surplus food, put on cookery demonstrations in the Field Kitchen led by popular British chefs. Tons more food donated by farmers was passed on to FareShare, a food redistribution charity that feeds vulnerable people who may not otherwise eat a square meal. In addition, around a ton of surplus apples was delivered to Trafalgar Square so that passersby can press them to make fresh juice. Friends of the Earth brought along four pigs to eat the leftover apple pulp. Feeding 5,000 people is a challenge, but according to my calculations, if we could hypothetically save all the food wasted across the UK on any one day, there would be enough to feed 60 million people (i.e., the entire nation) and still leave some over for tea-time. The aim of these activities is to demonstrate that everybody can gain by tackling food waste. The food we buy and eat is part of an international food supply chain. In straitened times it becomes ever more important to address the chronic problem of wastage in food production on farms, in factories, in supermarkets, restaurants, and in homes all across the world. Saving food really does help alleviate hunger, in rich countries as in poor ones. Tackling food waste is also good for the environment. In my book, Waste: the Global Food Scandal (2009), I calculated that 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from producing food that no-one eats. Waste has become so endemic to food production, that we now take for granted attitudes and practices that our ancestors would be appalled by. For example, until 10 years ago, pigs in Europe were often raised on a diet of food scraps. Today, however, European livestock is raised on a diet of soya imported from South America. Soya is expensive for farmers, and its cultivation contributes to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Because pigs fed on specially-grown soya no longer eat waste food, this creates the further problem of how to dispose of food waste. Food currently sent to landfill, for example, decomposes into methane, a greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The answer, as the event on Friday aimed to demonstrate, is to bring common-sense back into the food chain: eat what you can, redistribute what you can't, feed food not fit for humans to pigs, and only then turn to other waste solutions, such as composting or anaerobic digestion. We, the public, have the responsibility, and the power, to demand change. 80% of consumers in the UK want businesses to cut food waste, and Feeding the 5000 is urging everyone around the world to sign the pledge calling on food businesses, governments and citizens to stop wasting so much food. Food businesses, restaurants and retailers are being urged to sign up to the Feeding the 5000 Pledge and commit to tackling waste. We all have a role in ending the global food waste scandal. The opinions in this piece are solely those of Tristram Stuart.","Central London event aims to feed 5000 people using food normally considered to be waste .

"(CNN) -- You never know who's watching. As a child, I always thought this saying meant I had to make sure I was on my best behavior when grown-ups weren't around to make me mind. Over the past year, however, the phrase has taken on new meaning for me. In January 2012, I joined the Y and started the journey of my life. I had already been walking and working on small changes to my diet. I was determined to become the emotionally and physically healthy individual I deserved to be. I was beginning to figure out I was worth my own time and effort. The key to fitness? Schedule it in . At first my decision seemed selfish to those in my family who were used to having all my attention. When I couldn't pick up a prescription, pay a bill or go to the store for them because it was gym time, I was being self-centered. I was about to discover my family members weren't the only ones watching. I'm blessed with close friends who are all health conscious and actively fit. One of my dearest friends, Anje, had been watching me for six months and said, ""Let me help you."" Those are the four most powerful words I've ever heard. I didn't know how much I needed help until she was there every day. She taught me how to work out effectively and safely; she pushed me when I couldn't push myself. But the best gift of all was her friendship. I was now the one watching. By the end of 2012, I was at the gym six days a week. The weight was melting off, and everyone was noticing. The athlete I used to be . My co-workers would ask, ""How much?"" My family finally realized that being healthy was a serious and necessary transformation. My friends told me how proud and inspired they were. It was one thing for people I know to watch, but people at the gym had been watching, too. One day Anje and I were working on biceps when one of the regular weightlifter guys came over and said, ""We are here every day and we see you every day. We just have to say your transformation is amazing!"" That was one of my proudest and most humbling moments at the gym. A few weeks ago I was running. I had been sick earlier in the week, and it wasn't a good run for me. I was thinking about walking my fifth mile when a stranger came by and said, ""You're killing it."" I ran that fifth mile thinking about mind over matter. My relationship with my sister Judy is strained, so the idea that anything I do could affect her is shocking. Judy decided a few months ago she wanted gastric bypass surgery. I don't agree with it, but I never tried to talk her out of it. Trust me when I say weight loss is more mental than it is physical. The physical part is easy; changing your mind is the challenge. Imagine my surprise when a few weeks ago, Judy told me, ""I've been watching you, and I've seen the weight loss. But I've also seen how happy you've become. I've decided I need to work on my mind and not just on losing weight. You've done it right, and I'm trying your way first."" She's been watching the whole time. Getting fit for the family I love . I spent all of 2012 working to become healthy in mind and body. I'm continuing that journey into 2013 with CNN Fit Nation, and it's one I will continue for the rest of my life. I never knew simply taking care of myself would have such a widespread effect. Now when I hear, ""You never know who's watching,"" I realize it means I need to live life by example. I may just change another life in the process.

"Boston (CNN) -- The nurse who tended to Boston Marathon bombing victim Krystle Campbell near the finish line during her final moments of life would like to meet her parents in the hopes he could give them some solace in their grief. Stephen Segatore would like to tell Campbell's parents that she didn't die alone, and she didn't suffer for long. When EMTs carried a woman into the medical tent where Segatore was volunteering, he was struck by her beauty, her youth and her bright blue eye shadow. The freckles on her face and the shape of her eyes reminded him of his oldest daughter, who is not much younger than the woman who lay on the stretcher before him with multiple wounds, not breathing and unconscious. Even though he knew she probably wouldn't understand a word he said, Segatore told the woman he was a nurse and would take good care of her. For the next 10 minutes, Segatore, who works in the intensive care unit at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, an EMT and a physician gave her CPR. But a cardiac monitor showed her heart wasn't pumping blood. Mistaken identity adds to family's grief over Boston victim . ""The physician called (her death),"" Segatore said. ""The three of us who were working on her let out an expletive, a scream."" The next day he saw a picture of Campbell and realized she was the woman he had tried to save. He knew immediately from the bright blue eye shadow in the photo. It was his only death Monday afternoon, and it has haunted him. Now Segatore would like to speak with the Campbells to tell them about their daughter's final moments. ""I want them to know she was not alone when she died,"" he said. ""We did everything we could to save her, but her wounds were too great."" While he was giving Campbell CPR, he noticed black marks on her face, which he thinks might have been gunpowder, indicating she was very close to the blast. ""I don't think she lingered. I don't think she suffered,"" he said. ""If it were my daughter, I would want to know that."" Boston Marathon bombing victims: Promising lives lost . How to comfort grieving parents .

"(CNN) -- The passing of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez from cancer, long expected despite his condition being shrouded in secrecy, has opened a Pandora's box of questions concerning Venezuela's future. The Venezuelan constitution holds that power should have been given to the leader of the Venezuelan Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, once Chavez could not attend his own inauguration and new elections should have been held within 30 days. This did not happen. Now, Nicolás Maduro, current vice president and Chávez's hand-picked successor, will likely face divisions both from within the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and the Venezuelan military to keep his hold on power. But he also is likely to receive a challenge for the presidency from Henrique Capriles, current governor of Miranda and former presidential nominee, when and if an election is held. Conflict among the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, the military and the opposition will largely determine whether Venezuela has a smooth and peaceful transition or one that descends into violence as various factions lobby for power. Since winning his first election in December 1998, Chávez dramatically reoriented Venezuela's government and economy. His efforts have particularly focused on poverty reduction, providing housing and health services for the poor. Although Venezuelan poverty data are heavily disputed, most figures show poverty has indeed fallen. World Bank statistics show a decline from 50 percent of the population in 1999 to 32 percent in 2011. Inequality has declined as well; Venezuela has the most equal income distribution in Latin America. News: Chavez leaves a revolutionary legacy . The Venezuelan economy has not fared as well, with economic growth from 1999-2010 averaging a mere 2.7%, according to International Monetary Fund figures. This stands out, given the strong economic performance of other Latin American economies during this time and high global oil prices since the mid-2000s; oil exports comprise roughly 95 percent of export earnings for Venezuelans. Despite this windfall, the Chávez government has done little to diversify the country away from its oil-dependence. At the same time, by using oil proceeds to fund social initiatives at home, support for Cuba and other regional initiatives, such as PetroCaribe, which provides oil to mostly Caribbean countries on generous repayment terms, oil production has declined nearly 25 percent since 2001. The state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. lacks capital to maintain existing production or exploit new reserves, notably the oil-rich Orinoco Belt. This, and the horrible mismanagement of the company, have destroyed what was once Venezuela's industrial shining star. And now, with Chávez's death, a power vacuum has opened in Venezuela. Under the political coalition of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (the Democratic Unity Roundtable) and Capriles, the Venezuelan opposition is the most united it has been under Chávez. But Capriles' 11-point defeat in October's presidential election, coupled with Chávez's allies winning 20 of 23 gubernatorial elections in December, underscores the fact that the opposition still holds little power. Vice President Nicolás Maduro may not have the current president's appeal with Venezuelans, but he will still head a party with considerable influence. At the same time, the reaction of the Venezuelan military will be key to the transition. The military can be organized into three camps: one is the institutional group, focused on the effectiveness of the military and largely non-politicized, and then there is the constitutional camp. With Chávez's death, Diosdado Cabello, current president of the National Assembly, would preside over the country while new elections are called in 30 days. Speculation is rampant that Cabello, a former Venezuelan soldier who participated in the 1992 coup with Chávez, has stronger support within the military and they may push him as the next candidate. Finally, there is the pro-Chávez camp that has committed itself to the revolution and will likely follow the late president's wishes and push for Maduro. iReport: Tyrant or hero? Chávez allies have reason to be worried. Under PetroCaribe, members received generous terms for oil purchases, with payments as low as 5% of market value, and the remainder paid off through generous loan terms spread over 25 years. Even better, payment could be made in manufactured goods, with a barter system replacing payments in numerous instances. Cuba has been the prime beneficiary, receiving roughly 100,000 barrels of oil per day, which meets two-thirds of its daily requirement. If Venezuela's next leader were to end the program, or even reduce the generous terms, many countries would see a shock as import bills rise (not to mention having to face a public forced to pay much higher energy prices). Absent Chávez's leadership, the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas might also find itself increasingly marginalized. Extra-regional actors that have recently gained a foothold in Latin America could find themselves losing influence. Iran in particular will have lost its biggest supporter in the region and may find future efforts to engage stymied without Chávez's popular support. The Russian government, which has benefited from Venezuela's recent arms purchases, will likely find itself with a reduced footprint in Latin America as well. Furthermore, other Chavez-supported regimes throughout the world, from Bashar al-Assad in Syria to the North Korean government, will likely feel the effects of his death. For the United States, oil supplies could be an important concern. While Venezuelan imports have decreased in importance in recent years, falling to 8% of imports in 2011, it remains the fourth-biggest supplier to the U.S. market. If the transition were to turn violent and exports dropped, U.S. consumers could face higher prices and U.S. economic growth could take a hit. Chavez's passing also opens questions on narco-trafficking in Venezuela. Transnational crime has flourished under Chávez, with Venezuela serving as a major hub for shipment of illegal narcotics. Not only has Venezuelan cooperation with the United States declined, the United States has also added several high-level Venezuelan officials to its Foreign Narcotics Kingpin list, including former defense minister Henry Rangel Silva, for their complicity with transnational crime organizations and support for the FARC. A prolonged struggle for power would likely give these groups even greater space to operate within Venezuela. At the same time, this could produce spillover effects in Colombia, whose recent security gains, with the help of U.S. assistance through Plan Colombia, may be tested if the FARC can move more freely between the two countries. If there is a transition and new elections are called for in the coming months, regional leaders will need to play a key role in calling for a peaceful and democratic transition. The United States -- with Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Canada -- should urge for free and fair elections. Undoubtedly, Venezuela will remain divided no matter the next president, but fair and transparent elections will help ensure the next administration has the political capital to tackle needed reforms -- from a stagnant economy to rising crimes rates, rampant transnational crime and the rebuilding of the nation's powerful state-owned oil company -- that will benefit all Venezuelans.

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney press secretary Rich Gorka's outburst in Warsaw, Poland, on Tuesday, during which he told a reporter to ""shove it,"" is of a piece with the Barnumesque spectacle of his candidate's world tour. But to this veteran of many campaign tours, the incident raises a provocative question about modern campaign history: When and how did the Republicans become the championship party of whining? Rahm Emanuel brought it up earlier this month with his bracing instruction to Romney to quit complaining about Democrats' negative campaign ads. Such ads, deployed against Rick Santorum et al, were after all the instrument that brought Romney the GOP nomination. Any short history of the whining sweepstakes should start by noting that a tectonic shift is taking place when the candidates and handlers of one side begin asking, in some form, this question: Why are they being allowed to do to us what we've happily been doing to them since -- to choose a recent precedent to this partisan shift -- the swift boating of John Kerry? You see what's that led to? Why, these Obamians want to turn Romney's brilliant business career into an unpatriotic defect! News: Romney trip an 'embarrassing disaster,' Obama team says . The current situation is noteworthy because the Democratic Party seemed to have the exclusive franchise on piteous bleating dating back to Richard Nixon's victory in 1968 and throughout the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush years. Truth be told, the Democrats managed to keep whining throughout most of the triumphant Bill Clinton years. The game changer clearly has been Barack Obama, whose surprising taste for bloodying the noses of domestic critics and foreign adversaries seems to hark back to the last time the Democrats were unashamed political warriors. That would be 1960, when John F. Kennedy and his snarling little brother Bobby made political ""ruthlessness,"" unrestrained campaign spending, Teamster support and Mayor Richard Daley's vote-counting techniques into virtues. The era of bullying Democrats pretty well ended with Jimmy Carter's cardigan sweater and ""malaise speech."" Video: Romney aide to media: 'Show respect!' Then, with the victory of Reagan in 1980, the Democrats' claimed the whining trophy outright. Walter Mondale sealed the Democratic ascendancy with his high-pitched complaints about Reagan's ""compassion gap."" And it has taken Romney to mount a full-scale effort to take back the title. (Pioneering credit, however, must be given to Sen. Bob Dole with his plaintive cries of ""Where's the outrage?"" in response to voters' apparently bottomless forgiveness for Clinton's shenanigans.) To find the wellsprings of 2012 Republican whining, I think one has to look at the party's setters of tone and themes. Start with Romney and his cries of foul over the Obama campaign's use of ""Chicago-style"" politics. The vibe of this complaint is that of a suburban prep schooler who has wandered into a playground where the mean city boys took his football and then twisted his arm really hard. News: Romney trip may not matter much to voters in November . The signature moment in this year's use of the W word came in early July when an Obama staffer said that Romney was either a ""felon"" or was ""misrepresenting"" in his Federal filing about the length of his tenure as head of Bain Capital. Like much of today's campaign talk, the accusation was hyperbolic, verging on the demagogic. In other words, it was well within the strike zone the Republicans institutionalized in 1988 when they turned the GOP's amiable hitman Lee Atwater loose with his ""Willie Horton"" ad against Michael Dukakis. But when the White House dared escalate the rhetorical arms race, Romney feigned outrage. Now he wanted an apology even though he had defended his own blistering attacks last spring on his primary rivals as a standard part of grown-up politics. Romney's campaign even piled one whine upon another by running a commercial showing a plaintive Hillary Clinton saying ""Shame on you, Barack Obama"" during the savage 2002 Democratic primaries. ""Stop whining!"" Chicago Mayor Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, demanded on the George Stephanopoulous Sunday show recently. """"If you want to claim Bain Capital as your calling card to the White House, then defend what happened at Bain Capital."" There's something inescapably petulant about Romney's preference for critiquing all aspects of the economyâ€”but not his role at Bain. The Democrats should turn a deaf ear to his pleas for mercy on his record as a businessman and tax shelterer. The new Quinnipiac poll figures showing Obama ahead in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania demonstrate that Republican-style attack politics work for anyone with the gumption to use them, including this year's pugnacious Democrats. For the rest of this election season, if Democrats are smart, they'll keep reaching into the Lee Atwater bad-boy trick bag and let the season's reigning choir of complaint blend its many voices: the charismatic duo of John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, the tea party, the anchors and panelists of Fox News and now the hapless Rich Gorka. They all seem to know the same tunes: Why don't voters believe what we do? Why isn't Obama the milquetoast he looks like? Why can't we change the photo-op rules for Mitt? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howell Raines.","Howell Raines: Romney press secretary's outburst at reporters part of new GOP whining .

"London (CNN) -- Two members of the Basque separatist movement ETA, including one who has been convicted of more than 20 murders, were arrested Friday in London over alleged terror offenses, the Spanish Interior Ministry said. The men were detained at a west London home by officers from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. The Spanish Interior Ministry named them as Antonio Troitino Arranz, 55, and Ignatio Lerin Sanchez, 39. Troitino has been part of the Basque separatist movement ETA since the 1980s and was involved in many terrorist attacks, the ministry said. One of the worst was the bombing of a police bus in Madrid that left 12 officers dead and injured 51 people, including civilians, it said. Troitino was the one who triggered the bomb, the ministry said. Troitino is wanted under a European arrest warrant issued in April last year ""for belonging to an armed group or terrorist organization,"" it said. According to Spanish media reports, Troitino was let out of jail due to what is described as a judicial error, and fled before it could be corrected and he could be detained again. Ignacio Lerin, who has been on the run since 2007, when his brother was arrested as an ETA member, is wanted on suspicion of belonging to an armed group and possession of explosives, it said. The arrests have dealt a blow to ETA, the ministry said, as Troitino has direct links to the group's present leadership. In London, officers continue to search the house in Hounslow where the two were arrested before dawn, a Metropolitan Police statement said. A search of a second home has been completed. No weapons have been found, the statement said. The two suspected ETA members, whose arrests were made under extradition law, are being held at a central London police station. A 38-year-old woman also was arrested at the same house as the two Spaniards. She is accused of fraud and remains in police custody, the police statement said. Two other men at the same address were arrested for alleged immigration offenses. Spanish security forces have arrested 16 members of ETA since January, including three in the past week, the Interior Ministry said. Listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. Last year, ETA announced ""a definitive cessation of its armed activity,"" raising hopes that decades of separatist violence may finally be over. Spain's conservative government has stepped up arrests since winning elections in November. The Popular Party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has long maintained a tough line against ETA. CNN's Alexander Felton and Al Goodman contributed to this report.","NEW: Antonio Troitino Arranz's arrest deals a blow to ETA, the Spanish Interior Ministry says .

"(CNN) -- Ever wondered if a Greek is more trustworthy than a German? Or if a Frenchman is more likely to help you out than a Brit? Or which European nation is the most arrogant? As Europe gears up for the Eurovision Song Contest -- an annual event that often seems to be less about the music than national stereotypes, kitsch and dubious voting patterns -- a survey has come out this week that could add fuel to the fire. For its study of attitudes in the European Union, the Pew Research Center surveyed people in eight European nations: Britain, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland and Spain. While much of the survey is focused on the effects of the economic crisis, those questioned also give an intriguing insight into the stereotypes they hold about their neighbors at a time of austerity. Asked which EU nation is most likely to be named most trustworthy, those in seven out of eight countries picked Germany. The only ones who disagree are the Greeks, who pick their homeland as the most trustworthy -- and label Germany the least trustworthy, the most arrogant and the least compassionate. ""The prominent role Germans have played in Europe's response to the euro crisis has evoked decidedly mixed emotions from their fellow Europeans,"" the report says. ""In the wake of the strict austerity measures imposed in Greece, Greek enmity toward the Germans knows little bound."" Germany also suffers when it comes to perceptions of compassion, with six of the eight nations surveyed considering it the least compassionate. The two nations that differ on that point, France and Germany, pick Britain as the least compassionate -- perhaps a reflection of historic enmities or tensions over the European project. Britons in turn consider the French the least trustworthy and the Germans the least compassionate. Meanwhile, the Greeks themselves do not fare that well. They are considered the least trustworthy by the French, the Germans and the Czechs, the report points out. In a likely reflection of frustrations over corruption and political horsetrading, Italians consider their own country most likely to be named least trustworthy. The question of arrogance splits the French. They consider themselves both the most and the least arrogant nation. The British and Germans agree that France should be named the most arrogant, but everyone else gives their vote to Germany. The Europeans surveyed tend to hold a more charitable view of their own national character. Six out of eight countries pick themselves as the least arrogant, and every nation considers itself the most compassionate. Centrifugal forces . Other questions in the Pew Global Attitudes report, titled ""The New Sick Man of Europe: the European Union,"" reveal deep divisions and anger over the path the European Union is following. In Spain, Italy and Greece, which have suffered greatly as a result of austerity measures following the global economic downturn, public opinion is particularly bleak. Nearly 80% of Spanish and 72% of Greeks surveyed say economic conditions are very bad, while a majority of Italians say the same. This compares with a median of 28% for the rest of Europe, the report says. Unemployment is a ""very"" big concern for more than nine in 10 people in each of those three countries. Meanwhile, 80% of the French say unemployment is a very big problem, but less than a third of the Germans agree. Such concerns have impacted people's attitudes toward the wider European Union, the survey finds. ""The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from everyone else,"" the report's authors say. ""The southern nations of Spain, Italy and Greece are becoming ever more estranged as evidenced by their frustration with Brussels, Berlin and the perceived unfairness of the economic system."" The survey highlights a growing despondency among the French. Whereas before France has bridged the gap between Europe's north and south in terms of culture, politics and economics, times have changed, the researchers say. ""The darkening mood in France makes French public opinion look less like that in Germany and more like attitudes in southern Europe: Spain, Italy and Greece,"" it says. Perhaps a win in the Eurovision Song Contest final on Saturday could cheer the French up -- or at least give something to justify that stereotype of ""arrogance."" Then again, perhaps not. Victory is seen by some as a curse rather than a blessing when times are hard, because whoever wins this year faces the expense of being next year's Eurovision host. The contest, taking place this year in the city of Malmo since Sweden won in 2012, will bring together 39 countries and is expected to attract more than 100 million TV viewers across Europe, organizers say. Eurovision is widely loved for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs, sometimes questionable talent and international rivalries. After all the finalists have performed, the voting begins. Countries award a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs. They can't vote for themselves and they must announce the score in both English and French. Television viewers can cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines, which count toward the final vote. Many perceive the voting to be tactical, with neighbors or members of regional blocs, such as the former Soviet nations, appearing to base their scoring on geopolitical alliances rather than artistic merit. CNN's Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","People in eight European nations are surveyed on attitudes toward their neighbors .

"London (CNN) -- Police hunting the would-be killer of a former Russian banker gunned down outside his east London home have appealed for help to trace the taxi driver who dropped him off shortly before he was attacked. German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot several times last Tuesday evening, as he walked into an apartment block on Byng Street in the Isle of Dogs, near the Canary Wharf business district. London's Metropolitan Police say they are treating the shooting as attempted murder. Gorbuntsov remains in a critical but stable condition in an unnamed London hospital. Detectives say they want to speak to a cab driver who picked him up in Bishopsgate, in London's financial district, at 1900 GMT on Tuesday, and drove him to Byng Street, where he got out of the taxi shortly before 1930 GMT. No arrests have been made and police have not revealed details of the weapon used in the attack, though Russia's Kommersant daily reported that Gorbuntsov was shot with a sub-machine-gun. ""The shooting is not thought to be gang related or linked to any other incidents"" in the area, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. ""Officers retain an open mind regarding the motive for the attack at this time."" Kommersant cited Gorbuntsov's Russian lawyer, Vadim Vedenin, as saying the attack could be linked to an ongoing investigation into the attempted murder of another Russian banker, Aleksandr Antonov, in Moscow in 2009. Gorbuntsov reportedly formerly owned banks in Russia and Moldova, a former Soviet republic which gained independence from Russia in 1991. Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti reports that Gorbuntsov is wanted in Moldova on several charges, including an illegal bank takeover and embezzlement. But Gorbuntsov's Moldovan lawyer Valery Andronik told Kommersant that his client believed any threat to his safety came from within Russia. He is among a number of well-connected Russians, some of them at odds with Vladimir Putin's government, to have moved to London in recent years. British media have drawn links between this latest potential assassination attempt and the poisoning death of a dissident former Russian spy in London in 2006. Alexander Litvinenko, a vehement critic of President Putin, was a former KGB agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He died at a London hospital November 23, 2006, after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210. In a deathbed statement he blamed Putin, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied. Authorities in London want Russia to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, suspected in the killing, but Russia has repeatedly refused. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Bharati Naik and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Former Russian banker German Gorbuntsov shot outside his home in east London .

"(CNN) -- The Mayor of London Boris Johnson is open to the idea of a Formula One race in Britain's capital, but has yet to be approached by the sport's powerbrokers. Plans have reportedly been formulated to race around iconic venues such as Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square, with the hope it might rival F1's showpiece grand prix in Monaco. ""London hosts a vast array of world events,"" said a spokesman for Johnson. ""The mayor is always keen to explore new opportunities to do so, especially if they will create jobs, bring investment and further London's lead as a world city but as yet we have not received proposals."" Ferrari chief eyes title push . While industry insiders are skeptical the race will happen, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is keen to establish another race in his homeland -- in addition to the British Grand Prix at Silverstone which will take place on July 8. The 2012 world championship calendar is the largest in the sport's history, with a total of 20 races being held between March and November. Ecclestone said a London race would give the city a greater boost than the forthcoming Olympic Games, while also suggesting he would put up the necessary funds himself to ensure the grand prix got off the ground. ""With the way things are, maybe we would front it and put the money up for it,"" Ecclestone told The Times newspaper. ""If we got the OK and everything was fine, I think we could do that. ""Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic, good for London, good for England -- a lot better than the Olympics."" However, the idea is already facing opposition, with British motoring association the AA questioning whether London's already congested streets could handle an annual influx of F1 teams and fans. ""Tthe havoc you would create by having to shut roads would be interesting to see,"" an AA spokesman told CNN. ""We've seen the huge fuss that has been created by road closures during the Olympics and that it just once in a lifetime -- a London GP would be every year."" Earlier this year London announced plans to host a one-day professional road race to rival classic events such as the Paris-Roubaix, the Milan-San Remo and Liege-Bastogne-Liege. To be first staged in August 2013, the race will be part of a two-day cycling festival, which will become an annual event, as part of the Olympic legacy .","The Mayor of London would be open to talks over a grand prix in the city .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Lawmakers in Libya passed a law on Sunday banning senior Gadhafi government officials from holding official posts. The move comes after a week of rising tensions in the Libyan capital of Tripoli as heavily armed protesters surrounded the Foreign and Justice ministries demanding that the legislature pass the law. The political isolation law could exclude current senior officials such as the head of the General National Congress Mohamed al-Magariaf, who served as ambassador to India in the 1970s before he joined the exiled opposition to the Gadhafi government. The General National Congress is Libya's parliament. It remains unclear if Prime Minister Ali Zaidan, who was a diplomat in India around the same time, would be affected by the ban. The law, which would be implemented by a committee that would decide whether officials fall under the exclusion criteria, goes into effect in 30 days. But the law has already come under fire by international watchdog groups. ""(The law) violates human rights and Libya's provisional constitution because it allows for guilt by association rather than provable misdeeds. The provisions and procedures for exclusion are overly broad and vague. The desire to ban corrupt and abusive officials is understandable, but this law is deeply flawed,"" said Hanan Salah, Human Rights Watch's Libya researcher. Soon after the law was passed, Libyans broke into cheers as hundreds congregated outside the GNC, celebrating what many described as a victory. Celebratory gunfire rang across many areas of Tripoli as people drove around the city honking their horns and chanting in celebration. Outside the Justice Ministry, armed protesters played music and danced as they prepared to sacrifice a camel, a Libyan tradition. In March armed protesters surrounded the GNC for several hours in an attempt to force lawmakers to pass the law. They later opened fire on the car of Magariaf, who escaped unharmed. There were concerns on Sunday of a repeat of these events if lawmakers had not come to an agreement. The siege of government ministries seems to have ended with the passing of the law, but many Libyans are concerned about the implications of the vote. ""The events of last week have set a number of precedents -- the precedent that using arms to force the government to adopt a law or policy; the precedent of establishing non-equality of citizenship before the law, in effect creating classes of Libyans; and the principle that in the New Libya, people can and will be judged on the bases of general classification, not individual responsibility,"" said Hafed al-Ghwell, a former Gadhafi opposition figure and a Libya analyst.","Former Gadhafi officials are now banned from official posts in Libya .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- More than 1,000 homes have been set ablaze amid sectarian clashes between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar's volatile west as security forces struggle to bring some semblance of order to the countryside. In an effort to clamp down on the unrest, authorities sent extra security forces to the state of Rakhine, where at least 50 people have been killed and dozens more wounded, state officials said Thursday. Overnight curfews, in effect since a severe outbreak of communal violence during May and June, have been lengthened in several townships, said Myo Than, manager of the state government's information department. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens. The clashes between the majority Buddhists and the Rohingya minority during the summer killed at least 88 people -- mostly Rohingya -- according to state-run media. The violence in May erupted after police detained three Muslim men on accusations they raped and killed a Buddhist woman. Clashes spread, prompting the government to deploy the military to restore order. Hundreds of Rohingyas tried to cross the border into neighboring Bangladesh, but were turned back. Bangladesh said it already had too many Rohingya refugees, estimating that about 300,000 live in the country. Even after the killing stopped, simmering tensions remained in Rakhine, as shown by the resumption of violence this week. Those who lost their homes have had to live in refugee camps. About 75,000 people were displaced, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar. Myo Than said the government is aiming to return the situation to normal by organizing negotiations between the two sides and increasing security. State officials say they have sent medical teams accompanied by military personnel to two of the remote townships hit by unrest to offer treatment to Rohingya people too scared to go to a hospital. Journalist Phyu Phyu Zin in Yangon, Myanmar, contributed to this report.","More than 1,000 houses have been set on fire in recent clashes .

"(CNN) -- When you put a pro- and an anti-gun control person in the same room, you know what's bound to happen. But what happens when two gun owners debate gun control? Turns out, there can be just as much disagreement. The elephant in the room in the wake of last week's Colorado movie theater shooting is the debate over gun control. Gun control is not an either/or proposition. Most would agree that at least some degree of regulation is necessary, so the real question is where to draw the line: At what point does regulation become an unreasonable encroachment on our Second Amendment rights? CNN selected two iReporters with differing views on gun control to go head-to-head in a debate. Both live in Washington state, one of the 48 states where carrying concealed weapons is allowed. Opinion: Bloomberg's remarks got one thing right . Michael Kunda is an anti-hunting gun owner. He carries a gun for protection while filming bears and other large mammals in the woods of Alaska and Canada. At home, he carries a gun to protect his family from intruders. While he owns two pistols, a shotgun for his videography work and two assault rifles, he supports stricter gun control. He suggests establishing a bullet registry as well as outlawing large-capacity magazines and Teflon bullets. Kunda refers to himself as a reluctant gun owner, and says he would prefer a world without guns. In fact, he would turn all his guns in if everyone else did the same. ""I firmly believe fewer crimes of spontaneity or impulse would occur if there were fewer guns. But I recognize I am being unrealistic and idealistic,"" he said. ""It takes a societal change to get rid of the gun fanatic mentality anywhere in this world, and that kind of a change is not possible as long as the notion of 'freedom' is associated with gun ownership."" Opinion: Fear drives opposition to gun control . A ban on guns isn't the answer, at least not from David Douglas' perspective. He believes there is a good system in place for gun control and says changing the law wouldn't change what happened in Colorado. His reasons are personal: As a former convicted felon -- he was convicted of burglary and possession of drugs -- he was stripped of his right to bear arms. Douglas says his run-ins with the law and his loss of gun rights demonstrate the legitimacy and stringency of gun control in America. He now works as a substance-abuse counselor. ""The process that I went through, 15 years of not being able to possess firearms and then the process to petition the courts to get those rights back, was worth it,"" he said. ""Worth it in the sense that it showed me that it is a privilege in our nation to be in possession of firearms. Now, looking back, there is a pretty good system in place for who can and who cannot possess firearms after certain crimes are committed."" Opinion: When will America wake up to gun violence? Douglas and Kunda are two of the hundreds of iReporters who have shared their views on a variety of hot-button political issues in the iReport Debate, an eight-month project that invites voters to make their voices heard this election season. The project started with iReporters sharing which issue matters most to them.

"London (CNN) -- The Olympic torch is set to make a dramatic entry to London Friday, descending via a 180-foot line from a helicopter to the historic Tower of London. The torch's arrival in the capital begins the final week before the Games open and the final stage in its long journey. More than 10 million people have already lined the streets of more than 1,000 communities around Britain to see the torch, which has been carried by more than 7,000 torchbearers, Olympic organizers said. Nearly 1,000 more will carry the torch along nearly 200 miles of London streets over the coming week, before it takes a starring role at the opening ceremony at the Olympic Park on July 27. Read about Greece passing the Olympic flame to Britain . Eighteen torchbearers will carry the flame on the final day of the relay, with seven of them traveling with it down the River Thames on the royal barge Gloriana, which played a central role in the Diamond Jubilee river pageant for Queen Elizabeth II. The torch's arrival at the Tower of London on Friday evening promises to be eye-catching. A Royal Marine commando, carrying the flame in a lantern, will abseil -- the technique known as ""rappel"" in the United States -- 180 feet from a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter into the grounds, where London Mayor Boris Johnson will be waiting to greet it. The torch will be carried around the Tower, which dates back to the 11th century, before spending the night in the safekeeping of the Jewel House, home of the Crown Jewels. The buildup to the Olympics has been overshadowed by a security fiasco caused by the failure of contractor G4S to supply enough guards for the Games. 2012 Olympic flame lit in ancient stadium . But Johnson told CNN's Becky Anderson that while London authorities are not complacent, he is confident in their ability to keep visitors safe. ""We do everything in our power to maximize security at the venues and that's working well now -- the army, the military as well as G4S are providing very safe conditions on the site, plus there is a huge amount of work that nobody has seen involving the intelligence service,"" the mayor said . ""That's something about an event like this -- you listen out for what may or may not be happening on the Internet, you try as hard as you possibly can to monitor the potential suspects."" Johnson said it is impossible to guard against all ""unknown unknowns"" and that's why strong security is needed at venues. ""At no stage can you guarantee that someone won't do something moronic, stupid, violent and tragic, not just in London but the whole of the UK is a potential target in this period,"" he said. But at the same time, he said, ""the intelligence is as reassuring as it could be under the circumstances. The threat level as far as we are aware has slightly come down in the last 12 months, but you can never be certain."" Look at photos of the journey of the Olympic flame . Authorities said Thursday that an additional 1,200 British troops were being placed on standby for the Olympic Games. The company's recruitment shortfall had already forced the government to call in 3,500 extra military personnel to help. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the minister in charge of overseeing the Games, said that there was no need to deploy extra troops but that putting 1,200 on standby means they can be moved within 48 hours rather than seven days if required. G4S has a Â£284 million ($444 million) government contract to provide 10,400 security staff for the Olympic Games, but only about 4,000 guards are trained and ready. It expects to provide at least 7,000 by the time the Games start, chief executive Nick Buckles told lawmakers earlier this week. Home Secretary Theresa May gave more details on how the fiasco unfolded in a letter sent to the head of Parliament's Home Affairs Committee on Thursday. Although the Home Office did not become aware of the full extent of the shortfall until July 11, G4S had alerted the government to ""scheduling problems"" affecting staff numbers on June 28, she said. Once it became clear how large the shortfall would be, the government put its contingency plans into operation, she wrote. ""G4S will still be making a substantial contribution to venue security,"" she wrote. ""All G4S personnel working on venue security duties will have had training for the role they are undertaking,"" May added. The G4S recruits are supposed to perform tasks including venue perimeter security, such as manning X-ray machines, searching people, searching vehicles and operating closed-circuit television systems, the company said.","A Royal Marine commando will bring the flame from a helicopter into the Tower of London .

"(CNN) -- Tornadoes tore through the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and St. Louis, Missouri, areas Friday, ripping up homes and sending thousands scrambling for cover. Nine people, two children and seven adults, were killed in the Oklahoma storms, a spokeswoman for the state's chief medical examiner's office said Saturday morning. This comes less than two weeks after a monstrous tornado made rubble of the nearby town of Moore. Seventeen tornadoes were reported in the Midwest, and more than 212,000 were without power across the region early Saturday morning. One of the main concerns now is the flooding that the severe weather system left in its wake. Here are the latest developments: . -- While none were killed due to tornadoes, three people drowned in the state of Missouri, Gov. Jay Nixon told CNN affiliate KSDK Saturday. -- Nixon said the tornado that hit St. Charles and St. Louis counties had a ""very long damage track,"" with ""over 10 miles of significant damage ... that caused dozens and dozens of houses to be literally blown up."" -- Flooding was a major problem in southern Missouri, the governor said. ""Waters are rising, floods are still occurring, and we're asking people to be very safe,"" he said Saturday afternoon. -- A powerful storm caused major damage to a gymnasium of Gillespie High School in southwestern Illinois, with bricks piled up from what had been the gym's front now piled up on the school's lawn, Gillespie Mayor John Hicks said. Seven to 10 homes were destroyed -- and more than 30 others suffered damage -- in the storm. -- There were no injuries in Gillespie, Illinois, a town of about 3,400 people, despite the fierce winds, Hicks said. The mayor said the story might have been much different had the storm struck next week, when hundreds were set to gather not far from the high school for a celebration called Black Diamond Days. Previously reported: . OKLAHOMA . Casualties . -- Friday's storms killed two children and seven adults in Oklahoma, said Amy Elliot, spokeswoman for the state's chief medical examiner's office. -- At least 71 others were injured, officials said. -- Oklahoma officials are assessing the damage and working to determine if there are other casualties. Among the areas hit by tornadoes Friday: the communities of Union City and El Reno, both in Canadian County just west of Oklahoma City. -- A National Weather Service survey team found damage indicating an EF3 tornado had struck Friday near El Reno, 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. EF3s pack gusts of 136 to 165 mph. The strongest tornado is an EF5. -- Seven of the people killed in Friday's Oklahoma storms were killed in Canadian County, immediately to the west of the county that includes Oklahoma City, said Canadian County Undersheriff Chris West. -- The seven people who died in Canadian County were inside vehicles, West said. Travel . -- The Oklahoma Department of Transportation discouraged travel in the metro area, saying crews are working with the state highway patrol to close roads as necessary. -- Parts of Interstates 35 and 40, which cut through Oklahoma City and Moore, were ""a parking lot"" when the tornadoes struck. -- Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport lost part of its terminal roof, forcing travelers to seek shelter in the airport's basement. -- The airport reopened early Saturday morning, but airlines canceled or delayed several morning departures ""due to the fact that they could not fly in late last night to be at the gate for the first departures,"" the airport said. Flights were ""slowly resuming"" Saturday morning, the airport said. The airport's website showed many mid- and late-morning departures were on time. Flooding . -- There's flooding all across the metro area after 8 to 11 inches of rain fell, said Kristy Yager, a spokeswoman for Oklahoma City. The city also has minor building flooding downtown, including one inch of flood water pooling on the first floor of City Hall. -- ""We saw flooding in areas that we don't see flooding,"" said Oklahoma City police Lt. Jay Barnett, but he did not have firm numbers on rescue. -- The city of El Reno, west of Oklahoma City, was also at risk of flooding. The city mayor urged residents to take shelter inside. ""It's started to hail again and rain; we are telling people to stay inside,"" Mayor Matt White said.

MISSOURI . Casualties . -- Gov. Jay Nixon said Saturday that there were no fatalities tied to tornadoes that rolled through the St. Louis metropolitan area, but he said at least three people died around the state due to drowning. Damage . -- Outside St. Louis, in St. Charles County, some homes were demolished. Aerial video from CNN affiliate KMOV showed at least the second floors of several homes ripped apart, with houses to the front and behind still standing. -- Most of the St. Charles County damage happened in a 10-square-mile area just east of a country club, sandwiched between the town of St. Peters and the Ohio River, county spokesman Colene McEntee told CNN. No serious injuries were reported in the county. -- Also damaged was the 10,000-seat Family Arena in St. Charles, McEntee said. The damage led three high schools in the Francis Howell school district to postpone graduation ceremonies that had been scheduled for Saturday, KSDK reported. Travel . -- For four hours, the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport was closed to remove debris from the runway, but it reopened early Saturday morning. The terminals were not affected, but the storm caused damage to some airport buildings.

"London, England (CNN) -- The arrest of a Nigerian politician who deposited millions of dollars of stolen money in UK accounts has raised questions about the role of British banks in corruption. As governor of the oil-rich Delta state in Nigeria, James Ibori's salary was only $6000 a year, yet he managed to afford luxury properties, fleets of Rolls Royces, a Bentley and a Maybach, first class travel, private boarding school fees and a private jet worth $20 million. In April, accused of money laundering, Ibori pleaded guilty to stealing $80 million, although investigators believe he may have stolen three times as much. He was sentenced to 13 years. Prior to entering politics, Ibori had lived in London, England with his wife Theresa. In 1990, the pair were convicted of stealing from a hardware store where Ibori worked as a cashier. The next year, he was convicted of handling a stolen credit card. By the end of the decade, having lied about his criminal record, Ibori was governor of Delta State, and was reelected for a four year term in 2003. The Africans looking to make it in China . Although acquitted by a Delta State court in 2009, justice finally came for Ibori in a South London court, after a seven year investigation by the Proceeds of Corruption Unit of London's Metropolitan Police. The unit, staffed by a dozen or so detectives, traces the flow of foreign politicians' money through London, and is funded by the UK government's Department for International Development, which also delivers aid to Africa. ""We hope that, by tackling the likes of James Ibori, we're saying to those stealing from the state purse, you can't have your children at private school in London. You can't have a multimillion pound house in one of the most affluent areas of London. You can't drive around in top of the range vehicles. We won't let you move money around to buy multimillion pound jets,"" says unit head Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Benton. Ibori employed a range of methods, some straightforward, some devious. He inflated contracts, took kickbacks, and simply transferred cash out of state accounts. He was helped by his family, wife and mistress, as well as by London-based professionals, who set up shell companies, assisted in purchases and provided false due diligence. According to Robert Palmer of anti corruption NGO Global Witness, London holds a double attraction for corrupt politicians. ""We are a major financial and legal center so there's a lot of expertise, and there's also a lot of assets that go through the British financial institution, so it's easier to disguise your assets."" Palmer believes London also seems like a great place to spend ""illicit loot"". ""There's a prestige about being able to bring your assets and your wealth into the UK,"" he observes. In March, the Financial Services Authority fined Coutts, a private arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, a record $14 million for failing to monitor three-quarters of its high-risk customers, known as Politically Exposed Persons. Although Coutts says it found no evidence of money laundering, and its processes are now robust, campaigners say London's banks are still playing a role in the problem of African corruption. ""I think we need to see more sanctions,"" says Chandu Krishnan of Transparency International. ""And the greater the severity of penalties, the greater the deterrent effect. And that will ensure fewer institutions would commit these offenses."" Palmer has similar concerns. ""According to the prosecutor, Ibori and his associates had accounts with Barclays, HSBC, Citibank. He had a Centurion American Express card. These are major financial institutions that all took money from James Ibori and his associates,"" he notes. ""I think the only way we're going to get serious change is if you have heavy penalties, you go after individual bankers and, in the worst cases, in the most egregious failures, you put people in jail."" Is narcotic khat funding terrorism? Prosecutors in Ibori's case were aided by a whistleblower, Dotun Oloko. Although Oloko's identity was accidentally leaked back to Nigeria, resulting in his relocation to the UK, he continues to campaign against Nigerian corruption -- whether it's in Britain or Nigeria. He observes a ""terrible paradox"": ""The international financial intermediaries believe they can engage in this kind of activity, being protected by the same states or the same governments that are leading the same anti-corruption battle."" Detective Benton says although British banks do cooperate with his unit, tracing the sources of money can still be difficult, particularly without international cooperation.

"London (CNN) -- If you want to make a phone call you will have to find a big red box on the street -- that's if you're prepared to brave the occasional dense smogs that afflict London. Or you could instead curl up on the sofa with a hot drink and watch the only channel on television; as long as you haven't already used your tea ration for the week and your family is one of the few that has a TV set. Anyone taking a ride in a time machine back to the London of 1952 when Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne would find a dramatically different country to the UK's modern capital. The country was still suffering from the aftermath of World War II and there was very little to resemble what we might now recognize as youth culture . There were no mobile phones of course, but 60 years ago few people in the UK owned a car, television or washing machine. Some food rationing was still in place -- tea rationing ended in October of that year but sweets and sugar were still rationed until 1953. Even clean air was not guaranteed. In December 1952, 4,000 people were killed by the choking urban fumes that accompanied the London fog, and thousands more were made ill. Winston Churchill was British prime minister, identity cards were only just being ripped up and the blockbuster ""Singin' in the rain"" starring Gene Kelly was playing at the movies. Even money was different. British people bought and sold in farthings, florins, tanners, shillings, half crowns and thrupenny bits, and sometimes using coins minted in the reign of the queen's great, great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. Finding the 1952 smash hit . So what was life really like in 1952 and how does it compare to modern Britain? ""I hated it,"" recalls Sparrow Harrison who set up the Cae Dai 1950s-era museum in Denbigh, North Wales, UK. ""It was miserable. Sex was forbidden and smoking was chic. ""You had to do exactly the same as your parents. You wore the same clothes as your parents.There wasn't really a youth culture -- music wasn't orientated towards youth,"" he said. So if you journeyed back to 1952 and turned on a bakelite radio, what would be the summer's smash hit? It's difficult to say. Elvis hadn't happened yet and neither had an officially compiled UK pop chart -- success was previously measured in sales of sheet music. The first list based on record sales in the UK was published by New Musical Express in November 1952 and the first chart topper was Al Martino's ""Here in my heart."" Listen to Al Martino's hit and then compare it to the current UK top-selling single by Fun. called ""We are young,"" and featuring Janelle Monae. The early 1950s belonged to traditional singers like Bing Crosby and Vera Lynn though the male youth culture centered on the ""Teddy Boy"" was starting to make an appearance. With their distinctive swept-back hair, smart jackets and crepe-soled shoes, the fashion grew out of a revival of the clothing of the reign of the queen's great-grandfather Edward VII -- these ""New Edwardians"" became the Teds. Fashion was also changing for women. Dennis Nothdruft, curator at London's Fashion and Textile Museum, said: ""Fashion changed tremendously in the years immediately following the war. The real emphasis became femininity and luxury after years of 'make do and mend.' Designers such as Lucienne Day revolutionized surface pattern with strong sophisticated color and style. Firms like Horrockses Fashions also created brightly colored, fashionable cotton dresses."" It's the new color that Kenneth Taverner, 76, recalls from his youth in Tottenham, north London. ""Ladies wore flowery frocks,"" he said. ""They went colourful after the drab clothes during the war and wore long gloves on special occasions. Men always wore a hat or cap when out."" He said he liked being freed from rationing and the independence of getting his first scooter. Tell us how are you marking the jubilee . Salary levels clearly depended on your job but most people earned less than £10 ($15.40) a week... roughly equivalent to £260 ($400) now. The UK's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 ($369) a week for 40 hours' work. New coinage introduced in early 1970s . Even most British time travelers would find 1950s London bewildering. There were 12 pennies in a shilling, 20 shillings in pound, and each penny had a quarter value. Some of the coins had nick names so a shopkeeper might tell you a purchase was ""two and a tanner"" or a ""bob, three farthings."" The currency changed in the early 1970s so time-travelers younger than their mid-40s might find themselves confused ... or conned. The cost of some things are roughly equal. Take bread for example. In 1952, a loaf cost about three pence (about 50p or 77 cents) in modern terms ... but for a limited choice. Now we can buy a huge range of different styles -- from ciabattas to chilli flatbread. One big food chain store in the UK lists more than 100 bread options on its website, ranging from 45p (60 cents) to £1.87 ($2.88), and all can be bought online. The term ""buy with a click of a mouse"" would be complete nonsense to someone living in the mid-50s as home computers had yet to be invented and the web was decades away. A study of spending over the last half century reveals some surprising trends. A mid-1950s family spent 33% of their budget on food, compared to around 15% in the modern era. And according to the same figures from the UK's Office for National Statistics, the biggest expense on the shopping list after rent or mortgage payments was for cigarettes. Six per cent of the family budget went up in a haze of blue smoke. ""Everyone smoked -- that's a really big difference to nowadays,"" said Sparrow Harrison. ""To chat up girls you would always offer them a cigarette."" London smokers now have to puff away in the street because smoking inside public buildings is banned. And they might not recognize the local landscape either. ""In 1952, Britain hadn't really turned the corner from World War II,"" said Jim Gledhill, curator of social and working history at the Museum of London. ""You would still see significant evidence of bomb damage and the legacy of the war -- a lot of recovery was still going on."" Some things may never change . So has anything stayed the same -- would our time travelers recognize anything from 1952? Agatha Christie's play The Mousetrap opened in London in 1952 and is still showing at St. Martin's Theatre. Mr. Potato Head was launched in the U.S. by Hasbro and is sharing a diamond anniversary with the queen, though both the popular toy and the monarchy now have a Facebook page. The British are still passionate about football and cricket, and they still drink in pubs. London's great landmarks like St. Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London and the Houses of Parliament still stand but are somewhat cleaner since the dark days of the smog. Distinctive, red double-deck buses and black cabs still cruise the streets, and the weather is much the same. Adventurous older time travelers returning to their youth might also take some comfort from the queen's words. In Queen Elizabeth II's first Christmas speech in 1952 she said: ""We must keep alive that courageous spirit of adventure that is the finest quality of youth; and by youth I do not just mean those who are young in years; I mean too all those who are young in heart, no matter how old they may be.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of followers of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr marked the ninth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq on Monday by demanding improvements in public services in the war-torn country. Some of the protesters carried coffins marked ""electricity,"" ""water"" and ""education"" through the streets of the southern oil city of Basra. Others carried cables and water containers to express their frustration with the lack of basic utilities. Iraqi security officials estimated the crowd at 100,000 to 120,000 people, many of whom carried Iraqi flags, banners and pictures of al-Sadr -- the Shiite Muslim leader whose former militia once fought numerous pitched battles with U.S. troops. With the American military now out of Iraq, the banners challenged Iraq's new political leaders, asking ""Where are your promises?"" In a statement read by one of his allies, the cleric urged his followers to take their complaints to the ballot box. ""If the government fails to listen to your demands, then you will decide what is best for you,"" he said. About 30% of Iraq's population lacks access to clean drinking water, though the figure is up sharply from 2008, according to the Brookings Institution's Iraq index. Electricity generation surpassed prewar levels in mid-2007 but averaged about 56% of demand in 2011, Brookings estimates. Iraq seeks new oil routes amid Iran tensions . Al-Sadr, who rarely makes public appearances, also called on his supporters to remain firm in their opposition to the United States and Israel. ""If we unite our voices, then we will be able to defeat America, Israel and other enemies,"" Sheikh Assad al-Nassri told the crowd on al-Sadr's behalf. A U.S.-led army invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, toppling longtime dictator Saddam Hussein. But years of bloodshed followed the invasion as an insurgency led by Hussein's allies took root, followed by sectarian warfare between Iraq's Shiite majority and Sunni minority. Al-Sadr's militia, the Mehdi Army, was blamed for some of the worst violence. He formally disbanded the group in 2008, announcing that it was transitioning into a movement to oppose secularism and Western thought. Meanwhile, his political movement has become a kingmaker in Iraqi politics: Its 39 members of Iraq's parliament were key to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's winning a second term. His supporters usually demonstrate in Baghdad to mark the anniversary. But they held this year's rally in Basra because of tightened security in the capital as it prepares to host an Arab summit, security officials told CNN. The United States argued Hussein's regime had been harboring forbidden stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, long-range missiles and a nuclear weapons program. But inspectors later found that Baghdad had attempted to conceal some weapons-related research from the international community, but that Iraq had been effectively disarmed under U.N. sanctions in the 1990s. The invasion swiftly toppled Hussein, who was later executed for the massacre of Shiite villagers following an assassination attempt in the 1980s. But nearly 4,500 Americans and 300-plus allied troops were killed before the last American troops left in December, while estimates of the Iraqi toll run well above 100,000.","Sadrists demand better services as they mark ninth anniversary of war .

"Maputo, Mozambique (CNN) -- More Brazilian companies are moving into Africa amid a government drive to build closer economic ties with the continent. A year ago Vale, the Brazilian mining giant, exported its first overseas coal shipment from Mozambique. The shift of 35,000 metric tons of thermal coal from the port of Beira to the United Arab Emirates marked the southeastern African country's emergence into the global minerals market. It was part of Vale's ambitious push into the country, and its plans to double capacity to 22 million tons of coal annually over the next few years. And Vale, the world's second largest miner, is not the only Brazilian company eyeing Africa's potential. With ties that date back to the era of slave trade, Brazilian leaders are quick to use the country's cultural affinity with Africa as an advantage in its competition. Ricardo Saad, who oversees Vale's Asia, Australia and Africa operations, says the continent is a ""new opportunity."" He adds: ""I'm based here in (Mozambique capital) Maputo because our investments here in Mozambique are the most important."" Vale operates across several African countries, including Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa. It has been in Mozambique since 2004. The thermal coal was mined from the company's Moatize concession in western Mozambique, an area believed to hold one of the world's biggest untapped reserves. Vale is making a broader pitch to access the country's natural resources. It is spending millions on infrastructure, including a railway line passing through Malawi and connecting its Moatize facility with Nacala, the largest deep-water natural port on Africa's eastern coast . The company plans to spend more than $12 billion across the continent over the next five years. Read related: Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa . Vale is not alone. Over the last few years, Brazil's state and private firms have quietly made inroads into the continent, operating mostly in strategic sectors such as infrastructure, energy and mining. Odebrecht, Brazil's biggest construction company, and Petrobras, a state-controlled energy group, have also stepped up their African operations in recent years. Trade between Brazil and Africa has jumped from around $4 billion in 2000 to about $20 billion in 2010. Read more: Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . Analysts say that Brazil's interest in Africa shot up during Lula da Silva's eight years in power (2003-2010) as the former president made Africa a strategic priority for Brazil as part of the country's efforts to expand its global influence. ""Lula visited Africa more times than any other statesman in the world during his tenure in government,"" says Lyal White, director of the Centre for Dynamic Markets at the Gordon Institute for Business Science in South Africa. Brazil's deepening engagement with Africa continued under the leadership of Dilma Rousseff, who became Brazil's president early last year. In her first year in office, Rousseff visited Angola, Mozambique, and South Africa. The cultural ties feed into the relationship, analysts say. ""The fact that the majority of Brazil's population is of Afro-Brazilian origin -- making Brazil the world's largest black population after Nigeria -- is frequently quoted by the almost exclusively white governing elite of Brazil in order to stress Brazil's cultural similarities with the African countries,"" according to Christina Stolte, researcher at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies. Read more: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? Stolte says Brazil is very keen to avoid being viewed as a ""neo-imperialist"" power that is only interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources -- an accusation often directed at other emerging powers operating in the continent. ""Lula and Rousseff have more than once openly critizised China's way of engagement with Africa, trying to distance Brazil from its resource hungry BRICS partner,"" she says. ""Brazilian officials as well as businessmen frequently stress the aim of contributing to the development of African countries by pointing to the fact that Brazil is hiring and training local workforce and offering social projects to foster local development."" Back in Mozambique, Saad says that Vale, along with making profits, is committed to the development of local communities. ""When we talk about Africa, it's not possible to talk about Africa not thinking about sustainable development and respect to the people, respect to the environment, respect to the planet, but having the sense that our development is going to be also a local development,"" he says. ""We are here to be a Mozambican company -- we come from Brazil, but we are Mozambican now,"" Saad adds.","Mining giant Vale is one of the many Brazilian firms eying Africa's potential .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- From the ice age to the modern age, a 42,000-year-old baby woolly mammoth debuted on the world stage in Hong Kong. Scientists say Lyuba, which means ""love"" in Russian, died after 32 days of life, drowning in river mud in present-day Siberia. And for more than 40 millennia, she laid there encased in her dark, frigid grave. But Thursday the two-foot tall baby mammoth stood in the hot spotlight at Hong Kong's high-end International Finance Center Mall -- across from Chanel and flanked by an Apple store and a Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop. Karim Azar, general manager of IFC Mall, explained how ice age relics pair up with modern-day retail. ""We try to be a little bit more than a shopping mall. We want to try and be a cultural center. We're always looking for events that will attract a more cultural kind of angle."" Azar declined to say exactly how much money the mall paid to get Lyuba from her home at Russia's Shemanovsky Museum but he did hint it was in the realm of several million Hong Kong dollars -- 7.8 million Hong Kong dollars equals about $1 million in U.S. currency. ""We don't do it for the monetary gain,"" Azar said. ""We're doing it more for the cultural connection for the Hong Kong people and to get something interesting for the shopping mall."" He says the ""headaches"" and ""red tape"" -- including a Hong Kong promise to Russia to return Lyuba -- were worth it for the archaeological significance. Bernard Buigues, the French explorer who announced Lyuba's discovery in 2007, divulged that Lyuba is insured for U.S. $1.5 million. But the director of the Mammuthus Project added she is priceless. ""When you have access to such a specimen you think it's not possible. You have to pinch yourself and think you are dreaming,"" he said. Buigues goes on to say how excited he was to see Lyuba for the first time, and how fortunate a reindeer herder found the mammoth in 2007. The region's extreme cold and the lack of oxygen from Lyuba's thick mud grave had helped to keep her nearly 100% intact. Aside from missing a few toenails, Lyuba still sports a tuft of hair. Her skin is a near life-like grey. Even her last meal was preserved. That included her mother's milk and bits of her mother's feces -- an aid for digestion. The baby mammoth is not alone on her field trip to Asia. Also on loan from Russia's Shemanovsky Museum is a three-story, two-ton replica of a woolly mammoth skeleton. A trio of real skulls from other extinct ice age animals round out Lyuba's coterie -- a woolly rhino with a long single horn, a steppe bison and an open-mouthed cave lion baring its sharp predator's teeth. But Lyuba is the star of this show. To the thousands of expected visitors, she may prove that being 42,000 years old never looked so good. The exhibit ""I Love Lyuba: Baby Mammoth of the Ice Age"" extends to May 10, 2012 at Hong Kong's International Finance Center Mall.","Scientists says Lyuba, which means ""love"" in Russian, died after 32 days of life .

"(CNN) -- A former U.S. Army officer has been charged with passing information relating to nuclear weapons and other military secrets to his Chinese girlfriend, the Justice Department said. Benjamin Bishop, 59, was arrested Friday at work and appeared in federal court in Honolulu on Monday. He was formally charged with ""willfully communicating national defense information to a person not entitled to receive such information."" Court documents identified the woman as a 27-year-old Chinese citizen. Her name was not disclosed and she has not been charged. She was in the United States legally on a student visa, authorities said. Court documents do not accuse the woman of spying, but an affidavit notes that Bishop met her at a conference in Hawaii where she may have been attempting to target individuals with access to classified information. Investigators say Bishop began a romantic relationship with her in June 2011 and sought to hide it from authorities. Bishop, who had top-secret clearance, is also charged with unlawfully retaining classified documents in his home. He will remain in custody pending a detention hearing on Friday. If convicted, Bishop faces up to 20 years in prison. ""The arrest of Mr. Bishop is just the first step in what is going to be a long process and we are actively continuing the investigation to determine the roles of all those involved in this case,"" U.S. Attorney Florence Nakakuni said. Bishop's court-appointed lawyer, Birney Bervar, said the charges were devastating for her client. ""He has served his country honorably for 29 years and he maintains he would never do anything to intentionally harm the United States,"" Bervar said. Government officials said Bishop had been in the Army reserves but was activated for about three years before being hired by a contractor. After becoming suspicious of his activities, federal agents conducted wiretaps, physical and electronic surveillance, and searches of Bishop's home. Authorities would not comment on the extent of potential damage to national security, but said the information involved ""related to nuclear weapons, information on planned deployment of U.S. strategic nuclear systems, information on the ability of the U.S. to detect low and medium-range ballistic missiles of foreign governments, and information on the deployment of U.S. early warning radar systems in the Pacific Rim.""","Contractor allegedly gave information to 27-year-old woman he met at a conference .

"(CNN) -- An octogenarian climber has abandoned his bid to reclaim the title of the oldest man to climb Mt Everest after a combination of poor climbing weather and government red tape forced him to call off the ascent. Veteran Nepali climber Min Bahadur Sherchan, 81, had been acclimatizing at base camp, ready to reclaim his title from longtime rival 80-year-old Yuichiro Miura who became the oldest climber to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain last week. However, a government promise to provide one million Nepali rupees (US$11,200) for the bid -- on which other sponsorship money hinged -- was awaiting government Cabinet approval in Kathmandu. Team leader Ishwari Poudel told CNN that going up Everest was now too risky because the snow had started to melt, making ladders and other equipment unstable. He said that since other expeditions had already left the mountain, there would be no manpower available in the event of a rescue. The government had also pledged to help Sherchan's bid by waiving the Everest climbing permit fee of US$10,000 but this was also held up by Cabinet delays. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, the Tourism Industry Division of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, said his department, which processes climbing permits, had received the application late and the waiver could only be decided by ministers. ""The government makes decisions following its own procedure,"" he said. Sherchan downplayed rumors he was returning due to health concerns. ""When one goes to climb such a mountain there are small health issues,"" he told CNN. Oldest Everest climber finally gets recognition . Sherchan and Miura have been rivals for at least five years. The two mountaineers first clashed in 2008, when Sherchan, then 76, reached the 29,028-foot (8,848-meter) peak a day before Miura, then 75. However, it was Miura's ascent that made it into Guinness World Records, forcing Sherchan to travel to London to set the record straight. Back in Nepal, he gathered paperwork, photos, witness accounts and media reports to confirm his ascent, and his feat finally entered the record books in 2010. Sherchan earlier dismissed talk that he was making the climb because he was in danger of losing his record. He said he had planned to reach the summit last year but failed to secure financial support. ""Why should I go to set a record? I have my own record.

""I think three times is enough,"" said Miura, who made his first ascent at the age of 70. ""At this point I could not think of anything but rest."" He wished Sherchan good luck but called on his rival to take a photograph as evidence of a successful climb. Known for his exploits as an extreme skier, Miura made the ascent with his son Gota. Sherchan's wife, however, was less than thrilled by her husband's late-in-life mountaineering. ""Of course I do not want him to go,"" Purna Kumari Sherchan said. ""I had told him not to go even the first time."" Sherchan was being assisted in his ascent by a Sherpa who has climbed Everest 12 times. To prepare, Sherchan carried a 25-kilogram (55-pound) load on his back while walking up and down the stairs of his three-story Kathmandu home several times a day. ""If I am unsuccessful, it will be because of the weather. It will not be because of my physical condition,"" Sherchan said, before he set off.","Octogenarian climber abandons bid to reclaim title of the oldest man to climb Mt Everest .

"(Financial Times) -- China is looking at introducing tough controls on its carbon pollution as soon as 2016, in a shift that could boost talks on a global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, an official at the heart of state carbon policy has said. China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions, has resisted international pressure to commit to absolute cuts in its emissions, which are the world's highest. Instead, it has said it will lower its ""carbon intensity"", or emissions relative to economic output. However, the powerful economic planning ministry is considering an outright cap on emissions for its next five-year plan (2016-20) and is studying what level would be appropriate, Jiang Kejun said. That could help to break a deadlock at the heart of UN climate talks, which are aiming to agree a legally binding global deal on cutting emissions -- at a 2015 meeting in Paris -- that would take effect from 2020. Mr Jiang, a carbon policy researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission, said: ""I am sure China will have a total emission target during the 13th five-year plan."" Mr Jiang, whose department is influential in shaping China's carbon policies, said a target for total emissions would be ""more effective"" than the previous intensity target. He added it was ""very possible"" China might drop its longstanding opposition to carbon caps for developing nations before the UN climate talks in Paris in 2015. ""The whole world needs to come up with a good protocol, and this should be the last protocol, otherwise we will not have time,"" said Mr Jiang, referring to the Paris climate talks. China's emissions cap would be linked to the existing caps on coal consumption, he said. Another reason for the changing stance is the growing public debate over air pollution in China, where it has become a public health crisis as well as a political issue. No official announcement has been made about an absolute emissions cap but Mr Jiang's comments mark the first time China's carbon policy makers have spoken publicly about such a plan. His remarks are in line with a shift in China's position that some say has been evident in recent closed climate talks outside the formal UN negotiations. The UN talks have stalled because the US and other wealthy western countries say they cannot approve a deal until big developing countries such as China drop their historical opposition to making the sorts of emissions cuts that have so far only been demanded of industrialised powers. Peter Kent, the Canadian environment minister, said that both China and Brazil had made ""very positive sounds"" about such a shift at a meeting of the so-called Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate in Washington DC in April. ""Both Brazil and China were saying things that I'd never heard before,"" Mr Kent said. They were among countries that had until now been ""reluctant to step up and step away from"" their previous positions on curbing emissions but ""all of a sudden were making some very positive sounds"". He added: ""We still have a way to go, but it was very encouraging. China and Brazil in particular, I think we're seeing movement from them to eventually make commitments."" The MEF includes the US, the EU and the Brics nations. The combined emissions of its members account for more than four-fifths of all fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions, far more than the 15 per cent covered by the only existing global climate treaty, the Kyoto protocol. China's leaders, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, have forged ahead with efforts to control carbon emissions since they took office in March. After several years of preparation, China is this year launching seven pilot carbon exchanges, which are envisioned as a testing ground for a possible national emissions tradition scheme later. Part of the reason for China's enthusiasm for controlling emissions is that policy makers see these controls as a way to rebalance China's economy away from energy-intensive, resource-intensive sectors and towards ""cleaner"" sectors such as services and technology. It is still unclear how China's carbon cap would be enforced, and whether it would be a firm limit or a loose target. A second policy maker who works on carbon policy at the NDRC declined to comment on the carbon cap, saying only that ""no announcement has been made so far"". The NDRC did not respond to faxed questions about a future carbon cap. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","China may introduce checks on carbon pollution by 2016 .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Health workers administering polio vaccinations to children came under attack in northern Pakistan on Tuesday, killing their police escort, authorities said. Two women administering the shots entered a house on the outskirts of Mardan when two assailants on a motorbike opened fire of them, according to Danishwar Khan, a local police official. The women were not injured. Attacks like these have become a frequent occurrence in some parts of Pakistan and have left 10 workers dead. Pakistan is one of three countries in the world where polio has yet to be eradicated. Read more: At the U.N., a vow to eradicate polio by 2015 . Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program in 2011 to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. It wasn't immediately clear if the Taliban played a role in Tuesday's attacks. Polio, a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours, has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 in 2011 to 58 in 2012, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.","NEW: Pakistan is one of three countries in the world where polio has yet to be eradicated .

"(CNN) -- Known for his outspoken, unapologetic support of migrants in Mexico, the Rev. Alejandro Solalinde is bringing his message to the United States. The priest is part of a caravan of migrants and their supporters traveling from Los Angeles to Washington to push for immigration reform. In Mexico, Solalinde has criticized the government, and even the Catholic Church, saying that both can be more compassionate to migrants. His views are shaped by the years he has spent leading a migrant shelter in Oaxaca that offers support to Central Americans who embark on the dangerous route north by clinging to trains. A number of threats last year led to his leaving his post, located in Ixtepec, in the southern state of Oaxaca, but he has since returned. ""I don't know how to live with fear,"" Solalinde told CNN. Immigration issues must be tackled both at the source and the destination of the migrants, he said. In the United States, Solalinde says he wants to include more voices in the debate. ""Not just the voice of the north, but the voice of the south, the voice of the poor, the voice of the migrants."" The 68-year-old, wearing a white button-down shirt, cream-colored vest, thin glasses and a cross necklace, admits that he believes his opinion will have little sway. With so much money and political interests at play, the voice of a Mexican priest is likely to get drowned out, he said. But Solalinde is undeterred. The caravan's participants are lobbying for a path to citizenship, a stop to the separation of families, and greater attention to the human cost of immigration policies. The priest says he is not advocating a certain policy, but wants to raise consciousness about the issue. An immigration bill currently pending in the Senate commits additional resources to southern border security and establishes a new system of metrics to measure border control effectiveness, but critics insist the plan is full of holes and will ultimately do little to help stem to the tide of illegal immigration. While claiming to strengthen the border, the legislation also would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while bringing dramatic change to labor policy on America's farms. U.S. tactics like a border wall and restrictive immigration policies do nothing other than drive up the price that smugglers charge to sneak people across the border, he said. At the migrant shelter in Oaxaca, Solalinde says he sees constant suffering, but also constant hope in the people who pass by. During his brief exile from the shelter, Solalinde spent a month in Europe followed by some weeks of reflection in Jalisco state before returning to Oaxaca. After doing much reading and writing during his time away, the priest said he returned with a deeper commitment for acting now, for helping migrants today, he said. ""Each day god gives me the grace to be happy, he provides strength, but at the end of the day my heart hurts, it tires emotionally,"" he said. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","The Rev. Alejandro Solalinde is well known in Mexico for his migrant shelter .

"(CNN) -- Two issues -- security and immigration -- often get too much attention when it comes to talking about the U.S.-Mexico relationship, U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday. Now, Obama said, it's time to forge deeper economic connections to create more jobs and more trade on both sides of the border. ""That's the focus of my visit,"" he told reporters after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in the country's capital. But even as Obama and Peña Nieto pushed to shift the tone more toward trade and economics, security issues loomed large over Thursday's meeting. Peña Nieto said his government remains committed to fighting organized crime, but that the United States and Mexico must ""cooperate on the basis of mutual respect, to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in Mexico."" Obama stressed that the countries will continue to cooperate closely on security, but he didn't specify how. ""I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as that nature of that close cooperation will evolve,"" he said. It's up to the Mexican people, Obama said, ""to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations, including the United States."" In the meantime, he said, the United States remains committed to reducing the demand for drugs north of the border, and the southward flow of illegal guns and cash that help fuel violence. ""I think it's natural that a new administration here in Mexico is looking carefully at how it's going to approach what is obviously a serious problem,"" Obama said, ""and we are very much looking forward to cooperating in any ways that we can to battle organized crime."" High-profile cartel takedowns were a hallmark of former President Felipe Calderon's tenure. Peña Nieto has vowed to take a different approach, focusing more on education problems and social inequality that he says fuel drug violence. The details of his policies are still coming into focus, and analysts say his government has deliberately tried to shift drug violence out of the spotlight. Before Obama's arrival, a spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border detailed changes in how Mexico cooperates with the United States. Under the new rules, all U.S. requests for collaboration with Mexican agencies will flow through a single office, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. It is a drastic change from recent years, when U.S. agents enjoyed widespread access to their Mexican counterparts. Critics have expressed concerns that Peña Nieto's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year. On Tuesday -- two days before Obama's arrival -- his government arrested the father-in-law of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, head of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Obama on Thursday, Peña Nieto emphasized the importance of reducing violence, and also the importance of Mexico's relationship with the United States extending beyond the drug war. ""We don't want to make this relationship targeted on one single issue,"" he said. ""We want to place particular emphasis on the potential in the economic relationship between Mexico and the United States."" To achieve that goal, Peña Nieto said, the presidents agreed to create a new high-level group to discuss economic and trade relations between the two nations. The group, which will include Cabinet ministers from both countries and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, will have its first meeting this fall, Peña Nieto said. Imports and exports between the United States and Mexico totaled nearly $500 billion last year, and before Obama's arrival officials on both sides of the border said economic relations would be a focal point during the U.S. president's visit. ""When the economy in Mexico has grown, and people have opportunity, a lot of our problems are solved, or we have the resources to solve them,"" Obama said Thursday. The emphasis on the economy Thursday was a significant shift, said Jason Marczak, director of policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas. ""The conversations between Mexico and the United States are changing,"" he told CNN en Español. Obama is scheduled to deliver a speech at the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City on Friday morning. In the afternoon, he will travel to Costa Rica, where he will meet President Laura Chinchilla and other regional leaders. CNN's Mariano Castillo and CNN en Español's Juan Carlos Lopez and Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.","A new high-level group to discuss economic cooperation will convene in the fall .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Prominent retailers and clothing suppliers are scrambling to clarify their links to a garment factory in Bangladesh that caught fire over the weekend, killing more than 100 people. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Monday that the Tazreen Fashion factory in Ashulia, near the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, was no longer authorized to produce merchandise for its stores. But one of its suppliers ""subcontracted work to this factory without authorization and in direct violation of our policies,"" Wal-Mart said in a statement. ""Today, we have terminated the relationship with that supplier,"" it said, without identifying the company in question. The clothing factory, housed in a multistory building, caught fire Saturday night. More than 100 people were killed and at least 200 were injured as they rushed to escape, police said. The toll makes it ""the most deadly factory fire in the history of the apparel industry in Bangladesh,"" according to the International Labor Rights Forum (ILRF), a workers advocacy group. The range of international companies being linked to the Tazreen facility highlights the complex web of global supply chains in the clothing industry. Li & Fung, a large trading company that supplies international retailers, said that it had placed orders worth more than $100,000 with the Tazreen factory this year for Kids Headquarters, part of its U.S. subsidiary. But it said it had not made orders for other customers with Tazreen. Li & Fung, which is based in Hong Kong, said it was very distressed and saddened by the deaths of workers"" at the factory. It said it was offering the equivalent of about $1,200 to the family of each victim of the blaze. It also said it was setting up a fund for the education of victims' children. Fire rips through clothing factory near Dhaka . The big loss of life has provoked anger among workers in Bangladesh's huge garment industry. Thousands of people from dozens of clothing factories in Ashulia took to the streets Monday to protest the way in which their colleagues died. The protesters blocked traffic and demonstrated for several hours, demanding compensation and a full investigation into what happened. The Bangladeshi government has ordered such an investigation, asking two committees to file reports within a week. Li & Fung said it would carry out its own investigation. A period of national mourning was also held Tuesday for those killed at the factory and for the victims from a recent overpass collapse in southeastern Bangladesh. Overpass collapse kills 11 in Bangladesh . All apparel factories were to be closed Tuesday, and special prayers offered at mosques, churches and temples. As well as Wal-Mart and Li & Fung, other big companies were dealing with the fallout from the disaster. The ILRF published a list of companies whose brand logos had been found on clothing and documents at the factory. They included Dickies, whose owner, Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Co., said it had concluded its ""production schedule"" with Tazreen earlier this year. Williamson-Dickie aims to ""ensure the global vendors and suppliers we work with provide a safe work environment in accordance with all applicable laws and fair labor practices,"" the company said. The ILRF also said that the True Desire brand sold at the retailer Sears was among those linked to the factory. Sears Holdings said that it does not source products from the Tazreen factory and recognizes the critical importance of fire safety. ""Any merchandise found at that factory should NOT have been manufactured there and we are currently investigating further,"" the company said in a statement. Even as Bangladesh prepared to mourn the deaths from the weekend fire, firefighters battled a blaze at another apparel factory near Dhaka on Monday. Police and witnesses said the latest fire, at a 10-story clothing factory in the suburb of Uttara, began Monday morning, and firefighters took about four hours to bring it under control. ""Firefighters have brought the flames under control, and no one died in the incident,"" Brig. Gen. Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah, director general of Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defense, told reporters. Local police said at least 10 people were injured in Uttara as they jumped from windows to escape. They said the fire began on the second floor, where a large quantity of fabric and yarn were stored, and it spread immediately to the fourth floor. Bangladesh's ready-made garments make up 80% of the country's $24 billion in annual exports. The country has about 4,500 garment factories that make clothes for stores including Tesco, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, H&M, Marks & Spencer, Kohl's and Carrefour. The sector earned $19 billion this year as of June. The state-run news agency, Sangbad Sangstha, recently reported that some 6,000 people die every year in fires in Bangladesh. The accounts of survivors from the blaze on Saturday night underlined the panic and chaos at the scene. ""How the factory caught fire, I don't know. But when we heard 'fire,' we all rushed out and we were trying to get out of the factory,"" said Parul Begum, a survivor. ""One factory worker broke a window and one of the workers pulled me through. After the fire, we tried to run out the door, but it was locked. When the floor (became) dark with smoke, the boys came to rescue me,"" she said. CNN's Atika Shubert and Jethro Mullen, and journalist Farid Ahmed contributed to this report.","The factory was not authorized to make merchandise for Wal-Mart, company says .

"San Salvador, El Salvador (CNN) -- A 22-year-old woman in El Salvador, pregnant and suffering from illnesses, has become a flashpoint in the country's debate on abortion. The life of the woman, known only as ""Beatriz,"" is in danger if the pregnancy goes full term, but abortion is illegal in El Salvador with no exceptions, women's rights groups say. Anti-abortion groups counter that Beatriz is being used by abortion-rights advocates as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws. Beatriz's case is not the first time that risk to a mother's life has created an abortion controversy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Last year, a young woman in the Dominican Republic was denied chemotherapy to treat her leukemia for weeks because of the risk it posed to her unborn child. She eventually began receiving treatment, but both she and her fetus died. In Beatriz's case, she is suffering from lupus and kidney problems, and her unborn child developed without parts of its brain or skull. She asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life, but doctors are hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they won't be prosecuted. The country's Supreme Court has taken up the case, but it has deliberated for weeks without a ruling, raising the ire of the groups that support Beatriz. ""We are outraged at their abdication of their role to protect and defend Beatriz's life and health,"" said Esther Major, Central America researcher for Amnesty International. ""There is no justice in this delay, and definitely no humanity."" Beatriz is now 24 weeks pregnant. Although she is at the center of a national debate over abortion, Beatriz has declined to give interviews. Her mother, however, has spoken to the press. ""If this baby is born both (mother and child) could die, and they tell me that the baby would survive just six hours if it is born,"" the mother said. Beatriz argues that an abortion could save her life, and allow her to care for her other child, who is a year old. ""The fetus will die because it is not healthy, and so we have to decide that we must save Beatriz's life because there is another child who needs her,"" said Blanca Lopez of the Salvadoran Women's Union. Opponents of abortion have not been silent on the issue. ""I think that a great debate has been created using Beatriz, using her problem to promote the legalization of abortion,"" said Regina de Cardenal of the country's Yes to Life Foundation. Although the doctors who are treating Beatriz recommended an abortion, others in the medical field disagree. ""Unfortunately, lupus is an incurable disease, and there is no reason to lie to the public,"" said Miguel Fortin of the Institute of Legal Medicine. ""Beatriz will not get better if her pregnancy is terminated. The pregnancy is a temporary condition but the lupus will remain."" The country's health minister has indicated that the government supports an abortion, but that it is up to the Supreme Court to decide. With each passing week, the debate is more intense as the health of the mother and fetus are weighed. If the Supreme Court does not act quickly, Beatriz may travel to another country where she can get an abortion, her mother said. ""If here in this country they don't allow her what she has asked for, that would be a possibility,"" she said. Ireland's government puts forward draft abortion bill .

"(CNN) -- As the swimming meet comes to its final days, the action at track and field begins at the Olympic Stadium. Here's what to look for as that competition starts and in four other notable sports: . 1) Track and field: Sprint queens begin their quests . A few weeks ago, Allyson Felix watched as Jeneba Tarmoh took a celebratory lap at the Olympic Trials, apparently the third qualifier for the Olympics in the women's 100 meters. But Friday, it's Felix who will take to the blocks in a quest to finally win a gold medal. There was a second look at the photo finish. The two sprinters had tied, officials ruled. Then the track bosses scrambled to figure out a way to break the tie and decide who would run the event in London. On the day of a scheduled runoff, Tarmoh backed out. She's still part of the U.S. team, but she's a member of the relay pool. On Friday, Felix will race twice, seeking a spot in one of Saturday's semifinals. SI: Life-changing win for Gabby . Track and field begins at 10 a.m. London time (5 a.m. ET) 2) Swimming: Speaking of photo finishes . Four years ago, it became one of the most famous photos of the Beijing Games: Shot from the bottom of the pool, Michael Phelps in one lane, Milorad Cavic in the other, two swimmers lunging for Olympic gold. Phelps won the 100-meter butterfly that day by .01 seconds, after catching the Serbian swimmer gliding to the wall as Phelps took a quick, final stroke. Tonight, they will race again. But also look out for Chad le Clos, who beat Phelps in the last few meters of the 200-meter butterfly. Swimming begins at 10 a.m. London time (5 a.m. ET); the medley relay heats start at 11:49 a.m. in London (6:49 a.m. ET) followed by four finals in the 7:30 p.m. London time session (2:30 p.m. ET). 3) Tennis: Hopes for happier result at home . Britain's Andy Murray, who reached Wimbledon finals a few weeks ago, plays Novak Djokovic of Croatia in one men's singles semifinal. In the other, Roger Federer of Switzerland matches up with Juan Martin del Potro. The women also play singles semifinals; those matches are Serena Williams of the United States vs. Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, and Russians Maria Sharapova vs. Maria Kirilenko. Photos: American gold medal winners . Both matches begin at noon in London (7 a.m. ET) 4) Soccer: A big Hope here, too . The United States is backed by goalie Hope Solo, who gave up two criticized goals early to France and nothing since. The Americans face New Zealand (nicknamed the Football Ferns), which finished third in Group E. In February the Football Ferns nearly beat the United States, but forward Alex Morgan scored two late goals to rally the Americans. They also played a closed door match a few days later; no results were reported. The highlight match of the day could be Brazil with its great player Marta vs. World Cup champion Japan. Matches start at noon London time (7 a.m.) with the U.S.-New Zealand match at 2:30 p.m. London time (9:30 a.m. ET) 5) Judo: Saudi female expected to wear headscarf . At first, judo officials said they wouldn't allow 16-year-old Wojdan Shaherkani of Saudi Arabia to wear a hijab during her judo match. Shaherkani's father and Saudi officials insisted she would not compete unless she could wear the headscarf. On Friday, she will be permitted to wear it when she fights Melissa Mojica of Puerto Rico in a round of 32 match. Shaherkani, who is competing at her first major international event, received a special invitation to compete from the International Olympic Committee. Abuse victim wins first U.S. judo gold .

"(CNN) -- It is a surprising scene -- a picnic-like atmosphere with children playing in the pool under the tropical sun. The adults are also in celebration mode. The crowd is listening to a couple of rappers and some people dance to the beat. But this is not a park or a recreational facility. It's not somebody's backyard either. This is pavilion 1234 at one of the largest correctional facilities in Venezuela: San Antonio Prison. The prison is located on Venezuela's Margarita Island, also home to a popular beach resort that attracts international tourists. Carlos Nieto Palma, a Venezuelan human rights advocate, says San Antonio, located in Nueva Esparta state, has become a recreational facility where you can find anything from weapons to drugs and alcohol. Inmates allegedly even have access to cockfighting rings and prostitutes, but that's not the most shocking part. Nieto Palma, who's also the general coordinator of A Window to Freedom, a prison watchdog group, says the inmates recently had a grand opening for a discotheque with capacity for 600 people. He learned about the night club after getting an invitation by email and confirming the news with prisoners. ""This invitation talked about a discotheque with stage lights and LED screens. It also talked about a party lasting until sunrise where there would be 'bad girls,' with 'toys' to play with them. You can then assume that they also had drugs, alcohol, and other things,"" Nieto Palma said. This is not the first time conditions at the San Antonio prison have raised eyebrows. A New York Times report in 2011 called the prison ""a Hugh Heffner-inspired fleshpot."" Nieto Palma, who has been at San Antonio several times, says the prison is actually run by Teófilo Rodríguez, a convicted drug trafficker known as ""El Conejo"" or ""The Rabbit."" Nothing happens at San Antonio without the approval of The Rabbit or his gang, he says. ""The state hasn't been able to do anything against them in spite of the multiple statements made by the minister of prisons vowing to end the power of the mafias,"" Nieto Palma said. CNN tried for weeks to get a response to the allegations from the Venezuelan Ministry of Prisons. In a phone call, ministry spokesman Francisco Solórzano dismissed the discotheque claim. ""That's a lie. Someone came up with that lie because they were trafficking drugs inside the prison and we ruined their business. We do not respond to lies,"" Solórzano said, before abruptly ending the call. The possible existence of a discotheque inside a Venezuela prison is just the latest example of a prison system that human rights groups including A Window to Freedom, the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons and Human Rights Watch say is in a state of crisis. They say in the best cases, prisoners control their own affairs to preserve a fragile peace, while the worst involve constant riots and a climate of violence and murder. Read more: Report -- Prison riot kills dozens in Venezuela . According to the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons, a prisoner rights organization, there are 45,500 inmates in 33 Venezuelan prisons that were built for 17,500. This means the overcrowding rate in the country's prison system is 176%. Marianela Sánchez, an attorney with the group, says the observatory estimates that about 5,300 inmates have died inside prison walls since 1999 and more than 15,000 have been injured. Many of the fatalities and injuries have been the result of prison uprisings. In January, 56 prisoners and one member of the Venezuelan National Guard were killed during riots at Uribana prison in Lara state, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Forty-six other prisoners suffered serious injuries. During a weekend riot in June 2011, 19 people died at El Rodeo I Prison near Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, as reported by the Venezuelan Interior Ministry. ""This government has been an accomplice by omission. We have a population of more than 20,000 inmates who have been the victims of violence in jails. Some have lost their lives others have been injured. The state does not have the ability and has not demonstrated in practice that it can protect the life of prisoners,"" Sanchez said. Read more: Venezuelan prison standoff comes to an end [2011] . Last December, Minister Iris Varela issued a statement after launching an investigation into the savage beating of inmates at a federal prison in Falcon state. The investigation was launched after a video showed prisoners forced to strip completely naked and hit in the buttocks, one by one, with what appeared to be a baseball bat. ""We strongly repudiate those actions against the inmates. It's abominable. If there's a government that has respected the human rights of prisoners, that is the revolutionary government led by [then] President Chavez,"" the statement said. But Nieto Palma, the prisoner rights activist, says the government has done little to improve the situation and suggests the minister knows what happens inside prisons like San Antonio, on Margarita Island. He showed CNN a picture of Varela posing with The Rabbit to make a point: gangsters have plenty of clout. What makes San Antonio different is a lower homicide rate. In other facilities, where overcrowding can be at dangerous levels, violence is common. Last year alone, nearly 600 people died inside Venezuelan prisons, according to Human Rights Watch. But at San Antonio, hard-core criminals seem to be content for the most part. Their perks include free access to entertainment and women and a pool awaits those ready for a splash under Venezuela's tropical sun.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Human rights groups from the United States and Spain filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court Thursday, charging El Salvador's former president, Alfredo Cristiani, with covering up crimes against humanity. Alfredo Cristiani in 1994 shortly after he voted during the country's second round presidential runoff. The case involves the killing of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her teenaged daughter nearly two decades ago during El Salvador's civil war. In addition, 14 former Salvadoran military officers are accused of war crimes, murders and state terrorism in connection with the massacre dating back to November 1989. Most of the slain Jesuits were born in Spain. They were killed at their residence at the prestigious Central American University, in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador. Reports at the time said they were tortured and then shot. It has become one of the most notorious episodes of El Salvador's 12-year civil war that pitted leftist guerrillas against the U.S.-backed conservative government. Some 75,000 people died. The case filed by two human rights groups in Madrid argues that justice was never done in El Salvador. Two military officers were convicted of murder in 1991 in the deaths of the Jesuits, but were pardoned in 1993 under an amnesty law approved by the national assembly. The case was taken to Spain's National Court, because of its involvement in other high-profile human rights cases. The same Spanish court issued an arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998, while he was in a London hospital. For the rest of his life he fought legal battles -- first in England and later in Chile -- to avoid convictions. The Spanish court has also taken on human rights cases from other countries, including Argentina and Guatemala, testing a relatively new international legal principle known as Universal Jurisdiction. It contends that if justice for human rights abuses is not served in the country where the crime occurred, then a court in another country can intervene. The groups filing suits are the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability and the Spanish Association for Human Rights. Family members from at least two of the slain Jesuits will join the lawsuit later, the groups said. It could take the National Court weeks or even months to determine if it will accept the case. Spain and El Salvador have an extradition treaty. But a lawyer for the Center for Justice and Accountability told CNN that the most immediate practical effect of the case might be an effective ban on Cristiani and the 14 former officers from leaving El Salvador, for fear of arrest. If they were ever tried before a Spanish court and convicted on the charges, they could serve up to 30 years in prison. In an interview with CNN a few months before he was killed, university rector Ignacio Ellecuria praised then-president Cristiani, whom the human rights groups now accuse of covering up the crime. ""We have to recognize that Cristiani is a man of his word, who keeps his promises,"" Ellecuria told CNN. ""Personally I consider Cristiani an ethical, responsible person who will not offer to do what he can't or doesn't wish to do."" Ignacio Martin-Baro, another slain Jesuit, spoke at the time about the chilling effect of the long-running Salvadoran civil war. ""We have become used to violence,"" Martin-Baro said. ""We have become used to living in a very dangerous world. We have learned to live, accepting death, extraordinary abnormal death into our lives."" For years, the extreme right in El Salvador had accused the Jesuits of siding with the leftist guerrillas, according to a CNN report shortly after the killings. Uniformed troops were seen searching the living quarters of the priests at Central American University two days before they were killed, CNN reported.","Case involves killing of 6 Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter .

"(CNN) -- Never before in Pakistan's history has a parliamentary election resulted in a true democratic transition. Despite militant threats and attacks that left at least 21 people dead on election day, Pakistanis bravely voted in record numbers Saturday. While we're still waiting for official results, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz party looks to have a clear mandate to steer the country forward for the next five years. This is an important moment, but the challenges ahead are daunting. Democracy and the institutions of civil society remain as fragile as ever, with minorities especially vulnerable to persecution. A range of militants groups still enjoys safe haven throughout the country.  And the economy is in shambles. Now is the time for Pakistan's new leaders to grasp the nettle. It is time for the major parties to shift from campaigning to governing, consolidate democratic gains and tackle deteriorating security and economic conditions. The stakes are enormous, and Pakistan's new leaders cannot afford to miss this moment.  A recent Pew poll found that roughly nine in 10 Pakistanis believe the country is on the wrong track. This week's elections provided a voice for millions to cast their ballot for a better future, a democratic future. The United States should support this process and continue working toward a long-term relationship based on mutual goals. Pakistan today is buffeted by gale-force pressures: a long rivalry with India to its east, a bitter and bloody insurgency in its western tribal regions, a fragile transition in Afghanistan and twin financial and energy crises that burn at its core, leaving millions without power and businesses without access to credit. In the coming weeks, Pakistan may face a balance of payments crisis unless its new leaders take decisive action. There is no doubt that we are dealing with complicated issues in a volatile region. The United States has been working steadily with Pakistan to meet these challenges. With greater commitment and support from Pakistan's new leaders, we can build on existing areas of cooperation even as we press our interests. There is still a great deal of mistrust that permeates this relationship. It's unacceptable that two years after the United States found and killed Osama bin Laden, the most noteworthy action taken to get the facts on how he came to be in Pakistan is the conviction of the doctor that helped us track him down. We know that militant groups have taken refuge along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. And let's face it: when Americans hear about U.S. troops in Afghanistan under attack by insurgents who enjoy safe haven in Pakistan, they naturally see red. Despite these challenges, the reality is the United States and Pakistan share common interests and need to work closely together. Now is not the time to cut and run but to renew our efforts to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan and to address the terrorist threat that afflicts both our nations. Pakistan remains vital to any sustainable and peaceful outcome in the region. It can support genuine reconciliation efforts with the Afghan Taliban or undermine them. It can serve as the most cost-effective supply route for withdrawing our troops and equipment from Afghanistan or block their passage. And it can rein in militant groups that threaten India and halt the spread of nuclear weapons and technology or aid in their proliferation. If ever there was an opportunity for Pakistan to advance regional peace and security, this is it.  The international community is working toward a coordinated transition in Afghanistan to mitigate the prospects of civil war as foreign troops depart. We need Pakistan's help to get this right. Without close cooperation, our efforts will be imperiled, and Pakistani fears of international abandonment will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, once said: ""The story of Pakistan, its struggle and its achievement, is the very story of great human ideals, struggling to survive in the face of great odds and difficulties."" Pakistan's story is still being written, but its next chapter will be defined by action, not by words alone. This week's elections mark the beginning, not the end, of a long road. Pakistan's new leaders have an historic opportunity to provide real leadership and show that democracy can deliver. For their sake and ours, let's hope they rise to the challenge. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Menendez.","Pakistan's election Saturday has potential to be nation's first peaceful transition .

"(CNN) -- More than three weeks of testimony in the genocide trial of former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt were nullified by a judge Thursday on procedural grounds, state-run media reported. The impact of the ruling on the trial -- which was nearing completion -- was not immediately clear. A three-judge Supreme Court panel had pushed forward with the trial of Rios Montt despite unresolved objections to procedures in lower courts. Judge Carol Patricia Flores ruled that because all of the issues at the lower courts had not been settled, the current proceedings are invalid, the state-run AGN news agency reported. The ruling in effect rewinds the legal process against Rios Montt to where it was in November of 2011, in a pre-trial phase. Guatemala confronts a dark chapter . Flores called it a regrettable situation, saying the process had come to this point because the proper procedures weren't followed earlier, according to the Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala, which had representatives present in the courtroom. The judge said she was aware that the ruling would not be popular, but that it does not mean that justice will not be done, the group reported. Standing trial alongside Rios Montt is Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez, who was head of intelligence in the early 1980s. The pair are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity. Prosecutors accuse them of ordering 15 massacres between 1982 and 1983 in the northwestern region of Quiche. More than 1,700 Ixil Mayans were killed in those operations, prosecutors say. Rios Montt ruled Guatemala from 1982 to 1983. He came to power in a coup and led a military junta while Guatemala was in a bloody civil war between the army and leftist guerrillas. The war did not end until 1996, leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees. Prosecutors argued that Rios Montt was aware of the repressive strategies that the military was using against anyone suspected of being a guerrilla, such as killings, forced disappearances and kidnappings. His defense has argued that he never explicitly ordered the killings of the indigenous group.","Efrain Rios Montt ruled Guatemala from 1982 to 1983 .

"(CNN) -- Five people were rescued Sunday, but two more remain missing, after their hot air balloon crashed off the coast of Peru. The balloon's red and white wreckage was found in the Pacific Ocean south of the capital, Lima, the state-run Andina news agency reported. Citing the country's interior minister, it said that those rescued -- all women -- were taken to a naval hospital. Their conditions were not immediately known. The balloon's pilot and another man, a passenger, are still missing. ""Hopefully we can find them as soon as possible,"" Andina reported Minister Wilfredo Pedraza as saying. ""All we know is that one of them tried to swim to the coast. The search will continue, even at night, until they are rescued."" Workers are scouring the area with the help of helicopters, fishing boats and jet skis. Pedraza stressed the immediate priority is on finding the missing men but that there will be an investigation into what went wrong. The balloon was not equipped with GPS, nor did it have life jackets, the minister said, Andina reported. The crash recalled a somewhat similar hot air balloon accident in Egypt in February. Early investigations into that crash showed gas canisters exploded, causing the balloon to plummet and resulting in the deaths of 19 people. How safe is hot air ballooning?

"(CNN) -- Passengers might have been catching a catnap, reading a book or daydreaming as they gazed out the window into southern Canada. They may have recently hopped on the train or boarded many hours ago as far back as New York. Whatever their origin, wherever they were sitting, wherever they were going -- perhaps to the last stop of Toronto -- these travelers wouldn't have expected the terror that Canadian and U.S. authorities detailed this week, a plot they alleged was backed by al Qaeda elements half a world away. According to a U.S. intelligence official and another government official, the plan was to plant explosives on a trestle -- a type of bridge over which trains often pass -- and detonate them after a northbound train crossed from the United States into Canada. Specifically, another U.S. official said, the New York-to-Toronto line that runs through Buffalo was targeted. Once the explosives went off, two of the officials said, the train would have careered off its tracks, causing untold death and destruction. The attack never happened. Instead, the two men who Canadian authorities say planned the alleged terror plot are behind bars. On Tuesday, a day after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced the arrests, 35-year-old Raed Jaser appeared in Old City Hall Court in Toronto, the city he calls home. Asked whether he understood the legal proceeding, Jaser said, ""It's very clear."" But his lawyer, John Norris, afterward said that his client -- whom he described as a permanent resident in Canada, where he has lived the past 20 years -- is ""in a state of shock and disbelief."" ""He is anxious to see the evidence that the crown says that it has against him,"" Norris said outside the courtroom. After waiving the reading of his charges, Jaser returned to the Canadian federal facility where he's being held. Bail was not considered Tuesday in his case. His alleged co-conspirator -- 30-year-old Chiheb Esseghaier, who was taken to Montreal for a jurisdiction hearing so that a justice can decide whether he'll be transferred to the province of Ontario -- is expected to be in a Toronto courtroom Wednesday for a similar proceeding, said Norris. According to court documents, both Jaser and Esseghaier face charges of conspiring ""to murder persons unknown ... for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group."" Suspects not citizens but have roots in Canada . So who are these two suspects, and what were they doing? Authorities have not released much detail about the men, including their nationalities or how long they'd been in Canada, beyond that they weren't Canadian citizens. University of Quebec spokeswoman Julie Martineau said that, since 2010, Esseghaier has been a doctoral student at the National Institute of Scientific Research at that school. He was conducting research on nanosensors, which are used primarily for medical treatments or to build other nanoproducts, such as computer chips, she said. ""He seemed like a normal student,"" said Martineau. Authorities allege that Esseghaier and Jaser watched ""trains and railways in the greater Toronto area"" and intended to derail a passenger train, said Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan. ""We are alleging these two individuals took steps and conducted activities to conduct a terrorist attack,"" she said. Muhammad Robert Heft, a Muslim community leader in Toronto, told CNN that a tip from a local imam led to the investigation. Heft, president of the Muslim social services organization Paradise Forever, cited the Canadian police, which he said revealed the information during a briefing on Monday with local Muslim leaders. ""We are supportive and thankful that the RCMP did the investigation and was able to apprehend the individuals before anything happened,"" Heft said. ""We are pleased that they took us in and explained what was going on."" The Canadian Broadcasting Corp., quoting ""highly placed sources,"" reported that Esseghaier and Jaser had been under surveillance for more than a year. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that the FBI worked with its law enforcement counterparts in Canada, its close ally, during the investigation. The terror plot -- which a RCMP official said on condition of anonymity wasn't linked to last week's deadly Boston Marathon bombings -- was in its planning stages and not imminent, Canadian authorities said. Still, the outlines are reminiscent of those found in a document seized during the raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. This document indicated that al Qaeda members discussed as early as 2010 a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and in valleys, though no specific rail system was identified, a law enforcement official told CNN in late 2011. Police allege ties to al Qaeda in Iran . Authorities have said that they believe the suspects had help. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner James Malizia said the men got ""support from al Qaeda elements in Iran"" to carry out an attack and conspire to murder people in greater Toronto. There's no evidence that Iran's government was behind the plot, he added. ""When I speak about 'supported,' I mean direction and guidance,"" Malizia said. Iran denies that al Qaeda has any presence within its borders. ""Al Qaeda has no possibility to do any activity inside Iran or conduct any operation abroad from Iran's territory, and we reject strongly and categorically any connection to this story,"" Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a statement . Al Qaeda and Iran have not been viewed as allies, with al Qaeda's membership mostly Sunni-dominated rather than Shiite, the Muslim sect of the vast majority of Iranians. ""We have very little intelligence on al Qaeda in Iran,"" said U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee. What is known is that bin Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith fled Afghanistan and ended up in Iran after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. According to U.S. documents and officials, Abu Ghaith landed in Iran along with other members of bin Laden's inner circle, including the group's military commander, Saif al-Adel, and Saad bin Laden, a son of the al Qaeda leader who has played a leadership role in the group . Saad bin Laden also helped one of his father's wives and several of his father's children move from Pakistan to Iran, officials said. Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti, was captured in Jordan this year and is now in the United States, where he'll be charged in federal court with conspiring to kill Americans as part of al Qaeda. Bin Laden confidant emerged as voice of al Qaeda .

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- A week ago, the genocide trial of former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt appeared headed to a historic conclusion. Today, it is at a standstill, the result of procedural missteps that have cast uncertainty over the process. The country's Constitutional Court on Tuesday began to answer some of the legal questions that are holding up the trial. But the biggest one -- whether the trial proceedings will be annulled -- remains to be clarified. Guatemala confronts a dark chapter . The court ruled that the case file must be transferred from the judge who was overseeing the trial to another judge who at one time had been on the case but was removed. The new judge in charge of the case, Carol Patricia Flores, is the same judge who last week ruled that all of the testimony heard in the trial is annulled and that the proceedings should revert to a pretrial phase. The plaintiffs appealed that ruling and are awaiting the decision of the Constitutional Court. The charges against Rios Montt, who ruled Guatemala from 1982 to 1983, are considered historic because it is the first time a former head of state has been tried for genocide by the country's own justice system. Rios Montt and his then-intelligence chief, Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez, are accused of responsibility in the killings of more than 1,700 indigenous Ixil Mayans. Rios Montt's defense has argued that the leader never ordered the extermination of the Ixil. For more than three weeks, the trial moved at a fast pace under judge Yassmin Barrios, with dozens of witnesses testifying each day. Dozens of Ixil Mayans told of brutal killings and rapes that they suffered, stories that often left those watching the proceedings with their jaws dropped. Rios Montt's attorneys presented their case, too, saying there is no record anywhere of him ordering the killings of Ixil. The Mayan subgroup was not singled out for its ethnicity, the lawyers said. The trial was nearing closing arguments when Flores put the brakes on it with her ruling on the invalidity of the testimony. The three-judge Supreme Court panel overseeing the proceedings had pushed forward with the trial despite unresolved objections to procedures in lower courts. Flores ruled that because all of the issues at the lower courts had not been settled, the current proceedings were invalid. Judge nullifies testimony in Guatemala genocide trial . The case is back in Flores' hands, but until the Constitutional Court rules on the appeal, it is not a certainty that the case will revert to its pretrial phase. It is still possible that the trial will pick up where it left off, but with Flores now as judge. Other related rulings that the Constitutional Court handed down on Tuesday, however, point to how complicated untangling the legal web is. The court ruled that the trial court had erred by dismissing one of Rios Montt's attorneys during the first day of the trial. The Constitutional Court also said the court erred by ordering lawyers for Rios Montt's co-defendant to defend the former leader, too. Rios Montt came to power in a coup and led a military junta while Guatemala was in a bloody civil war between the army and leftist guerrillas. The war did not end until 1996, leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees. CNN's Mariano Castillo wrote this story and contributed from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Hugo Chavez's handpicked successor was sworn in as Venezuela's president on Friday. Nicolas Maduro's inauguration ceremony took a dramatic turn at one point as a man in a red jacket rushed toward the podium in Venezuela's National Assembly. ""They could have shot me right here. Security has failed,"" Maduro said after the man was taken away. Maduro was quick to regain the floor and spoke for more than two hours, vowing to crack down on any coup attempts to remove him from the presidency and slamming political opponents for waging what he called a ""dirty election campaign"" against him. Maduro's inauguration comes a day after Venezuela's National Electoral Council said it would complete 100% audit of votes cast in Sunday's election ""to preserve a climate of harmony between Venezuelans."" Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in the election while opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski won 49%, election officials said earlier this week. Capriles had called for a vote-by-vote recount but said late Thursday that he accepted the decision by election officials to audit the tally. The narrow margin has sparked mounting tensions in Venezuela after the closely watched election to pick Chavez's successor. Venezuela's state-run AVN news agency said at least eight people have been killed in post-election violence across the country. The government news agency tied the deaths to opposition protests and said the victims were all followers of Maduro. CNN could not independently confirm government reports of violence and it was unknown whether there were any opposition injuries or fatalities. Opposition protesters have sent numerous accounts to CNN's iReport, criticizing the government and pushing for a recount. In one of his last public appearances before his March 5 death, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to be his successor. Maduro now describes himself as ""Chavez's son"" and has vowed to continue the late leader's plans to build ""21st century socialism."" On Thursday night, Capriles urged supporters not to be discouraged by Friday's inauguration and to stay at home and listen to salsa music. ""This fight has not finished. ... I am sure that sooner rather than later the truth will come out,"" he said.","Nicolas Maduro is sworn in as Venezuela's president .

"(CNN) -- More than 100 people gathered at a church in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Saturday for the funeral of a 17-year-old girl who hanged herself after she was allegedly gang-raped and then bullied when a picture of the incident went viral. Mourners at St. Mark's Anglican Church remembered Rehtaeh Parsons for her caring nature and love of animals, CNN affiliate CTV reported. Her cousin, Angela, said the eulogy included ""memorable stories of our beloved Rehtaeh."" Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter attended the funeral. ""I came to the service today first and foremost as a father trying to imagine what kind of incredible, unfathomable grief could be visited upon a family, and to try and be supportive in this very, very difficult time,"" he said. Rehtaeh was taken off life support last weekend, three days after she hanged herself. Her family says she developed suicidal thoughts after she was sexually assaulted two years ago, and after a picture of the incident was shared by phone and online. The high school student became despondent, especially after a police investigation ended without criminal charges, her mother wrote on a Facebook tribute page. ""Rehtaeh is gone today because of the four boys that thought that raping a 15-year-old girl was OK and to distribute a photo to ruin her spirit and reputation would be fun,"" Leah Parsons wrote. ""All the bullying and messaging and harassment that never let up are also to blame. Lastly, the justice system failed her. Those are the people that took the life of my beautiful girl."" As news of her death spread, so did outrage that police did not file any sexual assault or child pornography charges -- even though authorities confirmed a photograph allegedly showing the teen having sex with one of the boys was circulated to friends' mobile phones and computers. A joint investigation by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and local authorities found ""insufficient evidence to proceed with charges,"" RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott MacRae said earlier this week. But on Friday, eastern Canadian police announced they are reopening the investigation. The HRM Partners in Policing -- which includes Halifax Regional Police and a locally based division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police -- said in a statement it was reviewing the case ""in light of new and credible information"" that has recently been brought forward to police. A demand for answers . By late Saturday, more than 200,000 people signed a petition demanding an independent investigation on how police handled the case. The lead petitioner described the decision to reopen the case as ""a great step,"" but said ""if we want real justice -- we need to find out why the RCMP did not lay charges in the first place."" RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott MacRae said the new information that led authorities to reopen their investigation ""did not come from an online source."" ""We can talk to a witness, we can verify the person, we can substantiate some of the information that has come forth, and that is a good thing,"" MacRae said. MacRae said investigators hope reopening the case will encourage those with information to come forward, ""but we have to advise the public that we can't accept reports through social media."" A disturbing trend . The Nova Scotia case is one of several involving reports of a teenage girl being raped and then humiliated after photos of the alleged attacks went viral. In California, three teenage boys are facing charges of sexual battery in connection with the alleged rape of 15-year-old Audrie Pott, who later committed suicide. Santa Clara County Sheriff's detectives said Audrie had too much to drink at a party and was passed out when the boys allegedly assaulted her. The boys are accused of taking photos of the attack and sharing them at school, as well as texting the images and posting them online. And in Ohio, two high school football players were convicted last month of raping an intoxicated 16-year-old girl. Graphic text messages, social media posts and cell phone pictures and videos emerged in court. The trial divided the football-crazed town of Steubenville. The case caught the attention of bloggers and Anonymous, a loosely organized hacking activist group. A warning from Anonymous . Anonymous has also expressed outrage over the Canada case and said it might release the names of teens linked to the alleged rape in an effort to force authorities to pursue prosecution. The group told Nova Scotia Justice Minister Ross Landry that ""justice is in your hands and supports the legal machinery to move forward with charges."" ""Better act fast,"" Anonymous warned Canadian law enforcement in a statement. ""We do not approve of vigilante justice as the media claims. That would mean we approve of violent actions against these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob,"" the group said. ""What we want is justice. And that's your job. So do it."" Jason Barnes, partner of the teen's mother, said the family does not ""support the publishing of the names"" in the case, which has shocked Canada. ""We are not looking for some kind of vigilante justice. We just want justice,"" Barnes said. Anonymous claimed it took only a few hours to identify the boys who assaulted her. ""This wasn't some high-tech operation that involved extracting private messages from someone's Facebook account. Dozens of e-mails were sent to us by kids and adults alike, most of whom had personal relationships with the rapists. Many recalled confessions made by these boys blatantly in public where they detailed the rape of an inebriated 15-year-old girl,"" the group said. ""These sad little boys had no fear whatsoever about admitting publicly their crimes and even spreading photographic evidence of it. Why were they unafraid? They believed no one was ever going to do anything to stop them and they were right,"" the group said.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- An elderly man's brain languishes. His body languishes, too, in prison. No one seems to know he's there. Before a sudden turn of events this month, this was the story of Juan Navarro, who spent nearly 37 years inside the tough San Pedro prison in the Lima neighborhood of San Juan de Lurigancho. To be precise, before being released this week, Navarro spent 36 years and eight months in prison. The exactness of this number is important because it is one of the few facts that he has certainty about. He doesn't know how old he is. He doesn't remember if he ever appeared before a judge. He can't recall if he was convicted. Dementia and suspected schizophrenia have faded his memory. The real shock isn't that Navarro, who has given his age as between 76 and 78, can't remember basic facts about his imprisonment. It's that prison and judicial officials don't know, either. No one in the Peruvian justice system can say whether Navarro was ever convicted. Or sentenced. They know that he entered the prison system in 1976, as a murder suspect in the province of Arequipa. He was accused of killing his mother. At some point he was transferred to the prison in Lima, but his file remained stored in the province where he was arrested. His records were destroyed in a prison riot fire there. Prisons in Peru -- and Latin America, in general -- are known for being overcrowded places where it is not uncommon for inmates to spend weeks, months or even years awaiting a simple hearing. Inmates -- whatever their guilt or innocence -- are at a disadvantage in such an overburdened system. To get a day in court requires an advocate, if you can afford one, or patience and luck. The problem is especially severe at the San Pedro prison. Of the approximately 8,600 inmates, only 1,291 have been sentenced, prison director Col. Tomas Garay said. ""It's a problem that we, with our scarce resources, are learning how to manage,"" he said. Navarro never had anyone who cared enough to visit him in prison, and any luck went up in smoke when his records burned. A couple of points of Peruvian law: If you are imprisoned for 36 months without a sentence, you are to be freed. But it's not automatic; someone has to file the paperwork for you. Second, according to laws at the time of his alleged crime, the maximum sentence a judge could give was 35 years. In other words, even if Navarro had been convicted to the maximum sentence, he should have been released nearly two years ago. It wasn't until a radio station found and aired a story about his situation this month that anyone stepped forward to help. A lawyer, Roberto Miranda, announced on television that he would file a writ of habeas corpus on Navarro's behalf, to be followed by a lawsuit. ""The government should recognize and compensate for this very grave judicial error that forced him to remain unjustly incarcerated for a period longer than he should have served,"" he told RPP Noticias. But the government beat the lawyer to the punch, and the country's minister of women and vulnerable populations personally intervened and secured the aging Navarro's release. It was a simple procedure that anyone could have arranged. ""The thing is that this man doesn't have family who could help with the paperwork, so his case remained up in the air,"" said Cristian Galvan, a psychologist who works at the place where Navarro will live. Navarro's new home is in a residence that provides shelter for the elderly who have been abandoned. He doesn't have good memories from the notorious prison. ""They ruined my teeth from so many hits and they chased me with a knife. ... They wanted to slit my throat,"" he said. The first thing he did upon being released was to ask to see the ocean. ""Progressively we will begin taking him to different places so he can begin to gain a familiarity because, you understand, these have been 37 years that he has been in a prison where he only saw other inmates,"" said Julio Rojas, a medic at the home.

"(CNN) -- For the first time in 14 years, Hugo Chavez isn't running for president in Venezuela. But his legacy has loomed large over weeks of intense campaigning. And his words still echo through the South American country -- literally. At rallies, a recording of Chavez's voice belting out the national anthem booms through loudspeakers. A phrase Chavez used has become a campaign slogan for Nicolas Maduro, the man Chavez tapped to be his successor. Thursday was no exception. State-run VTV aired video of Maduro waving to supporters at a Caracas rally marking the end of his campaign. His official campaign theme song blared in the background. The song -- ""Maduro from my heart"" -- begins with Chavez's voice, endorsing Maduro's candidacy, . The catchy tune includes lyrics like ""with Chavez and Maduro the people are safe,"" ""Chavez forever, Maduro for president"" and ""Chavez, I swear to you, my vote is for Maduro."" Less than six weeks after Chavez's death, Venezuelans head to the polls Sunday to pick a new leader. Maduro, a member of Chavez's inner circle during his 14-year rule, has pledged to continue Chavez's efforts to build ""21st century socialism."" Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski says he is pushing a more moderate approach, promising to continue social programs and improve the country's economy. Both candidates closed their campaigns with massive rallies on Thursday, vowing to win decisive victories in Sunday's election. Before Maduro spoke to supporters, a large screen behind him showed videos of Chavez on the campaign trail last year, dancing alongside supporters and singing the national anthem. Members of Chavez's family surrounded Maduro onstage, hugging him and pumping their fists in support. When he registered to run for the presidency, Maduro told supporters, ""I am not Chavez, but I am his son."" At one rally, he told supporters that Chavez appeared to him in the form of a little bird to give him spiritual support. The frequent references to Chavez have drawn criticism from many in the opposition. One opposition website alleges that Maduro has said Chavez's name more than 7,000 times in public appearances since the president's death on March 5. ""In recent days they were talking about a little bird, and I said, my God, with so many problems that there are in Venezuela, we have someone who believes in little birds,"" Capriles said at a recent rally. Capriles has criticized Maduro for invoking Chavez since the outset of the campaign. ""Make no mistake, Nicolas,"" Capriles said at a rally with supporters last month, ""do not hide behind the image of the president. Let him rest in peace."" While opposition figures have mocked Maduro's recent reference to the bird, Maduro and his supporters have embraced it. VTV showed a bird perched on Maduro's shoulders at the outset of Thursday's rally. Maduro has said he's proud to continue ""Chavismo,"" the political movement Chavez started. Throngs of dedicated followers still call themselves Chavistas in devotion to the former president. Some analysts have questioned whether Maduro will have the charisma to maintain their support. At Capriles' campaign closing rally on Thursday, one supporter waved a large sign above the crowd. ""I was a Chavista,"" it said. ""Now I am a Caprilista."" Maduro told supporters on Thursday that Chavez remains at the helm. ""This is Chavez's post,"" Maduro said, gesturing toward the lectern where he stood. ""Chavez is still leading with his example and his love."" CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: Capriles and Maduro hold massive rallies to close their presidential campaigns .

"(CNN) -- Guantanamo Bay detainees wielding ""improvised weapons"" clashed Saturday with guards, an episode that occurred amid simmering tensions at the U.S. military base. The U.S. guards responded by firing ""four less-than-lethal rounds,"" the military's Joint Task Force Guantanamo said in a statement. No guards or detainees suffered ""serious injuries"" at the facility in Cuba. The incident, which happened in Camp VI at the detention center, comes as some inmates have waged a weeks-long hunger strike in protest of their treatment, guards searching through Qurans and other issues. Since 2002, the Guantanamo detention center -- where people have been held in a range of conditions, from communal living to lone, maximum-security cells -- has held people captured outside the United States in counterterrorism operations. As of November 2012, there were 166 detainees in the facility, according to a government report. Carlos Warner, a U.S. lawyer representing some of those detainees, told CNN late last month detainees have become increasingly frustrated with ""very dire, dire conditions"" and their sense that the current legal process leaves them in limbo indefinitely. ""It leaves them with the prospect of the only way we leave Guantanamo is death,"" Warner said. ""Unfortunately, I think the men are ready to embrace this."" Early Saturday, the commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo ordered all inmates in Camp VI moved into individual cells. The reason, the military explained, was ""to ensure the health and security of those detainees."" The clashes occurred while guards tried to move inmates. Capt. Robert Durand, a Guantanamo spokesman, said the decision was made after detainees starting in February -- about the same time as latest hunger strike -- began obstructing surveillance cameras, windows and glass partitions. These actions, which Durand described as ""non-compliant"" and ""unacceptable,"" made it difficult for guards to do ""round-the-clock monitoring"" throughout the facility. ""Suspending the detainees' communal living privileges was in response to a coordinated effort by detainees to create an unsafe situation and limit the guard force's observation,"" the military spokesman said. ""... The ability to continuously monitor detainees is the only way we can provide for their health and security. We should have gone in earlier."" Warner, the public defender for some Guantanamo detainees, has said frustrations have grown since a change in command last year, which was followed by a number of new policies. The lack of action in closing Guantanamo Bay -- as President Barack Obama signed on to -- is furthering resentment that those held have no recourse or hope, the lawyer said. ""It was designed ... to be exactly what it is, a legal no man's land,"" Warner said. ""Where there's one way in and the only way out is in a box.""","Head of Guantanamo Bay decides to move all Camp VI detainees into single cells .
