Mr Manning has led Denver to an 11-3 record this year, his second with the Broncos after missing the 2011 season with Indianapolis because of neck troubles that affected his right triceps. He has thrown 47 touchdown passes, three shy of Patriots quarterbackTom Brady's NFL season record set in 2007, and he has two games remaining. Man of the hour: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) passes Thursday night in the third quarter against the San Diego Chargers . Mr Manning last year won the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year Award after returning from multiple neck surgeries that many feared would end his career. The Denver Broncos star spent 14 years . with the Indianapolis Colts before being released after sitting out the . 2011 season while rehabbing from the surgeries. Huge honor: Mr Manning is the fourth quarterback in the last nine years to win the honor . 'I have no idea who wants me, what team wants me, how this process works,' he said between tears at the press conference announcing the end of his time with the Colts. The veteran was already a first-ballot hall of famer at the time, but his 2013 season puts him on par with the all-time greats who have ever played the game. 'When great competitors get scorned, they come back with a vengeance,' former Broncos quarterback and current Executive Vice President of Football Operations John Elway told Sports Illustrated. 'We signed a Hall of Famer with a chip on his shoulder' That uncertainty must have motivated him, because he's having the greatest season by a quarterback in the 97 year history of the NFL - he's poised to break both the single-season touchdown and passing yards records. He has also guided his team to the top seed in the AFC playoffs - all at the age of 37. Mr Manning is the fourth NFL quarterback to take the honor in the last nine years, following Brady in 2005, Brett Favre in 2007 and Drew Brees in 2010. LeBron James was the winner last year.","Peyton Manning, 37, is having the best season of his hall of fame career .

Gardening shows on television are to blame for a rise in evictions of allotment holders as they make caring for a plot look 'too easy'. Shows such as Love Your Garden and Gardeners' World has led to many people taking on allotments without realising the hard work needed to grow vegetables, experts say. This has seen waiting time in some councils increase to over a decade, while existing tenants are neglecting their plots. Easy work? Television gardening shows such as Alan Titchmarsh's Love Your . Garden on ITV1 have been blamed for making gardening look too easy . Local councils are now increasingly cracking down on . neglected patches - dubbed 'dirty plots' - by issuing notices warning tenants to clean up their plots or risk losing them. Di . Appleyard from the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners said growing waiting lists are putting further pressure on . local authorities to evict lazy gardeners. She added: 'There . have been more non-cultivation letters issued this year because of the . weather and people taking allotments unaware of the work and skills . involved.' Around 87,000 people were on council allotment waiting lists last year, with an average waiting time of three years, The National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners said. However, the total number could be close to 200,000 as 150,000 plots owned by parish and town councils, public bodies and private allotment associations were excluded from the survey. Long wait: Nearly 200,000 people could be on waiting lists for allotments as 150,000 plots owned by non-council organisations were excluded from the survey . In Brighton, 1,070 such notices have been issued in the past year - covering over a third of the council's plots in a hope that a drastic crackdown will speed up the 13-year waiting list for the council's 2,855 plots. A Brighton council spokesman said: 'We carry out regular and rigorous inspections to ensure allotments are properly maintained and remain viable for future tenants. 'All allotment holders are made aware of the need to cultivate their allotments when they sign their rental agreement.' Similarly, London's Merton Council has issued 378 notices to quit - in respect of almost a third of its 1,364 plots. Growing pains: Allotment tenants face a harsh truth when they discover that growing vegetables is not as easy as Monty Don and the team on Gardeners' World make it look . And allotment holders with untended plots in Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, have also been warned to 'use them or lose them' in a bid to improve an eight-year waiting list. Beverley Town Council has framed its tenancy agreements so that holders can be evicted if they fail to keep their plot 'clean and free from weeds and well manured and otherwise maintain it in a good state of cultivation'. One of the council's allotment reps, Steve Johnson, complained: 'People see these gardening programmes that make it look easy. It's not like that. 'They get very depressed when they see the weeds and they abandon it.' Reg Knowles, chairman of The Allotments & Gardens Council, said the summer's bad weather had seen many amateur gardeners abandoning their plots. 'People think allotments are easy to maintain but it's been a bad year weather-wise and people have got disheartened and not bothered doing their plots.'","Increasing number of allotment tenants evicted over unkempt plots .

Controversial plans have been drawn up to slash up to £5 billion a year from the welfare bill by limiting child benefit to families’ first two children. Under the proposal, revealed today, families would also lose their entitlement to child tax credit for any more than two children. The change would mean parents with three children, who would currently be entitled to child benefit because their annual income is less than £50,000, would lose out on £696 a year. On top of that, those earning less than £30,000 will also be denied child tax credits worth £2,725 a year – making them in total £65 a week worse off. Controversial: Families are set to lose their entitlement to child tax credit for any more than two children under new plans revealed by Downing Street today (library image) The initiative has been put forward by Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, recently appointed by David Cameron to the No 10 policy board to come up with vote-winning policies for the Conservative Election manifesto. Mr Zahawi is a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, who said last week he was determined to find billions of pounds of extra savings in the welfare budget. Opinion polls show strong public support for welfare cuts and the Tories say it is vital  to encourage greater responsibility. But the idea is likely to  be criticised by Labour as an attack on hard-up families. The Tories say it is ‘nonsense’ to call the idea ‘social engineering’ or compare it to China’s ‘one child policy’ to curb population growth. Mr Zahawi wants the two-child cap included in the next Tory manifesto and introduced in 2015 if they win. It would apply to those who had a third child from then onwards, not to families with more than two children now. The move is certain to be fiercely opposed by Mr Cameron’s Coalition partner, Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Benefits reforms are vital  to save taxpayers’ money, says Mr Zahawi in an article in today’s Mail on Sunday. The welfare state was set up in the 1940s as a ‘last resort, not a lifestyle choice’, he writes. Proposals: Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, right, who has recently been appointed by David Cameron to the No. 10 policy board, put forward the plans . But over the years, ‘the safety net became a straitjacket,’ trapping people into a life of dependency on the state – at someone’s else expense. ‘Many couples take the decision to delay having a third or a fourth child until they are sure they can afford it,’ he argues. ‘This should be case for every family, regardless of their income.’ People had to understand  ‘welfare will . always be there to help them take responsible decisions about work and . family. In return, they can no longer assume the taxpayer has a . bottomless purse. 'Capping welfare by family size would save billions . and help the next generation think more carefully about their . relationship with the welfare state. And it would restore the original . bargain made between citizens and state: a safety net in return for . personal responsibility.’ The Tories have already scrapped child benefit for higher rate taxpayers earning more than £50,000 a year. Two years ago, a similar Conservative plan to cap child benefit to families on the dole with two children was vetoed by Mr Clegg. Mr Zahawi’s proposal goes much further, and would end all child benefits and child tax credits after the second child. With certain opposition from Labour and the Lib Dems, it will only have a realistic chance of becoming law if the Conservatives win an outright majority in the Election, due in May 2015. Support for such welfare curbs grew after the scandal of unemployed Derby man Mick Philpott, who was convicted of killing six of his 17 children by five women in a house fire. He was accused of using his children as a ‘cashcow’ to generate £60,000 a year in benefits. Mr Osborne provoked Labour anger by saying the ‘horrendous’ Philpott case justified a nationwide debate ‘about the welfare state and taxpayers who subsidise lifestyles like that.’ The Tories believe voters are on their side, though some Conservative MPs fear that radical welfare cuts run the risk of the party being caricatured as  ‘the Nasty Party’ – an image  Mr Cameron has worked hard to shrug off. Uproar: Mr Zahawi's proposals are bound to be unpopular with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . Labour leader Ed Miliband has attacked Tory welfare cuts such as the ‘bedroom tax’ and is likely to seize on Mr Zahawi’s plan as further evidence that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are out of touch with ordinary people struggling to make  ends meet. But private Labour polls show that Mr Miliband’s own supporters want him to take a tougher stance on welfare abuse. Last night, senior Ministers said Mr Zahawi was speaking in a personal capacity. The trend for big families is already on the wane in Britain. Ten years ago, a third of  all families had three or more children. But now the proportion has slumped to  just one in four. The effect of the proposed benefits cap is most starkly illustrated by the example of a household with three children, in which the parents’ combined income is £30,000 a year. Under the current system, the family are entitled to £2,447 a year in child benefit payments and £2,940 in child tax credits, deducted from the tax bill. But under the proposed plan, their child benefit payments would be slashed by £696 a year to £1,751. And their child tax credits would fall by £2,725  a year to just £220. The total annual loss for the family would be £3,421 – or £65 a week. Currently, about 1.2 million families have more than two children. Of these, about a million qualify for child benefit. In total, more than 150,000 people who have been claiming Income Support for over a year have three or more children: 57,000 have four or more. Almost 200 families reliant on out-of-work benefits have at least ten children.","Parents with three children would lose out on £696 a year in plan .

Nearly two dozen teens have been arrested at high schools in southern California after undercover police officers posed as students for an entire semester to rat out drug-dealing on campus. Serina Ramirez, 18, and Erick De La Cruz, 19, were arrested at Perris High School last Thursday and 20 minors from that school and nearby Paloma High School in Menifee were also booked on drug-related charges. Three additional students weren't in school that day and remain at large. Two deputies, a woman at Perris and a man at Paloma, had been posing as 16 or 17-year-old students since the start of the school year in an operation to find the source of drugs at the two Riverside County high schools. Busted: Serina Ramirez, 18, left, and Erick De La Cruz, 19, right, were arrested after undercover cops conducted a semester-long drug sting at their Riverside County high school in Southern California . Throughout the probe, the deputies, who haven't been named, seized marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, methamphetamine, hashish and various prescription pills. Lt. Paul Bennett said most of the drug buys were for small amounts of marijuana. Officers also served warrants at the homes of two of the students arrested. After the drug bust, rumors were flying around both schools as students tried to pick the moles among them. Some were convinced they knew who it was and others were worried more undercover police officers could be among them, with some even pinpointing a substitute teacher who struck them as suspicious. According to the Riverside Press Enterprise, officers stormed into classrooms with photos of 25 suspects and proceeded to handcuff all but the the absentees in front of everyone. Student Anthony Rodriguez, 16, told the Press Enterprise the whole bust was over within minutes. 'They knew who they were looking for and exactly how to get there,' he said. But Trevor Steinrichter, 16, said it was frightening while it lasted. The officers showed up in his history class, he told the newspaper. High school: The probe took place at two Riverside County high schools including Paloma Valley high school, pictured . 'Scary. I saw my friend get arrested,' he said. Bruce Hollen, 16, said it was disturbing that a deputy was posing as a student. 'You think you can trust people - you just never know,' he said. Bennett said the sheriff's department has used the undercover tactic at schools in the area before, but the deputies selected to go undercover this year received additional training, particularly about special needs students and avoiding entrapment. He explained all students arrested Thursday were in general education classes, not special needs programs. Perris Union High School District superintendent Jonathon Greenberg said the schools were on board with the investigation after the sheriff's office approached them about it earlier this year. 'It was a question of what we could do to assist them,' he told the Press Enterprise. 'This is a very well-researched program. The people in it are all professionals.' He added that only three people within the district knew what was going on, and no one at either school had been told of the undercover deputies. Board members learned of the probe Wednesday night ahead of Thursday's arrests.","Serina Ramirez, 18, and Erick De La Cruz, 19, were arrested at Perris High School in southern California Thursday .

Holly Bobo was last seen April 13, 2011, when her brother said he saw a man leading the then 20-year-old away from the family home outside Parsons, about 125 miles northeast of Memphis.

After the school run and household chores, one suburban mom gets on with her other business of the day - running a revenge porn website. Ariella Alexander, who operates under the fake name from her home in Maryland, has set up a site where wives can post pictures of their husbands' alleged mistresses and stories of the sordid affairs. Alexander, who is acting within the law, posts the often intimate pictures of the alleged 'homewreckers' along with the women's names and where they live. Scroll down for video . A mom, with the alias Ariella Alexander, runs a revenge porn website where she names and shames alleged mistresses from her home in suburban Baltimore . The mother, who also runs a blog where she documents her cheating ex-husband's affairs, said that she believes some of the alleged mistresses enjoy the attention that her site brings. She claims that betrayed married women from across the country have sent her more than 1,000 pictures. It is unclear how much money Alexander makes from her business but the website has a number of ad placements. The sad tales of loyalty betrayed and marriages destroyed fill Alexander's site in an endless scrolling list. One heartbroken wife from Florida writes: 'Thanksgiving day 2013, I discovered... all the filthy deleted texts. The horrible I love you’s the descriptions of having sex in the stockroom at work. The talk of how they had sex, where they had sex and what they did to each other... The affair had been going on so long I felt sick to my stomach.' In another a Texas woman sent topless pictures to the website of her daughter's fourth-grade teacher whom her husband was allegedly having an affair. Alexander's site takes a new spin on revenge porn. Previous cases have seen men post graphic pictures of their former girlfriends and wives in order to humiliate them. The mom runs the revenge porn site from her Maryland home which allows women to name and shame their husband's alleged mistresses - often including graphic pictures . Alexander's site, . shesahomewrecker.com, names and shames the women accused of sleeping . with other women's husbands - with the role of the men in these alleged affairs featuring far . less prominently on the blame scale. The alleged mistresses are tagged with long streams of insults and expletives - 'fat cow', 'b****', d********' and 'pitiful, homewrecking tramp'. Revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them. California and New Jersey passed specific laws criminalizing revenge porn - while others including Maryland, where shesahomewrecker.com operates - are considering a change in legislation. Kevin Bollaert, who ran a California-based revenge porn site, was arrested this week after extorting victims out of thousands of dollars. He was charged with 31 felonies pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in from the subjects' ex-partners. When women contacted Bollaert begging to have their picture and personal details removed, he required that they transfer $350 to an account linked to another one of his sites- changemyreputation.com. Alexander has no remorse for her site and shrugs off responsibility over the fact that she has no proof that these women actually are the cheating mistresses they are made out to be. She told America Tonight: 'I can’t be certain for anything I read . on the Internet if it’s true or not. 'I mean, you can’t be certain. Somebody’s telling a story.' Alexander also edits the photos she receives - often naked selfies of other women that scorned wives have taken off cheating husbands' cell phones. She won't post naked pictures of women in their early twenties but of those in their thirties, forties or fifties? 'You know better at that age' is her response. The suburban mom appears to view her website as a public service for married women. Alexander told GMA: 'I think if one woman says, ''Oh my god, I do not want to end up on this website''...because your life is going to be destroyed.' Under current legislation - the Communications Decency Act of 1996 - Alexander is not doing nothing wrong. Section 230 of the Act says that website operators are not legally liable for the words of third parties. And Alexander's website comes with a very clear disclaimer: 'The content of all posts and comments on Shesahomewrecker.com represent the opinions of the original poster and are not endorsed, approved or representations of the opinions of Shesahomewrecker.com or its owners.' MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Alexander. Alexander also runs her own blog where she documents her ex-husband's cheating ways .","Stay-at-home mom 'Ariella Alexander' runs the site from her suburban Baltimore home .

He has pleaded guilty to running poker games in Manhattan after being one of more than 30 people charged in April over the illegal gambling operation.

A debt collector used two mix martial arts fighters to help him scare losers in an illegal poker racket into paying up, prosecutors have said (file picture of fighters not connected with the case) When he was arrested, he was found with brass knuckles in his chest of drawers and an inoperable gun in his apartment. 'These weapons are the tools of the trade for an ""enforcer"" who threatens the use of force to collect debts,' prosecutors said in the presenting letter for his sentencing on Thursday, according to the New York Daily News. They say Rapoport worked with Arthur Azen, 44, from Staten Island, who admitted money laundering, conspiracy and extortionate credit collection last month. 'He (Rapoport) was not a dealer or a bartender. His job was to make sure that bettors at Azen's illegal poker games and bettors of Azen's sports book paid their debts,' the letter adds.

Concerned they may harm the player, but not wishing to blow their cover, the agents asked the New York City Police Department to intervene on the pretense they had reports of someone smoking marijuana in the area, the letter said. The player later admitted he owed $35,000 to $40,000. Rapoport's lawyer Jay Schwitzman claimed in August that his client had been targeted by the feds because of his Russian background.

Analogue radio has been given a stay of execution after ministers admitted too few listeners were switching to digital. Both FM and AM radio were due to be turned off in 2015, though the Government had already considered a delay as digital uptake was so slow. But now ministers have decided to postpone the plan indefinitely after discovering that barely a third of radio is received from digital stations. Delays: Ministers will not set a date to switch of FM services until more people start using digital radios . Communications minister Ed Vaizey said more needed to be done to persuade listeners to switch. Mr . Vaizey said: ‘I regard my role as a supporter and enabler of digital . radio but . . . I completely respect the people’s passion for radio and . not being made to do something they don’t want to do. ‘I also have a . huge amount of respect for people who run independent commercial . stations. They’re not flying off to the Caribbean for Christmas; these . are tough organisations to run and they don’t make a huge amount of . money.’ Ministers have refused to set a deadline until half of all radio listened to is on digital settings.Mr Vaizey added: ‘We are not there yet. So now is not the time to switch over.’ Mr Vaizey added a new ‘digital . certification mark’ scheme is planned for 2014, which aims to identify . radios that meet the industry's minimum technical and performance . standards. In a written . ministerial statement, he said: ‘In spite of recent progress, the . current rate of digital listening has not yet reached 40 per cent. We . have always been clear that the switch to digital must be consumer-led . rather than Government imposed. ‘Therefore, . we do not believe that now is the time to commit to a switchover. Nonetheless, we want to maintain the positive industry action to promote . digital listening, because we know that consumers like the clearer . sound and ease of tuning, not to mention the wide range of content . offered.’ Communications minister Ed Vaizey said more people had to go digital before he would set a date for switchover . Digital listening includes DAB . radio and the internet and when switchover happens it will see all . existing FM coverage has been replicated on DAB networks. Digital switchover of television completed last year. Just . one in 20 people have a digital radio in their cars and only 40 per . cent of new vehicles come equipped with them. Converting an existing car . radio to a digital one would cost around £100. Less than half of households own digital radios, which start from around £30 but can cost more than £150. There . are more than 100million analogue sets across Britain, which would . become obsolete if the FM and AM frequencies were switched off. Patchy . coverage has also blighted the transmission of digital radio. Labour’s . culture spokesman, Helen Goodman, told the BBC that people did not have . money for the switch, saying: ‘In the middle of a cost-of-living . crisis, this is not what people need.’ She added that digital take up should be closer to 75 per cent before a deadline was set. Digital radio groups are pushing for ministers to agree a date for a switch. Bauer Media and Global Radio have called for non-digital radio to be switched off in 2018, as has industry body the Radio Centre. However small, independent radio stations have warned they do not have the money or staff to make the switch in a hurry. A . coalition of 81 national, regional and local commercial radio stations . was established last month to campaign against an enforced switchover. Paul . Smith CBE, chairman of Celador Entertainment, which is part of the . coalition, said: ‘The Government’s decision not to commit to switch over . is very good news for listeners. ‘We have always felt that . broadcasters are best placed to understand the needs of their audiences . and that platform investment decisions should rest with individual radio . stations.’ To help stations switch, Mr Vaizey said the Government, . the BBC and the commercial sector would pump £21million into upgrading . digital transmitters. This would improve national BBC digital coverage from 94 per cent to 97 per cent. Just one in 20 people have a digital radio in their cars and only 40 per cent of new vehicles come equipped with them . Local transmitters, which cover both BBC and commercial stations, would increase their coverage from 70 per cent to 90 per cent. New national commercial radio stations . could launch as Ofcom seeks interest to build and run a second national . commercial multiplex in the new year, according to Mr Vaizey. Motorists . are also in line to receive better information on how to upgrade their . car radio to digital and details of approved installers. Government . figures show 41.6 per cent of new cars sold in October had DAB radios . fitted as standard, an increase from 4.4% in 2010. Paul . Keenan, chief executive of Bauer, said: ‘The continued growth of DAB . means listeners will benefit from an increased choice of stations, a . better radio listening experience and a certainty that they can tune in . 24/7 to the best radio content on offer worldwide.’ Although Britain is a leading manufacturer of digital radio sets, it lags behind Europe in switching over. Norway and Denmark have already made pledges to switch off their analogue signal. Germany and France are also making moves to set deadlines.Radio . listeners will not be forced to go digital for several years after . ministers warned too many people are still using analogue devices.","Ed Vaizey says more must be done to persuade listeners to switch to digital .

A device created by a New Jersey dental hygienist is receiving high marks from an NFL coach after it has helped him call plays on the field during even the most inclement, vision impairing snow storms. Six years ago, 56-year-old Jill Cakert developed - and patented - a color-coded contraption that essentially looks like a collection of different colored paint swatches attached by a key ring. Cakert, who in addition to being a dental hygienist also is a volunteer softball coach, created the device to help and other coaches relay signs to players on the field. She called it the Signalfan. Signalfan: The Philadelphia Eagles have started using the Signalfan, a device invented by a New Jersey woman who sent it to coach Chip Kelly . Now, at least one NFL coach has taken notice, and is using the device himself. 'All I did, I sent [Philadelphia Eagles coach] Chip Kelly a note and said, I know you use color . squares and pictures for signs, I thought maybe you might like this,' Cakert tells the Philadelphia Inquirer of her new connection with the NFC East-leading Eagles. 'If nothing else happens . in my life with the Signalfan, at least I made it to the Eagles.' Shortly after sending Kelly a Signalfan, she got a letter - as well as a check for $25 (the Signalfan costs $24.99) - from Kelly. On a note accompanying the check, Kelly wrote, 'it's been a big help!! Great Idea!!' Clever: Jill Cakert (left) invented the Signalfan while coaching softball in her native New Jersey . 'I have no clue what they're using it for,' Cakert told The Inquirer. 'They have so much going on on the sidelines, you see Chip Kelly with his tongue out talking, somebody doing hand signals. They could be using it as a decoy for all I know.' Whatever the team is using it for, it's definitely using it - as the Inquirer reports, Eagles intern R.J. Harvey can often be seen maneuvering the Signalfan’s . “six baseball-bat-shaped, 9-inch blades (fanning) out in all . directions,” as if to relay . varied signals from sideline coaches to personnel on the field. Kelly, however, won't tip his hand as to how he is using the Signalfan during games. 'It's just another way to communicate what we're doing on game days,' he said of the Signalfan at a press conference. Cakert, however, is ecstatic to see her invention used on the field. Multi-use: The Signalfan isn't just for football - it can be used in any sport that requires coaches communicating with players on the field . 'Oh, my God, I just saw it,' the mother of three and grandmother of two told The Inquirer last week while watching a video of an Eagles game at her home. 'This is so exciting. We are so psyched that they would keep winning.' Cakert has setup a website for her invention, on which she describes the product as 'an innovative way to communicate with athletes. The clearly visible . color blades make it easy for your players to read signs while keeping . your opponents guessing as they sort through thousands of possible . combinations! Use the same signals all season by disguising them with . the use of indicator blade(s), or changing the number, position, or . direction of the blades. Now being used in the US, Canada, and Japan.'","New Jersey dental hygienist Jill Cakert invented the 'Signalfan' six years ago when she was a volunteer softball coach .

A United Methodist minister in Pennsylvania plans to defy a church order to surrender his credentials for performing a same-sex wedding. The Rev. Frank Schaefer said today that he cannot uphold the church's Book of Discipline because he finds it discriminatory. The Methodist church accepts gay and lesbian members but rejects the practice of homosexuality as 'incompatible with Christian teaching'. Rev. Frank Schaefer, a United Methodist clergyman convicted of breaking church law for officiating at his son's same-sex wedding, spoke during a news conference today (pictured) The Rev. Frank Schaefer seen speaking at the news conference today at the Arch Street United Methodist Church in Philadelphia . Schaefer says he doesn't know what will happen next. He's scheduled to meet with church officials Thursday about his future, following his conviction in a church trial last month. Methodist Bishop Peggy Johnson acknowledges the denomination is in turmoil over the issue. She says the church uses contradictory language about sexual orientation. Schaefer is serving a 30-day suspension from his church for leading his son's same-sex wedding in Massachusetts in 2007. Before the punishment was announced in . November, Shaefer told the jury that he is unrepentant and refused to . promise he wouldn't perform more gay unions. Rather than beg for mercy, the pastor upped the stakes. The church 'needs to stop judging people based on their sexual orientation,' he told jurors. 'We have to stop the hate speech. We have to stop treating them as second-class Christians.' The Rev. Robin Hynicka, right, embraces the Rev. Frank Schaefer, left, at the press conference today in Philadelphia . The Rev. Herb Snyder, at podium, holds up a letter of support for the Rev. Frank Schaefer, center right, during the press conference today . After the jury pronounced its sentence, Schaefer's supporters began overturning chairs in the courtroom - symbolizing the biblical story of Jesus overturning the tables of the money changers - and held an impromptu communion service. Schaefer's trial rekindled debate within the nation's largest mainline Protestant denomination over church policies on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. Schaefer donned a rainbow-colored stole on the witness stand and told jurors it symbolized his commitment to the cause. 'I will never be silent again,' he said, as some of his supporters wept in the gallery. 'This is what I have to do.' Jon Boger, who filed the initial . complaint against Schaefer, was outraged by the pastor's recalcitrance. The career Naval officer grew up in Zion United Methodist Church of . Iona, the church that Schaefer has led for 11 years. 'Frank . Schaefer sat here and openly rebuked the United Methodist Church, its . policies, standards and doctrines,' Bolger said when called as a . rebuttal witness. 'He should no longer be in service as a minister of the United Methodist Church, not at Iona, not anywhere else.' The . Methodists' prosecutor also called former members of Schaefer's church . who said his conduct split the congregation, and experts who said the . punishment should serve as a deterrent to other like-minded clergy. A man places a hand on the shoulder of The Rev. Frank Schaefer as he walks up to the stage to speak at the press conference today . The Rev. Frank Schaefer and his son Tim whose same-sex marriage he officiated in Massachusetts in 2007 . Christina Watson said her family left Schaefer's church because they no longer wanted to be 'subjected to the preaching and teaching' of Schaefer. 'To me, it wasn't a good Christian example for ministers to say it's OK to break the rules of your church,' she testified. The Rev. Paul Stallworth, who leads a United Methodist task force on sexuality and abortion, testified that church law requires jurors to 'openly rebuke' Schaefer so that fellow clergy will think twice before breaking it. Schaefer had previously testified that he performed his son's 2007 wedding in Massachusetts out of love, not a desire to flout church teaching on homosexuality. But his November testimony made clear he has had a change of heart. 'I have to minister to those who hurt and that's what I'm doing,' said Schaefer. The prosecutor, the Rev. Christopher Fisher, invited Schaefer to 'repent of your actions' and pledge never again to perform a homosexual union. 'I cannot,' Schaefer replied. His son, Tim Schaefer, told jurors he knew he was putting his father in a difficult position by asking him to officiate his wedding. But he concluded he would hurt his father's feelings if he didn't ask. Schaefer said he hoped his father's trial would start a larger conversation in the denomination.

A man accused of killing a nine-year-old neighbor and hiding her body in a trash bin had been building a snowman with her just hours before she was reported missing, investigators said Monday. Jerrod Metsker, 24, was the last person seen with Reann Murphy at the trailer park where they lived, a sheriff's investigator said. He later joined neighbors and relatives in a search for her, a neighbor said. Metsker was arrested Sunday, about 12 hours after deputies found the second-grader's body. A judge ordered him held in jail on a $1 million bond after his appearance in court on an aggravated-murder charge. Horrible: Jerrod Metsker, 24, was the last person seen with Reann Murphy, nine, when they were making snowmen outside of the trailer park where he works . Investigators with the Wayne County Sheriff's Office described Metsker as a family friend and neighbor. Capt. Douglas Hunter said Metsker has a ""diminished mental capacity,"" but he wouldn't release information about a specific diagnosis. People who live in the trailer park said Metsker would play outside with the neighborhood children and built a playhouse out of blankets alongside his home, where he'd spend time with youngsters less than half his age. Reann and her mother had just moved into the trailer park a few months ago around the beginning of the school year, relatives said. They lived in an apartment above a maintenance garage at the park outside Smithville, 30 miles southwest of Akron. Heartbroken: Reann's father Richard said that he wants the killer to get the worst punishment but it still won't bring her daughter back . The girl's mother was at work Saturday afternoon while she was at home with her mother's live-in boyfriend, Hunter said. She went outside to play in the snow and was with several other children in the trailer park's courtyard, but the others went home, leaving Metsker alone with her, he said. Reann was reported missing Saturday evening, about two hours after she was last seen with Metsker, Hunter said. Police officers, firefighters and neighbors went door to door looking for her. Her body was found buried under trash five hours after she was reported missing. Metsker took part in the search, neighbor Judy Jarvis said. Authorities spoke with Metsker soon after at the trailer home he shared with his mother, but he wasn't arrested until Sunday afternoon, Hunter said. Scene: Metsker and the girl were making snowmen outside of the trailer park where he lived with his mother . Preliminary autopsy results showed the girl likely had been strangled with an unknown object, county coroner Dr. Amy Jolliff said. Metsker's mother and sister refused to comment publicly on Monday and referred questions to a county public defender appointed to represent Metsker, who's unemployed. Attorney John Johnson Jr. said he couldn't discuss the case. Metsker appeared for his arraignment Monday before a Wayne County municipal court judge via video from jail. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 23. County prosecutor Daniel Lutz said the case could go to a grand jury on Friday if the evidence is processed in time. Authorities haven't offered a possible motive for the girl's killing. Lutz said a coroner will determine the cause of her death but she wasn't shot or stabbed. Victim: It is unclear how Reann died but police have confirmed that she was not shot or stabbed . 'The charges that we ultimately bring will clarify what we think the motive was,' Lutz said. Relatives . said Reann lived with her mother but also spent time with her father . and his family. They said she loved to play outside and described her as . a tomboy. 'She was a little firecracker, always ready to wrestle . and play,' her cousin Paula Watts said. 'She wasn't into girlie stuff. Last Christmas, she said she wanted some girlie stuff. I don't know if . she ever wore the makeup we got her.' Reann's father, Richard Murphy, broke down crying at a vigil Sunday night, WEWS-TV said.'She's . the best thing that ever happened to me ... this is the hardest thing . I've ever been through in my life,' Murphy said. 'She saved my life. I . wish I could trade her places.' He grappled with the appropriate outcome for her killer, saying that while he wanted to see justice it still would not bring the relief he needed. ‘I want the worst for the guy, but it’s still not going to bring back my daughter,’ he told Fox8. ‘She was a wonderful kid.  I mean she was playful.  She’d never - all she did was love people.’","Jerrod Metsker, 24, was arrested the day after being questioned by police .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:11 EST, 16 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:19 EST, 16 December 2013 . A federal judge sentenced a Rhode Island lawyer to six years in prison Monday for his role in a $46 million investment fraud that preyed on terminally ill people, calling him the architect of the scheme and saying he didn't seem to recognize the harm he had caused. Joseph Caramadre was sentenced in Providence after pleading guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy. His lawyers wanted two years in prison and two in home confinement. Prosecutors sought 10 years. Judge William E. Smith also ordered Caramadre to perform 3,000 hours of community service to help the elderly and terminally ill. Joseph Caramadre: A well-known Rhode Island estate planner behind an investment fraud scam that preyed on the terminally ill was sentenced to six years behind bars on Monday morning . Caramadre was a prominent lawyer and philanthropist. Prosecutors say he and former employee Raymour Radhakrishnan illegally got personal information from terminally ill people and used it to purchase bonds and annuities that would pay out when a person died. 'You seemed to apologize that they were hurt. You don't seem to recognize that you were the one that hurt them,' Smith said at the sentencing, after Caramadre addressed the court. The judge told Caramadre that he . doesn't seem to realize he is responsible for 'very real emotional, . psychological victimization' of dying people. Behind bars: Joseph Caramadre pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining $46 million from insurance companies and bond issuers by stealing the identities of terminally ill individuals for a period of over 15-years . Before their guilty pleas, prosecutors told the jury that Caramadre had cooked up the idea in the mid-1990s. He would buy variable annuities and, later, death-put bonds, both of which will pay out money, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, if the owner passed away. The companies that offered the services never asked if the account owners were ill, so Caramadre would take out accounts in the names of people he knew were dying. Then he or one of the dozens of people who invested with him would collect when they died. To find people, they placed ads in the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence in which they offered $2,000, with no strings attached, to those who were terminally ill. It was Radhakrishnan’s job to meet with the dying and their families to find what they called 'measuring lives' — people whose names would be attached to each account. When the person died, they would say the 'measuring life' had 'matured.'Before . the sentence was announced, Caramadre addressed the court, saying he . 'lost everything at the hands of the government and their . investigation.' Deceiver: Caramadre took out bonds for the terminally ill. However, the companies that offered the services never asked if the account owners were ill, so Caramadre would take out accounts in the names of people he knew were dying and collect the cash . Caramadre apologized to Judge Smith and to the families of the terminally ill. He said he designed the program as a 'win-win.' He asked for two years in jail plus two years of home confinement. 'You were the one who was the architect of the scheme and ultimately you are the one who's responsible for the hurt and distress that's been imposed upon those individuals.' His accomplice, Radhakrishnan was also sentenced Monday to a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to the same charges. Prosecutors had revised their sentencing recommendation to five years. Radhakrishnan's lawyer, Olin Thompson, asked for just one day. Radhakrishnan apologized to everyone he had wronged, including the families and companies. He said it was satisfying to give money to people - the way people got roped into the scheme - and acknowledged he made misrepresentations to people. 'My compassion led me to my shortfall,' Radhakrishnan told the judge. 'I did cut corners.' Smith repeatedly asked him what he was thinking and why he hadn't asked someone outside the firm whether what he was doing was legal. 'You're smart. You're naive in a lot of ways, but you're smart. I'm trying to figure out why that bell didn't go off for you,' the judge said. Radhakrishnan also was sentenced to six months of home confinement following his prison term.","Joseph Caramadre was a Rhode Island philanthropist, estate planner and lawyer who counted governors and high-ranking judges among his friends .

Outstanding student: George Huynh seen here in a recent picture has gained admission to Yale next year and his success was announced today by the reporter who first told his and his brother's story in Boston two years ago . On Monday Twitter began to buzz with the story of two young Vietnamese Americans who have defied their poverty stricken upbringing to win admission to two of the nation's top colleges and define the American Dream. Despite their abusive father's suicide, their mother's mental illness and a life of near-destitution in one of Boston's toughest neighborhoods, Boston teenagers Johnny and George Huynh have become straight A students . Their tale of how they used their god-given talent to better themselves first came to light in a 2011 report by Boston Globe journalist Billy Baker. And now, almost two years to the day since it was published, he live-tweeted the satisfying news that George, 17, had gained admission to Ivy League college, Yale. Recounting the boys story through Twitter, Baker revealed to those unfamiliar with the Huynh's struggles how difficult it was for them to rise from one of Boston's most impoverished neighborhoods to find themselves at Yale and UMass Amherst - where Johnny, 19, is now studying. Their father, David Huynh, had fought with the United States during the Vietnam War, but was put through traumatic 're-education' by the communist victors - a chilling synonym no doubt for brutal torture. Their mother, Nhung Bui, four years younger than David, had not wanted to marry him, finding him slightly unhinged. Two years ago: Johnny, front, and George Huynh ride a bus that is used to transport Boston students to Boston Latin School from their home in Dorchester - one of the city's toughest neighborhoods . However, her parents pressured her to - reminding her that for his service with the Americans they would find immigration to the United States easier. But, despite promises of 'money falling from the sky', Nhung Bui and David struggled after arriving in Boston in 1992. Their two sons and one daughter were born in the States, but they had precious little money and Nhung Bui endured 'private horrors' from her husband in addition to battling her own mental problems. Their father left their home in the rough neighborhood of Dorchester and when he died he left a wife who could not speak English and children who could barely speak Vietnamese. However, the sliver of hope for Johnny and George was that they found themselves attending the famous Boston Latin School - the first public school and oldest existing school in the United States, where Founding Fathers, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin studied. Successful studies: George Huynh, (left), sits in a Latin Prose class at Boston Latin School in Boston, in Boston, Massachusetts two years ago almost to this day . Prestige for the hardworking: Boston Latin School has seen students such as JFK's father Joe Kennedy and five of the 65 Founding Father's walk its halls . Their academic excellence carried them to the notice of Baker, who became intrigued by the daily dedication of Johnny, then 17 and George, then 15, to making the most of the slim opportunities afforded them. In addition to their brilliance at school, Baker painted a portrait of normal teenagers, struggling with adolescent problems. 'I’m jealous,’ Johnny told Baker in his Boston Globe piece, describing a North Face jacket that many of his schoolmates owned. 'But I’m only jealous because I have to work to get the bare necessities. That’s my only option.’ So poor were the boys when the article about them was published that they worried they would not be afford to buy that days paper. Setting the Twittersphere alight: Billy Baker live tweeted the admission of his protegé into Yale University today and couldn't have been prouder . Admitted: George Huynh took to Twitter to announce that he had indeed made it to Yale - after years of hard work with encouragement only from one or two others - including his brother and reporter Billy Baker . Baker took them to the presses to be handed the first edition and realized after the piece that he could not now leave them to their lives. 'I stayed close to the boys, party out of an obligation, but mostly because I cared about them. They inspired me. And they were fun,' said the father-of-two. Becoming something of a mentor to the boys, Baker paid for dinners where he caught up with their lives and even helped bring a fridge to the dorm of Johnny when he became a freshman at UMass Amherst. Next step: While his brother is currently studying at the no-less prestigious UMass Amherst - George is to start courses next year at Ivy League school Yale . The story did not stop there. Baker assisted George with his school work and encouraged him to aim as high as his grades and ability suggested he could go. And then today, in an emotional volley of tweets, Baker revealed that the youngest Huynh had gained admission to Yale and as icing on the cake - had his braces removed. Admitting to crying on Twitter, Baker then revealed he was to take out George for a slap-up meal to celebrate. 'And we've ended up at Wahlburgers! Seems fitting for a Dorchester kid made good to celebrate with a burger cooked by a Wahlberg.'","Johnny and George Huynh were the subject of an in-depth report by the Boston Globe two years ago that chronicled their battle to escape their poor upbringing .

A Saudi judge has sentenced a political activist to 300 lashes and four years in prison for calling for a constitutional monarchy in Saudi Arabia, his rights group said on Sunday. Omar al-Saeed is the fourth member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) to be jailed this year after the group issued statements attacking the ruling family over its human rights record and calling for democracy. Saeed, who has also been issued with a worldwide travel ban for his so-called transgressions, did not have legal representation at the secret hearing when he was sentenced, ACPRA said in a statement on its website. Harsh penalty: Under Saudi's Sharia or Islamic law, flogging is mandatory for a number of moral offences such as adultery. But it can also be used at the discretion of judges as an alternative or in addition to other punishments . All powerful: King Abdullah is the prime minister and he appoints the government, which includes top princes in the roles of foreign, interior, defence and intelligence ministers . And today he issued a scathing attack on the ruling elite who exacted the medieval punishment. 'I am the proud prisoner Omar Mohammed al-Saed,' he said in a statement. 'I read out to you the motives and causes of my imprisonment: my hatred of injustice, the fabrication of pain and misery, taking advantage of passive attitudes, treating them as if they were fools, and denying them their livelihoods for brutal personal ambition.' 'This unjust sentence is an honour and . pride to Omar al-Saed and a disgrace and shame to Judge Issa . al-Matrudi,' the activist’s brother, Abdullah al-Saed, tweeted after . learning of the sentence late on Thursday. Under Saudi's Sharia or Islamic law, flogging is mandatory for a number of moral offences such as adultery or being alone in the company of an unrelated person of the opposite sex. But it can also be used at the discretion of judges as an alternative or in addition to other punishments. King Abdullah (pictured) has promoted some social reforms since taking the throne in 2005 but diplomats say he is held back by religious clerics and princes. Cinemas and music concerts are banned, while many restaurants and even some shopping centres cater to families only, especially on holidays. Religious police roam streets to make sure no unrelated men and women mix. The Saudi court system is exclusively controlled Wahahbi/Salafi clerics, and bans the employment of non-Salafi citizens, especially as judges. Saudi Arabia is the world's leading country in the use of  torture-by-flogging, public beheadings and publically crucifying condemned  prisoners. Adam . Coogle, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, added: 'It's just . another troubling instance of Saudi authorities' absolute refusal to . countenance any activism or criticism of Saudi policies or human rights . abuses.' A spokesman for the Justice Ministry said he could not comment on the report or confirm its accuracy. U.S.-allied . Saudi Arabia is ruled by the al-Saud family together with powerful . clerics from the country's ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Sunni . Islam. King Abdullah is the . prime minister and he appoints the government, which includes top . princes in the roles of foreign, interior, defence and intelligence . ministers. Most senior princes also have extensive business interests. Saudi . Arabia's only elections are for half the seats on relatively powerless . town councils. Licensed media exercises stringent self censorship, . public expressions of dissent are often not tolerated and demonstrations . are banned. During the Arab . Spring in early 2011, protests were restricted to the Shi'ite minority . in the Qatif district of Eastern Province. Unrest . among the Sunni majority was avoided after King Abdullah pledged $110 . billion in spending on social benefits and top clerics and tribal . leaders said people should back the ruling family. Foreign . analysts say there appears to be little public demand for big political . changes in Saudi Arabia now, although they point to evidence on social . media of growing frustration at corruption, poverty and poor state . services.

From his exclusive Mediterranean enclave, Christian Candy has made a fortune developing luxury apartments for the ultra-wealthy elite. Now the British property tycoon has become the proud father of twins – whom he has apparently named after two of the world’s most well-known tax havens. Isabella Monaco Evanthia and Cayman Charles Wolf were born two weeks ago, and a source close to the family told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The names seem to be entirely deliberate, sticking two fingers up at the taxman.’ Mr Candy has business dealings with the Cayman Islands as well as owning a house in Monaco with his socialite wife Emily. Yet his spokeswoman has strongly denied the suggestion their twins were named after those locations. She insisted: ‘There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in the comments from your source regarding the names Cayman and Monaco being chosen in relation to British tax or tax havens. This is factually incorrect.’ She said little Cayman’s name was actually in tribute to Mr Candy’s favourite car, the Porsche Cayman. The £40,000 sports car might be considered a surprise choice for the multi-millionaire, as it is widely considered to be the budget version of the more refined classic 911 model, which costs up to £120,000. Nonetheless, the spokeswoman added: ‘Christian and Emily liked the name Cayman in relation to the Porsche.’ The non-identical twins, who stand to inherit a share of their father’s estimated £150 million fortune and vast property portfolio, were delivered on February 13 at a hospital in Manhattan, where the couple also own a home. They have property in London, too. Fond of the area: The Candys own a home in Monaco, which is the middle name of their new daughter Isabella . Emily revealed that she was expecting the twins on her 31st birthday in November. Posting her ultrasound scans on a social networking site, she announced: ‘I’m having the best birthday ever. I am five-and-a-half months pregnant with twins! A mini Christian and a mini me...world get ready. I feel utterly blessed and a little nervous.’ A friend of the couple, who reportedly met on a blind date five years ago, said: ‘Some people might be a little reticent about putting up intimate photographs online, but Emily is so thrilled she wants to share her news with everybody.’ Mr Candy, 39, and his 40-year-old brother Nick – who is married to singer and actress Holly Valance –  are self-made millionaires, amassing their vast fortune in less than 15 years. Caribbean tax haven: Grand Cayman Island, where Christian Candy has had business dealings . Their most famous development is London’s One Hyde Park, an exclusive residential glass tower in Knightsbridge, reputedly the most expensive apartment block in the world. It is owned by Project Grande (Guernsey) Ltd, a joint venture between Candy & Candy and Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, who is the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar. Superstar property developers: Brothers Nick Candy and Christian Candy at a reception for Knightsbridge's One Hyde Park . The sheik’s firm, Park One, is registered in the British overseas territory of the Cayman Islands, a chain of Caribbean atolls known for its generous tax regime. The Candys made their fortune from a modest start, turning in a £50,000 profit on a flat they bought for £122,000 in Earls Court, London, with the help of a £6,000 loan from their grandmother. In 2011, the Candys’ combined wealth, earned through their companies Candy & Candy and CPC Group, was estimated at £300 million, but some experts now say it could be closer to £1 billion, if reported recent sales are taken into account. In 2010, they sold the most expensive three-bedroom flat in history – which also happens to be in Monaco – for an eye-watering £200 million. They bought the Belle Epoque penthouse for about £10 million, then spent around £26 million renovating it before selling it to an anonymous investor, believed to be an Arab sheik. The brothers went on to develop One Hyde Park, which was unveiled in 2011 at a lavish party with a guest list that included Bernie Ecclestone, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Gary Lineker. There were complaints from local councillors that the flats, which were marketed at prices from £3.6 million for a one-bedroom home to £136 million for a penthouse, were a haven for tax-dodgers. According to one analysis of public records, 25 of the registered owners were companies in the British Virgin Islands. Glamorous double date: Developers Nick and Christian Candy with their wives Holly Valance, left, and Emily Candy, right, in Knightsbridge . Other offshore tax paradises used to purchase the properties reportedly included Guernsey, the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein and Liberia. Buyers were also accused of dodging council tax. Labour MP Karen Buck said: ‘It is scandalous that residents in luxury apartments can avoid their share of council tax  liability. It sometimes seems as if the more money you have, the less you are required to pay.’ However, the Candy brothers’ spokeswoman said they were not responsible for registering properties for council tax, but added that all the buyers paid the relevant stamp duty. She added: ‘Once the apartment is sold, it is not the developer’s responsibility to register the new owner with the council. This is the responsibility of the owner.’","Twins are called Cayman Charles Wolf and Isabella Monaco Evanthia .

A jailed sex offender says he's tired of being linked to the 1979 disappearance of a New York City boy whose case helped mobilize a nationwide missing-children movement. Jose Ramos was for years the prime suspect in the disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz. Authorities believe the boy was abducted off the street in SoHo and later murdered. Another man, Pedro Hernandez, has since been charged in Patz's death and faces trial, but a civil court once held Ramos responsible. He denies involvement. Scroll down for video . Jose Ramos (pictured left) has complained in a letter that people still consider him a suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz - despite Pedro Hernandez (right) being charged . Etan Patz disappeared when he was six years old from a street in Soho, New York City in 1979 . Ramos sent a letter this week to The Citizens' Voice newspaper in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to complain about media coverage linking him to Patz, his attorneys and the Luzerne County court system. He calls himself an 'ex-sex offender and not a sex offender'. Ramos completed a 27-year sentence last year on molestation charges. He's jailed on Megan's Law charges. Pedro Hernandez, confessed last year to strangling Patz in the basement of a SoHo bodega in 1979. Ramos' connection to Patz is through one of the boy's babysitters, who was friends with Ramos. Shortly after Patz's disappearance, Ramos was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation and served a 27-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania. Ramos, pictured on his way to a court appearance on Friday, complained to a Pennsylvania newspaper that he is an 'ex-sex offender not a sex offender' At the time of his arrest, authorities found dozens of photos in the drainpipe where Ramos had been living of young boys who all had a strong resemblance to Patz. While incarcerated, a jailhouse . snitch told authorities that Ramos had confessed to him that he knew . what happened to Patz. However, it wasn't enough evidence for . prosecutors to pursue charges. Despite . no criminal charges, the Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where . he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death. The Patz family was awarded a ceremonial $2million, which they never attempted to collect. The Etan Patz case was reopened last year with the FBI investigating a Soho basement . Ramos, 70, is currently in a Pennsylvania prison for failing to register as a sex offender after serving a 27-year prison sentence. He in the Luzerne County Correctional Facility being held on $75,000  bail. The child molester has repeatedly denied involvement in Patz's disappearance. Hernandez, who was arrested in May, 2012 - after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance re-opened the Patz case - when family members told authorities that he admitted to killing Patz. At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez worked in a bodega just blocks from the boy's home. Prosecutors may be forced to throw out the case against Hernandez - who is both schizophrenic and suffering from bipolar disorder - due to a lack of evidence.","Jose Ramos was for years the prime suspect in the disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz in New York City .

It is five-star living with vast spiral staircases, bridges and stunning sloping roofs. But this village of 18 homes provides luxury without the guilt, as the properties are all crafted from sustainably-sourced bamboo. Set alongside the rushing Ayung River, the Green Village rises out of the lush jungle in Sibang, Bali. Scroll down for video . The 18 luxury homes in the Green Village in Bali are made almost entirely from bamboo . Specially designed roofs and roll down bamboo blinds shield the inside from the rainstorms in the jungle . The beautifully designed village features sweeping staircases all made from locally sourced bamboo . It is the brainchild of designer Elora Hardy, who wanted to prove that sustainable materials can be used to create architecturally stunning buildings that do not need to compromise on modern conveniences. The unique village is built using locally sourced bamboo that is then treated to make it last longer. Banana paper - used to line the inside of the walls - and sheets of aluminium are the only other materials used. The village has attracted buyers and investors from across the world who have forked out between £300,000 and £1.2million for a home. It is centred around a stunning communal centre with wooden floors, bar and stools made from bamboo. Tropical rainstorms are kept at bay by roll-down bamboo shutters. The properties cost between £300,000 and £1.2million and have been snapped up by buyers across the world . The village is part of designer Elora Hardy's vision to prove that sustainable materials can be used to create architecturally stunning buildings . The bamboo is treated so it lasts longer and Hardy said the homes could last a lifetime . There is also electricity inside the village so owners can still enjoy home comforts. It is the sister site to the Green School campus, which was founded by Ms Hardy's father, John, in 2006. The Canadian former jewellery maker arrived on the paradise island in 1975. Like the village, the school is built using sustainable natural material and is powered by more than 100 solar panels. Ms Hardy, the creative director of the Ibuku team, said on the village's website: 'Green Village has redefined the potential of sustainable materials. 'It is a place where people connect with nature. We build light on the land. Ms Hardy said the villas - which feature open walls - allow people to reconnect with nature . Electricity and modern kitchen and bathroom fittings are standard, allowing people to enjoy home comforts . Bamboo has also been used to create study bridges connecting the village and crossing the Ayung River . 'With very few resources or attention, a bamboo shoot can become a structural column within three years and that house can stand strong for a lifetime. 'The care we put into designing the homes and the skill of the local craftsmen is a statement about the potential for human innovation and ingenuity for the future.' Operational Director Patrick How told CNN he hopes the project has changed the way people see bamboo as a building material. He said: 'Many people still think bamboo is cheap and only for small buildings, but we're showing it can be used to make high houses and really redefine how the material is used.'","The Green Village in Sibang consists of 18 homes priced up to £1.2m .

These pictures show an enchanting 'hobbit house', complete with stained glass windows, dovecotes and turrets, built in the middle of the Wiltshire countryside. The imaginative property was built entirely by hand by artist and farmer Colin Stokes, 68, who today said he originally planned to build a rectangular hay store barn - but 'got a bit carried away'. Mr Stokes first bought the land in the 1980s with compensation money he received following an accident. Magical: Colin Stokes, 68, spent 11 years building this magical two-storey Hobbit House in Chedglow, Wiltshire . Hand-built: The farmer and artist said he started constructing the building - which features several turrets and dovecotes - from stones he found on his land . Tranquil: Mr Stokes made his barn - initially made for storing hay and grain - using dry stone walling techniques and then secured the walls with concrete on the interior . He lived in a cottage 400 yards away and farmed sheep on the land in Chedglow, Wiltshire and decided he needed a place to store hay and other supplies. Mr Stokes began building a rectangular barn by using traditional dry-stone walling techniques before securing the walls with concrete. But rather than stopping at four walls, the building - which took him 11 years to complete - began to grow until it eventually became the unusual build it is today. Mr Stokes, who now farms sheep, poultry and angora rabbits near to Moffat, Scotland, said: 'I bought some land, around 10 acres, in the 1980s when I got some money following an accident. 'There was a lot of stone lying around in the fields. I collected it up and used it to build the barn. 'I just did it bit by bit. I started small - laying all the stones up and pouring concrete down the back to secure it and it just continued to grow. 'I think I just got a bit carried away really. 'Rather than a modest barn, I started building turrets and dovecots - which were inhabited by lots of birds, including one owl that lived there the whole time I owned the land. Architecture: The build features several arches, left, plus tens of hand made windows and turrets, right, all constructed by the artist - who farmed sheep on the land . 'Organic': Mr Stokes said he did not draw any plans for the sprawling barn, which he based on a selection of buildings he had liked throughout his life . Enchanting: Through one of the entrances to the barn, left, is a spiral staircase which leads to the top of one of the dovecotes. There is also some detailed stained glass, right, that depicts two autumnal scenes including a badger on the left and a bird flying above the building on the right . 'I also had a room up the top where I would sleep during lambing season. 'I . didn't draw any plans before hand - it just grew organically. I took . inspiration from buildings that I had seen during my life that . looked like they were part of their surroundings. I like buildings to . look like they belong.' The . barn is split into several different rooms with varying levels. One . section - called 'The Hermitage' by Mr Stokes - has several stained . glass windows, all hand-made by Mr Stokes. 'The windows represent spring, summer, autumn and winter as well as earth, air, fire and water, and are just another nod to the natural world,' Mr Stokes said. However, having spent over a decade on his magical building, Mr Stokes - who said he doesn't know how the build first became known as the Hobbit House - sold up when a quarry opened nearby. Mr Stokes said: 'I don't like it when people call it the Hobbit House. I never made it to look like that. I just call it my barn. There are also apparently rumours that I had a dispute with the planning office - which is utter nonsense. I moved on because of a quarry. 'They found Forest Marble - which is in high demand - near to my land. I knew there would be lots of lorries trundling in and out constantly so I decided to give it all up. 'When I first sold up, I had dreams about it every night. A woman spends nine months carrying a child, but I spent 11 years on the barn. I felt lost without it. 'Although it was a really difficult decision, know I made the right choice. I've moved on and have done other things. Mr Stokes added that he had only been back to the building once since he left in 2000. Interior: The barn includes a place for Mr Stokes to sleep during lambing season, pictured left, and several examples of the artist's stained glass windows, right . Artistic: This picture shows another window made by Mr Stokes. With its flowers and muted tones, it is suppose to represent the spring months of the year . Unique: Mr Stokes, who calls this yellow-walled section of the build 'The Hermitage', also made several art pieces for the barn, pictured . The 'Hobbit House' has now become a frequent stop for photographers and explorers looking to capture some of the building's magic.Manchester photographer Dan Circa, 28, took this set of images after he decided to track down the quirky construction.He said: 'Normally buildings like this are built for novelty, but once upon a time this was actually someone’s home.''It felt like I was in a movie like Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, and I half expected a tiny person to ask me what I was doing in there. It has such a magical feel about it.” 'This little hobbit house was amazingly hand built by Colin many years ago his treasured animals.''He built it all on his own, stone by stone and the stained glass windows were all hand painted. 'There was not much inside the building, just an old table and benches made from logs, but it had an enchanting feel to it.'I really enjoy documenting old buildings, and being able to grab a part of history while it’s still there.' Relocation: Mr Stokes sold the land the property was built on the 2000 when a quarry was built nearby.

The Ohio attorney general's office, which handled his trial, asked the judge in a filing last week to sentence him to 41 years in prison. Sentence: John Donald Cody, pictured in court Monday, was sentenced to 28 years in prison for racketeering, theft and money laundering charges . The judge rejected a request for a new trial. The defense had said comments by jurors after the verdict that they were disappointed he hadn't testified showed they were biased against him. The defendant, whose appearance in court Monday was neat in contrast to the final days of his trial, slumped in his chair as the sentence was read. He complained to the judge about alleged abusive treatment by jailers while locked up during the trial. There was no immediate response from the sheriff's department. Jailers said earlier that the defendant had acted erratically and had bloodied his forehead smashing it against a holding cell wall. The judge said the crimes had harmed veterans who were the intended beneficiaries of the donations and also had hurt other charities as donors became skeptical of giving. Charity fraud: Cody, pictured left, was convicted last month of defrauding donors of up to $100 million in 41 states through the United States Navy Veterans Association, a charity he ran in Tampa, Florida . Fair punishment: Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Steven Gall, pictured Monday, said the sentence reflected the length, extent and amount of the charity 'charade' 'Everyone's afraid to give,' Gall said. He said the sentence reflected the length, extent and amount of the charity 'charade.' Defense attorney Joseph Patituce said after the verdict and again after the sentencing that ineffective legal representation issues stemming from limited preparation time might be a basis for an appeal. His client denies committing the crimes, Patituce said. The defense hinted at a CIA covert operation and showed jurors photos of the defendant with President George W. Bush, suggesting Thompson was acting with government sanction. Thompson was convicted November 14 of racketeering, theft, money laundering and 12 counts of identity theft. The prosecutor showed jurors identification cards with the defendant's photo but different names and issued by government agencies and companies in numerous states. What a mess: The defendant, pictured during his November trial, was extremely unkempt in the final days before he was convicted . Thompson sat upright, taking notes . during much of his trial but turned unpredictable in the final few days, . appearing in court with his shirt unbuttoned to his waist and uncombed . hair hanging down his face. The . judge, who expressed irritation with Thompson over his appearance, . issued an order that he be 'dressed, groomed and showered' by 8 a.m. on . trial days and directed deputies to bring him to court 'by any means . necessary.' Attorney General Mike DeWine's office asked that $330,778 of the seized money cover investigation and trial costs. The office also wants $650,871.30 for a default judgment order, with the money going to veterans charities, according to Dan Tierney, a DeWine spokesman. An additional $101,000 seized from Thompson has already been distributed by Ohio to veterans charities. The onetime fugitive signaled he would testify at trial but changed his mind. Fraudster: Records show the defendant, pictured left with George W. Bush, had showered politicians, often Republicans, with political donations . Donations: Politicians who received donations from Cody, pictured left with John Boehner, include Bush and former presidential contenders Mitt Romney, John McCain and Rudolph Giuliani . The fraud occurred in 41 states, . according to trial testimony, and Ohio took the lead, indicting Thompson . in 2010. He disappeared for nearly two years and was arrested last year . in Portland, Oregon. He was convicted of looting the United States Navy Veterans Association, a charity he ran in Tampa, Florida. Only a fraction of the $100 million was found. When Thompson was arrested, authorities found fake IDs and a suitcase with $980,000 in cash. Records show the defendant had showered politicians, often Republicans, with political donations. Politicians who received donations from him, according to campaign finance filings, include Bush and former presidential contenders Mitt Romney, John McCain and Rudolph Giuliani. The defendant was identified through military fingerprint records.","Cleveland, Ohio, judge Steven Gall handed down the sentence Monday to Harvard-trained attorney John Donald Cody aka Bobby Thompson .

Lee Mairs, 24, died after falling during a stag party trip to Tenerife, an inquest heard . A British tourist who died on a stag party trip to Tenerife may have fallen 12 feet off a hotel balcony after a fight, an inquest heard. Electrician Lee Mairs, 24, who had flown to the Canary island with a group of 22 friends to celebrate the imminent wedding of his friend Chris Booth, 29, suffered a fractured skull and bleed to the brain after falling onto some concrete steps outside his hotel in Playa de las Americas. Mr Mairs, from Stockport, was found under his first floor apartment window by another holidaymaker who heard 'coughing and spluttering' coming from the ground. He was rushed to hospital in Santa Cruz but his life support machine was later switched off. An inquest into his death heard that his room at the Hacienda del Sol hotel had been ransacked, with two beds tipped onto their sides, kitchen cupboards and the fridge door open, and a smashed tumbler lying on the floor. Yet nothing was missing, and Mr Mairs' iPhone and iPod docking station were still in the room. Mr Mairs died in June last year, after a night out with his friends in the resort's nightlife strip. The inquest heard from his friend and hotel room-mate Steven Haley, who said that he last saw Mr Mairs in Yates' Bar wearing a hat he'd bought from a street vendor. He said: 'Lee was dancing on a table and playing Air Guitar and having a laugh.' Mr Haley, a joiner, said he left the bar at around midnight and headed back to the hotel, where he saw a flipflop belonging to Mr Mairs. He said when he got back to their room he could not find the key they'd hidden, so he climbed in through a window.

Pictured with his mother, Joanne, Mr Mairs was found under his first floor apartment window by another holidaymaker . Happy: Mr Mairs, kneeling front centre, is pictured on the stag trip to Tenerife before he was fatally injured . Mr Haley said he saw Mr Mairs' phone on the floor, and then noticed that the beds were upended, and the room was in a mess, although no valuables had been taken. He said another holidaymaker told him that Mr Mairs had been taken away in an ambulance, so he went to the reception desk where a member of staff told him that the situation had been dealt with and the police were not needed. He claimed staff told him: 'No police needed - your friend was drunk and fell off the balcony.' Mr Haley said: 'One of the times he . was saying he had been attacked outside the hotel, another time he told . me he had had a fight, each time was a different version from the same . person in such a short space of time.' Mr Haley said that when the police did arrive the following day, they 'decided in minutes what had happened'. The Spanish authorities registered Mr Mairs' death as an accident, saying he had fallen from the balcony, but his family do not believe they carried out a full investigation, the inquest heard. He was rushed to hospital in Santa Cruz but his life support machine was later switched off . Funeral: Mr Mairs' family believes the Spanish authorities have not properly investigated the circumstances of his death . Mr Haley also told the inquest that one of the stag party guests became upset and 'emotional' after the tragedy. He said he asked Ross Collett what had happened with Mr Mairs in Tenerife and said:  'He wouldn't answer me, so I asked him again. 'He was crying, he said ""He hit me, it went off"".  As I took it, Lee had hit [the guest] and something had occurred in retaliation.' However the inquest was told Mr Collett denied making the comments, and said that he had been drunk. Recording an open verdict, Coroner John Pollard said there was insufficient evidence to decide how Mr Mairs died that night. He said it was possible he had been assaulted on the way back to the hotel and then fell again, or that he fell from the balcony. He said he could have been assaulted at the hotel and fallen over. The coroner added: 'Then there is the possibility a combination of these things happened. We cannot prove it one way or the other.'","Lee Mairs body was found outside his hotel room in Playa de las Americas .

For the first time since the  economic downturn, the majority of employers now say they expect to take on extra staff within the next 12 months. The Confederation of British Industry said job prospects are ‘on the up’ amid clear signs that the recovery ‘has finally taken hold.’ The news follows the recent statement by the Bank of England’s governor, Mark Carney, that ‘for the first time in a long time, you don’t have to be an optimist to see the glass as half full.’ Prospects: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said recently that 'for the first time in a long time, you don¿t have to be an optimist to see the glass as half full.' Around 325 private-sector firms of all sizes were asked by the CBI whether they think their workforce will be larger, smaller or the same size at the end of 2014. The report, published today, found 51 per cent plan to hire more workers, a landmark moment for a workforce which has suffered redundancies and recruitment freezes for several years. During the darkest days of the recession, in 2009, this figure was as low as 22 per cent. The report says: ‘Private sector workforces are anticipated to grow across all regions, with Yorkshire and Humberside and the East Midlands the most buoyant.’ Katja Hall, chief policy director at the CBI, said: ‘We’re starting to see the recovery have an impact on business plans to hire, with more than half of firms boosting staff numbers next year and more opportunities for young people. ‘It is good to see jobs being created across most regions, not just London and the South East.’ Workers also have a good prospect of a pay rise. For many, it will be the first substantial one since the crisis began in 2008. The report found 42 per cent of workers ‘expect to match Retail Prices Index inflation’, which was 2.6 per cent in October, according to the Office for National Statistics. And the number of firms planning to keep pay frozen has dropped to a new low of 8 per cent, half last year’s figure of 16 per cent. In 2009, it was 55 per cent. Last week, the ONS said the average worker would now be earning £2,600 more were it not for a general pay freeze. The average full-time worker earns £27,000, but that would be £29,600 if pay had kept pace with inflation for the last five years. The report also said a third of businesses plan to increase graduate recruitment, a relief for young people desperately seeking a proper job since leaving university. Oliver Benzecry, managing director of Accenture, the consultancy which co-published the report, said: ‘Too many young people remain trapped in low-skilled, short-term jobs, or in a vicious cycle of “no experience, no job”.’","Report by the CBI found 51 per cent of firms plan to hire more workers .

Injuries: Kathleen Allegrone, 70, was left with a bloody nose after being thrown to the ground . A police officer has been filmed violently body-slamming a 70-year-old woman face-first onto the pavement after stopping her for drunk driving. Kathleen Mary Allegrone was left with a bloody and bruised nose after Kevin Jones from the Glynn County Sheriff's Office threw her to the ground on St. Simons Island, Georgia on December 5. Despite the apparently brutal act, which was caught on camera by a passerby, the sheriff's office concluded that Jones acted reasonably and he has been allowed to continue working. The video shows Allegrone struggling with the officer as he leads her, handcuffed, to his patrol car before throwing her into the air and onto the street, her face hitting the ground with a smack. 'The lady was being handcuffed and did not have her arms to break her fall,' a witness said. The cameraman's friend added to First Coast News: 'I was stunned really. I think everyone was.'

A rail firm has become the first to announce a freeze on 43 per cent of its fares for 2014 - including more than half of journeys to and from London. But Government-run East Coast, which runs to the North East and Edinburgh, said regulated fares, which include season tickets, will rise by 3.1 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Fares on 43 per cent of all journeys will be frozen next month, with fares on tickets booked in advance frozen for 64 per cent of all journeys.’ Government-run East Coast, which runs between London and North East and Edinburgh, has become the first to announce a freeze on 43 per cent of its fares for 20134 . This is in sharp contrast to the . oft-quoted ‘real terms freeze’ in which fares go up only by the rate of . inflation - which still means ticket prices rise. The company said there would be some increase below or up . to the rate of inflation on 51 per cent of fares. And 6 per cent of . tickets would see an above inflation rise, it said. The line was taken over by the Department for Transport in 2009 after franchise holder National Express decided it cost too much to run. East Coast managing director Karen Boswell said: ‘We’re freezing fares to encourage more people to travel with us. This will help us to continue to grow our business, and to give back even more to the taxpayer. ‘This is a straightforward commercial decision which is very good . news for our customers and businesses across our route. It will also . help East Coast to sustain our strong advantage in a highly-competitive . travel market. 'When you take into account the rate of . inflation, [the] announcement represents a genuine real terms cut in . our overall fares. The company said it was a 'commercial decision' and hoped it would attract more passengers (file picture) 'We believe this will attract more people to our . trains, and help to maximise revenue. It will also help businesses and . hard-working people by holding down the cost of travel for many.‘ . East Coast operates services from London up the east side of England to Scotland, with about 60 per cent of services starting or finishing at London’s King’s Cross station. Overall average rise for all East Coast fares from January 2 will be 1.21 per cent. Unregulated fares - which include off-peak fares and advanced-purchased tickets for leisure travellers - will go up by an average of 0.83 per cent. Regulated fares, including season tickets, will rise by 3.1 per cent next year after an announcement by George Osborne . But regulated fares, which include season tickets, are rising by the recently-agreed 3.1 per cent average which is in line with the July 2013 RPI inflation rate on which the January 2014 national rises are based. This follows the announcement in Chancellor George Osborne’s recent Autumn statement that January 2014’s rail fare rise for regulated fares - which include season tickets - would be capped and limited to the retail or RPI rate of inflation rather than ‘RPI plus 1per cent’. The rises will now be based solely on the inflation-rate rate in July 2013, which means that the average rise in January 2014 will be 3.1 per cent rather than the expected 4.1 per cent. However, train operators still have flexibility to increase fares by a further 2 percentage points to 5.1 per cent, - provided other fares fall to compensate and keep the overall average at 3.1 per cent. Mr Osborne said his decision would benefit more than 250,000 annual season ticket holders who will, on average in 2014, save £25. Passenger Focus executive Mike Hewitson said: ‘Hard-pressed passengers will welcome East Coast’s decision to freeze nearly half of all its fares, including more than half of those to or from London.’ And TSSA transport union leader Manuel Cortes said other rail companies who have made ‘massive profits down the years from ripping off passengers’ should follow suit. He added: ‘We would like to see all fares frozen because they have more than doubled since privatisation 20 years ago.’","Government-run East Coast said freeze was 'commercial decision'

One in eight retired Britons still have a mortgage to pay off, with an average loan burden of nearly £50,000, a report revealed yesterday. It estimates around 1.6million over the age of 55 who have retired have a mortgage. Some owe more than £100,000, the study said. The research into the over-55s who have stopped full-time work shatters the dream of retirement being a time of holidays, relaxation and time with grandchildren. In fact, the report, from the pension experts MGM Advantage, estimates retired Britons have a total debt burden of more than £100billion. It warned the rising tide of poor pensioners is ‘alarming’, and said many are too scared to talk about their debts which are a ‘taboo’ subject for many people of this generation. Many have interest-only mortgages, a loan which allowed them to pay the interest but none of the actual loan, forcing many to sell their home when the loan matures. Britain’s new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, estimates 40,000 people a year over 65 will have this type of loan maturing between 2017 and 2032. The lucky ones will be able to repay the mortgage lump sum that they borrowed decades ago. Many of the unlucky ones will be forced to extend their mortgage and keep on paying a mortgage into their 70s, which means they may have to keep on working to find the money. Fearful: Many unlucky pensioners will be forced to extend their mortgage into their 70s . Andrew Tully, pensions technical director of MGM Advantage, said: ‘These figures are alarming.‘They show the pressure people face on a daily basis trying to balance the household budget.‘Although many people consider themselves retired, they are continuing to pay off their mortgage, some with quite substantial balances. ‘Dig a little deeper and many people are working part-time, sometimes through choice but often simply to make ends meet. ‘Talking about debt in retirement will be a taboo for many people who find themselves in this position.’ Yesterday the Office for National Statistics, which looked at older people who are 65 and over, said it estimates around 325,000 in this age group are repaying a loan, typically of £30,000. More than one in ten described their monthly mortgage repayments as ‘a heavy burden.’ To add to the pressure on pensioners, a separate report reveals how the income that they get from their savings and investments has collapsed since the financial crisis began. Property difficulties: More than one in ten described their monthly mortgage repayments as ¿a heavy burden¿ . The average retired household received around £1,863 a year in 2007/08, compared to £1,207 today, according to the retirement income firm Key Retirement Solutions. MGM Advantage warned around a third of ‘retirees’ also have other personal debts, with an average of around £7,000. It comes after one of Britain’s biggest debt charity warned last week of a ‘crisis’ among people over the age of 60 with record numbers facing insolvency. Step Change said it dealt with a record number of people in this age group last year, and said the numbers had shot up nearly 40 per cent since the recession began. The report reveals people aged 60 and over typically have larger debts than any other age group who contact the debt charity about their financial problems. On average, their total debts are £23,000, while the average debts of a typical person contacting the debt charity are around £17,650.","Retired Britons have a total debt burden of more than £100billion .

The game's developers says it has been blocked by Facebook but that it is working to fix the issue . The company said it 'violated its platform policies'. The app comes at a sensitive time for Facebook, after figures last month showed more than 1million users are ditching the social networking site a month. Artist Mr McDonald, who says he is working to fix the game, said he wants people to feel able to delete their accounts after playing Social Roulette. He told Yahoo News: 'My favourite feedback came from a friend on Facebook who wrote that he played, and his account was not deleted, but he felt like after playing he now had the peace of mind to delete his account. 'Social Roulette is a gift to everyone who feels like they can't delete their Facebook account.' Users sign into the game with their Facebook identification and then 'pull the trigger of the gun'. There is then a one in six chance of the account apparently being deleted. If it was not then the so-called survival would be announced on the user's page. Kyle McDonald said he wanted people to feel able to quit Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, pictured . The game's website says: 'Everyone thinks about deleting their account at some point, it's a completely normal reaction to the overwhelming nature of digital culture. 'Is it time to consider a new development in your life? Are you looking for the opportunity to start fresh? Or are you just seeking cheap thrills at the expense of your social network?' It is not the first time app creators and even big companies have used anti-Facebook techniques. In the U.S., Burger King gave away a free burger to people who deleted 10 of their friends. Mr McDonald said he was inspired by FriendFracker, where friends were deleted at random. He told Yahoo that he wanted to take the idea even further.

The Fire Brigades Union last night announced a string of further stoppages over the festive period in an escalation of its  long-running dispute with the Government over pensions. The move came just 48 hours after a man died in a blaze in a flat in north London during the latest walkout by fire crews. The Fire Brigades Union has announced planned strikes that will take place over the festive period . Fire Minister Brandon Lewis condemned the move, saying that firemen were already being offered ‘one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector’. Mr Lewis said: ‘The decision by FBU leaders to interrupt the Christmas holiday season with unnecessary industrial action is completely cynical. ‘I met with the FBU on December 4 to continue discussions but their actions today show that they are not serious about resolving this dispute, which simply further damages firefighters’ standing with the public.’ He added: ‘The deal on the table gives firefighters one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector. ‘A firefighter who earns £29,000, and retires after a full career aged 60, will get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension. ‘An equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much.’ The FBU said members in England and Wales will walk out for five hours from 7pm on December 24, for six hours from 6.30pm on December 31 and for two hours from 6.30am on January 3. The move will raise fears about the safety of firework displays on New Year’s Eve and other celebrations. FBU members in Scotland will also join the industrial action for the first time since the row flared, by joining in an overtime ban. Between 7pm on December 27 and 7pm on the 29th, all firemen in the union across England, Wales and Scotland will refuse to work voluntary overtime. The move comes just 48 hours after a man died in a blaze at a London flat during the latest walkout by firefighters . The union claims that members in their late 50s face the prospect of being sacked or seeing their pension reduced by almost half because of changes in the retirement age. FBU chief Matt Wrack said: ‘Firefighters provide a first-class standard of service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and these strikes will remind Government just how reliant they are on our members’ professionalism, commitment and flexibility. ‘However, there should be no need for industrial action and it’s absurd that firefighters’ concerns over pensions have not been addressed already.’ London fire chiefs were yesterday forced to defend their contingency plans after retired father-of-two  Richard Nicholson died in a blaze while union members were on strike on Saturday night. A neighbour raised the alarm at 9.52pm but striking firemen remained on their picket line until the four-hour walkout ended at 10pm. When they arrived at his ground-floor flat they found his body. The FBU said the tragedy raised questions over contingency cover. But James Cleverly, chairman of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, said going on strike put people’s safety at risk. He said he believed the emergency services should agree no-strike deals, but added that it was ‘too quick and judgmental’ to conclude that Mr Nicholson had died due to the strike.","The Fire Brigades Union announced string of stoppages over festive period .

On trial: Neville Neville, the father of England footballers Gary and Phil, stands accused of sexual assault which his alleged victims claims happened when she dropped him home . The father of former Manchester United and England footballers Gary and Phil Neville sexually assaulted a woman after having 'far too much to drink' and told her 'I like the chase', a jury heard today. Neville Neville, 63, is on trial at Bolton Crown Court accused of a single count of assault by penetration after the woman gave him a lift home on a snowy evening. The alleged victim - who said she feared she was going to be raped - told police: 'The thought he could do that without my consent and to think he ""likes the chase"" made me feel dirty', the court heard. On the first day of his trial today his famous sons, Gary and Phil, were in the public gallery to support him. The incident is said to have taken place in Bury, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of March 23, but Neville denies the offence. The jury of eight women and four men was told that the accused knew his alleged victim. The incident happened following a night out in which the alleged victim offered the defendant a lift home in her car in the cold, snowy conditions at the time. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said when she was about to drop him off near his home, he suddenly 'lunged' at her and forced his tongue in her mouth. She said she told him to stop but he persisted and grabbed her breast before he pushed his hand down her trousers and inside her underwear, the prosecutor said. When she later reported the matter to the police, married Neville did not deny the incident took place but told detectives it was consensual. Mr Cadwallader told the jury: 'The Crown . say it was not consensual and he knew full well it was not consensual . because she told him so.' Scroll down for video . Concerned sons: Gary  and Phil Neville leaving Bolton Crown Court today on the first day of their father's trial . The prosecution said she was effectively pinned to her seat as she told him to stop when he began kissing her. Mr Cadwallader continued: 'The Crown would say he had far too much to drink. 'The defendant did not stop with kissing her. He pushed his hand up her top and grabbed her breast. 'By that stage she was feeling more and more distraught and frightened by the persistence. 'She did not know what it would end with.' He then pushed his hand down her trousers as he attempted unsuccessfully to undo the buttons, the court heard. Forcing her thighs apart he then sexually assaulted her in a 'rough' manner, the court was told. She continued to tell him to stop and eventually the defendant got out of the car and she drove off, said Mr Cadwallader. The prosecutor added: 'She was in a distraught condition. She did not know at that stage what to do.' Supportive: Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, right, and his brother former Everton captain Phil Neville, left, were in court to back their father . The alleged victim entered the witness box to give evidence without screens. The jury was played a video of her police interview. 'I said 'What are you doing?' and he said ""I like the chase"".' 'The thought he could do that without my consent made me feel dirty' - Neville Neville's alleged victim . She told the interviewing female officer: 'I feel cheap. I have never been made to feel like that in my life. 'I felt I was doing him a favour on dropping him off because it was snowing... he abused that kindness really. 'I did not want him to fall in the snow and slip. And he is a big guy so I said 'I will drop you off'. I had no reason not to give him a lift.' Describing the moments before the alleged sexual assault, she said Neville told her to pull over. 'He said 'Turn the engine off' and I just did it. 'He took his seatbelt off. I didn't take mine off.' 'He forced his head on me,' she said. 'It was a really forceful kiss. His tongue, like, forced down my throat. 'I had never been in a situation like that, especially with someone I knew.' Prosecution: Bolton Crown Court, pictured, heard that Neville was a 'big man' who sexually assaulted the woman in a 'rough' manner because he 'liked the chase' She said she initially thought she would be blamed for what had happened for not pushing him off. 'I just froze,' she said, 'My whole body froze. I could not speak. I just panicked. 'He forced himself on me totally. His hand up the side of my shirt, inside my bra. He grabbed hold of me but at the same time forcing me down with his face. He is a very, very big man. That was stopping me moving. 'He went down my trousers... he forced my legs apart and he was trying to rip my trousers off. 'I said 'Stop what you are doing'. I didn't say 'No'. 'I said 'You are a married man, are you not happy?' and he said 'I'm very happy'. 'I said 'What are you doing?' and he said 'I like the chase'.' The trial continues.

The killer of April Jones is set to receive up to £170,000 in legal aid, the Mail can reveal. The disclosure comes as April’s distraught family expressed their horror that Mark Bridger had launched a shameless bid for freedom – which will cost the taxpayer £20,000. They demanded that Bridger, who abducted and murdered the five-year-old in a case that shocked the nation, be forced to reveal where he hid her body if he is allowed to appeal his whole-life sentence. He was convicted in May and ordered to die in prison but, after just six months behind bars, he is attempting to overturn his sentence. April’s family are furious that he has any right to appeal when he so cruelly refuses to reveal where he hid the little girl’s body. ‘I really don’t think he should have any right,’ April’s grandmother Linda Smith said yesterday. ‘If he can’t say what has happened, I don’t see how he can appeal.’ Bridger’s appeal, which was confirmed by the Ministry of Justice yesterday, comes as the Mail reveals he received £150,000 in legal aid while dragging April’s family through the courts. Even though the killer confessed to her death when he was arrested last October, he claimed it was an accident, forcing April’s parents to endure five weeks of harrowing  evidence at trial. Coral and Paul Jones said they felt ‘tortured’ as a result. ‘He’s put us through so much. It’s like he’s taunting us, like he wants to show he’s got the upper hand,’ Mrs Jones said. ‘It’s disgusting. He’s in prison where he belongs and he should stay there. He’s just torturing my family with these legal battles.’ Appeal: Mark Bridger, left, is appealing against his imprisonment for killing five-year-old April Jones, right . Politicians . and campaigners said taxpayers would be ‘disgusted’ to know they had . funded the monster’s cruel show in court with a six-figure legal aid . bill. And with his appeal due at the High Court next month, that amount is set to rise by an estimated £20,000. April . was abducted on the evening of October 1 last year as she played on her . pink bicycle close to her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in Machynlleth, . Mid-Wales. Former slaughterman Bridger, 48, who kept child porn and . pictures of dead youngsters on his laptop, lured April into his Land . Rover and drove her to his remote rented home before brutally sexually . assaulting her, killing her and disposing of her body. Months of . exhaustive police searches failed to find the child’s body. Bridger told . police that he had killed April but has adamantly refused to reveal . what he did with her body. Anguish: The victim's parents Coral and Paul Jones have spoken of their anger at hearing the news . April’s blood and 17 fragments of skull . were later discovered in his house. The tiny pieces of bone are all her . parents were able to bury at her funeral in September. Despite his . confession, Bridger pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, . subjecting her grieving parents to the horror of a five-week trial. Represented by top criminal  barrister Brendan Kelly QC, Bridger’s substantial legal costs were funded by the public. Bridger, a father of six, was  sentenced to die in jail by Mr Justice Griffith Williams at Mold Crown Court. The judge said he had ‘no doubt there can be only one sentence’, handing him a whole life tariff. ‘The . grief of April’s parents  cannot be over-stated. They lived with the . torment of a missing daughter... And they have had to endure the . spectacle of your  hypocritical sympathy for their loss and of your . tears, flowing not because of any regret for your crimes, but because of . your enduring self pity.’ Jailed: Bridger is one of just 49 people in Britain currently serving whole life sentences . Bridger has now appealed his sentence and, because he is covered by legal aid, his challenge will also be paid for by taxpayers. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It beggars belief that Mark Bridger can claim such a huge sum of  public money.’ Robert . Oxley, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘Given the horrendous . nature of Mark Bridger’s crime, most people will find it disgusting that . they have funded his trial with a six-figure bill.’ Earlier this . year, Bridger tried to claim compensation following an attack by a . fellow inmate at the top security Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire. In . total, it is believed Bridger’s refusal to accept any responsibility . for his heinous crimes has cost the public about £9million, including . £8.5million for the biggest search in the history of British policing.","Bridger, 47, was convicted of murdering five-year-old April in May this year .

China's new prime minister is the man behind one of the biggest medical scandals of all time. In the 1990s between 50,000 and 300,000 people were mistakenly infected with HIV in Henan province and  Li Keqiang, the man who led the cover-up is now China's new leader. Mr Li was governor of the area in 1998 when people contracted HIV . from state-sponsored blood-buying rings with unhygienic practices. Hypocrisy: Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang presides over a State Council AIDS Working Committee, in Beijing on Monday. Mr Li was governor of Henan province in 1998 when people contracted HIV from state-sponsored blood-buying rings with unhygienic practices . Activists have urged Li to acknowledge the government's responsibility . for the disaster and provide compensation, with little success. There are no official figures because . the Chinese government has never admitted or apologised for what . happened but now Mr Li is desperately trying to rectify his shadowy . past. Earlier this week Li shook hands with Aids victims on Chinese television and promised to . let NGOs play a more active role in battling the disease. The stigma against people with HIV runs especially deep in China, from . being unofficially barred from government jobs to being expelled from . school. Tough talk: During a meeting Monday with a dozen activist groups Li said health facilities that discriminate against people with HIV would be severely punished. An estimated 780,000 people have HIV in China . In China, hospitals routinely reject people with HIV for surgery out of . fear of exposure to the virus or harm to their reputations. But last Friday, following Mr Li's orders, the health ministry banned hospitals from turning away infected patients. During a meeting Monday with a dozen activist groups, he said such . discrimination would be severely punished, according to Li Hu. After years . of denying AIDS was a problem in China, the country has significantly . improved care for patients, but the lingering stigma sets back those . advances. One of those infected was Wang Pinghe who was just 12-yearsold when he had a chest operation and was contracted HIV. He did not realise he  was ill but suffered fevers which last for weeks and some mornings he found he could not even open his eyes. After leaving school, he worked in factories and then dug irrigation systems in western China. Now aged 28, Mr Wang was diagnosed with full-blown Aids in May. 'My parents cried for four days. I am their only son,' he told The Telegraph. Mr Wang wants the tumor in his liver removed before it becomes life-threatening. But the 28-year-old Chinese villager knows it will be hard to find a hospital that will do the operation because of his diease. Lasting legacy: 28-year-old HIV patient Wang Pinghe shows bottles of medicine pills he has been taking. He was infected when he was just 12-years-old . 'In my hometown, not a single hospital is willing to operate on people infected with HIV,' said Wang, who traveled to Beijing from Runan county in the central province of Henan to try to draw the attention of central authorities to the issue by speaking to the foreign media. 'This is not discrimination by one single person but by an entire country.' Now, as more people rail against the myriad inequalities that plague Chinese society, people with HIV are becoming increasingly willing to assert their right to fair treatment. One man recently claimed the spotlight by altering his medical records to hide his HIV-positive condition so he could get surgery for lung cancer. The man, who went by the pseudonym Xiaofeng, told state media he had been turned away by two hospitals. His story sparked a firestorm of criticism directed at both the hospitals for rejecting him and thepatient for exposing medical staff to risks they were not aware of. [caption . 'Xiaofeng was smart. When he felt that his life was in danger, he found a way to save himself,' said Li Hu, a Tianjin-based activist who helped Xiaofeng and later publicized the case online. 'But this way isn't good for anyone, be it the patient or medical workers. Now the question is: Can we find a way that is favorable for everyone?' China has made significant strides in tackling the epidemic, with the AIDS mortality rate falling 64 percent from 2002 to last year. The government last year increased HIV treatment by 50 percent — reaching three-quarters of the adults and children who require it, according UNAIDS. An estimated 780,000 people have HIV in China. There has been an increasing trend of cases transmitted through sex rather than intravenously, with sex workers and gay men considered most at risk, said Guy Taylor, a communications officer for UNAIDS. Treatment: With improved access to lifesaving drugs, people with HIV in China are living longer, which means more are seeking treatment for other ailments . About 70,000 new cases were reported in the first 10 months of this year, largely through sexual transmission, as compared with about 93,000 for all of last year, the Health Ministry announced this week at a news conference ahead of World AIDS Day on Saturday. With improved access to lifesaving drugs, people with HIV in China are living longer, which means more are seeking treatment for other ailments. Chinese law bars medical facilities from refusing to treat people with HIV, but activists say discrimination continues because the law spells out no serious punishments. Many patients cannot afford the time and expense of taking hospitals to court. The China Alliance of People Living with HIV/AIDS, a Beijing-based network, said that a survey last year found dozens of patients being turned away by facilities throughout the country — in some cases even leading to deaths. 'I feel that if a doctor refuses to treat a patient who is HIV positive, it is a crime akin to murder,' said the group's coordinator, Meng Lin, who recounted being denied a CT scan by a Beijing doctor in September, after he told him he had AIDS. Dr. Wu Zunyou, who leads the government's HIV/AIDS center, said he believes attitudes will change. He said Chinese health workers report about 700 cases of accidental contact with the every year and none have resulted in infections. He welcomed the public debate the Tianjin case triggered. 'The debate causes medical workers to think about the issue and health facilities to improve their management, so there should be fewer chances for such things to happen in the future,' Wu said.","Henan Li was governor of Henan province in 1998 when people contracted HIV from state-sponsored blood-buying rings with unhygienic practices .

Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher penalties of up to life imprisonment for human traffickers would lead to more prosecutions . Trafficking gang victims who are caught working in a cannabis farm or forced to run a brothel will escape prosecution. Home Secretary Theresa May announced a blitz on the ‘scarcely believable’ modern slave trade yesterday amid claims there are up to 10,000 UK victims. A Home Office bill will introduce a maximum sentence of life in prison for human traffickers, and new guidelines will be issued which state victims should not face prosecution. A review by Labour MP Frank Field says those who commit crimes after being trafficked usually do so ‘at the behest of their controllers’. It adds: ‘This may be children and young persons compelled into forced labour in cannabis farms and factories; those who are forced to run a brothel as part of their enslavement; or those in possession of false immigration documents.’ Mrs May warned last month of slaves working in nail bars. She said slavery is ‘all around us, hidden in plain sight’. Home Secretary Theresa May said that it was impossible to know exactly how many people are being held in conditions of servitude in Britain, but referrals to official agencies suggest that the numbers are growing. The draft Modern Day Slavery Bill, published today, sets out the Government's plans to tackle the problem of people being trafficked into the UK to work in conditions of slavery. Thousands of slaves are thought to work in building sites and farms as well as brothels, shops and in domestic servitude. The bill pulls together into a single act the offences used to prosecute slave-drivers and increases the punishments courts can hand down. Crime hotspot: Earlier this month police raided brothels, sex shops and lap dancing clubs in Soho in a crackdown on drugs and people trafficking . The government has been under pressure . to act because fewer than 10 prosecutions are secured each year, . despite there being thousands of victims. Labour . MP Frank Field, who has produced a report into slavery for the Home . Office, estimates that there are 10,000 victims of slavery in the UK. But . Mrs May said: ‘The honest position is that we don’t know if that’s the . right figure or whether there are fewer or indeed more victims in the . UK. ‘What we do know if . that we have seen more referrals to what is called the National Referral . Mechanism where people are able to refer people who they think have . been trafficked,’ she told BBC Radio 4. ‘I . mean we have seen more cases being identified in the UK through action . by the likes of the National Crime Agency and the Gangmasters Licensing . Authority and one of the purposes of bringing the bill forward is to . ensure we can enhance our ability to deal with the slavedrivers and . therefore reduce the prospect of people being victims in the future.’ Mrs May said one of the obstacles to successful prosecution was the reluctance of victims to come forward because of fears that they might themselves face prosecution or be sent back to their home countries. New guidance is being drawn up by the Director of Public Prosecutions to protect victims of slavery from being prosecuted for crimes which they have been forced to commit because of their illegal servitude, she revealed. However it is thought that because the victims of trafficking and slavery are often also prosuected - such as the case unsuccessfully brought against a group of Vietnamese children forced to work in a cannabis factory – it might deter victims from taking the stand against their exploiters. Mrs May added: ‘We do need victims to be willing to come forward and give evidence in these cases. ‘That issue of whether or not a victim is going to be treated as a criminal themselves is consistently raised. I have talked to both the former and the current Director of Public Prosecutions about the treatment of victims and about why it is that we are not seeking more prosecutions for trafficking and slavery cases. Labour's Yvette Cooper called for more protection for child victims of trafficking . ‘The DPP and the Crown Prosecution Service are issuing more guidance to make clear the circumstances around this question of where a victim has been forced into criminality because of their servitude, because of what the slave-driver has done.’ The Bill contains provisions to give automatic life sentences to offenders who already have convictions for very serious sexual or violent offences. It introduces Trafficking Prevention Orders to restrict the activity and movement of convicted traffickers and stop them from committing further offences. And a new Anti-Slavery Commissioner will be appointed to hold law enforcement and other organisations to account. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the legislation should do more to provide protection for child victims of trafficking. She said: ‘There is cross-party consensus that we need new action to tackle modern-day slavery. And we welcome the limited moves in this Bill. ‘But we would like to see the Bill go further - particularly to provide stronger legal protection for child victims. It is right to increase sentencing for traffickers and to make it easier to prosecute these heinous crimes and prevent repeat offending.’","New laws mean human traffickers will face up to life in prison .

Normally the rejects of the Christmas dinner plate, sprouts are often shoved aside to make way for roast potatoes and scoops of stuffing. But a self-styled Willy Wonka may have achieved the impossible task of getting children to eat their greens over Christmas – by covering them in chocolate. Chocolate shop owner and professional magician, Andrew Simpson, now has queues of curious customers lining up outside his shop to sample the new delicacy Truffle Sprouts he has created using a top secret recipe. Chocolatier Andrew Simpson says making the truffles is a long and drawn out process and it takes hours to make just one batch . The 51-year-old, who runs Simpson’s Chocolates at Elsecar Heritage Centre in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, came up with the idea following the success of his chocolate sprouts, which he introduced two years ago. The chocolatier, who gives talks in schools and turns classrooms into chocolate factories, said he started experimenting with the festive vegetables six years ago at a family party. He said: 'It all started five or six years ago when we had a chocolate fountain and I was looking for something to cover in chocolate. 'I went to the salad graveyard that everyone has in their fridge and found the sprouts. I used a raw sprout and tried it and to my amazement it tasted really good. The eccentric chocolatier added that he is constantly having to tweak his secret recipe as each batch of sprouts can taste different . 'Everyone started trying them and wanted more, same so I took it one step further and introduced them to the public. Parents are stunned to see their child eating a raw sprout.' Since then Andrew has been working . hard on a truffle recipe he can use with the sprouts, which only have a . two day shelf life once ready. He says making the truffles is a long and drawn out process and it takes hours to make just one batch. The . eccentric chocolatier added that he is constantly having to tweak his . secret recipe as each batch of sprouts can taste different depending on . where they have come from and if they have been through a good frost or . not. He said: 'People keep . asking for my chocolate sprouts year after year and I wanted to give . them something extra special this year. Tuck in: The texture of the truffle goes really well with the crunch of the sprout, Andrew claims . 'The Truffle Sprouts are a bit like an after dinner mint or good to be eaten in between courses or even just straight out of the fridge as one of your five-a-day. 'The texture of the truffle goes really well with the crunch of the sprout but you have to try it to believe it.' Andrew said despite the large amount of sprouts he eats while making the truffles he will never get sick of them. He said: 'I love sprouts and I hope by trying my Truffle Sprouts this Christmas more people will learn to love them. 'Unfortunately, although I have made them taste a lot better, I haven’t come up with a recipe which stops them giving you wind.' Andrew, who is working on his latest creation – Marmite Truffles added: 'People say I am like a real life Willy Wonka coming up with weird and wacky ideas like this but I just like adding a bit of magic back into confectionary.'","Chocolate shop owner and magician created Truffle Sprouts .

Ikea presents itself as the champion of affordable home furnishings. But it appears that the store’s definition of affordable varies dramatically according to the country it is operating in. British families are being charged about 70 per cent more for some items of furniture compared with their counterparts on the Continent. A snapshot survey of popular Ikea items – from armchairs and sofas  to a chest of drawers and a rug – found that, on average, customers in Britain are paying more for exactly the same product. For example, Ikea’s popular Friheten corner sofa bed costs £525 if bought in its British stores – some 71 per cent more than the £307 charged in Poland, and also considerably more than the £344 in Spain and Germany. The sofa is also cheaper in Ikea’s home country of Sweden – renowned for its relatively high cost of living – where it comes in at £400. A similar pattern is seen on items including the Äpplaro gazebo, which costs £250 in the UK, versus a cheapest figure of £158 in France. It is £205 in Poland and £215 in Spain and Germany. The price differences were not  consistent and in some cases British families were paying less, which suggests shopping at Ikea offers something of a geographic lottery in terms of value. On the face of it, the prices tend to be lower in countries with lower wages and living standards, however this does not always hold true. Across the eight items surveyed, the UK total cost of £2,215 was higher than the £2,038.60 for Germany and £2,177 in France. It was some £467 – 26.7 per cent – more than the £1,748 total in Poland, and £380 more than Spain’s £1,835. The findings echo a pattern seen in the past among brands of perfume and beauty products, designer clothes, trainers and cars sold globally. It will also fuel the belief that  multi-national companies view Britain as a ‘Treasure Island’ where they can get away with higher prices and bigger profits. And it can be hard enough getting an Ikea flatpack home in the car, let alone on public transport, so it’s unlikely many Britons will be  popping over to Warsaw to collect the store’s cheaper wardrobe. While in opposition, Lib Dem Business . Secretary Vince Cable made government failures to tackle higher UK . prices a campaigning issue. Any suggestion that Ikea, which is hugely successful and profitable, is charging more in the UK risks alienating shoppers here. However, the company, supported by several retail analysts, suggested the gaps have more to do with the relatively high cost of doing business in Britain. Professor Jeremy Baker, a marketing expert at the ESCP business school, said: ‘Ikea looks cut-price but it is a rich Swedish ""category killer"" which exploits its position. ‘It is ruthless on the business side.’ He added: ‘A price is based on three separate factors – cost, what the customer will pay and what the competition are charging. Ikea wins in terms of what the customers will pay and it beats the competition. A snapshot survey of popular Ikea items - from armchairs and sofas to a chest of drawers and a rug - found that, on average, customers in Britain are paying more for exactly the same product . ‘People are seduced by the domestic atmosphere and the impression of value in its stores. Of course the company will charge what it can get away with.’ He said the cost of doing business is higher in Britain versus countries like Poland and also suggested our welfare state effectively props up prices here. This is because benefits guarantee a certain level of income, meaning retailers can get away with charging more in Britain. Prof Baker said it would be wrong for the British to believe that the higher prices we pay are some kind of badge demonstrating a better quality of life. ‘Poland is full of smart hard-working people, and we Brits kid ourselves if we think we are superior. Not any longer,’ he said. Richard Perks of analysts Mintel rejected the idea consumers here are victims of a rip-off culture, and also argued the raised prices are more likely to be the result of higher business costs. ‘Furniture retailers have driven down prices to survive – and many haven’t,’ he added. ‘Ikea is unquestionably very competitively priced. It has that end of the market to itself because all the other furniture retailers are so frightened of it.’ Leigh Sparks, professor of retail studies at the University of Stirling, said prices will also fluctuate depending on what was selling well in each country. An Ikea spokesman said: ‘Low price is the cornerstone of the Ikea vision, and we will always remain focused on giving our customers the best value for money. ‘Prices are set once a year and are subject to a number of factors in each country, such as VAT, exchange rates, corporation taxes, wages, energy and transportation costs, which impact on the actual cost of offering that product in each country where Ikea operates. ‘We guarantee our customers in the UK the lowest prices in the market with a substantial price distance to the competition.’","Friheten corner sofa bed costs £525 if .

Witness: International Monetary Fund's Christine Lagarde has been designated as an 'assisted witness' in the French payout scandal . The head of the International Monetary Fund was tonight made an assisted witness in an alleged case of alleged embezzlement and fraud. Christine Lagarde, 57, announced her new status following two long days of questioning by judges in Paris. She could still face formal criminal charges over a case she described tonight as ‘complex and old’, but insisted she ‘always acted in the best interests’ of France. The former French finance minister  has already faced calls to stand down from her £305,000  a year job. Ms Lagarde was questioned by three judges over two whole days in the French capital over a 340 million pounds payout of public money to convicted conman Bernard Tapie. It came after Dominque Strauss-Kahn, another senior French politician, was sacked as IMF chief following allegations that he attempted to rape a chambermaid in a New York hotel. Ms Lagarde began campaigning to succeed Mr Strauss-Kahn soon after his arrest for the alleged crime. But now it is Ms Lagarde, a lawyer and retired synchronised swimming star, who is facing a long court process of her own, as well as a jail sentence. The scandal not only piles further shame on France's political class, but will worry politicians and bankers trying to resolve the global financial crisis. Lagarde, 57, announced the move after two days of questioning by judges in Paris.

She said: ‘Knowing the IMF and the way this type of institution works, I tend to think that if she was placed under investigation, she would without doubt be asked to quit her post.’ Before tonight’s decision, Mrs Lagarde’s lawyer, Yves  Repiquet, said the inquiry was ‘in no way incompatible’ with her IMF job, adding that he expected it to be dismissed. Tapie was jailed for six months in 1997 for corruption and match- fixing while he was the owner of  Marseilles football club.","Lagarde, 57, questioned for two days by judges in Paris .

The severe winter weather coupled with a faulty import pipeline led to supplies being rapidly used up at the end of March. The revelation that the country almost ran out of gas came as officials warned there could be a similar crisis next winter. Household fuel bills, already at record levels, are expected to rise further as a result of the shortage. Rob Hastings, director of energy and infrastructure at the Crown Estate, the property portfolio managed by the Queen, said: ‘We really only had six hours’ worth of gas left in storage as a buffer [at the end of March]. If it had run any lower it would have meant interruptions to supply.’ The Crown Estate owns the rights to gas storage sites under the seabed. With continuing cold weather – this spring is expected to be the coldest since 1979 – reserves could be partly empty heading into next winter. This could force energy companies to buy gas on the open market at a higher cost, which would likely be passed on via household bills. With eight of the UK’s coal plants shut down last month to meet EU diktats, the nation will be left relying on wind farms and imported gas for power. Angelos Anastasiou, an independent energy analyst, said: ‘This won’t trigger price rises immediately, but if it causes companies to spend more buying gas over the winter then [energy firms] will definitely recoup their costs later on.’ The National Grid, which pipes gas around the UK, insisted the UK has 'substantial resilience' and diverse supply sources including imports of liquefied natural gas . He added: ‘This is most likely to be felt over the next two or three winters as prices creep higher.’Peter Atherton, utilities analyst at stockbroker Liberum Capital, said it would be likely to have a ‘significant’ impact on wholesale gas prices. It comes only days after energy giant SSE, Britain’s second biggest power firm, warned that a price hike of £80 was ‘highly likely’ for its customers because of rising costs. Leaked documents seen by the Mail, which come from within a government body, assessed the impact of the gas crunch in March. The document revealed energy firms had to start drawing on emergency gas reserves, which are said to be more volatile than standard gas, after supplies dwindled to almost nothing. Companies make money by buying gas cheaply in the summer, putting it into gas stores, and selling it in the winter. But summer prices have been rising, and the difference with winter rates is now so small that it is not economical for investors to build any new gas stores – leaving Britain with a maximum of 20 days of storage. This compares with more than 100 days in France, 92 days in Germany and 70 days in Italy. The US protects itself against gas shortages by storing contingencies for up to six months. It also emerged that the number of ships bringing liquefied natural gas from Qatar – the UK’s other main source of gas – has halved in the last 12 months. These ships, which are the most expensive way to get gas, take more than two weeks to reach Britain. It was only because one arrived at the end of March that Britain avoided gas shortages, experts believe.","Senior energy boss Rob Hastings reveals crisis closer than first thought .

Bisexual women have more health problems than people of any other sexual orientation, new research suggests (posed by model) Bisexual women have more health problems than people of any other sexual orientation, new research suggests. Compared to heterosexual people, bisexual men and homosexual people, bisexual women have more mental health problems, poorer general health and more sexually transmitted diseases, the researchers found. However, the quality of life of gay and bisexual people - when compared with heterosexual people - has improved dramatically during the last decade. The research was commissioned by the Norwegian Directorate of Children, Youth and Family Affairs. ‘The similarities are greater than the differences regarding quality of life. That suggests that the world is moving forward,’ said Dr Kirsti Malterud, one of the researchers behind the study. ‘The previous Norwegian report on quality of life from 1999 presented a dismal picture.’ The study revealed that the quality of life of gay and bisexual people is now similar to that of heterosexual people. However, some bisexual women experience a lower quality of life than the rest. ‘We see signs of marginalisation and minority stress in a small group. This group has more mental health problems, poorer self-rated health, more sexually transmitted diseases, experiences loneliness and includes several suicide attempts. This applies to a minority, but it’s serious,’ said Dr Malterud. The survey not only revealed that bisexual women are more likely to suffer chronic illness, but it also showed that many bisexual men and women hide their sexual orientation at work. It showed that some 78 per cent of bisexual men and 68 per cent of bisexual women do not reveal their sexual orientation to their colleagues. In contrast, only 18 per cent of gay men and nine per cent of gay women keep their sexuality under wraps at work. ‘The fact that some are struggling is related to the attitudes of those around them. Perhaps there’s little room in our culture for people who don’t want to call themselves heterosexuals, gays or lesbians. Have we reached our limit of tolerance by accepting gays and lesbians, but then that’s enough?’ asked Dr Malterud. Compared to heterosexual people, bisexual men and homosexual people, bisexual women have more mental health problems, poorer general health and more sexually transmitted diseases, the researchers found . She added: ‘It’s not the case that it’s up to the individual to come out, this is a responsibility we all share.’ Shockingly, the report also showed that 16 per cent of the men in Norway would move away from a gay man on the bus. Dr Malterud said: ‘I’ve been out as a lesbian since I was 28, and I’ve felt good about it. But I’m used to it being an issue, and that people form opinions when I talk about my girlfriends. ‘The 16 per cent who would move away is less than before, but still enough to make you unsure of people’s reactions if you come out. But we have to be pleased that there’s progress.’ Dr Malterud worked on the report entitled ‘Sexual Orientation and Quality of Life’ with Norman Anderssen, Mari Bjørkman, Tone Hellesund and Hilde Slåtten.","These women are more likely to have mental health problems, STIs and chronic illnesses, say Norwegian researchers .

The bank holiday weekend got off to a soggy start yesterday as the Met Office said this spring will be the coldest for more than 30 years. The unsettled weather will put a dampener on Bank Holiday Monday and looks set to continue into next week as schoolchildren enjoy their summer half-term break. Temperatures sank as low as 7C (45F) yesterday as severe weather warnings were issued in parts of the country. Undeterred: Traffic was starting to build on the A14 near a rainy cambridge at the start of the Bank Holiday getaway . The days ahead: Don't forget to bring an umbrella on your Bank Holiday trip . Meanwhile high winds swept from the South West up to Yorkshire, making it feel even colder. The . Met Office now believes this spring will be the coldest since 1979, . with the mean UK temperature estimated at 6.1C (43F), well below the . long-term average for this time of year of 7.7C (46F). Forecaster John Lee of MeteoGroup said: ‘We have got a low pressure system, which is spreading from the North Sea. ‘That’s . what’s bringing these showers and keeping the skies pretty cloudy. It’s . also got some quite brisk winds, so all of those areas in the South and . South East are feeling quite chilly.’ But . hardy Britons refused to be deterred by the grim conditions, with . millions taking to the roads yesterday to make the most of the getaway, . as supermarkets stocked up on barbecue food. And . there is reason to be optimistic. Forecasters said the weather could . improve over the weekend.

Wintry scene: The reindeer seen today was born during a snowstorm in the Cairngorms this week . Ominous: Blooming apple trees look spring like near Glastonbury, Somerset, but the grey skies were evidence of the dismal start to the Bank Holiday . Flourishing despite the cold: Apple tree blossom creates a pretty picture at orchards in Dorset today, but cider makers still need some warmer weather to ensure the trees bear fruit . Bumper crop: It may have been a poor start to the spring, but Somerset cider makers are celebrating a blooming start to the apple growing season . Better late than never: The blossom has arrived two weeks late this year - but cider-makers say it is bigger and better than they had hoped . Spring awakening: The floral display at the Somerset orchard is the best in a decade, growers say . Today much of the country will experience . sunny intervals, with temperatures reaching 14C (57F) and highs of 18C .

Natasha Bigby, 36, from Birmingham, suffered a rare condition which caused her arteries to fill with deadly blood clots. Surgeons had to drain her body of blood to allow them to remove the tiny clots which could have killed her. Natasha Bigly's life was saved by doctors who cleared her pulmonary arteries of blood clots after draining the blood from her body and reducing her core body temperature to just 18 degrees . They also had to reduce Ms Bigby’s body temperature from a normal 37 degrees to an incredibly low 18. Amazingly, she has now made a full recovery and is looking forward to Christmas with her daughter. Ms Bigby said: ‘When the doctors told me about the operation I was amazed. ‘Having my blood drained out of me sounded like something out of a horror film. I have a little girl and when I thought about the risks it was just awful. ‘I just had to remember that it was going to save my life.’ Ms Bigby was diagnosed with a condition called pulmonary hypertension. Ms Bigly had high blood pressure in her pulmonary artery because it was partially blocked by blood clots. This meant the blood could not easily flow through it and caused her to suffer breathlessness and chest pains . The condition occurs when the blood pressure in the pulmonary artery increases. As in Ms Bigby’s case, it can be caused by blood clots blocking the artery and making it difficult for blood to flow through it. This can cause breathlessness, fatigue, faintness and heart problems. Pulmonary endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that removes chronic blood clots from the arteries in the lungs. It involves the patient being connected to a heart-lung machine that takes over from the heart and lungs during the procedure. The patient's body is then cooled to 18 degrees - down from the normal 37 degrees - to prevent damage while the machine is switched off and the blood is removed from the body. While the arteries are briefly emptied of blood, surgeons can remove the clots. Once this has been done, the patient is warmed up to a normal body temperature and taken off the bypass machine. The operation usually takes eight to ten hours. She said: ‘I’ve always been perfectly healthy but last November I went to Jamaica to visit my grandfather. ‘He lives on the top of a hill - which I’ve always been able to walk up - but I was finding it really difficult. ‘I could hardly breathe and it just took me ages - it was then that I knew something was wrong. ‘Back . at home, I was getting really bad chest pains and swelling - my feet . were getting enormous - by the summer I could hardly breathe.’ Initially . doctors diagnosed Ms Bigby with a blood clot, but after collapsing at . her home, and suffering from chest pains, she was rushed to hospital. She said: ‘At the hospital a cardiologist told me that they needed to contact another hospital to get some advice. ‘I was getting really worried because no one seemed to know what was wrong with me and I just didn’t know what was going on. ‘They put me in the intensive care . unit and I just couldn’t understand why - everyone else in there was . really ill and I was awake and chatting away.’ Ms . Bigby was transferred to Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire where her . condition worsened and she became dependent on breathing support. Doctors had to use a heart-lung bypass machine to take over the work of her Ms Bigby's heart and lungs. The machine drained her arteries of blood meaning the surgeons could remove the clots while the arteries were emptied of blood. Image (left) shows the scar on her chest and (right) shows how swollen her feet became . She said: ‘It was at Papworth where they revealed the true extent of my condition. ‘They . explained that I’d been rushed down there because they were the only . hospital in the country that could perform the procedure. ‘I felt relieved to know that I was . in safe hands but I was so scared. I was almost inconsolable in the days . leading up to the surgery, I was scared I’d never see my daughter . again. ‘But the doctors and nurses were fantastic - they did everything they could to make me feel at ease. ‘When . the day of the operation came on August 14 I was so nervous, but I just . had to focus on the bigger picture - I needed this to save my life.’ Before her life-saving surgery, Ms Bigly's legs became very swollen because of her condition . The procedure - known as a pulmonary endarterectomy - involves the patient being put on a heart-lung bypass machine which temporarily takes over the work of the heart and lungs. The body is then cooled to a temperature of just 18 degrees to prevent damage caused by the lack of oxygenated blood flowing around the body. The surgeons then have just 20 minutes to remove the clots while the arteries are emptied of blood. Ms Bibgy said: ‘When I came round I felt better straight away. My recovery has gone swimmingly and I’m finally starting to feel like me again. ‘Getting to go home, after everything I’d been through was incredible - it’s all I’d wanted all along. Ms Bigby said: 'When the doctors told me about the operation I was amazed. Having my blood drained out of me sounded like something out of a horror film' ‘I’m truly amazed at what the surgeons at Papworth did for me, they saved my life.’ Consultant Cardiothoracic Surgeon David Jenkins, who leads the national PEA programme, said: ‘The pulmonary endarterectomy procedure is one of the longest and more complex cardiothoracic operations we perform. ‘Despite the technical difficulty, this procedure is very satisfying as it transforms lives, improving both quality of life and prognosis. ‘It is very rewarding to see patients, like Natasha, with a new lease of life, after struggling to breathe and do the simplest of things, like walking down the street.’","Natasha Bigby had high blood pressure in her pulmonary artery as it was blocked with clots - meaning blood struggled to flow through it .

This is the last image of soldier Lee Rigby in his Help For Heroes top - taken just two days before his brutal murder. Drummer Lee was a regular at the Kebab Ye takeaway in Frances Street, Woolwich, south-east London, and would visit to order food at least three times a week. The kebab shop is less than 100 metres from the main entrance to the Woolwich barracks where the 25-year-old Fusilier was based after serving in Helmand four years ago. Timecodes on the footage show him entering the premises at 9.23pm on Monday and leaving 12 minutes later. Drummer Lee Rigby is seen, wearing a Help For Heroes sweatshirt, in the Kebab Ye takeaway on Monday evening - just two days before he was murdered on a London street . Timecodes on the footage show him entering the premises at 9.23pm on Monday and leaving 12 minutes later. The takeaway is near the Woolwich Barracks, in south-east London, where he was based . The shop's owner told ITV that he knew the soldier as 'Lee' and that he was a regular customer . Yesterday, one member of staff at the . shop was red eyed and still visibly upset after the death of the young . soldier two days ago. Colleague Ali Ulu, 32, spoke warmly of the late Lee Rigby. He said: 'Lee was in here at least three times a week. 'He was a really regular customer and he came in at lunchtime two days before he was murdered. 'He ordered pizza and chips to take . away. He would always stop and chat. He would talk about his young son . and once showed us his picture. He was a really nice man and we are all . still in a state of shock.' Lee's image was captured on the shop's CCTV security camera and Mr Ulu added: 'He . was so well known in here that we would let him use our staff toilet . upstairs while we prepared his food. We still cannot believe he was . killed in such a horrible way.' Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier . The shop's owner, Oner Arslanboga, told ITV that he knew the soldier as 'Lee' and that he was a regular customer. He added that Lee was a 'very polite chap'. Drummer Lee Rigby, of 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was hit by a car and then 'hacked to death' on Wednesday by two men who got out of the vehicle and attacked him with knives and meat cleavers while shouting 'Allah Akbar!' - an Islamic phrase for 'God is great'. Lee had been off-duty at the time, and was possibly wearing the same Help For Heroes hooded top he had on in the kebab shop. His death has sparked a public outpouring of grief, with hundreds of tributes to the father-of-one left near the scene of the crime by Woolwich Barracks. Both the suspected killers, Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were known to MI5. They were shot by armed officers at the scene after allegedly waiting around for up to 20 minutes for police to arrive so they could attack them. A man who was identified on internet forums as Adebolajo was filmed clutching knives and with his hands covered in blood ranting about Islam to passers-by with cameras after the incident. The pair have been arrested and are under armed guard as they recover in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Another man and a woman, both 29, were arrested yesterday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, after police raided a number of addresses around London, Essex and Lincolnshire.

The number of both adults and children surviving cancer is on the rise across England, but figures show survival still depends on where someone lives. Although the North-South divide in survival rates has narrowed since 1996, it is still ‘persistent’, according to a new report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Data from more than three million people shows that cancer of the oesophagus, bowel and lung have the widest regional variations of people still alive one year after diagnosis. The number of both adults and children surviving cancer is on the rise across England . The report reveals there was a difference of more than 10 per cent between regions on these cancers. In one example, 68.3 per cent of women in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire with bowel cancer are alive a year after diagnosis, as are 69.4 per cent of those in West Yorkshire. But women in the South fare better, with 79.2 per cent of those in Thames Valley, and 74.4 per cent of those in Surrey and Sussex, alive after a year. Meanwhile, in Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral, 29.6 per cent of women with lung cancer are alive a year after diagnosis, but in East Anglia the figure is 40.7 per cent. The range in one-year survival between NHS England area teams was widest for men diagnosed with stomach cancer at 14.2 per cent, the report went on. However, at a national level, there has been an increase in survival rates for six key cancers. At a national level, there has been an increase in survival rates for six key cancers, including stomach lung and breast cancers . The largest improvement in one-year survival among men occurred for oesophageal cancer, where survival increased by 19 per cent from 26.7 per cent for those diagnosed in 1996 to 45.4 per cent for those diagnosed in 2011. For women, the largest improvement in one-year survival was for lung cancer, where survival increased by 13 per cent from 21.9 per cent for those diagnosed in 1996 to 34.7 per cent for those diagnosed in 2011. The ONS also published figures on childhood cancer, showing five-year survival has gradually increased from 66.6 per cent in 1990 to 81.3 per cent in 2006. The data covers all children with cancer up to the age of 14. Last week, figures from NHS England showed thousands of people eventually diagnosed with cancer may be failed by GPs who do not refer them quickly enough. Although the North-South divide in survival rates has narrowed since 1996, it is still 'persistent' Figures from around 4,000 GP practices in England show that, in many cases, only a minority of patients are fast-tracked for investigation by a specialist. In some practices, only around one in 10 patients eventually diagnosed with the disease saw a specialist within two weeks. The target for the NHS says 95% per cent of patients with suspected cancer referred by their GP must be seen by a specialist within two weeks. The data suggests many are not seen on this basis and are eventually diagnosed another way. While some GP practices show 100 per cent of patients with cancer making it through the fast-track system, others fall far behind. In around half of the practices in the sample, fewer than 50 per cent of cancer patients were seen through the two-week system. The largest improvement in one-year survival among men occurred for oesophageal cancer, where survival increased from 26.7 per cent for those diagnosed in 1996 to 45.4 per cent for those diagnosed in 2011 . A report by MPs has condemned the findings as a ‘national disgrace’ and suggested doctors should get financial incentives to ensure they diagnose patients within the target. The report by the all-party parliamentary group said there was a gulf between affluent parts of London and the Home Counties and the rest of the country. There was a wide regional variation in urgent referral rates, ranging from fewer than 800 referrals per 100,000 people in areas of London to nearly 3,500 per 100,000 in the North East and East Anglia. In Liverpool, premature cancer death rates were more than twice as high as in Kensington and Chelsea, London, where fewer than 78 people per 100,000 under-75s died early. North East residents have more than double the chance of being sent for a targeted form of radiotherapy than those in the South West.","The North-South divide in survival rates has narrowed but is still 'persistent'

A mother-to-be who thought she was only eight weeks pregnant went to hospital fearing she was miscarrying - and gave birth to healthy twins. Katie Brown, 35, was stunned when doctors told her she was actually 31 weeks pregnant and carrying two babies. What she had mistaken for a miscarriage was actually the onset of labour - and twins Amy and Daniel arrived less than 24 hours later. Katie Brown, 35, went to hospital thinking she was eight weeks pregnant and having a miscarriage. Doctors told her she was actually 31 weeks pregnant and giving birth to twins . Ms Brown and her partner, James Moore, 31, are now home in Darnley, West Yorkshire, with their unexpected arrivals. Ms Brown said: ‘I thought I was just putting weight on. ‘I did a pregnancy test in July and it came back negative. Then I did one at the beginning of November and it was positive. ‘When I went to the hospital I thought I had lost my baby. But once they did tests at the hospital they told me I was 31 weeks pregnant and that I was expecting twins. ‘We couldn't believe it, it was a good job we were sitting down. ‘People cannot believe that I didn't know, but I didn't feel any kicking. It is brilliant and I am just glad we are home in time for Christmas.’ Amy and Daniel were born on November 14. Daniel weighed 3lb 12oz and Amy weighed 2lb 14oz. They were kept in hospital until they had gained some weight and have now been allowed home for Christmas . Ms Brown, who also has an eight year-old daughter, Laura, went into Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield on November 14. Daniel was the first to arrive at 5.48pm the following day weighing 3b 12oz, his sister emerged 13 minutes later weighing 2lb 14oz. Amy needed initial help with her breathing and the babies remained in hospital until they put on some weight. Mr Moore, a warehouse worker, said: ‘It's all been overwhelming. We now need a new house. ‘It was a fantastic surprise and I am glad they are all home in time for Christmas. It is going to be the best Christmas ever. Mr Moore said: 'It's all been overwhelming.

Our emotions ran really high. Mr Moore said that after Amy and Daniel (pictured) were born they were totally unprepared but friends and family rallied round to buy them all of the things they would need . ‘I've been told that the colour instantly drained from my face. I went white as a sheet and if I'd been standing up I'm sure I would have passed out. ‘I just remember Katie saying over and over again “how am I having twins?” ‘We were both as shocked as each other.’ Mr Moore explained that his partner had put on three stone in a few months but that they just assumed she was eating too much. He said they were completely unprepared for their new arrivals but family and friends clubbed together and bought everything they needed as a surprise present. Ms Brown and her partner, James Moore, were aware that she had gained three stone in a matter of months but believed she was just eating too much as a pregnancy test in the summer had come back negative .

The proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight has fallen for the first time in six years, according to new figures . The proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight has fallen for the first time in six years, according to new figures. A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13 were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous year. This proportion is the first recorded fall for Year 6 – 10 and 11-year-olds - in seven years. In Reception, the number of obese and overweight children also fell in 2012/13 compared to the previous year and is lower than seven years ago. Today’s report from the Health and Social Care Information Centre revealed that this year 9.3 per cent of Reception pupils are obese, compared to 9.9 per cent in 2006/07. The study of 587,700 four and five-year-old children also revealed 22.2 per cent are now obese or overweight, compared to 22.9 per cent in 2006/07. The proportion who are underweight - 0.88 per cent - is down from 1.3 per cent six years ago. The study also included data from 489,100 Year 6 children. It found 18.9 per cent of these children are obese this year, which is more than in 2006/07 when the figure was 17.5 per cent. The proportion of children who are obese or overweight - 33.3 per cent - is lower than in 2011/12 - 33.9 per cent - but higher than in 2006/07 - 31.6 per cent. The proportion who are underweight - 1.33 per cent - is down from 1.5 per cent in 2006/07. The research also revealed that obesity prevalence among children attending schools in the most deprived areas is almost double that of the least deprived. Some 12.1 per cent of Reception . children attending schools in the most deprived areas are obese, . compared to 6.4 per cent of children attending schools in the least . deprived areas. Just . over 24 per cent of Year 6 children attending schools in the most . deprived areas are obese, compared to 13 per cent of Year 6 children . attending schools in the least deprived areas. A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13 were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous year . Obesity prevalence is also significantly higher among children living in urban areas than rural areas - 9.6 per cent of Reception children living in urban areas are obese compared 7.5 per cent living in village areas. Some 19.6 per cent of Year 6 children living in urban areas are obese compared to 15.4 per cent living in village areas. Obesity prevalence also varies by region. The lowest levels of obesity are in the south and east of England. However, the highest levels are in London. Obesity prevalence is significantly higher among children living in urban areas than rural areas - 9.6 per cent of Reception children living in urban areas are obese compared 7.5 per cent living in village areas . Health and Social Care Information Centre Chair, Kingsley Manning, said: ‘These figures provide clear insight into the weight of the next generation on both a national and local scale. ‘The first drop in obesity prevalence among Year 6 stands out, although we will need to see what the numbers say in future years to determine if this is the start of a decline or more of a blip. ‘Today’s figures reflect an element of the health of our nation’s children and today’s report isn’t just of interest to people that make health policy, it will be of note to many parents in England.’ Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: 'At long last, a set of obesity figures showing a faint sign of improvement. ‘The Government is right not to be too cocky about it since at least two or three years of similar statistics are required before breaking open the champagne. ‘The country was told in 2008 that childhood obesity was levelling off but that piece of Whitehall spin met an early death. ‘Unfortunately, these figures don't tell the full story - children who are already obese are getting fatter and getting fatter earlier.’ Earlier in the year the Health and Social Care Information Centre revealed only one in three men are now classed as being a normal weight for their height. The figures showed a 'marked increase' in obesity over the last 20 years with 65 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women now classed as overweight or obese.","33.3% of Year 6 pupils are overweight or obese, down from 33.9% last year .

An English student has been forced to drop out of university because she has a potentially deadly allergy to books. Kirsty Ashman’s severe allergies meant that grubby student accommodation and dusty lecture halls and could have killed her. The 22-year-old ended up in hospital after trying to study in the library because dusty books triggered a severe asthma attack. Kirsty Ashman, 22, had to drop out of two universities after suffering more than 15 severe asthma attacks in less than two years and being repeatedly hospitalised . And after trying to study at two universities, Ms Ashman has been forced to give up her dream of becoming an English teacher. Ms Ashman, from Haverhill, Suffolk, said: ‘I was desperate to get a degree and finish my studies, but I had to put my health first. ‘My allergies grew so bad that I lived in fear of libraries and common rooms as even a small inhalation of dust could bring on an asthma attack which would completely shut down my airways. ‘I tried to stay away from areas which could bring on an attack, but there’s so many aspects at uni I couldn’t control all of them. ‘The library and the common rooms were always dusty, the books triggered my allergies and I had to get my friends to get my books from the shelves. ‘I am determined to become a teacher, so I’m studying at home from the Open University - but there’s no way I can study English, there are too many dusty books.’ Ms Ashman is allergic to dust, pollen, mould, grass and some animals. When she was at university, she had a severe asthma attack after opening a dusty book in a library and had to be hospitalised . Ms Ashman first attended Queen Mary’s University in London but lasted only a term as her continual allergy-related health problems meant she spent more time in the hospital than in her halls. She then decided to commute from home to attend Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge, where she survived for nearly a year before a series of attacks meant she was forced to drop out. In two years at university Ms Ashman suffered more than 15 life-threatening asthma attacks brought on by dust, grass, pollens, animals and mould. She said: ‘The toilets and the canteen were always dangerous because the cleaning products could bring on an attack and mean another visit to hospital.’ Ms Ashman suffered from hay fever as a child but her more severe symptoms began at the age of 18 when a chest infection heightened her allergic reactions. When she is at home, Ms Ashman and her family have to vacuum and dust daily, change the hypoallergenic sheets every day and never open the windows during summer for fear of letting in pollen . She said: ‘It’s really hard, I have to battle so much just to achieve normal things. ‘One day I was studying, I’d got my friends to get the books off the shelves in the library as that is normally a danger area for me. ‘As I got the book out of my bag and opened it, it must have wafted a cloud of dust into my face because I felt my airways closing and was struggling to breathe. ‘It was a terrible reaction and I ended up back in hospital.’ Ms Ashman now studies medical sciences with the Open University from the safety of her own home where she and her family have to stick to a strict cleaning regime. They have to dust and vacuum the house every day and also change the special hypoallergenic bed sheets daily. They are unable to open the windows in summer because of the risk of pollen entering the building and they have an air filter to clean dust particles from the air. Ms Ashman feels she has missed out on the benefits of a real university experience. Ms Ashman had to give up her dream of remaining at university but she is now doing a degree from home through the Open University . She said: ‘Older, dustier books trigger my allergies so fewer, newer books definitely minimises the risks. ‘I’ve . not changed my aspirations completely, I still want to be a teacher but . it definitely made me reconsider which subject I taught. ‘My allergies have such a big impact on my life it’s inevitable that they would influence my choices for the future. ‘All my friends have been to university, moved away from home and had an amazing time. ‘They’ve finished their degrees and have already got jobs and I feel left behind. ‘I would love to live away from home but it’s just not practical for me.’","Kirsty Ashman, 22, is allergic to dust, pollen, mould, grass and some animals .

A man claims a botched skin graft has left him with a football-sized hernia sticking out from his stomach. Yves Rivest, 36, says his problems began in 2003 when a rubbish truck ran him over while he was working. He explained that he slid underneath the lorry while it was reversing. The front wheel then passed between his legs and drove up onto his stomach. Yves Rivest, 36, developed a football sized hernia after having a skin graft on his stomach. He needed the operation after suffering serious stomach injuries when he was run over by a rubbish truck . The former sanitation worker, from Montreal, in Canada, was in a coma for three weeks and woke up to find his intestines outside his body. Doctors sealed his abdominal wall but Mr Rivest says the repair failed and he needed a skin graft to cover the wound. Speaking to the Toronto Sun he said: ‘After the accident, the surgeon came to see me and explained my intestines would be in bags for at least a year. ‘Once my intestines healed, they would reattach them, which they did, but it never lasted. ‘There was so much pressure in my stomach that the sutures gave way completely and my stomach began to open.' Mr Rivest now wants surgery to remove the hernia but says surgeons are refusing to carry out the procedure unless he loses weight. He says it is impossible for him to lose weight as the hernia means he cannot workout . Mr Rivest said that he now weighs 17st but that he would only weigh 15st if the hernia was removed . He added that he was left with little skin on his stomach meaning he needed a skin graft from his leg in 2004. However, he says the graft has now turned into the 28in hernia that weights more than 2st. Mr Rivest says doctors are now refusing to operate unless he loses weight - but says he can't lose weight because of the hernia. He explained that he has been told he must not push, pull or lift anything heavy because of the hernia and that this makes it impossible for him to workout. He added that while he weighs 17st now, he would weigh 2st less if the hernia was removed.","Canadian Yves Rivest, 36, was run over by a rubbish truck in 2003 .

WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT One of Britain’s top universities is to overhaul its animal research work after an undercover investigation revealed ‘appalling suffering’ in its labs. Imperial College London, a world leader in scientific research, has admitted that there is ‘significant scope for improvement’ and has pledged to take immediate action. The admission follows footage obtained by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection which showed rats being beheaded with a guillotine and having their necks broken at the end of experiments. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: A rat with a cannula (medical tube) inserted into its body . Rats having their necks broken. The images raised fears about the treatment of larger animals such as dogs, cats, pigs and monkeys in labs around the country . The BUAV, which infiltrated one of Imperial’s labs, also alleged that rats were able to wriggle around during operations, baby rats had their heads chopped off with scissors and that mice were found emaciated and ‘pitiful state’ on a Monday morning. The harrowing images raised fears about the treatment of larger animals such as dogs, cats, pigs and monkeys in labs around the country. They also sparked an independent review, which in a report released today accuses Imperial of complacency and calls for sweeping changes. The review identified a lack of ‘adequate operational, leadership, management, training, supervisory and ethical review systems’ at Imperial, where more than 1,000 people are involved in animal research on four separate sites. It made 33 recommendations for improvements – and said that other universities should also take note. A rat undergoing brain surgery . The panel, headed by Professor Steve Brown, of the Medical Research Council, found that training of scientists doing animal experiments was ‘ad hoc’ and that there was a ‘them and us’ culture between those looking after the animals and the scientists. The review found while the mice and rats well were well fed and watered and kept in modern cages, there were serious concerns about their care during experiments. This included whether research workers always responded rapidly enough to reports of sick animals, so that they could receive attention or be put down if this was necessary. The university was criticised for an over-reliance on agency staff and the ethical committee that reviews applications for new research, evaluates existing projects and looks for ways to reduce the use of animals in future, was described as being  not fit for purpose. The independent experts stressed that their remit was not to investigate the specific claims made by the BUAV, but the general systems employed at Imperial College. They said that all lab animals deserved be treated humanely, even ‘just mice and rats’. The review found while the mice and rats well were well fed and watered and kept in modern cages, there were serious concerns about their care during experiments . Calling for an immediate overhaul, Professor Brown said: ‘Our investigation identified a number of serious concerns on the conduct, management and oversight of animal research at Imperial College. ‘Imperial College is internationally recognised as one of the world’s best research institutes and it is important that this is matched by its standards of animal use and welfare. ‘While our focus has been on Imperial College, the committee’s recommendations should serve as a useful framework for other institutions to review their policies and practises.’ Imperial said it accepts all of the professor’s recommendations, including better training, more staffing, better leadership and more emphasis on finding ways of minimising the use of animals in research. It stressed that it only uses animals when essential for developing new treatments and making medical advances. A spokesman added: ‘The College reiterates its strong belief that the use of animals in research is essential to improve human and animal health and welfare.’ The BUAV said the report’s conclusions were a ‘devastating indictment’ and added: ‘If such criticisms can be levelled at one of the world’s leading universities, then it is inevitable that similar issues arise in research establishments all over the country. ‘It should not take an undercover investigation to expose what is happening in UK laboratories. The system overseeing animal experiments is broken and needs a drastic review.’ Dr Vicky Robinson, chief executive of the  NC3Rs, a government-funded body which looks for ways of reducing the number of animals used in research, said: ‘It is important that words are translated into action through appropriate ethical review, and having the right culture and organisational leadership. ‘As we have seen from the recent investigation even giants like Imperial College have some considerable work to do in this area. This isn’t the time for finger pointing but an opportunity for the scientific community to ensure that it is truly operating at the highest standards when it comes to the difficult issue of research using animals.’ The Home Office, which regulates animal research and inspects labs, is carrying out a separate inquiry into the specific allegations made by the BUAV. The Home Office said it will take action against anyone found to breach animal research regulations.","Campaign group infiltrated Imperial College London lab .

It may look like an aerial shot from a post-apocalyptic film, but this new map shows how London could look if sea levels continue to rise and the Thames Barrier wasn’t there to protect it. Released by the Environment Agency, the map highlights what would happen if the capital was hit by 'severe' tidal surges. Parts of Beckton, West Ham, Whitechapel and Southwark are all shown completely submerged with only a handful of spots across the floodplain escaping the flooding. Scroll down for video . The map, pictured, created by the Environment Agency, shows what east London would have looked like following a 'severe flood' if the Thames Barrier hadn't been built. Parts of Beckton, Whitechapel and Southwark are shown under water . Melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three . feet by the end of the century, according to academics from the European Ice2sea . programme, the British Antarctic Survey and Bristol University. They claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the . British coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of . climate change. If such rises were to take place, London’s current sea defences would . struggle to cope, with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade . Last week storms hit parts of the UK causing the largest tidal surges in 60 years. Around 1,400 homes were said to have been flooded, including 300 in worst-affected Lincolnshire. However, many properties in London were protected due to the Thames Barrier - a 520m-long flood defence system near Woolwich in east London. The movable barrier is made up of 10 gates attached to 39-metre tall cofferdam piles, which are buried 24 metres into the river bed. Individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely. The Thames Barrier, pictured, was opened in 1982 and is a 520m-long flood defence system near Woolwich in east London. Individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely. The barrier can hold back up to 9,000 tonnes of water . In anticipation of last week’s storms, the Thames Barrier was closed on Thursday and Friday to prevent surges flooding the capital. When fully raised, the barrier creates a solid steel wall preventing water flowing upstream towards the capital. The four main gates span 61 metres and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each. Each gate is 20 metres high and can hold back loads of up to 9,000 tonnes. According to the Environment Agency, London is vulnerable to flooding and high tides from surges travelling down from the North Sea towards the English Channel and Thames Estuary. In 1928 fourteen people were said to have died after flooding on the Thames, a further 307 died during the North Sea flood of 1953 and this led to the barrier being built in the late 70s before being opening in 1982. It costs in excess of £16,000 each time to fully close the Thames Barrier but it is regularly tested and closed during high spring tides. The Thames Barrier is the main defence against flooding for London and cover a 520 metre section of the River Thames near Woolwich. The . Thames Barrier has two types of gates: Falling Radial Gates that sit above the river and Rising . Sector Gates which rest on the river bed. Individual . gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes around an house and a half to close completely. When fully raised, the barrier creates a solid steel wall that stops water flowing upstream towards the capital. The four main gates span 61 metres and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each. Each gate is 20 metres high and can hold around 9,000 tonnes of flowing water. The Thames Barrier is only be reopened once the water level upstream of the barrier matches the level downstream. Once a decision has been made to reopen it, a controlled amount of water is passed under the gate and up the Thames.","New map shows how London would have looked following ‘severe floods’

Two grieving spouses who wished to keep their loved ones close, have buried their late partners in their own gardens. Patricia . Waters, 81, wanted to provide her husband with a truly personal send-off and . has had him buried in the back garden of their home - and even . conducted the funeral service herself. Phillip Topham, 56, buried his wife the front garden of their home in Colwick, Nottingham, when she died from oesophageal cancer after 18 years by his side. Pious: Patricia Waters plans to turn the burial plot into a shrine for her late husband . Tribute: Phillip Topham has buried his late wife Catherin in the front garden of their Nottingham home . Patricia Waters decided that she did not want her husband Eddie laid to rest in an 'impersonal' cemetery, so she commissioned an undertaker to dig a plot round the back of their house in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. Mrs Waters, a devout Catholic arranged for a priest to lead the ceremony - but when he was unble to attend, she carried out the service herself. 'I first saw something about home burials in a newspaper more than 20 years ago,' the 81-year-old said. 'Graveyards are so regimented and impersonal - so I thought wouldn't it be nice to be buried at home. 'Eddie . and I were both interested in the idea. I'm just so glad we were able . to do it. It is a great comfort for me knowing he is buried in the . garden.' Burial: Patricia Waters had her husband Eddie laid to rest in their back garden in Kidderminster . Couple: The pair were married in 1986 after meeting when they were both primary school teachers . Home burials are perfectly legal in Britain, under the terms of the Burial Laws Amendment of 1880. As . long as the bereaved party owns the freehold on the land containing the . burial plot, it is not usually necessary to seek any sort of official . permission from authorities. However, there are some environmental . restrictions governing home burials - for example, bodies must not be . interred too near certain bodies of water. In addition, corpses must be buried at least two feet below the soil. Those . considering home burials are advised to contact the police in advance, . as Mrs Waters did, to avoid any suspicion of lawbreaking. Estate agents claim that having a body buried on your property can reduce the value of the home by up to £50,000. Mrs Waters, a former teacher, asked undertakers Edwin Harris and Sons to arrange the burial. Chief executive Mark Bullivant said: . 'The home burial for Mr Waters was very unusual because it is at the . back of a resident house in the middle of Kidderminster. 'It . is certainly the first time we have done a home burial of this kind, in . such a residential area. Normally, it would be a remote house with . acres of land, but Patricia's request was unique.' 'Once . the legalities had been cleared with the council, it was relatively . straightforward. We made sure the spot was appropriate, prepared the . grave and the brought to coffin to the house the night before the . burial.' When the . priest Mrs Waters had asked to attend the service fell ill and could not . attend, she decided to step in and do it herself. 'With my experience as a schoolteacher, carrying out assemblies, I knew I would be able to carry out the service,' she said. 'We had about 15 people here and I had worked hard the night before to organise the traditional readings.' Mr Bullivant said: 'We attended the service, which was conducted in the house by Mrs Waters. It was very moving and she is a very talented lady. 'We then carried the coffin out to the garden where the burial took place.' Tribute: Mrs Waters thought that it would be too 'impersonal' to bury Eddie in a public graveyard . Devout: Mrs Waters, a Roman Catholic, conducted her husband's funeral service herself . Legal: The 81-year-old warned officials in advance that she was planning the unusual burial . Mr and Mrs Waters were married for 27 . years after they met while teaching at a primary school in . Kidderminster, where they occupied classrooms opposite each other. While . home burials are perfectly legal, local officials urged the widow to . warn the police in advance so they would not suspect any wrongdoing. In addition, Mrs Waters checked that her neighbours had no problem with the burial going ahead. 'Not . many people know that home burials are allowed, but it is a lovely idea . to keep a loved one close and I hope that Eddie's grave can become a . religious shrine,' she said. Tragic: Catherine Ann Hopper died of cancer just six weeks after marrying Mr Topham . Mr Topham, whose wife Catherine Ann Hooper died of cancer just six weeks after their wedding, also decided to bury his partner in the front garden of the home in Nottingham. The couple, who had been together for 18 years before marrying, had lived in the house for 14 years. When the pair married Ms Hooper was so ill she needed an oxygen mask to attend the ceremony. She died in hospital on November 14, and last weekend Mr Topham laid her to rest in the garden. Moving: The bereaved husband wanted a special way to remember his late wife . 'Our home was our little castle, we . loved it here, there are a lot of memories, it may not have suited . everyone, but it suited us,' he said. 'She is my sweetheart and I want her close to me always. I don't want her in a field with a load of strangers. 'I don't want her away from me and I don't think she would want to ever be too far from home - our favourite place.

Thousands of survivors of Typhoon Haiyan erupted into wild cheers Sunday to celebrate Filipino boxing icon Manny Pacquiao’s victory, giving them a brief respite from the enormous destruction that the storm brought to the Philippines. ‘It felt like I got my house back,’ said street sweeper Ardel Nebasa, who lost his home in tsunami-like storm surges that ravaged the city of Tacloban on November 8. Officials were hoping that watching Pacquiao’s bout against American Brandon Rios in Macau would help traumatized survivors take their minds off the devastation wrought by the typhoon and inspire them to pick up the pieces from the storm, which killed more than 5,200 people. Gave hope: Thousands of survivors of Typhoon Haiyan watched Filipino boxing icon Manny Pacquiao beat American Brandon Rios in a world title fight . Many jumped repeatedly in joy as they cheered on Pacquiao, who won by unanimous decision to take the WBO international welterweight title. ‘I was so happy and I wanted to cry, but there were too many people,’ said Nebasa, who watched the match with his son and thousands of others on a TV screen set up in a public plaza in Tacloban. ‘It would have felt like another storm has hit if he lost,’ Nebasa said. Another survivor waved a cardboard placard that read: ‘We’re for Pacquiao, God bless, Tacloban will rise again.’ Victorious: People cheer as Pacquiao wins the fight, watching the victory unfold a big screen set up in the city of Tacloban after the storm which killed more than 5,200 people . Promised to visit: Pacquiao dedicated his comeback fight to Haiyan victims, promising to visit Tacloban and outlying regions after winning the international welterweight title . For the people: Victorious, Pacquiao thanked the Filipino people, particularly the survivors and said 'the honour is for you' Take their minds off the devastation: Officials hoped that watching Pacquiao's fight would inspire typhoon survivors to pick up the pieces after the storm . Residents also cheered at Tacloban’s seaside Astrodome stadium, where they watched the fight on a giant screen, their view partly obscured by the light filtering through holes in the ceiling. One man carried a Philippine flag. Pacquiao dedicated his comeback fight to Haiyan victims and promised to visit Tacloban and outlying regions that the typhoon turned into a corpse-strewn wasteland. Interviewed by Manila’s DZBB radio network after his victory, Pacquiao thanked the Filipino people, particularly the typhoon survivors who prayed for him. ‘The honour is for you,’ he said. All eyes on Pacquiao: Filipino troopers, US personnel, aid workers and typhoon survivors watched the fight during a live braodcast at Villamor air base in Pasay, south of Manila . God bless Tacloban: Survivors held placards and signs inciting peace and hope for the future . Traumatised: Many lost their homes in the tsunami-like storm surges that ravaged the city of Tacloban on November 8 . President Benigno Aquino III’s spokesman, Herminio Coloma, said Pacquiao ‘once again united the hearts and mind of our countrymen who are facing intense challenges brought by a series of tragedies that have befallen our country’. Self-made man: Pacquiao rose from poverty to become one of the world's highest-paid athletes . When the bell rang to signal the end . of the 12-round match, many spectators in Tacloban threw their baseball . caps, shirts and pieces of cardboard into the air, even before the . result was officially announced. Tacloban . city folk, Nebasa said, would gladly await the visit of Pacquiao, who . rose from poverty to become one of the world’s highest-paid athletes. ‘We’ll be thankful if he can help us,’ Nebasa said. ‘He came from the ranks of the poor and we identify with him and are happy for his triumphs.’ Hundreds of typhoon survivors and aid workers, as well as several U.S. Navy personnel, watched the bout in a grandstand at Manila’s Villamor air base. In Macau, the 13,000-seat arena at the Venetian, where the fight was held, was packed. Many in the audience were Filipinos who either lived and worked in Macau or nearby Hong Kong, or made the one-hour flight from the Philippines. Some waved Philippine flags, and frequently chanted, 'Manny, Manny'. Businessman Bong Ferrer flew to Macau with a group of 11 others.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 04:27 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:20 EST, 5 December 2013 . A housewife has landed a book deal after writing a steamy novel in secret for the past 14 months. Anna-Maria Athanasiou, 47, originally from Leeds but now living in Cyprus, hadn't even told her husband of 23 years, Marios, that she was penning the book. She told MailOnline: 'I'm not a writer by profession and I felt a bit embarrassed to tell people that I thought I could write a book. My husband works nights so I would write when I was on my own in the evenings or before he got up in the morning.' Secret writer: Anna-Maria Athanasiou has had her first novel published after penning it without telling anyone . Anna-Maria said she's always had a 'big imagination' and had thought about writing a novel for years after getting an idea for a story. She would often scribble down notes and ideas when she was out and about so that various plot threads and conversations between characters ended up being written on any scraps of paper she had handy at the time. She explains: 'The idea for the story came into my head about ten years ago but I never thought about writing it down. Then after my sons got older and I started to have more time I thought I would finally try and write it and I just became absorbed in it and getting it written. Inspiration came at inconvenient times: The mother-of-two would scribble notes on scraps of paper until she finally bought a notebook, left . 'I wasn't very organised though and I would often get inspiration when I was out or driving. I'd have to write things down on bits of paper or old receipts so I could then make sense of it and type it up when I got home. Eventually I realised it would be beneficial to get a notebook!' The mother said her two sons, George, 18 and Michael, 12, knew what she was doing as they often saw her working at her computer but never expected she would become a published author. She describes her book, called Waiting For Summer, as 'erotic but romantic' fiction, saying it contains sex scenes to satisfy Fifty Shades Of Grey fans while having an engaging plot to keep readers hooked on the storyline as well. Exotic location: The book is set in Limassol, Cyprus, and tells the tale of Sylvie Sapphiris whose perfect life is shattered when she discovers her husband is having an affair . It is set in the author's home town of Limassol in Cyprus and tells the tale of Sylvie Sapphiris whose seemingly perfect . life is thrown into chaos by the discovery of her husband's infidelity . and follows her subsequent whirlwind romance with a much younger man. Anna-Maria said she feels the book differs to other romantic fiction on the market as the main character is not a young woman but is in her forties. She welcomes comparisons to Shirley Valentine, which has a similar plot to her book's synopsis, but said it's 'much more unconventional than that'. She wouldn't divulge further for fear of spoiling the plot for readers. Those who are intrigued can find the book in stores or download it to their e-readers now after it has been published by Austin Macauley. A second installment will be published in April. 'Gobsmacked': The writer and her family were shocked and delighted when the book was published by Austin Macauley . The mother-of-two said she and her family were 'gobsmacked' when she found a publisher, which was all thanks to her brother, Anthony. She explains: 'Once I'd finished the book I started to show snippets to my friends and they were all really positive and said I should try and get it published. My mother read the whole book and she agreed. When she told my brother about it he was shocked as he had just been to visit me and I hadn't mentioned it. 'But he then started contacting publishers on my behalf. The big publishers would only deal with literary agents but three smaller ones did get in touch and asked to read more. I was then offered the deal by Austin Macauley. We were all shocked and delighted as it happened so quickly. 'They were all really proud of me. My husband couldn't believe I hadn't told him about it but he was really supportive and said he knew I could do it.' Waiting For Summer is available now from book shops and Amazon.co.uk.

Ariel Castro kept his former wife tied up in his basement and whipped her with dog chains, according to her former boyfriend, foreshadowing the horrific crimes he would later allegedly inflict on his three captives. Fernando Colon, who welcomed Castro's wife Nilda Figueroa into his home after she left her abusive husband, said that the man would viciously kick her in the stomach while she was pregnant. Castro similarly beat his kidnapped victims, Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus, after he raped them and they fell pregnant, according to reports. He has been charged with three counts of rape and four counts of kidnapping after Berry managed to escape the Cleveland home on Monday and alerted authorities to their horrendous plight. 'Abuse': Ariel Castro, left, who has been . arrested for allegedly imprisoning three missing girls for ten years, also locked his wife, Nilda Figueroa (right), in the basement and beat her, a former boyfriend has said . Speaking to the New York Post, Colon recounted the treatment Figueroa, who passed away last year, allegedly suffered at the hands of her former husband. 'He kept her tied up in the basement,' he said. 'He used to whip her with dog chains. She wasn’t allowed to go out... He pretty much kept her locked up in there.' He added that Castro would push her down the stairs and kick her in an attempt to abort her babies. Even after she underwent brain surgery, Castro would hit her in the head, Colon said. Court records from 2005 claim that Figueroa suffered two broken noses, shattered ribs, a blood clot on the brain, a knocked-out tooth and two dislocated shoulders at the hands of her former husband. Beaten: Grimilda Figueroa, pictured in a family photo, allegedly suffered broken noses, teeth and ribs . The documents, which emerged this week, also claim that Castro . 'frequently abducts his daughters and keeps them from mother' and would . frequently threaten to kill Figueroa. 'Former crimes': Ariel Castro was arrested in 1993 for domestic abuse but was not indicted . Colon worked at the hospital where Figueroa was frequently sent for treatment for her injuries and, moved by what he saw, he invited her to live with him and his parents, he said. They went on to have a child, which infuriated Castro and he accused Colon of molesting his daughters. When the case ended up in court, Castro's son said it was lies, Colon said. The judge dropped the charges but Colon still served three years probation. Colon said that authorities once questioned whether he was responsible for the disappearances of the girls, but that he countered they should look at Castro instead. He told the Post that police never followed up on his suggestion. The 2005 filing, which lists Figueroa's injuries, asked the court to . pass a protection order banning Castro from contacting his former wife or their . children and from harassing them. It requested that a judge 'keep [Castro] from threatening to kill [Figueroa]', The Plain Dealer reported, claiming that he had threatened to kill her three or four times already that year. Figueroa's brother, Jose, told RadarOnline that he believes Castro's treatment of his former wife caused her to die. She passed away from brain cancer in April last year. House of horrors: In a photograph taken in 2001, suspect Ariel Castro stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door, which led to the basement where he allegedly kept the girls . 'I believe he murdered my sister,' he said. 'He abused her for years. She had multiple instances of serious head trauma and it created a brain tumor in her head.' Of the treatment, Jose added: 'My sister was in hell living with him. She was trapped there and there was nothing we could do. She was afraid of him.' Police records show that Castro was arrested for domestic violence in 1993, but that a grand jury declined to indict him. But in 1996, she escaped to a woman's shelter with the couple's children, Angie, Emily, Anthony and Rosie. In January 1997, she was awarded full custody of the children. After . the 2005 filing, a temporary protection order was granted instructing . Castro to stay away from the family. It also banned him from owning a . deadly weapon, using drugs or alcohol. In court: Ariel Castro was formally charged with kidnapping and raping the three women on Thursday . Locked up: Castro talks with his public defender, Kathleen DeMetz, during his arraignment on the charges . Castro signed it but it was dismissed two months . later when Figueroa's lawyer was unable to attend a scheduled . hearing in the case due to another court commitment, The Telegraph reported. Speaking to MailOnline, one of . Castro's sons, Anthony, depicted his father as a violent, controlling . man who nearly beat his mother to death in 1993 while she was recovering . from brain surgery. 'Having that relationship with my dad all these years when we lived in a . house where there was domestic violence and I was beaten as well... we . never were really close because of that,' he said. In 1996, Castro was accused of . pulling a fence post from a neighbor's property amid a dispute and the . neighbor's six-year-old daughter later fell in the hole and hurt . herself. Castro, who said in court documents he had called police repeatedly about the neighbor, was ordered to pay $241 in damages. Locked up: Three missing women were found at this home, owned by Castro, in Cleveland on Monday . Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she . vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was . 16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday . Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing . On . Monday, Castro was arrested along with his two brothers after three . women who had allegedly been held captive at his Cleveland home for a . decade were found by authorities. Amanda Berry, 26, who disappeared in 2003, was heard screaming by a neighbor, who helped her escape through a screen door. She used a neighbor's phone to call 911. Gina Dejesus, 23, who went missing in 2004, and Michelle Knight, 32, who vanished in 2002, were also found alive at the home. They were taken to hospital with a six-year-old girl, who was born to Berry while she was in captivity. It appears that his treatment of his wife was just the beginning of the horror he inflicted on women. Police confirmed on Wednesday that they found ties and chains inside the home to restrain the girls, while the victims allegedly suffered miscarriages after being assaulted and then beaten at the home. Probe: Members of the FBI evidence response team carry out evidence from the home on Tuesday . Local police sources revealed that . Ariel Castro would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run . away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried . to run free. This is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling. He also reportedly turned the home into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the back. He used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in.","Castro 'kicked Grimilda Figueroa in the stomach when she was pregnant'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 11 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:13 EST, 11 December 2013 . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius struggled to fend off the latest round of barbs in a Capitol Hill hearing on Wednesday, following revelations that fewer than 365,000 Americans have enrolled for medical insurance through government-run marketplaces – including a federal website that will ultimate cost $677 million. Two months into a six-month open enrollment period that the federal government expected to generate 7 million signups, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services aimed to attract about 1.2 million new insurance customers, according to a September memo released by the House Ways and Means Committee. But as of Nov. 30, just over 137,200 Americans had chosen insurance policies through the perennially afflicted healthcare.gov. And nearly another 227,500 enrolled through the 14 state-run insurance exchanges, whose websites have experienced fewer problems. That puts the government about 835,000 enrollments – or 70 per cent – behind its intermediate target. The pace of enrollment accelerated in November, compared with an even more anemic October rollout that produced just 106,000 new sign-ups. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made her final congressional appearance of 2013 on Wednesday, giving Republicans another chance to grill her on Obamacare's lackluster performance . White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest has tried to shift reporters' focus away from the overall enrollment numbers, and toward the thorny question of how many young, healthy Americans the administration can attract to Obamacare . But the Obama administration isn't saying how many, or how few, of those enrollees have paid premiums. Americans who want their insurance coverage to kick in on January 1 must make their first month's payments by December 23. The final deadline for 2014 policies is March 31. Sebelius declined to say Wednesday how many people have paid those premiums. State-based health insurance marketplaces have far outperformed the federal government's effort, which has been fraught with technical disasters and delays . 'Some may have paid. Some may not,' she told Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Joe Pitts. 'We're giving you the enrollment numbers.' White House Deputy Press Secretary Joshua Earnest hinted to reporters on Wednesday that the Obama administration is no longer focusing on recruiting a specific number of Americans to enroll, focusing instead on balancing the ratio of young, healthy participants with those who are older and more prone to illness. 'What we need is the right mix of individuals in these exchanges,' Earnest said. An additional 1.94 million people have registered for accounts on healthcare.gov and learned their eligibility to enroll, the administration announced Wednesday, but none of them has chosen an insurance plan and there's no indication that they will. More than 800,000 have been declared . eligible for state-administered Medicaid coverage as a result of . shopping on healthcare.gov. Critics point to the number as evidence that . the Obamacare system will produce far more government dependents than . private insurance buyers. West Virginia, . for example, has seen 75,000 new Medicaid enrollments but just 1,200 . new private insurance customers – a ratio of 60-to-1 – according to . state insurance commissioner Nancy Adkins. Under . withering questioning from Rep. Pitts, Sebelius acknowledged that if . HHS were stalled at 365,000 enrollments by the end of December, it would . be 3 million short of its goal. 'That is correct, sir,' she said. But the federal government insists that enrollment rates have continued to rise during the first one-third of December. 'Evidence . of the technical improvements to healthcare.gov can be seen in the . enrollment numbers,' Sebelius told the House Energy and Commerce . Committee on Wednesday. Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn grilled Sebelius on the healthcare.gov website's cost, demanding to know how many taxpayer dollars have been committee to the project's IT costs, and how much of that has already been spent. The Obama administration, the secretary replied, . has 'obligated $677 million' so far, including funds allocated to fix the site's numerous flaws. And $319 million of . that total has already gone out the door, she said. President Obama, fresh from a selfie-schmoozing trip to South Africa, is facing choppy waters back at home as his signature health insurance overhaul law returns disappointing numbers . Blackburn also railed against the administration's habit of using quiet holiday news cycles to announce a pair of new Obamacare delays. In one, the . administration announced on July 3 that a so-called employer mandate would be pushed back by one year. In another, the day before Thanksgiving brought news of a one-year delay for the online small-business insurance exchange. 'What new delays will be coming on Christmas Eve and New Year's?' Blackburn snarked. Michael Hash, the director of HHS's Office of Health Reform, told reporters during a conference call that 'we think we're on track and we will reach the total that we thought.

'As many more Americans learn about the options available to them at the marketplace,' Hash said, 'we have every reason to believe interest will continue to grow and enrollment will continue to rise.' Alan Cohen, the chief strategy officer at Liazon, a firm that provides health exchanges to private employees, told USA Today that the government's numbers have been 'stunningly, dramatically below expectations.' Republicans have continued to hammer away at the White House and HHS over healthcare.gov's performance, including concerns about its capacity for paying insurance companies once Americans purchase their new policies. Not impressed: Expressions from House Energy and Commerce Committee members Bill Cassidy, Brett Guthrie and Morgan Griffith were typical of Wednesday's duel between Sebelius and her Republican detractors . In theory, the website's 'back end' financial processing system also allows consumers to sign up directly with health insurance companies, but government officials have testified in previous hearings that large portions of it have yet to be built. The GOP has also focused attention on the 5.5 million American consumers who have received cancellation letters from their insurers since the Oct. 1 start of Obamacare's open enrollment period. 'Far too many Americans who were happy and satisfied with their healthcare coverage on January 1st of this year have had the worlds turned upside down,' Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan said during the committee hearing, which he chaired. Sebelius, however, insisted Wednesday that 'a lot of individuals who received cancellation notices are thrilled with the choices that are now available to them' through healthcare.gov. The most recent national opinion survey, released Tuesday by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, shows that just 34 per cent of Americans now approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing on the health care issue.","Obama administration projected 1.2 new private insurance customers by the end of November, but produced just 365,000 .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:42 EST, 4 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:25 EST, 4 November 2013 . President Obama has largely dismissed the disastrous launch of healthcare.gov by insisting that consumers can also apply for health insurance on the telephone or via paper applications, but internal notes revealed today show the Dept. of Health and Human Services knew paper applications would be 'stuck in the same queue.' According to notes from inside an HHS 'war room' set up to troubleshoot the website in its calamitous first days, stakeholders were told on October 11 that '[t]he paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provides another option; at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue.' The notes were released Monday by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which obtained them from the Logistics Management Institute, a website contractor, not from the Obama administration. The HHS war room' learned two weeks ago that paper Obamacare applications were 'stuck in the same queue' with attempts to visit healthcare.gov . The main Obamacare website highlights four methods for applying for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but they all rely on the dysfunctional website to determine who's eligible for government subsidies . The committee has subpoenaed HHS for documents like these, since it has so far ignored more polite requests. Contractors for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have to manually enter data from paper applications into the same website that consumers use – the hapless and error-prone site that has been down nearly as much as it's been up since its October 1 launch. Americans signing up for Obamacare coverage on the telephone, or with the help of 'navigators' tasked with providing community-level assistance, face the same problem: Both methods rely on healthcare.gov. And when the site is offline, no one's application gets through. 'The same portal is used to determine eligibility [for government subsidies] no matter how the application is submitted (paper, online),' reads another section of the war room notes. On the same day the HHS war room was advised to tell navigator groups to stop using the Obamacare website and use paper applications, the president emphasized the hand-written approach in a White House Rose Garden speech . On Oct.15 the war room heard that '[n]avigators are seeing people very frustrated and walking away, so they are turning to paper applications to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help, even though paper applications will not have a quicker result necessarily.' By October 21, the navigators were reporting enough problems accessing the website that healthcare.gov team leaders were given marching orders to tell them to stop using it. '[W]e are to instruct Navigators to use paper applications rather than go through the call center,' that day's notes read. On that shat same day, President Obama said during a Rose Garden speech about the problems with healthcare.gov told Americans they could use paper applications. U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, chairs the House Oversight Committee, and has been the most active investigator digging into Obamacare's failures . 'We updated the website's home page to offer more information about the other avenues to enroll in affordable health care until the online option works for everybody,' the president said. 'So you'll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in.' Excerpts from the same war room meetings held earlier in October showed that HHS only enrolled six people in new Obamacare insurance plans on the first day healthcare.gov was open, and fewer than 250 on the second day. But by October 21, one of the contractors tasked with hand-entering information from paper applications reported that it had received 3,000 such requests for health insurance coverage. The Obama administration needs to recruit 7 million new applicants by the end of March, or about 38,500 per day.","At a 'war room' meeting on Oct. 21, website contractors learned that paper applications would be entered into the problematic website .

A woman was locked inside a petrol station because the RBS and Natwest computer crash meant she was unable to pay for her fuel. Laura Grogan's RBS debit card failed when she tried to pay for her fuel, and she claims that although she tried to explain staff refused to let her leave while they waited for a device to empty the fuel out of her car. She had tried to persuade staff that she would return with money if they let her leave, but to no avail. Trapped: Laura Grogan says she was locked inside the Firwood Service Station in Bolton when her RBS debit card failed as she tried to pay for fuel . Ms Grogan even called police to the Firwood Service Station in Bolton, Greater Manchester, She had reported that she was being shouted at and a staff member was refusing to let her leave. When officers arrived they told the cashier that the dispute was a civil matter, and 29-year-old Ms Grogan should be allowed to leave. Choice: The owner of the petrol station said Ms Grogan could have arranged for someone else to pay for her fuel over the phone, or leave her details - but had refused to do either . Her partner Gordon Thomas, 28, said staff used abusive . language towards the mother of two and threatened her, and that she had been badly shaken by the incident. Mr Thomas returned to the garage later that night to pay for his partner's petrol in cash. He said: 'It is disgraceful and totally unacceptable. 'My . partner knew money was in the account and it could have been a problem . with his machines for all he knew when he locked her in. Why he didn't . just take her personal details, registration plate and then let her . leave is beyond me.' The . incident happened at about 8.30pm on December 2, as bank customers . across RBS and Natwest the country were left unable to use their bank . cards after a system crash. Mr Thomas said staff even asked Ms Grogan to leave her new iPhone 5 with them as a deposit for the £25 of fuel. And he claims even when staff discovered the reason the card was not working they would not back down. Mr Thomas said: 'She came home in tears as she understandably felt intimidated at being locked in somewhere by a bunch of men.' 'At the end of the day, she was on her own and we have two kids, who could well have been in the car with her.' Reez Patel, the owner of the petrol . station, said that Ms Grogan had been offered the choice of arranging . for someone else to pay for her fuel over the phone, or leave her . details so a future payment could be arranged - but she had refused to . do either. Abusive: Ms Grogran's partner Gordon Thomas said she left badly shaken after staff threatened her and used abusive language . Last Monday, supermarket trolleys full of food were abandoned, mothers were unable to buy milk for babies and motorists could not purchase fuel as RBS's payment systems crashed completely. Millions of customers were unable to use their debit or credit cards, with some told they had gone into overdraft because payments could not be processed. The computer glitch lasted for around three hours, and affected cash machines, smartphone apps and websites belonging to RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan apologised for the technical problems which plagued 'Cyber Monday', said to be the biggest online shopping day of the year. He blamed it on years of underinvestment into the bank's computer systems, and vowed to 'do better' in the future. The British Government owns 81 per cent of RBS Group, and the IT troubles could harm its attempts to reduce its stake and return the bank to the private sector. Mr Patel . added that staff had been wary to let Ms Grogan leave because the garage . had lost £8,000 through non-payment in the last year, but denied that . she had been locked in. He said that the cashier had not told Ms Grogan the fuel would be removed from her car. He said that when Ms Grogan's bank card had not worked, neither she nor the cashiers had known about the problems with RBS. 'She came into the shop and her card did not work,' the 31-year-old said. 'We give customers options, they can call someone to make an over the phone payment, or fill in a no means of payment form. 'She refused to do that.' He . added: 'Sometimes people do not come back, and the police say it is . just a civil matter so we lose out. Last year we lost £8,000 through no . means of payment. 'We have had to be strict.' Mr Patel said that Ms Grogan had been unable to leave the store because the door lock mechanism, controlled from the cash desk, had caught as it was not closed properly. 'We lock the doors from inside for safety because of the risk of armed robbers,' he said. He said that Ms Grogan had called police after the cashier told her she would have to fill in a form, or arrange for a payment to be taken. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed that officers were called out to the garage at around 8.55pm, after a call from Ms Grogan - who said she was unable to arrange for a payment as she was on another person's phone. The spokesman said that officers had reported that a cashier was being aggressive. 'It is a civil dispute, we were going to address the behaviour of the cashier however,' he said.","Laura Grogan's debit card failed as she tried to pay for her petrol .

The U.S. and China have agreed on a new draft sanctions resolution to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test, U.N. diplomats said. The U.N. Security Council announced yesterday that it will hold closed consultations on North Korea and non-proliferation Tuesday morning. The United States is expected to circulate a draft resolution to the full council at this morning's meeting, diplomats said, after which council members are expected to send the draft to their capitals for review. Threat: The U.S. and China have agreed on sanctions on North Korea after the latest nuclear missile test at a base in Punggye-ri, pictured . Control: The new draft sanctions by U.S. and China are set to punish North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-Un over the nuclear missile launches . All 15 council members approved a . press statement condemning Pyongyang's nuclear test and pledging further . action hours after North Korea carried out its third atomic blast last month. The swift and unanimous response from . the U.N.'s most powerful body set the stage for a fourth round of . sanctions against Pyongyang. For the last three weeks, the United . States, a close ally of South Korea and Japan, has been negotiating the . text of a new resolution with China, the closest ally of North Korea. Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly . Churkin, told a . news conference Monday that a resolution on North Korea might be . approved in March though the text had not yet been circulated. Last month's statement from the . Security Council called the underground test in February a ‘grave . violation’ of three U.N. resolutions that ban North Korea from . conducting nuclear or missile tests. At the time of the successful nuclear . test in February, outgoing US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said North . Korea represented a ‘serious threat’, adding: ‘We’ve got to be prepared . to deal with that.’ Even close ally China was openly . critical, while President Barack Obama said the ‘highly provocative act’ threatened international peace. ‘The danger posed by North Korea’s threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community,’ Mr Obama said in a February statement. On February 12, North Korea announced that . in open defiance of the United Nations it had conducted a successful . underground test at the Punggye-ri nuclear site in the north-west of the . country. Pyongyang made clear that the explosion of the device on February 12 was a warning to the U.S. ‘The . test was conducted in a safe and perfect way on a high level, with the . use of a smaller and light A-bomb, unlike the previous ones,’ North . Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said. ‘If . the US further complicates the situation with continued hostility, we . will be left with no choice but to take even stronger second or third . rounds of action.’ The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions after the first two nuclear tests and after the North's rocket launch in December, which was viewed as part of the country's covert program to develop ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads. The sanctions are aimed at trying to derail the country's rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, barring North Korea from testing or using nuclear or ballistic missile technology, and from importing or exporting material for these programs. The latest sanctions resolution, adopted in January, again demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program and cease missile launches. It slapped sanctions on North Korean companies and government agencies, including its space agency and several individuals. The diplomats said they did not know what new sanctions would be included in the resolution to be circulated Tuesday. There has been speculation that a new resolution will strengthen existing sanctions related to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, toughen financial restrictions and cargo inspections, and add additional companies and individuals to the sanctions list.

This is the horrific moment a zebra foal fell prey to a float of crocodiles after stumbling at the last minute crossing the Mara River in Kenya. The frail youngster had waited with the rest of its herd until it was safe to cross the stream. But when they finally took the plunge, the foal lost his footing in the deeper water and became isolated from the group. Tragic: Almost at the other side of the Mara River in Kenya, this young foal slipped away from his herd and was captured by a preying crocodile . Within seconds, three more emerged from the murky water to pull the foal into their clutches as the rest of the herd could do nothing but flee . Before any of its cousins could turn around, the zebra was pulled into the river by one of the looming tetrapods. It was a tragic end to a meticulous river crossing that lasted almost an hour. Zimbabwe-born amateur photographer Michael Olsen, who captured the event in the Maasai Mara National Reserve described how close the foal came to escaping. Mr Olsen, 60, said: 'It was an incredibly tense situation . in which obviously we were hoping that all the zebra would make the . crossing safely. They nearly did. Waiting: The herd of dozens were at first drinking the water from the river in Maasai Mara National Reserve . Calculating: They had to cross to continue their migration to Tanzania in search of fresh grazing, but spent almost an hour biding their time to move at the right moment . 'It . was quite amazing to watch the way in which the zebra communicated as a . herd when preparing for the crossing and also seeing the ambush . strategy of the crocodiles in action.' Led by a mature zebra stallion, nicknamed 'Captain Courageous' by Mr Olsen, the herd had to cross the river in order to continue their migration to Tanzania in search of fresh grazing. Operating on the principle that there is safety in numbers, the zebras waited until the herd numbers had swelled to a significant number to make the crossing en masse. Captain Courageous: Led by the mature stallion, nicknamed Captain Courageous by amateur photographer Michael Olsen, they eventually made their move . Tightly-formed group: They meticulously filed into the stream close together to form a protective line that would be difficult for crocodiles to break into safely . After patrolling the river bank to find the best crossing spot, 'Captain Courageous' swam to the far shore - then bravely returned to the north bank after realising that the rest of the herd had failed to follow his lead after getting spooked by a hippo. However, the herd committed to the second crossing and they filed into the water in two distinct lines, following each other closely for safety. 'The crocs had taken up ambush positions in the river above and below the crossing point,' Mr Olsen, currently based in Accra, Ghana, said. 'There were a few unsuccessful attempts made by the crocs to grab a zebra and a few extremely close escapes. Two lines: As this group plough through the deep water, others trot further up stream to form a similar line to complete the operation quickly while their predators are at bay . Slipped: But this is the moment a baby zebra at the back of the line lost its footing in the deep water and fumbled to clamber to safety . 'There were also a number of crocs who were certainly trampled under the frenzied hooves of the zebra.' Most of the animals had completed the crossing when suddenly one of the younger zebra foals lost his footing in the deeper water, drifting from the protection of the line. Within a second, the crocodile launched, snapping its powerful jaws over the muzzle, breaking its bones instantly, before dragging the zebra foal beneath the water. Attack: As if out of nowhere, the predator leaps up from beneath the murky water and wraps its jaws around the young zebra's head, despite its attempts to turn away . Moving: Mr Olsen said the moment was difficult to watch as such a young animal fell prey to a calculating crocodile . 'We felt very helpless and sad to see how a vulnerable young animal can so easily become prey,' Mr Olsen added. 'As soon as it became separated from the safety of the crossing line it was attacked - all it took was one mistake. 'We left in a very sombre mood. The reality of nature can be quite harsh. 'The zebra were so focused on surviving the crossing amidst the threat of the crocodiles - they just carried on, while the crocodiles went into a complete feeding frenzy - floating downstream and out of sight like a raft.'","The young animal became isolated from the others at the last minute in the Maasai Mara National Reserve .

After a drawn-out divorce, most women could be forgiven for not feeling entirely charitable towards their ex. But one author channelled her feelings about the end of her own marriage into a slightly more extreme form of therapy – writing the story of a woman who decides to kill and eat her husband. Natalie Young penned Season To Taste after being inspired by the break-up of her ten-year marriage to Peter, the father of her two children. Scroll down for video . Natalie Young's new book, Season To Taste, tells the story of a middle-aged woman who decides to cut up and eat her husband of 30 years. It is set to be one of the most controversial talked about books of 2014 . The macabre novel tells the story  of fiftysomething Lizzie, who decides to kill her husband Jacob after 30  years of marriage. To . save wasting the body, Lizzie also decides to cut it up into 16 pieces – . each of which gets bagged, labelled and stored in the freezer before . being cooked and eaten. Miss . Young, 37, confirmed that the novel drew on her own experiences, . although she took care to point out that she never actually considered . eating her ex. She told the . Mail: ‘With two children to raise on your own it is unbelievably . difficult. You have to deal with the guilt and explain why you left . daddy. The novel, Ms Young's second, is published by Tinder Press, part of Hodder, and is released next month . ‘This book was a way . of unconsciously depicting an extreme aspect of that very traumatic . experience. It was a way of exploring the extreme repercussion of . separation and divorce.’ She . added: ‘It is all too easy to break up without grieving, and this was . about the grieving process that occurs when a marriage breaks up – an . artistic experience of cannibalism.’ While . it may not seem like the most humorous of tales, she revealed that, . astonishingly, her ex-husband managed to see the funny side of the . situation. Miss Young said: ‘Obviously he sees that it came out of our experience. But he thinks that it is really funny.’ Perhaps . unsurprisingly, her darkly humorous interpretation of a marriage . break-up has received mixed reviews from her close group of friends. The . former magazine editor said most of her male friends were horrified by . the concept. However, she . was encouraged by the fact that the majority of her female friends were . hugely supportive, with some even giving her a round of applause when . she first revealed the idea. ‘People love it because it is so real,’ she said. ‘They are reading something utterly disgusting but it is a very human story. ‘It . is very Waitrose, there’s lots of olive oil and salt, she’s got clean . tea towels, and it cuts through into our escapist fantasies. It is not a . bloodbath, it is an emotional and artistic exploration of someone’s . marriage.’ While filled with . black humour, Miss Young stressed that the novel – which is due to be . published next month – still has a serious point to make. She . said: ‘So many women  are trapped in relationships. I do believe women . give more to a relationship than men do. It is in our nature to be . incredibly giving once you have children. ‘Women . in relationships are  so often trying to please men and we allow . ourselves to be exploited and devoured.

North Korea will unveil a multimillion-dollar ski resort to demonstrate that the country - often painted as isolated and poverty-stricken - is as civilised and advanced as anywhere else. Masik Pass, a winter wonderland of luxury chalets, ski runs and sleigh rides, will open to the public on Thursday despite facing a tumult of opposition from Swiss, Austrian and French resorts that refused to provide ski equipment. It is billed as a key feature in the nation's bid to boost tourism as the economy flounders and . civilians suffer one of the lowest standards of living in the world. Multimillion-dollar project: They have set to building ski lifts themselves after Switzerland refused to provide theirs . The complex of ski runs, sleigh rides and luxury chalets are far from finished but will open on Thursday . While few North Koreans could afford a . trip to Masik Pass, near the country's east coast, the leadership could offer visits as a reward for . loyalty or exceptional work - although just 0.02 per cent of the population (5,500 people) can ski. However, supreme leader Kim Jong-un - who fell in love with the sport at . University in Switzerland - has blasted suggestions that it is just a . playground for foreigners the elite in his nation of 24million people. Masik's ski runs cut through the trees, down to two hotels - one eight-storey building for foreigners, and a smaller one for Koreans. Propaganda stands at the base of a ski slope at Masik Pass. The sign reads: 'Full attack. March Forward. Let's Absolutely Finish Building Masik Pass Ski Resort Within This Year By Launching A Full Aggressive War and Full Battle' A construction workers carries bricks to the sound of patriotic music played on loudspeakers around the complex . The signs on the slope together reads 'Burning Hope'. North Korean authorities have been encouraging a broader interest in sports in the country, calling it 'the hot wind of sports blowing through Korea' But three days from its opening, the site is running behind schedule, according to journalists who visited on a press trip late last month. The 'pistes' are currently long stretches of bright-brown dirt dotted with rocks, weeds and patches of stubborn grass. Standing clear among the rubble is a selection of brightly coloured propaganda posters as hundreds of 'soldier-workers' work on the land to the sound of patriotic music. Despite the unfinished state of the resort, officials refuse to budge on the launch date of 10 October - the 68th anniversary of the Korean Workers' party - and workers are 'carrying out their daily quotas at more than 200 per cent,' according to local press. Last month, the complex faced a set back when the Swiss government blocked plans for a company to sell North Korea $7.7m-worth (£4.8m) of lifts and cable car equipment because of new sanctions barring the sale of luxury goods to the North. There will be a 250-room hotel for foreigners and a 150-room hotel for Koreans, 0.02% of whom can ski . North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (centre) blasted claims the resort is just for an elite band of the nation . Kim Jong-un's latest project comes as the South Korea Winter Olympics 2018 looms. He offered the site to their neighbours as a hosting venue, explains Masik's ski chief Kim Tae-yong, but Seoul turned it down. Now, . they have their sights set on turning Masik into a training centre to . produce a North Korean world champion within a few years. So far, it has won only two medals at the Winter Games – both in speed skating. Austrian and French ski-lift manufacturers also have reportedly said no. North Korea's state-run media branded the move a 'serious human rights abuse that politicises sports and discriminates against the Koreans'. Ski chief Kim called it 'a pity', but said Masik Pass would have three functioning lifts this year. 'We can make nuclear weapons and rockets,' he said. 'We can build a ski lift.' Planners foresee hordes of tourists driving to the resort after arriving by plane at a converted military airbase in the nearest city, Wonsan. The resort also has its own heliport. It is part of Kim Jong-un's policy to use sport as an attraction for the nation. Over the past few months, numerous recreational sports parks, basketball courts and inline skating rinks have been erected in Pyongyang. 'All of Wonsan will be turned into a tourist area,' Ri Ki Song, an economist for the Institute of Economy at North Korea's Academy of Social Science, said in a recent interview in the capital. 'It will have a big impact on the economy. We are now trying to build a lot of tourism sites, and skiing is the kind of sport that developed countries enjoy. 'It will also be a place for our own people to use.'","Masik Pass will open on Thursday, despite claims it is well behind schedule .

A woman, from the central Florida town of Longwood, was attacked by a black bear while out walking her dogs (file picture) Lieutenant Alisa Keyes, of Seminole County Fire and Rescue, said: 'She . was out walking her dogs. The bear attacked her. She got away and ran . to a neighbor's house,' Keyes said. 'The bear ran off and they were . unable to locate him.' Karen Parker . of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sent biologists to . the scene to search for paw prints and set a trap, said bears go into . residential areas in search of easily obtainable food. 'It's fall and the bears are trying to fatten up,' Parker said. 'Our big message is remove attractants from your yard.' The . wildlife commission receives the most complaints about bears in the . northeast region of Florida, and the Ocala National Forest in central . Florida, where most of them live, Parker said. The first documented bear attack in FWC's history happened in March 2012. The bear attack victim was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, Florida, 20 miles south of where the incident took place . Terri Gurley, of Seminole County, was bitten by a female bear as she, too, walked her dog one morning. FWC captured and euthanized the 300lb bear nearly a week after the attack. On Monday night, FWC officers and Seminole County deputies searched the area where the bear attacked the woman. 'We've got a little blood trail here,' an FWC officer said. In the past five years, bear complaints more than doubled statewide to 6,189 in 2012, according to a recent analysis of a state wildlife database, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Two of every five calls came from Lake, Volusia, Seminole, Orange or Osceola counties. Still, despite thousands of nuisance calls, wildlife officers move only a dozen bears a year from Central Florida neighborhoods, usually to Ocala National Forest, and euthanize about a dozen more. Experts say that relocation fails about half the time as the bears follow their noses and sometimes find their way back. And, often, other bears take their place. The black bear, Florida's largest native land mammal, was removed from the state's threatened-species list last year. Yet it remains protected in Florida, where it is illegal to purposely injure or kill one. Feeding them also is illegal.","Victim being treated 20 miles away at Orlando Regional Medical .

The polygamist family stars of TV show Sister Wives have won a legal victory after a federal judge ruled on Friday that key parts of Utah's polygamy laws are unconstitutional. Kody Brown and his four wives had fled Utah for Las Vegas last year, under the threat of prosecution. But yesterday, U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups said in the ruling that the phrase in Utah law that forbids cohabitation with another person was a violation of the First Amendment. Relieved: Kody Brown with his sister wives, from left, Meri, Christine, Janelle and Robyn, had fled Utah fearing prosecution . Attorney Jonathan Turley has said that the Brown family had drawn the attention of Utah authorities because of their TLC hit series. The family filed their lawsuit in July 2011, before leaving for Las Vegas last year. Mr Turley, who is based in Washington DC, argued the case before Judge Waddoups in January. Utah's bigamy law is stricter than the laws in 49 other states - most of which prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. Utah makes it illegal to even purport to be married to multiple partners or live together. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Judge Waddoups took a narrow interpretation of the words 'marry' and 'purports to marry' in his ruling. That means that bigamy remains illegal in Utah only in the literal sense, such as when someone fraudulently acquires more than one marriage license. Acceptance: Kody Brown, seen here with his children, welcomed the ruling . Stars: Kody, pictured here with two of his wives' mothers and his own mom, features in the hit TLC show . 'The decision affects a far greater range of such relationships than the form of polygamy practiced by the Browns,' Mr Turley said on Friday. 'It is a victory not for polygamy but privacy in America.' Utah officials had sought to have the suit thrown out. They first argued that the Browns couldn't challenge the bigamy law because they hadn't been charged. State attorneys later argued for dismissal because a prosecutor had pledged not to prosecute them for bigamy. But Judge Waddoups wrote in a 2012 ruling that the promise from the Utah County Attorney's Office appeared to be a ploy to avoid the suit. Mr Brown said in a statement yesterday that the family was 'humbled and grateful' for the ruling. 'While we know that many people do not approve of plural families, it is our family and based on our beliefs,' he said. 'Just as we respect the personal and religious choices of other families, we hope that in time all of our neighbors and fellow citizens will come to respect our own choices.'","Kody Brown and his four wives had fled to Las Vegas fearing prosecution .

As if UKIP leader Nigel Farage hasn't enough on his plate, a BBC glitch saw him appear on screen with a Hitler-style moustache today. Only yesterday, Farage was accused of making racist and fascist remarks during his time at school, with the party leader admitting he did 'push the boundaries of debate' further than he should. And now a pixel fault on the BBC big screen in Media City, Salford, saw the UKIP leader sporting a somewhat unfortunate accessory when appearing on BBC Breakfast this morning. Not a good luck: The timing of the glitch which appeared on BBC Breakfast couldn't have been worse for Farage . Unfortunate comparison: The BBC glitch left Farage sporting something similar to Hitler . Channel Four News broadcast comments from teachers at Dulwich College that the teenage Farage was a ‘fascist’ and a ‘racist’ when a pupil at the private London school in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A letter from 1981 claims Mr Farage, now 49, was even heard ‘shouting Hitler Youth songs’. The claims did not prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school. The Ukip leader last night played down the significance of the claims, which he said were made by left-wing teachers who disliked his views. He denied singing Nazi songs. Sadly this latest, unfortunate error comes just at the wrong time for the embattled Farage. And today marked a new low for Farage on a personal level when he was forced to call for the sacking of friend and fellow party member Godfrey Bloom. Drink it all away: A beer is only a short-term solution to mounting problems facing UKIP leader Nigel Farage (pictured left) The MEP, speaking at an event held to promote women, was heard to say 'This place is full of sluts,' before calling one journalist 'a sad little man' and hitting another with a brochure. It comes barely a month after Mr Bloom's complaint that UK aid money was being sent to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’. Mr Bloom was attending an event at the UKIP conference designed to promote women in politics. He . seemed an unlikely choice, having previously declared that he wanted to . deal with women's issues because: 'I just don't think they clean behind . the fridge enough.' Several female speakers made . reference to the remark at today’s meeting, with one confessing: ‘I too . have never cleaned behind the fridge.’ Mr Bloom replied: ‘This place is full of sluts.’ Outburst: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom said an event to promote women in politics 'full of sluts' before falling foul of Channel 4 reporter Michael Crick (left) Clobber: Mr Bloom hit Mr Crick over the head with the UKIP brochure as they argued about the fact there were no white faces on the front cover . UKIP called . an emergency meeting tonight to discuss whether to kick Mr Bloom out of . the party. The leader does not have the power to withdraw the whip, but chairman Mr Steve Crowther said the remarks had gone too far. And there are further stormy waters ahead for Farage, after another UKIP MEP said he believed rape has 'different levels of culpability' Roger Helmer said he stood by his view that the victim 'shares a part of the responsibility' in some date rape cases. Mr Helmer, who was appearing on Channel 4 News to respond to the Ukip whip being withdrawn from his fellow MEP Godfrey Bloom for calling females in the audience at a conference fringe event 'sluts', insisted 'we in this party respect women'. Questioned about his views on rape, Mr Helmer said: 'I think what we are looking at is the situation where different crimes have different levels of culpability, that's why we have judges, that's why judges apply different sentences for different offences. Mobbed: A media scrum formed around Mr Bloom as the row erupetd over his comments about women at a UKIP event . Anger: The UKIP leadership are furious that Mr Bloom's antics have distracted from the launch of its drive to win next year's European elections . 'We in this party respect women, I'm sorry that we don't live up, or that Godfrey didn't live up to that today.' Asked if he stood by past comments on rape he said: 'Yes I do.' Mr Helmer added: 'I said that there were different degrees of culpability and that is why we have judges who issue different sentences. You would expect a judge trying a murder case to apply the appropriate sentence in relation to the culpability of the person who is accused. 'We are here today at a party conference where we have a whole range of issues and I'm not interested in doing an interview with you over a lot of old ground from way back, I'm much more interested in talking about policy.' Foot in mouth: UKIP's Roger Helmer's quotes on the levels of rape are sure to cause his leader more trouble . In 2011, while a Tory MEP, Mr Helmer described a 'classic stranger rape' scenario, where a 'masked individual emerges from the bushes, hits his victim over the head with a blunt instrument, drags her into the undergrowth and rapes her, and then leaves her unconscious, careless whether she lives or dies'. He contrasted that with a 'date rape', where a woman 'voluntarily goes to her boyfriend's apartment, voluntarily goes into the bedroom, voluntarily undresses and gets into bed, perhaps anticipating sex, or naively expecting merely a cuddle. 'But at the last minute she gets cold feet and says 'Stop!'. The young man, in the heat of the moment, is unable to restrain himself and carries on,' he added.'In both cases an offence has been committed, and the perpetrators deserve to be convicted and punished. 'But whereas in the first case, I'd again be quite happy to hang the guy, I think that most right-thinking people would expect a much lighter sentence in the second case. Rape is always wrong, but not always equally culpable.' Mr Helmer added: 'While in the first case, the blame is squarely on the perpetrator and does not attach to the victim, in the second case the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend's mind.' Mr Helmer defected from the Tories to Ukip in March 2012, claiming Nigel Farage's party better reflected the views of Conservative voters.","Farage was on BBC Breakfast speaking about accusations that he made fascist remarks as a schoolboy .

Good friends like Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard got more credit for their contrary ways and trend-setting ideas, but it was Ray Price who set the precedent for change in country music more than a decade earlier. Price passed away Monday at his Texas home, having long outlasted most of his country music contemporaries and the prognosis doctors gave him when they discovered his pancreatic cancer in 2011. He was 87. The way the Country Music Hall of Fame member fought cancer was an apt metaphor for the way he lived his life, always fiercely charting a path few others might have the fortitude to follow. Scroll down for video . Country singer Ray Price has died at his Texas ranch aged 87 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer . Price was a rommate and drinking partner of country star Hank Williams and took over as frontman of the singer's band following his death . Along the way he changed the sound of country music, collaborated with and inspired the genre's biggest stars and remained relevant for more than half a century. 'Ray Price was a giant in Texas and country western music. Besides one of the greatest voices that ever sang a note, Ray's career spanned over 65 years in a business where 25 years would be amazing,' said Ray Benson of the country music group Asleep at the Wheel. Price, one of country music's most popular and influential singers and bandleaders, had more than 100 hits and was one of the last living connections to Hank Williams, who was Price's roommate and drinking partner. Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum historian Michael McCall said Price 'was one of his generation's most important musical innovators,' popularizing the bedrock 4/4 shuffle beat that can still be heard on every honky-tonk jukebox and most country radio stations in the world. Long career: During his six decades of producing music Price, pictured here 50 years apart in 1957 and 2007, had seven Billboard No. 1 hits and made the country music charts more than 100 times . 'His emphasis on the shuffle rhythm influenced every generation to follow and remains a staple of country dance floors everywhere, especially in the Southwest,' said McCall. Price died Monday afternoon at his ranch outside Mount Pleasant, Texas, said Billy Mack Jr., who was acting as a family spokesman. Price's cancer had recently spread to his liver, intestines and lungs, according East Texas Medical Center in Tyler. He stopped aggressive treatments and left the hospital last Thursday to receive hospice care at home. At the time his wife Janie Price, relayed what she called her husband's 'final message' to his fans: 'I love my fans and have devoted my life to reaching out to them. 'I appreciate their support all these years, and I hope I haven't let them down. I am at peace. I love Jesus. I'm going to be just fine. Don't worry about me. I'll see you again one day.' Perhaps best known for his version of the Kris Kristofferson song For The Good Times, a pop hit in 1970, the velvet-voiced Price was a giant among traditional country performers in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, as likely to defy a trend as he was to defend one. He helped invent the genre's honky-tonk sound early in his career, then took it in a more polished direction. Price (far right) was a pioneer of his genre, introducing the 4/4 rhythm-heavy shuffle to country on his track Crazy Arms which is used by artists to this day . He reached the Billboard Hot 100 eight times from 1958-73 and had seven No. 1 hits and more than 100 titles on the Billboard country chart from 1952 to 1989. For The Good Times was his biggest crossover hit, reaching No. 11 on the Billboard pop music singles chart. His other country hits included Crazy Arms, Release Me, The Same Old Me, Heartaches By The Number, City Lights and Too Young To Die. Price was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1996, long after he had become dissatisfied with Nashville and returned to his home state of Texas. His importance went well beyond hit singles. He was among the pioneers who popularized electric instruments and drums in country music. After helping establish the 4/4 shuffle in country music, Price angered traditionalists by breaking away from country. He gave early breaks to Nelson, Roger Miller and other major performers. His Danny Boy in the late 1960s was a heavily orchestrated version that crossed over to the pop charts. He then started touring with a string-laden 20-piece band that outraged his dancehall fans. In the 1970s he sang often with symphony orchestras - in a tuxedo and cowboy boots. Like Nelson, his good friend and contemporary, Price simply didn't care what others thought and pursued the chance to make his music the way he wanted to. 'I have fought prejudice since I got in country music and I will continue to fight it,' he said in 1981. 'A lot of people want to keep country music in the minority of people. But it belongs to the world. It's art.' In the same 1981 interview, he credited the cowboy for the popularity of country music. 'Everyone loves the cowboy. He's nice, humble and straightforward. And country music is the same thing. The kids have discovered what mom and pop told `em.' Price continued performing and recording well into his 70s. 'I have to be in the business at least five or 10 more years,"" Price said in 2000, when he and his band were doing 100 shows a year. Over his 65-year career Ray Price performed thousands of times including on March 13, 1981 in Nashville, Tennessee (left) and then just a year before his death on January 7, 2011 in Bullard, Texas (right) 'Two or three years ago, we did 182,' he said. 'Fans come to the shows, bless their hearts, they always come.' In 2007, he joined Haggard and Nelson on a double-CD set, Last Of The Breed. The trio performed on tour with the Texas swing band Asleep at the Wheel. 'I'll be surprised if we don't all get locked up somewhere,' Price joked at the time. Over the years, Price came in and out of vogue as traditional country music waxed and waned on the radio. He was a constant advocate for the old days and ways of country music, and more recently re-entered the news when he took offense to comments Blake Shelton made about classic country music that included the words 'old farts.' The dust-up drew attention on the Internet and introduced Price to a new generation of country fans. 'You should be so lucky as us old-timers,' Price said in a happily cantankerous post in all capital letters. 'Check back in 63 years (the year 2075) and let us know how your name and your music will be remembered.' Price earned his long-standing fame honestly, weaving himself into the story of modern country music in several ways. As a young man, Price became friends with Williams, toured with the country legend and shared a house with him in Nashville. His wife Janie gave Price's final message to his fans last Thursday as the singer left hospital, saying he would 'see you again one day' Williams even let Price use his band, the Drifting Cowboys, and the two wrote a song together, the modest Price hit Weary Blues (From Waiting). By 1952 Price was a regular member of the Grand Ole Opry. The singer had one of country music's great bands, the Cherokee Cowboys, early in his career. His lineup included at times Nelson, Miller and Johnny Paycheck. His 1956 version of Crazy Arms became a landmark song for both Price and country music. His first No. 1 country hit, the song rode a propulsive beat into the pop top 100 as well. Using a drummer and bassist to create a country shuffle rhythm, he eventually established a sound that would become a trademark. 'It was strictly country and it went pop,' Price said of the song. 'I never have figured that one out yet.' Price was born near Perryville, Texas, in 1926 and was raised in Dallas. He joined the Marines for World War II and then studied to be a veterinarian at North Texas Agricultural College before he decided on music as a career. Soft-spoken and urbane, Price said in 1976: 'I'm my own worst critic. I don't like to hear myself sing or see myself on television. I see too many mistakes.' He was one of the few who saw them.","Ray Price has died aged 87 from pancreatic cancer at his Texas ranch .

The daughter of the Austin police officer who fatally shot University of Texas Tower sniper Charles Whitman has now joined the Austin Police Department herself. Monika McCoy is the 42-year-old daughter of Houston McCoy, who shot Whitman dead and ended the slaughter that left 17 people dead and 32 others wounded. The mother of two sons says her children had been her priority. Now that they're grown, she says she's pursuing a career path that has been her dream since childhood. Officer: Monika McCoy, daughter of hero cop Houston McCoy, is now an Austin Police Officer . Hero: Houston McCoy killed Charles Whitman, ending the terror at the University of Texas in 1966 . Terror: Whitman killed 17 people while perched in the clock tower at the University of Texas . Monika McCoy was one of 33 cadets to receive their badges on Friday. Her father didn't live to see the day, having died a year ago at age 73. But Monika McCoy says she's sure that he and her mother are proud of her from beyond. Prior to joining the Department, McCoy spent 10 years in the U.S. Army and worked as an accountant, according to the Houston Chronicle. Before completing the Academy, McCoy had to prove that she could complete several different exercises, including a 300-meter run in 63 seconds or less, 33 or more push ups (un-timed), 36 or more sit ups in one minute and a 17-inch vertical jump. Young officer: Houston McCoy (third from left) died in 2012 at the age of 73 . Killer: After his death, an autopsy revealed Whitman had a brain tumor that may have caused him to kill . Whitman entered the University of Texas clock tower on the afternoon of August 1, 1966, armed with several high-powered rifles and enough food to sustain him for days. He then opened fire on the people below. Prior to the clock tower shootings, Whitman murdered his mother and wife before penning a suicide note. 'I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed,' Whitman wrote in his note. 'I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts.'

Francois Hollande secretly underwent prostate surgery and spent a week in hospital during his presidential campaign, it emerged today. The French President was hospitalised for 'several days' in France 2011, but the procedure has been kept secret until now. The revelation raises questions about why the 59-year-old's operation was kept under wraps, particularly as ex-president Francois Mitterrand, died a year after leaving office after concealing his prostate cancer while in office. Secret surgery: French President Francois Hollande underwent a prostate surgery in February 2011 while he was campaigning for presidential candidate . Today the Elysee Palace issued a statement saying: ‘The President of the Republic, Francois Hollande, confirms that in the month of February 2011, he was hospitalised for a number of days in the urology department of the Cochin Hospital’ in Paris. It adds that ‘following this intervention, no further medical attention was judged necessary.’ An Elysee spokesman insisted that the procedure to reduce the size of Mr Hollande’s prostate was ‘benign’ and ‘harmless’. At the time, Mr Hollande was campaigning to become the Socialist candidate for president, and most assumed he was in perfect health. Just over a year later – in May 2012 – Mr Hollande became head of state, but not a word was ever mentioned about his week in hospital. President Hollande, pictured with partner Valerie Trierweiler was campaigning to become the Socialist candidate at the time of his op, but not a word was ever mentioned about his week in hospital . He was specifically treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is also referred to as enlargement of the prostate (BEP). There are a number of surgical methods which can be used to deal with the condition, ranging from removing part of the prostate through the urethra, or using lasers to reduce its size. Today, French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told French radio: ‘There is no reason to be concerned, the President is in good health.’ Trying to explain why the operation was kept secret, Mr Ayrault said: ‘It I have a bad cold in the morning, and I do not invite governmental questions, does it become a political event?’ Families minister Dominique Bertinotti, who was recently diagnosed with cancer, meanwhile called for ‘respect for the intimate’ and said the most important thing was that the government should be allowed to ‘carry on with its mission’. But others pointed to the case of Mitterand, who infamously kept his prostate cancer secret while in office. He died in Paris on 8 January 1996 at the age of 79 from prostate cancer, a condition his medics had never revealed. President Georges Pompidou died while still in office in April 1974, and his blood cancer had been kept a secret.","Francois Hollande underwent prostate surgery in February 2011 .

The single-engine plane went down about four to five miles north of the George Washington Bridge in Yonkers, New York, at about 5:25pm local time on Sunday evening. The plane, a Piper Cherokee PA-32, had suffered some sort of mechanical failure in the air, and the pilot was forced to ditch the plane in the river, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

Scare in the air: The Piper PA-32 plane, similar to the one pictured here, crashed into the Hudson River on Sunday evening . The passengers, a man and a woman, . were both wearing life vests and were safely pulled out of the water by several off-duty Yonkers police officers who had boarded a pilot boat in the area. They were joined by two on-duty EMS workers. They had been in the freezing water for about 20 minutes, police said. The Yonkers Police Department said that it had received numerous 911 calls from witnesses who had seen the plane crash into the water. FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen told MailOnline that the aircraft is now fully submerged in the water. Bergen said the flight was not receiving air traffic control services at the time of the crash. The pilot told local authorities that . the flight departed Trenton-Robbinsville Airport in Robbinsville, New Jersey.

Troy University (AL) linebacker Dimitri Miles, 21, is in jail after being accused by police of shooting dead Marquise McClendon, 26, also of Troy, Sunday morning in an off-campus apartment. It is not clear how both men knew each other, and an officer with the Troy Police Department declined to comment when reached by MailOnline. Shooting death: Troy University linebacker Dimitri Miles (left), 21, has been charged with murder in the shooting death of Marquise Mclendon (right), 26 . Mr McClendon was shot just before 8am in an apartment that neither he nor Mr Miles were a resident of – it is not known if others were present for the incident, and the circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear, according to WAKA. Neighbors told WSFA they heard several shots fired and worried for their safety. ‘It's really shocking because it's usually pretty quiet over here and it's not even a lot of people that stay in this complex,’ Breauna Crayton told the station. ‘It's really something that we all wouldn't expect to happen and it's like it's getting closer to me and it's not really a safe feeling.’ Not allowed to play: Mr Miles was academically ineligible to play this season, but has now been suspended from the team and banned from the school over the charges .

Left behind: Marquise McClendon leaves behind his girlfriend (top right) and these children, it is not yet clear if they are his - but he is pictured with them online . Mr McClendon was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to reports. An investigation quickly pointed to Miles, who was charged with murder and tossed into Pike County Jail on a $100,000 bond. The university then quickly moved to distance itself from him. ‘First and foremost, anytime there is a loss of life it is tragic event and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victim and his family,’ John Hartwell, Troy University athletic director said in a statement to the Troy Messenger. Scene of the crime: The shooting happened at this apartment complex, just blocks from campus . Family man: Mr Miles also has at least one son . ‘Dimitri Miles was a walk-on student-athlete on our football team who was academically ineligible to compete in competition this past season, but practiced as a member of the scout team,’ Mr Hartwell continued. ‘His association with our football team and the Troy Athletic Department has been terminated as a result of these charges which are associated with an incident that occurred off campus,’ said the statement.

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 21:03 EST, 13 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:04 EST, 13 December 2013 . David Cameron has hit out at universities who segregate men and women during lectures with radical preachers, warning the practise must not be allowed. The Prime Minister broke his silence on the controversial policy of seating men and women separately during lectures from Muslim and other ultra-orthodox scholars. Universities last night caved in after Mr Cameron intervened to warn them it was unacceptable.The Prime Minister told Sky News: 'I’m absolutely clear that there should not be segregated audiences for visiting speakers to universities in Britain. ‘That is not the right approach. The guidance should not say that, universities should not allow this. I’m very clear about this.’ Anger: Protesters hold up placards rejecting 'gender apartheid' outside the headquarters of Universities Uk in London last night after their guidelines agreed that women and men can be segregated . Mr Cameron’s intervention came after Education Secretary Michael Gove told the Mail that he believed universities were guilty of ‘pandering to extremism’. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Prime Minister also felt ‘very strongly’ about segregation: ‘He does not believe that guest speakers should be allowed to address segregated audiences, so he believes that Universities UK should urgently review its guidance.’ He added that with segregation came possible ‘risks of discrimination’. ‘There is an important principle here around free speech. There is a long tradition of that in our educational establishments and he (the Prime Minister) thinks that is a very important tradition.’ Universities UK, which represents higher education institutions, buckled under the pressure and last night scrapped its original guidance. It also asked for more clarity from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission [ECHR] over segregation by gender on campus. Anger: The segregation by sex at university talks by visiting speakers has been called discrimination and those concerned say decision will take Britain backwards . Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ‘Universities UK agrees entirely with the Prime Minister that universities should not enforce gender segregation on audiences at the request of guest speakers. However, where the gender segregation is voluntary, the law is unclear. We are working with our lawyers and the EHRC to clarify the position.’ But EHRC chief executive Mark Hammond said it is not ‘permissible’ under the law for universities to segregate by gender in academic meetings that were open to the public. ‘Clearly, a university like any other institution is entitled to provide services and facilities separately by gender where appropriate and lawful - for example, accommodation, sports and targeted welfare provision,’ said Mr Hammond. ‘It is also entirely permissible for a university or other organisation to have private members’ clubs for a single sex. ‘Universities can also provide facilities for religious meetings and associations based on faith, as in the rest of society. Equality law permits gender segregation in premises that are permanently or temporarily being used for the purposes of an organised religion where its doctrines require it. ‘However, in an academic meeting or in a lecture open to the public it is not, in the Commission’s view, permissible to segregate by gender.’ Action: University College London has banned one Muslim group after it found one group had demanded gender segregation . Critics said the confusing guidelines had led to ‘sexual apartheid’ and 9000 people have signed a petition condemning separation of the sexes in lecture halls. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said he was ‘horrified’ and warned a future Labour government would not allow or tolerate segregation in universities. Mr Gove told the Daily Mail this week that the guidance should be withdrawn immediately: ‘We should not pander to extremism. Speakers who insist on segregating audiences should not be indulged by educators. This guidance is wrong and harmful. It should be withdrawn immediately.’ The argument hinges on a hypothetical case study included in the guidance which was published last month. The case study involves an external speaker invited to talk about his orthodox religious faith who subsequently requests segregated seating areas for men and women. University College London hit the headlines in March after a Muslim organisation hosted a debate in which the audience was split into male only, female only and mixed seating.And a lecture at Leicester University in April hosted by the university’s Islamic Society also displayed signage indicating where ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ should sit separately. Research by Student Rights, a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities, said that over the year to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have either explicitly promoted segregation by gender or implied that this would be the case. Six of these were cancelled before they took place, however, the group said. Greek Islamic convert Hamza Andreas Tzortzis was a speaker at the debate at UCL, his spokesman said earlier this year that segregation was informal .","Prime Minister spoke out after Universities UK caused outrage this week .

The families of a young pregnant California woman murdered in Hawaii and her missing boyfriend fear that he too may have been killed. Boaz Johnson, 22, is a suspect in the murder of his girlfriend Brittany Royal, 25, but he has not been seen since before Royal's body was discovered strangled and dumped in the ocean on the coast off Hawaii's Big Island. 'We're definitely concerned that he was also murdered alongside Brittany. It's very possible her body showed up and his didn't,' Boaz Johnson's sister Sarah Johnson said. What happened? Brittany Royal, 25, was murdered in Hawaii in May and her boyfriend, Bo Johnson, 22, vanished and was suspected of killing her. But her family is not convinced he was responsible . 'It just seems all too easy to blame someone who isn't even here, may not even be alive to defend himself.' Royal's body was found in May this year and there has been no sign of Johnson in the seven months since. Neither family knows what to believe and are finding it difficult to grieve without knowing what happened to Brittany and Bo. Brittany . Jane Royal was newly pregnant when she was strangled with rope, . dragged across rocks and thrown into the ocean off Kalpana, Hawaii. Police . initially suspected her missing boyfriend Johnson, but . family members have insisted he had no money to escape or motive to kill . her. Months later, a . local news site received a cryptic note suggesting Johnson, known to his . friends and family as 'Bo', had also been killed amid racial tensions. Now the Royal and Johnson families have been left with little to go on and no further to finding out exactly what happened to their loved ones. 'Whoever killed her does not deserve to be walking around,' Royal's mother Julie told People magazine in a new interview. 'But I feel like I can't really grieve right now because of the not knowing. It's always there. It's always going to be there.' Julie was initially worried about how . trusting her 'free spirited' daughter could be but knew it was right . for Brittany when she decided to go traveling to the Big Island of . Hawaii in January. There, . she met Johnson and just months later they returned to the family home . in Tustin, California to break the news: they were expecting a baby. They also announced their plans for the . future; Brittany said she would work as a yoga instructor while Bo . wanted give lava tours. Missed: Brittany's mother Julie, pictured with her left and as a baby, said she cannot grieve until she knows what happened to her daughter, who was strangled, and who was responsible . Tragedy: Brittany was newly pregnant and looking forward to starting a yoga business when she was killed . 'She seemed finally ready to settle down,' Royal said. But less than three weeks later, Bo failed to turn up to a meeting with a real estate agent and Brittany didn't call her mother to wish her a happy birthday. Days later, on May 28, a fisherman found her body in waters off the island. Unanswered questions: Brittany's family became concerned when she failed to call her mother on her birthday, and her partner missed an appointment with a real estate agent . Police believe Boaz Johnson, the . only suspect in the case, may have stayed in a local hostel two weeks . after Brittany's death using a pseudonym. According to ABC News, . the manager of the hostel said she recognized his face from pictures but . said he checked-in as Jeffrey Allen. But Bo's sister Sarah told the magazine: 'He's not capable of this. He has a good heart. We were taught right from wrong.' Then . to further complicate the case, a news site received the anonymous . letter claiming that Bo had also been killed following racial tensions. The note listed specifics about the alleged murder. Bizzare: Signs have started appearing around the town saying that Bo was murdered on the lava fields . The writer explains that Bo had intended to buy land at Kalapana and conduct lava tours without paying locals a cut of $1,000 a week. 'Haole had to be killed befor (sic) he buy land... said this message 2 haole, stay out of Puna - Puna is for the pono,' the note said. In Hawaii, 'haole' is a term used for Caucasians and 'pono' is a Hawaiian word for righteousness. Posters also began to emerge around the town, reading: 'You killed the baby! They killed Bo on the lava flow! Confess!' Ahead of his disappearance, Bo was supposed to meet with a realtor and was going to sign a deal to purchase 10 acres of land - but he never showed up.

House prices have soared by 5.5 per cent in a year to a new record high, figures showed today. The average home in the UK hit £247,000 in October, as the property market roared ahead as the economic growth took hold. But amid fears of a new housing bubble in London, average house prices in the capital rocketed by 12 per cent and now stand at £437,000. House prices have soared to new record highs, above levels seen before the financial crash . Demand for houses is dramatically outstripping supply, with not enough homes on the market pushing up prices. George Osborne has repeatedly denied that his controversial Help To Buy scheme, where the government guarantees mortgages to allow people to buy with a five per cent deposit, is driving a new boom. In London alone prices are nearly 17 per cent higher than before the financial crisis levels, while in the South East and the East of England they are now around 1 per cent higher than their previous 2008 highs. But not every part of the country is seeing the same levels of growth, with prices in Yorkshire and the Humber up just 0.8 per cent year-on-year and in the North West only 1.3 per cent. A house in London is now typically worth almost three times one in the North East, which has the lowest average house prices at £148,000. On a year-on-year basis, prices in England were up 5.7 per cent to reach £257,000 on average, by 2 per cent in Wales to £164,000 and by 3.3 per cent in Scotland to £184,000. In the year to October house prices rose by 5.2 per cent, up from 3.8 per cent in September . Northern Ireland, which has previously endured year-on-year falls in house prices of around 10 per cent as the economic downturn took hold, recorded a 4.8 per cent annual increase in prices in October. However prices in Northern Ireland are still 50 per cent below their 2007 peak. England remains the only UK country where property prices are above their pre-crisis high and prices in both Scotland and Wales are still around 6 per cent below their 2008 peak levels. Fears of a looming house price bubble have been growing in recent months as a flurry of would-be home-buyers has entered the market following Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy which have widened mortgage availability. Funding for Lending gives lenders access to cheap finance on condition they pass on the benefits of this to borrowers, while Help to Buy gives aspiring home- buyers with deposits as low as 5 per cent a helping hand on to or up the property ladder. But analysts have warned that the supply of homes on the market is not enough to keep up with demand, which is putting upward pressure on prices as the market heats up. There are major disparities between different parts of the country, with prices in London surging by 12 per cent year-on--year . The Bank of England recently took the first step in applying the brakes to the property market by announcing that it is refocusing Funding for Lending away from mortgages and towards helping small businesses borrow. Some experts have warned that this could spell the beginning of the end for ultra-low mortgage rates. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘It is important that buyers plan ahead for potential interest rate rises and ensure they can afford their mortgage once this happens.’ Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist for IHS Global Insight, said the ‘sharp acceleration’ in prices in the ONS figures would fuel concerns of a bubble. He said: ‘There is a very real risk that house prices could really take off over the coming months, especially if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted appreciably further by the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme which was launched in October. ‘Consequently, the decision of the Bank of England and the Treasury to end Funding for Lending support for lending to households from January looks a highly sensible decision.’","Prices rise by 5.5% in the year to October, up from 3.8% in September .

Clocking in: Lord Hanningfield, pictured today with his dog Theodore, has been found clocking in to Parliament for just 20 minutes a day so he can claim £300 in taxpayers' cash . The Cabinet today rounded on a disgraced peer found clocking in to Parliament for just 20 minutes a day so he can claim £300 in taxpayers' cash. Lord Hanningfield, a former Conservative, has dismissed the row as a 'storm in a tea cup'. But Cabinet minister Lord Hill said he was 'dismayed' by the behaviour and the 'shadow' it cast over Parliament. Lord Hill, the Leader of the Lords, said the rules could tightened to prevent the practice amid claims dozens of others peers could be doing the same thing. Lord Hanningfield has been exposed for repeatedly turning up to Westminster just to register his presence before heading home again. On one occasion, he was seen arriving at Westminster before departing the Houses of Parliament 21 minutes later to return home, after checking in with a clerk. Today the 73-year-old insisted he had never made any money from his public work and the revelations about his clocking in was 'a lot of rubbish'. The peer was jailed two years ago for fiddling his overnight stay allowance. His actions caused the parliamentary authorities to scrap overnight allowances. But an expose by the Mirror showed that the peer was still finding ways to maximise his allowance. Members of the House of Lords do not get paid a salary unlike MPs. Instead, they get a day rate of up to £300 for turning up. But rules stipulate they should take part in votes, debates and in committees. Lord Hanningfield was scrutinised for one month this summer during which he claimed £5,700 despite spending fewer than 40 minutes in Parliament for 11 out of 19 days. In the House of Lords today, Lord Hill told peers: 'Like me, Noble Lords will have been completely dismayed to read the reports in the press this morning about the behaviour of a Member of our House. 'Dismayed about the behaviour, and dismayed about the shadow it casts over the whole House.' Amendments to the peers' code of conduct would be examined, Lord Hill said in statement, to allow more discretion to act against members who 'bring the House into disrepute'. There was already action in train to introduce a new sanction of withdrawing financial support and access to facilities from members who breach the code, he pointed out. That is due to be brought forward early next year. Lord Hanningfield . But Lord Hanningfield insisted he had not profited from his role in public life. He said: 'This is a lot of rubbish.

He . told Sky News: 'I’ve done nothing wrong, I haven’t done anything wrong, . I’ve been doing my work. I double check with the finance department all . the time. 'I don't have this money myself, I give it to other people. I've never made a penny out of my public work.' Jailed: Lord Hanningfield was jailed in 2011 for wrongly claiming nearly £14,000 in expenses . Earlier he told the Mirror: 'Clocking in and out of Parliament is only part of being a peer.' The former Essex County Council leader, whose real name is Paul White, also said he had worked 'for 40 years for nothing'. He added that it cost him £150 a day in expenses to attend Parliament so 'I don't really make a profit'. Around half of all peers were doing the same, he added. But turning up to parliament was just part of the Lords' work, he said. Lord Hanningfield was jailed in 2011 for wrongly claiming nearly £14,000 in expenses. The . peer was raking in taxpayers' cash at a rate of £174 a night for . overnight stays in London at a time when he was not in the city. He was released after three months and put on a home detention curfew. On the orders of the court, he has also paid back £70,000 in false expense claims. He has claimed more than £50,000 since returning to Parliament in April 2012. The former leader of Essex County Council, who was stripped of the Tory whip in 2010, said that in July he had been 'trying to get myself back on track' after suffering a breakdown because of the expenses scandal. Since October, he said, he had 'dramatically' upped his contributions in the Lords - speaking twice and attending committees.

Lloyd's: Industry veteran Inga Beale, 50, was unveiled as the new chief executive of the insurance market at Lloyd's in the Square Mile, London . Lloyd’s of London has appointed the first female boss in its 325-year history. Industry veteran Inga Beale was unveiled yesterday as the new chief executive of the insurance market, making her one of the most powerful women in the City. Beale will move into Lloyd’s famous ‘inside out’ skyscraper headquarters in the heart of the Square Mile financial district when she starts her new job in January. She will replace Richard Ward, who announced he was stepping down in July. Beale will be in charge of 900 staff, but will be responsible for overseeing a market with around 90 syndicates and companies. The 50-year-old has more than 30 years’ experience in the industry, most recently as group chief executive of Lloyd’s managing agent Canopius. During her long career she had spells at Prudential, GE Insurance Solutions and Zurich. Chairman John Nelson said: ‘Her CEO experience, underwriting background, international experience and operational skills, together with her knowledge of the Lloyd’s market, make Inga the ideal chief executive for Lloyds.’ Women have been conspicuous by their absence in the upper echelons of Lloyd’s, with Claire Ighodaro currently the only member of its 12-strong board. Beale has been vocal about the need for more diversity in Britain’s boardrooms arguing ‘diverse boards help companies make better decisions, which affect the bottom line’. But she has also said that women have sometimes held themselves back. In an interview in June she said: ‘Some of the time we put our own “glass ceiling” on ourselves because we are not confident in our ability.’ She added: ‘I talk to a lot of women who have been working as I have for 30 years in the industry and we wonder what happened to all those women who started when we did.

As soon as a break comes we tend to get on to a job we hadn’t quite finished and that can make it tough to get on.’ There are currently just four female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies, including Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts, EasyJet’s Carolyn McCall, Imperial Tobacco’s Alison Cooper and Royal Mail’s Moya Greene .

Detectives investigating the killing of a respected marriage guidance counsellor were quizzing her son on suspicion of murder today. Psychotherapist Glennis Brierley, 64, was found with stab wounds inside her terraced cottage after police received a call from a phone box saying she had been killed.

Most people would rather tell a lie or do a bad deed if asked than face the social discomfort of saying no, according to a new study. Researchers said we tend to underestimate the extent to which we can all 'influence someone else's ethical behaviour'. People urged to tell lies or commit minor acts of vandalism were much more likely to do as asked than those who made the request anticipated, they found. The research echoes Stanley Milgram's classic work, which found many more people than participants anticipated were willing to obey a scientist and administer a deadly electric shock. Milgram is pictured here, second from the right, in the 70s . The Canadian authors of the study, from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, said people may agree to do bad deeds to avoid the awkwardness of refusing. Alternatively, people might choose to see such unethical acts as simply being helpful to others or a way to win popularity. 'Instigators failed to recognise the social pressure they levied on actors through simple unethical suggestions, that is, the discomfort actors would experience by making a decision that was inconsistent with the instigator's suggestion,' they wrote. Lead author Dr Vanessa Bohns and colleagues carried out a series of experiments for the study, published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. First they asked 52 students to estimate how many people they would have to approach to find three willing to lie by signing a form saying the participant had given them a verbal introduction to a new course. Participants guessed they would need to ask 8.47 people on average before three agreed but it turned out they only needed to ask around half as many - 4.39. More than nine out of ten students overestimated how many people they'd need to ask. The Canadian authors of the study, from the University of Waterloo (pictured) in Ontario, said people may agree to do bad deeds to avoid the awkwardness of refusing . In a second study 25 participants estimated how many people they'd need to ask before three agreed to vandalise a library book by writing the word 'pickle' inside in pen. Participants thought they would have to ask nearly 11 people on average but in fact approaching just 4.7 people on average was sufficient. Two further studies used hundreds of people recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk online survey website, asked to imagine they were either the 'actor', the 'instigator', or a neutral party in a range of hypothetical scenarios. They included buying beer for underage children, illegally downloading a film and claiming expenses on personal dinners. People playing the actor said they'd feel a lot more uncomfortable if a friend or colleague nudged them toward behaving unethically, compared with advising them to behave ethically. But those playing the instigator or a neutral party did not anticipate this difference. Researchers said this shows we underestimate people's willingness to comply with unethical requests because we fail to take their perspective. The research echoes Stanley Milgram's classic work, which found many more people than participants anticipated were willing to obey a scientist and administer a deadly electric shock.","Study finds people urged to tell lies are more likely to do so than thought .

Three U.S. Marines have been shot dead by an Afghan worker on a military base in southern Afghanistan, in a deadly 24 hours during which six American soldiers were killed in rogue attacks. The shooting took place on Friday night in the Garmsir district of Helmand province, where three U.S. special forces soldiers were killed by an Afghan policeman and his comrades earlier in the day. In the earlier incident, an Afghan police commander opened fire on the U.S. service members after inviting them to a  Ramadan breakfast to discuss security. 'Let me clearly say that those two incidents clearly do not reflect the overall situation here in Afghanistan,' the chief NATO force spokesman, Brigadier-General Gunter Katz, said today.

The three Marines were shot by a base . employee who turned a gun on them, in the third rogue attack in four . days. Foreign military sources said the man had not been wearing a . uniform and it was unclear how he got hold of the weapon.

Members of the Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers stand guard in Laghman province as NATO troops train them in preparation for their withdrawal in 2014 . Last year, a U.S. Army team led by a behavioral scientist produced a 70-page survey that revealed both Afghan and American soldiers hold disturbingly negative perceptions of the other. According to the survey, many Afghan security personnel found U.S. troops 'extremely arrogant, bullying and unwilling to listen to their advice' and sometimes lacking concern about Afghans' safety in combat. They accused the Americans of ignoring female privacy and using denigrating names for Afghans. American troops, in turn, often accused Afghan troops and police of 'pervasive illicit drug use, massive thievery, personal instability, dishonesty, no integrity,' the survey, which has been downplayed by U.S. military officials, said. Victims: Thomas E. Kennedy, 35, left, and Sgt. Maj. Kevin Griffin, 45, were killed in a twin suicide attack in the Kunar province on Wednesday. The troops were assigned to units based at Fort Carson in Colorado . Killed: Walter D. Gray died in Wednesday's suicide bombing attack . Katz said yesterday's incidents were . relatively isolated and were not hurting cooperation between foreign . forces and the 350,000-strong Afghan Security Forces. 'We have almost 500,000 police and . soldiers working together, side by side, enhancing their trust and . enhancing their cooperation in order together to fight for a better . future for this country,' he said. NATO has directed its forces to . increase measures against rogue attacks, including placing armed . 'guardian angel' soldiers on duty in areas where troops gather, such as . gyms and meal halls. Soldiers are also required to travel in pairs in . Afghan base areas and carry weapons at all times. The majority of rogue shootings, Katz . said, were due to personal disagreements between Afghan forces and . their Western mentors, or were due to combat stress, rather than . successful infiltration of the security forces by insurgents. The Afghan military has also placed . intelligence agents within Afghan units to watch for signs of rogue . attacks, with dozens of Afghan police or soldiers moved to other bases . following disagreements with foreign soldiers. 'Together with our Afghan partners we look into procedures, how to mitigate these incidents,' Katz said.

England has been branded the divorce capital of the world with judges free to award generous payments to former partners, a survey has shown. The flexibility given to judges presiding over divorce proceedings in England and Wales means spouses are more likely to receive generous maintenance payments than in 13 other countries, the research finds. The survey examined spousal maintenance payments in jurisdictions across Europe, the US, South Africa and New Zealand. New research has revealed England is the divorce capital of the world  when it comes to generous payments to ex-partners.  In 2008, Heather Mills was awarded £23.4million following her divorce from Sir Paul McCartney . The study, by City law firm Withers, revealed a wide range of issues that judges can take into account when deciding on a settlement, set England and Wales apart from other jurisdictions. London's courts have long been earmarked as the divorce centre of the world following a raft of generous awards to ex-wives. Generous settlements include that awarded to Heather Mills following the break down of her marriage to Sir Paul McCartney 2008. Following the four-year marriage, Miss Mills received £24.3million. Last month Michelle Young was awarded a £20million sum after parting ways with her 'bankrupt' husband Scot Young. In 2006 Beverley Charman, the former wife of insurance magnate John Charman was awarded a £48million settlement by the English courts in proceedings which took two years. Mr Charman appealed the decision but the pay out, which made legal history at the time, was upheld in 2007. The businessman claimed he was penniless and could not afford to pay his ex-wife anything, prompting a bitter dispute after she alleged he was worth millions. Suzanne Kingston, family law partner at Withers, said in other countries judges face more ridged rules dictating the affect the circumstances of the divorce has on a settlement, and the amount and duration of maintenance payments. Michelle Young was awarded £20million last month following her divorce from 'bankrupt' husband Scot Young . She said while common themes were found in the 'most basic aspects of setting maintenance' in some jurisdictions there are 'striking exceptions'. 'And of course, it is these differences that favour certain jurisdictions, such as England and Wales, ahead of others in forum rates on divorce,' Ms Kingston added. In all the areas studied, courts had the power to order maintenance payments on the breakdown of marriage, but in Cyprus, Scotland, Germany and Switzerland, the length of time maintenance can be paid is strictly limited. Most other jurisdictions give judges greater 'scope and independence in their decision-making' but Ms Kingston adds 'England and Wales stands out for the broad judicial discretion it applies in considering all aspects of each and every case'. It is that freedom which 'frequently comes into play when deciding the quantum and duration of maintenance payments'. In Germany the courts use official guidelines, the Dusseldorf Table, when deciding on the size of payments to ex-partners. The formula provides a degree of certainty and predictability in calculating maintenance. The £48million settlement awarded to Beverley Charman, left, when she divorced her insurance magnate husband John Charman, right, made legal history in 2006 . Meanwhile the French take a more informal approach. In many areas the concept of 'fault-based' divorce allows factors including adultery, desertion and unreasonable conduct, to be used as a reason to refuse a claim for spousal maintenance. Ms Kingston added: 'England and Wales has an international reputation as an attractive divorce forum for the financially weaker spouse, and we should be proud of the courts’ efforts to reach a fair result in each and every case.

For years it was a time-honoured tradition: families would wrap a fiver around a milk bottle to thank the postman at Christmas, or slip a few quid to the binmen for a festive drink. But today as few as half of UK households still tip tradespeople at Christmas, a new study has found. Just over a fifth of people tip their hairdresser, while postmen are the next most like trade to receive a festive tip (22 per cent) followed by binmen (15 per cent) and window cleaners (12 per cent). (File pictures) Declining tips: A postman delivering letters (left) and (right) a 16-year-old girl on her paper round putting papers through a letterbox . Milkmen are at the bottom of the list (11 per cent) although this is most likely to reflect the dwindling number of residents who have milk delivered to their door. The older generations are most likely to tip, the study found, with 54.8 per cent of those aged 55 and above saying they tip, compared to 45.3 per cent of 18-24 year olds. But Londoners are the most generous, with 16.9 per cent of those who tip giving more than a tenner, in comparison to 1.3 per cent in East Anglia. People living in the West Midlands are most likely to dip their hand in their pocket for the postman at Christmas, while London residents are more likely to tip their binmen during the festive period than people elsewhere in the country. Budgeting account provider Thinkmoney, who conducted the study, found 15 per cent of people tip their binmen . Of those who do tip, the majority (65 per cent) give up to £10, 6.4 per cent give more than £10 and 28 per cent prefer to give something other than cash, like food or drink. Budgeting account provider Thinkmoney, who conducted the study, suggested the low level of tipping could be due to increasing pressures on household budgets. Ian Williams, director of communications at budgeting account provider Thinkmoney, said: 'The Christmas box is a lovely tradition and a great way to show your appreciation to hard working tradespeople. 'But with household budgets under increasing pressure it is perhaps no surprise that less than half of those we questioned leave a tip nowadays.'","Study finds half of UK households still tip tradespeople at Christmas .

A widower obsessed with his next-door neighbour has been jailed for three and a half years after planting a live nail-bomb in her garden. Father-of-eight Christopher Dooley, 40, began pestering Joanne Dixon, 34, after his wife died aged just 31 from deep vein thrombosis. A court heard Dooley made a T-shirt with a photo of Mrs Dixon printed on it and gave her a Samsung phone after secretly downloading an app on to it to track her whereabouts. He then researched gunpowder on the internet before planted his homemade device outside Mrs Dixon’s front door after which he texted her saying: 'Just had a walk round to yours. Shame that.' Behind bars: Christopher Dooley, 40, pictured left, has been jailed for three and a half years after leaving a homemade nail-bomb on the front doorstep of his neighbour Joanne Dixon, 34. She discovered her three-year-old son Levigh, pictured together right, playing with the device and called police . Mrs Dixon's three-year-old son Levigh was playing with his two older sisters when he spotted the plastic tube, which contained a small bag of nails and gunpowder with a wick coming out, and picked it up. He then unwittingly began playing with it until his mother saw him and took the device away. As she picked it up she saw black powder pour out and called police. Bomb squad officers were called to the house to make the device safe. Police later raided Dooley's home in Preston, Lancashire, and found electrical equipment which had been used to make the bomb plus. They also discovered a towel with black powder residue in his kitchen bin. An expert described it as a 'viable, explosive device'. Dooley sobbed as he was jailed for three and a half years at Preston Crown Court after admitting charges under the Explosives Act of making and possessing an explosive. But Mrs Dixon, also a mother-of-eight, criticised the 'mild' sentence. She said: 'He could have killed us all and the jail term seems very mild, given the effect what he did has had on my kids. Dangerous: Mrs Dixon called police who sent an Army bomb disposal unit to her home. The device was destroyed in a controlled explosion . 'It was the hottest day of the year and . we have been told if the sun had hit it the heat may have been enough on . its own to set it off. We were told it was strong enough to have killed . Levigh and maim any adult who was in a certain distance.' She added: 'I took the package off Levigh and I didn’t know what it was at first, until the powder came out. Then we noticed the tiny nails attached to it. The police operator sounded shocked - they said: ""Put it outside and do it now, now, now"". 'My children were terrified when they realised what they had been playing with. This could’ve injured at least 10 people and would have most definitely killed my Levigh. This man was definitely obsessed with me but I just saw him as a friend and nothing else. 'It’s disgusting what he has put me in my family through and I wish he had got longer in prison.' At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Amanda Johnson said the pair had lived around the corner from each other for ten years but Dooley tried to get closer to her after his wife Christine, a school governor, died in 2010. Mrs Dixon, pictured, criticised the sentence handed to Dooley for being too short . 'She acted as a shoulder to cry on . but began to become concerned that he was developing some sort of . obsession with her,' said Miss Johnson. 'He bought her expensive gifts like a mobile phone, he had a T-shirt printed with her photo on and put an app on her phone to track her whereabouts. 'On the morning of July 13, Joanne saw her son in the front garden playing with what appeared to be a black plastic tube that had a lid. 'It had a wick coming out and a small bag containing nails. She opened the lid and black powder poured out. She was concerned it was a nail bomb.' An Explosive Ordnance Disposal team were called to examine the device and ensure it was safe. They carried out a controlled explosion of the device and no one was injured. Dooley was identified as the culprit after another of Mrs Dixon’s daughters said they had seen him handling the black powder the previous day. Mrs Dixon and her new boyfriend confronted Dooley but he denied any involvement, claiming he had been in all night caring for his children. Dooley’s cleaner later said she had seen fireworks within the kitchen and him pouring powder out of them into a cup. His fingerprints were on the tape of the plastic bag of nails taped to the device. Dooley claimed he had been in a relationship with Mrs Dixon for five months and was 'pestering' her to keep it going - only to find out she had a new boyfriend. Miss Johnson said: 'He accepted he had sent a text and agreed he had been pouring gunpowder into cups and had thrown remnants into the bin. He agreed that he had been researching matters on gunpowder on the internet three days earlier.' She added that the fuse end had been charred as if an attempt had been made to ignite it. In mitigation, defence counsel Peter Turner said: 'These two people have had a relationship. He is not an unintelligent man but he has collapsed inwardly since his wife’s death. He has not been able to go into the living room where she died. Blown to pieces: Components of the bomb after it was destroyed in a controlled explosion . 'He witnessed that, he tried his best to care for her and he has never recovered from it. He is not able to recall lighting the device that he took to her home.' Passing sentence, Judge Anthony Russell QC told Dooley: 'It was your connection with that lady, described as an obsession, that you made that nail bomb from the powder of fireworks and nails placed in plastic bags. 'Nails would have been propelled around, potentially causing serious injury and acting like shrapnel. It was found by children who had played with it before their mother discovered it. 'It may have been you were suffering from depression. The circumstances which your wife died are very sad indeed but they cannot excuse your actions. 'The fact that the device contained nails, was placed in the garden of the dwelling and found by children render the case as serious.' After the case, Det Sgt Martin Pearson said: 'Clearly this was distressing for the victim, whose child found the device. Fortunately no one was hurt in the process.'

Criminals should be allowed to sit as justices of the peace for the first time in more than 700 years, a prominent think tank said yesterday. They should win the right to apply to become magistrates five years after committing their last crime, according to the centre-right Policy Exchange group. The organisation, which has close links to David Cameron, said that appointing former offenders would ‘overhaul’ the magistrates’ courts which deal with 19 out of every 20 criminal cases. Changes: The Policy Exchange group said the changes would 'overhaul' magistrates' courts which currently deal with 19 out of 20 criminal cases . More than half of all JPs are over 60 and the magistracy is ‘overwhelmingly white, middle class and old’, a report by the think tank said. It also recommended that, to help with the turnover of JPs, no magistrate should serve for more than 10 years. This will ‘inject greater innovation and dynamism into the courts system’, the Policy Exchange said. The scheme would sweep away the rule which since the reign of Edward l has insisted that magistrates must be ‘good and lawful men’. But critics said that opening the criminal bench to recent offenders would undermine trust in the honesty of magistrates and introduce the possibility of criminal sentencing motivated by corruption or revenge. Magistrates have wide powers to set fines and community punishments and to hand down shorter prison sentences. They regularly deal with offences such as burglary and they can impose maximum jail terms of six months. But Policy Exchange said former . offenders would be especially well-suited to working in the . ‘problem-solving’ specialist drug courts set up under the last Labour . government, because they will understand ‘complex issues faced by those . with addictions and mental health problems.’ The . report said that ‘there needs to be an overhaul of the magistracy, . which presides over more than 90 per cent of criminal cases. This should . be driven by the involvement of ex-offenders who have turned away from . crime and become respected, positive role models in their communities. ‘The . lay magistracy is overwhelmingly white, middle class and old, with 55.5 . per cent of magistrates over the age of 60 and just 3.2 per cent of . them under the age of 40,’ it added. It . pointed to the drug courts established in some cities from 2004 onwards . as suitable benches for former criminals, where ‘judges and magistrates . take a more personalised approach to solve offenders’ problems.’ Adaptability: The group said former offenders would be especially well-suited to working in the ¿problem-solving¿ specialist drug courts set up under the last Labour government . Max Chambers of Policy Exchange said: ‘We want to see more courts adopting this innovative approach to dealing with crime. Tackling offenders’ issues in court and holding them accountable for their progress is about moving from assembly-line justice to problem-solving justice. ‘Magistrates could be the key to making it happen. They’ve been the pillars of our communities since their creation 650 years ago, but in today’s world whether you’re allowed to become a magistrate has got to be about more than whether you move in the same social circles as other magistrates.’ He added: ‘We need to open this system up to those with first-hand experience of what addiction and the criminal justice system are really like. Who better to help turn offenders’ around and make our streets safer than someone who’s been through it, come out the other side and is now making a positive contribution to society?’ But criminologist David Green of the Civitas think tank said: ‘I do not see what is wrong with experience. It is important that the courts do have experience, which means the wool can’t be pulled over the judge’s eyes, something that is a problem with our courts at the moment. ‘There are good reasons for rules that say criminals cannot be magistrates. If someone has crime in their past it can indicate lack of honesty or integrity. The courts need honesty and integrity, and any sign that they are not there is a good reason for never allowing someone to sit as a magistrate.’ Dr Green added: ‘The Policy Exchange are not giving proper weight to the role of the justice system in society. There must be no doubt that magistrates are not only honest, but that they have a judicial temperament, which means they can put their own views to one side and they will not be tempted to act in vengeance. ‘Other countries don’t have that and it is very important. This report is casual about upholding of appointing judges and magistrates with the right qualities, and for that reason the report is no more than posturing.’ Policy Exchange, which has exchanged a number of staff with Mr Cameron’s Downing Street, launched its report with former Friends sitcom star Matthew Perry, who helps publicise US drug courts. ‘We are increasingly seeing the use of former addicts as magistrates and judges in helping to turn people’s lives around,’ Mr Perry said. ‘Drug courts and sobriety courts save lives and taxpayer dollars,’ he added. Longstanding rules say that people may not become magistrates if they have criminal convictions, including motoring convictions. They can also be barred from the bench if their spouse or partner has a criminal record.","Policy Exchange said convicts should be given the opportunity .

Ministry of Defence plans to increase reservist troops from 11,000 to 30,000 by 2018 to make up for the cuts to the regular army have come under criticism.

John Baron, Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, raised questions about the Government's plans. He told the Telegraph: 'The resulting capability gaps, the strong prospect of fals economies and a substantially older Army suggest the risks far outweigh any benefits.' Earlier this year, campaigners warned controversial plans to replace thousands of full-time soldiers with reservists risks creating a new wave of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim is to reduce the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018 - an army small enough to fit inside Wembley Stadium - while doubling the number of reservists to 30,000. But experts said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's proposals could see a massive increase in the number of troops seeking help for severe psychological trauma. An MoD spokesman said: 'Reservists have always been slightly older than their Regular counterparts, partly because they carry out so many specialist roles that require years of experience. 'However we are transforming our Reserve, strengthening its requirements and reversing its decline over the last decade. 'As part of this we are running sustained recruitment campaigns aimed at young people and are introducing higher fitness and deployability requirements.

If you're tired of having to dispose of your dead Christmas tree year after year, one entrepreneur might have the answer. Peter Inch is offering people the chance to rent a tree for the festive season before re-planting the fir at his Dorchester farm. The businessman has grown 3,000 trees, since setting up his business Rent A Tree five years ago. Rent A Tree is the brainchild of Peter Inch, left, and his wife Jo Hunt, right. The couple have grown 3,000 fraser fir trees at their Dorchester farm . The trees are carefully pruned and tended to by Mrs Hunt and her husband before they are delivered to households across the country at the end of November . Businesses and families across the country can then rent one, with Mr Inch delivering the trees at the end of November. Once he has picked up the trees in the first week of January, they are planted back in the ground in tubs and linked up to a watering system that revives them. The trees are fed a litre of water each day and are carefully pruned by the 52-year-old and his wife Jo Hunt, 42, ready for Christmas the following year. The aim is to reduce the number of people throwing trees away and cut down on the use of plastic replicas that are harmful to the environment. After testing a range of varieties the couple decided to grow Fraser Fir trees, because they don't drop their needles, have a better shape and are hardier than other breeds. Most Christmas trees have roots that grow around three feet into the ground - but Peter's trees have shallow roots so they can be grown in pots. The trees grow between 6ft and 7ft and cost £99 to rent. Mr Inch, pictured with two of the Christmas trees, rents each tree for a set fee of £99. As the festive season draws to an end, he picks up each of the trees, returning them to the farm to be re-planted . The trees are popular with families, including the Evans family, left, and businesses. Right, Gemma Wall decorates the tree rented by Humphries Kirk solicitors in Dorchester . Mr Inch said: 'The idea came from us seeing discarded Christmas trees, we saw people just leaving them in car parks after the festive period. 'We thought it was such a waste so we looked at ways that they could be reused time and time again. 'We tried different types of trees but in the end we settled on the Fraser fir. 'They take about 10 years to grow into a full 6ft sized tree so we purchased some from a grower in Scotland and and set up the business five years ago. 'We have up to 3,000 trees at the farm which are on a drip irrigation system that gives each one a litre of water per day. 'People can rent trees for as little as one or two days or from the end of November to the first week in January at a fixed price of £99. 'They do need to be regularly watered as they are a live plant but because they are alive, they do not drop any pine needles. The Evans family tree is decorated and ready for the festive period, left. And the rented tree at Humphries Kirk stands pride of place in the reception area . 'We drop the tree off and collect it at the end of the season before placing the pot back into a bigger container in the ground. 'It's much more environmentally friendly than simply discarding trees and people don't have to worry about what to do after Christmas now.' The rented trees have been an instant hit with families and businesses snapping up all 3,000 trees this year. Darrell Stuart-Smith from Humphries Kirk solicitors in Dorchester said: 'When I went down to the Rent a Tree farm it was a real delight to see how they care and restore the trees. 'We get so many compliments on our wonderful Christmas tree, it's absolutely beautiful. 'It has a real story behind it that we tell people when they come in and it's lovely to know that we are supporting the environment.'","Rent A Tree is the brainchild of Peter Inch and his wife Jo Hunt .

A set of vintage posters from the 1940s has been found hidden underneath a tatty old carpet in a run-down property and they are now expected to go for £15,000 at auction. A property developer discovered the fascinating set of vintage posters from the golden age of British rail travel underneath a carpet in a house he was renovating. The posters, which are in mint condition, date back to the late 1940s and advertise seaside resorts around the country that could be visited by rail. It is thought the collection of 10 posters belonged to a railway worker who used them to line the floorboards of his house in Edinburgh around 60 years ago. Discovery: This staycation poster from the 1940s, which attempts to entice travellers to visit Southend-on-Sea, was one of ten found hidden underneath the carpet of house being renovated . Retro: The posters, which advertise locations around the UK which could be visited by rail in the 1940s, are all in near perfect condition . Despite being worthless then, the posters are now much sought after - and experts have tipped to sell for upwards of £1,500 each. Many were issued by the British Railway Executive, the nationalised body that went on to become British Rail. Resorts featured include Southend-on-Sea, Blackpool, the Isle of Man, Brighton and Hove and a string of destinations in Norfolk. They are in such good condition that experts suspect they were never put on display. The collection is tipped to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer at Onslows in Blandford, Dorset. The anonymous seller said: 'We were clearing out an end terrace property that we had just bought in Edinburgh in preparation for refurbishment. 'It was an old-style house that was badly in need of modernisation. To our surprise, as we were ripping up the carpets, we found this set of posters underneath. Visit Brighton & Hove: Each of the ten posters discovered by a property developer in a house in Edinburgh is expected to fetch upwards of £15,000 at auction . The new Brighton: This poster issued by British Railways attempts to lure tourists away from Brighton to Wallasey in Cheshire . 'It’s quite common for people to put newspaper underneath carpet to stop dust coming up through the floorboards but one previous owner opted for something more robust. 'I’ve found plenty of unpleasant things under old carpets but never something like this of historical and monetary value.

Channel 5's Big Brother reality shows have sparked the most complaints to TV watchdog Ofcom this year - almost 1,500. The year's ten most complained about programmes have outraged almost 5,000 viewers in all so far. But as yet, Ofcom has taken hardly any action over the most controversial screened incidents. The June series of Big Brother triggered 965 complaints and August's Celebrity Big Brother a further 438. Complaints: Courtney Stodden is evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother house at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire . Racy: Lady Gaga's performance on the X Factor helped make the show the second most complained about TV programme of 2013 . Viewers were outraged by housemate Jemima Slade getting an ‘unjustified' official warning for saying black men are not her type. Ofcom received 305 complaints in June that Slade, 41, had been 'unfairly accused of racism'. Slade had said: 'I do go for younger guys, generally. I go for darker looking, not black, but darker features, more like Mediterranean.' Big Brother said her language was 'unacceptable and potentially offensive'. A further 244 viewers complained that Gina Rio had bullied fellow housemate Hazel O'Sullivan. Rio shouted at the Irish model: 'You're a pain in the a**e, a homewrecking whore, a dirty a**e skank, an ugly and disgusting cheap little tart.' And another 166 viewers complained to Ofcom over scenes shown of boxer Daley Ojuederie fighting with O'Sullivan. Sixth in the list of most complained about shows was ITV's Britain's Got Talent with 422 . Shocking: The murder of Emmerdale . character Gennie Sharma sparked a flurry of complaints . Ojuederie was removed from the . Hertfordshire house for what Big Brother branded 'threatening and . aggressive behaviour' towards O'Sullivan. He . had slapping her bottom and clasped his hands around her neck while . they were on a bed. Ofcom is currently investigating all three . controversial incidents and will publish its findings in the New Year. Celebrity Big Brother also courted controversy amid claims of ‘animal cruelty' on the show. Viewers complained after they watched U.S. reality TV star Courtney Stodden put her toy, stuffed bunny rabbit through a mangle. It . is not the first time that the Big Brother shows have faced potential . action from Ofcom. The 2012 Big Brother series also ran into trouble . with the organisation over claims of bullying. Controversial: Rowan Atkinson as the Archbishop of Canterbury, backstage at the filming of his sketch for Comic Relief 2013 . More than 1,000 viewers complained about Conor McIntyre's expletive-laden tirade at fellow contestant Deana Uppal. He raged: at her: 'Get your epilator and stick it up your a**e. We don't give a f**k! Stick it up her f**king m**ge, stupid b**tard.' He later added: 'I'm gonna play loads of pranks on her. F**king piece of s**t, I don't give a f**k if I'm pulled up to the Diary Room.' ITV talent show X Factor was the second most complained about programme so far this year. Ofcom received 734 complaints about the series with 317 sparked by Lady Gaga's racy performance on a results show in October. She writhed around on stage in a nude-coloured bra and pants to her songs ‘Venus' and ‘Do What U Want'. But Ofcom ruled that her saucy antics had not breached the Broadcasting Code. BBC News was the eighth most complained about programme in 2013, with 354 complaints. Sophie Raworth is the BBC newsreader pictured here . Ninth was ITV drama Downton Abbey with 252 complaints, 246 of which related to the rape of Joanne Froggatt's character, lady's maid Anna May Bates . Completing the top ten list of shame was ITV soap Coronation Street, which attracted 225 complaints over the year . Ofcom also took no action when Louis . Walsh's dramatic change of heart sparked the most complaints - 1,345 - . to Ofcom of any TV incident in 2012. A . producer was seen whispering in his ear during a live sing-off and . Walsh then sent Carolynne Poole packing instead of rival Rylan Clarke. Ofcom . ruled that viewers knew that the ultimate decision to eliminate . contestants or force a 'deadlock' situation 'rests with the judges'. ITV News was the third most complained about programme this year. Its coverage resulted in 574 complaints, 278 of them over graphic footage showing the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May. The single most complained about TV incident so far this year was Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of the Archbishop of Canterbury on Comic Relief in March. Atkinson's foul-mouthed parody sketch attracted 487 complaints - but again Ofcom ruled that it was not unduly offensive. The BBC's ‘Comic Relief: Funny for Money' programme was the fourth most complained about show of 2013 with 492 upset viewers in all. Next came the Celebrity Big Brother series with 438 complaints. Sixth was ITV show Britain's Got Talent during 2013 with 422. Of these, 162 of these related to a risque performance by pop star Jennifer Lopez but Ofcom decided against investigating it. ITV soap Emmerdale prompted 376, of which 193 were about the murder of character Gennie Sharma before the 9pm watershed. Serial killer Cameron Murray was shown smothering her with his bare hands but Ofcom ruled the coverage was not in breach. Eighth was BBC News with coverage generating 354 complaints over the year. Ninth was ITV drama Downton Abbey with 252 complaints, 246 of which related to the rape of Joanne Froggatt's character, lady's maid Anna May Bates.

Arsonist Karl McGarry, 25, was tasked with petrol bombing a drug rival's car as part of an ongoing feud between two traveller families . An arsonist burned his own head when his 'Russian-style' hat set alight as he tried to torch a rival drug dealer's car. Things then got worse for Karl McGarry, 25, when he also managed to set fire to his getaway vehicle. Liverpool Crown Court heard that McGarry had become embroiled in a 20-year feud between two traveller families in St Helens, Liverpool. A member of the Price family ordered him to firebomb two cars but when he leaned through one of their windows, his furry hat ignited. Unaware that the headpiece was on fire, he got into his getaway car, setting that alight as well. McGarry, who worked as a ‘full time . drug dealer’ in St Helens, Merseyside, was later recorded on a police . bugging device, complaining about setting his Russian hat on fire. Another voice could be heard laughing: 'That was when you had that big mark on your head, weren’t it?' Liverpool Crown Court heard the Price family was trying to control the supply of class A drugs in the town and had previously been known to petrol bomb and fire shotguns at the Maughans. Eight of their gang were jailed for a total of 97 years last week for drug, firearm and arson conspiracies. Prosecutor Neville Biddle told the court how McGarry arrived at the home of Patrick Maughan, a leading member of the gang, at around 11pm on July 30, 2011. Mr Maughan was not there but his wife, who had just put their children to bed, looked out of the window and saw what happened. Fire: McGarry, circled in red, can be seen setting fire to a second car just metres from a family home in St Helens, Liverpool . Mr Biddle said: 'A car pulled up to the house and two men got out. 'The windows of the cars were smashed and some sort of lighter fluid or petrol poured into the cars and they were set on fire. McGarry was wearing a Russian style hat and he set himself on fire. 'The two men were observed to get into the Volvo and drive away in a blaze of flames.' Father-of-two McGarry, from Knotty . Ash, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to arson, conspiracy to supply class A . drugs and burglary and was jailed for six years and eight months. Oops: But McGarry's furry hat catches and alight and sets his own getaway car on fire . Stephen Swift, defending, said he was ‘utterly and completely out of his depth’. Judge Denis Watson, QC, said: 'The context is of a feud between the members of the Price family and the Maughans. 'That feud had begun very many years earlier but the origins of the rivalry is not clear. 'Since March 2010 there had been a steady escalation of violence. It had become nothing short of a vendetta.'

Children of the 1960s and 1970s will be worse off than their parents when they retire, economists warn today. The post-war trend for each generation to be richer than the last may be coming to a halt, they said. Workers aged from 34 to 53 are being punished by inadequate pay rises, dire pensions and crippling housing costs. With meagre savings, their only hope of a comfortable retirement is a large inheritance. 'The economic fate of the 1960s and . 1970s cohorts may be relatively dependent on the fortunes of their . parents,' says a report published today by the Institute for Fiscal . Studies. A study published today by the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies found workers aged from 34 to 53 are being punished by the current economic climate (picture posed by models) Just 28 per cent of . people born in the early 1940s have had, or expect to have, an . inheritance. For those born in the late 1970s, the figure jumps to 70 . per cent. The report also found that family finances have been battered over the past decade. Between . 1974 and 2002, households saw income – earnings and benefits – grow by . an annual average of 1.5 per cent. Since then the rise has been a paltry . 0.1 per cent a year. The . IFS says the household income of 1960s children was typically £615 a . week by the age of 40. But those born in the 1970s are on only £570 a . week, adjusted for inflation. Home ownership is also on the wane, the IFS said, with the picture being 'strikingly different' across the generations. Two thirds of Londoners born in the . 1940s were on the property ladder by the age of 40. The same is true for . less than half of those born in the 1970s. (File picture) Economists have warned children of the 1960s and 1970s will be worse off than their parents when they retire . (File picture) The report found home ownership is also on the wane, with the picture being 'strikingly different' across the generations . The IFS says the household income of children born in the 1970s is only £570 a week, adjusted for inflation . Young workers think their retirement plans will be rescued by a large inheritance, the Institute for Fiscal Studies found. Of the richest third of people aged 30 to 39, a total of 35 per cent expect to pick up at least £100,000. For those currently in their 50s, the figure falls to just 10 per cent. The institute's researchers said it was 'a natural consequence of the sustained economic growth seen over the post-war period' – with each generation having more wealth to pass on than the one before. Even among the poorest third of society, 12 per cent aged 30 to 34, and 9 per cent aged 35 to 39, expect to inherit £100,000 or more. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'The reliance on inheritance looks like a recipe for disappointment.' Where a man expects to inherit £100,000 or more, there is a one in two chance his spouse expects to receive the same amount. The . report says a 'rapid switch' away from well-funded company pension . funds has hurt those born in the 1960s and 1970s. Their parents were . often big beneficiaries of such schemes. In conclusion, the institute warns: . 'Individuals born in the 1960s and 1970s have no higher take-home . income, have saved no more previous take-home income, are less likely to . own a home and are likely to have lower private pension wealth. 'They . will also tend to find that their state pensions replace a smaller . proportion of prior earnings than is the case for those currently above, . or around, the state pension age.' Andrew . Hood, one of the report's authors, said: 'Since the Second World War, . successive cohorts have enjoyed higher incomes and living standards than . their parents. 'Yet the incomes and wealth of those born in the 1960s and 1970s look no higher than the cohorts who came before them. 'As a result, younger cohorts are likely to have to rely on inheritances to be better off in retirement than their predecessors. 'But inheritances are unequally distributed, with households that are already relatively wealthy far more likely to benefit.' Prospects for those in their teenage years or 20s could be even worse. A report by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, which was appointed by David Cameron, says they are on track to become the first in more than a century to be materially less well off in adulthood than their parents. Ashley Seager, of the Intergenerational Foundation, which campaigns for fairness for future generations, said those 'unlucky enough' to be born after 1970 were suffering from the combined effects of 'intergenerational unfairness'. But Ros Altmann, a leading pensions expert, said she was sceptical about the findings and said there were 'false expectations' as to how poor future generations will be when they retire.","Workers aged from 34 to 53 are punished by the economic climate .

Canoe fraudster: John Darwin, 63, of Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, is due to be questioned on suspicion of breaching the terms of his early release . Canoe fraudster John Darwin was arrested last night moments after flying home from a trip to find a Ukrainian bride. The 63-year-old, jailed for six years for faking his death for a £500,000 insurance payout, is due to be questioned on suspicion of breaching the terms of his early release. A warrant is understood to have been issued for his arrest alerting police at all ports and airports to detain him on his return. He was apprehended at Newcastle airport. The apparent parole breach means he is likely to serve another nine months in jail — meaning he will spend Christmas behind bars. Darwin was not supposed to leave the UK without official permission but travelled to Ukraine last month for a date with Anna Avramenko, 25. They met through a foreign brides website for women seeking a rich husband. Miss Avramenko dumped him after finding out about his past and labelled him a ‘sex-starved criminal’. The Ministry of Justice has said Darwin, granted parole in 2011, can expect to be returned to jail for the breach of parole. He broke the conditions of his early release by travelling the 1,700 miles from his home near Hartlepool to visit Miss Avramenko in the industrial town of Sumy. The tall blonde said she agreed to meet Darwin after he bombarded her with sleazy messages, which included requests for a threesome and boasts that he could ‘satisfy any woman’. Apparent parole breach: A warrant is understood to have been issued for his arrest alerting police at all ports and airports to detain him on his return. He was apprehended at Newcastle airport (file picture) He claimed hundreds of women wanted to meet up with him and said he had received 240 messages in one day, she said. It is unclear which travel documents he used to visit Ukraine as it was thought his passport was not due to be returned until next March. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Any offender subject to licence supervision is required to gain permission from probation to travel outside of the UK. 'Permission is only granted in exceptional circumstances. Any offender who travels without this permission will be subject to recall to custody.’ Miss Avramenko, who has a six-year-old daughter, said that during a three-month email exchange, Darwin told her that one of his favourite hobbies was kayaking. Fraud: Darwin (left) was declared dead in 2003, after apparently drowning. His family claimed the insurance money, yet all the while he was living in a hidden part of the home he shared with his then wife Anne (right), 61 . He also allegedly tried to persuade her to sleep with him by saying Westerners often have sex on the first date. 'Sex-starved criminal' How Anna Avramenko described Darwin . Darwin was declared dead in 2003, a year after apparently drowning on a canoe trip. His family claimed the insurance money, yet all the while he was living in a hidden part of the home he shared with his then wife Anne, 61. The swindle deceived the police, a coroner, a number of financial institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony. The couple moved to Panama but in December 2007 Darwin walked into a London police station claiming he had amnesia. He survives on a pension of £138 a week in a £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew near Hartlepool.

A book advising newly-wed women how to behave advises: 'It's true, you're not yet an experienced cook or a perfect housewife. What's the problem if he (your husband) tells you so? Tell him that he is right, that it's true, that you will learn. On seeing your sweetness and your humility, your effort to change, this will also change him.' It sounds like an extract from an outdated Fifties handbook but it is in fact from a recently published book that's become a bestseller in Italy and Spain. 'Cásate y sé sumisa', meaning 'Get Married and Be Submissive', is the title of the self-help tome that calls on women to be 'loyal and obedient' to their husbands. Step back in time: A new book advises women to try and be the perfect housewife in order to please their husband . Another of its pearls of wisdom explains: 'If you only do what is right for you, what you think, then you are not married to a man, you are married to yourself. Instead of doing that, you should submit to him.' It is already causing controversy with feminists and politicians who have called for it to be banned and one women's group staged a protest in Spain where they ripped up copies. Controversial: The book advises wives to be loyal and obedient to their husbands . One reviewer on Amazon commented: 'What an insult, a real setback for the struggle of women and men in favour of equality.' What has riled many even more is that the book is written by a woman - Italian author Costanza Miriano, 43. A devout Catholic married with four children, her book is based on the teachings of St Paul and has been published by the Archbishop of Granada's printing press Editorial Nuevo Inicio. In an interview with El Huffington Post, she said as well as turning to the Bible, she based her advice on the happy marriages of herself and her friends. She defended her work saying it was well-received when it was first published in Italy in 2011 and she can't understand why Spanish woman are so offended after it was translated and published in Spanish this year. She said: 'I never said that women should get married in general. I said that some women, my friends, just those, they should get married (in fact, now the majority have done so). Because I know and I know that to them that is the way of happiness. And anyway, not just women, men too, of course. 'Women and men together. I believe that at the bottom of the human being there is a sense of emptiness that fills only giving themselves completely to someone. This is the way of happiness.' She added that a submissive woman will have a happy marriage because: 'Submissive is the way to make room, to accept, to be put under as the columns of a cathedral, as the foundation. Not a dirty word: Author Costanza Miriano believes the key to wedded bliss is submission . 'Of course you can be happy. Because man is seduced by the beauty of a woman, able to support, to be a mother to those she meets. And then he can win his enormous selfishness, which is the default male.' The book states 'we [women] like humiliation because it is for a greater good' but Miriano rejects criticism that this incites violence against women. She said: 'If disturbing is the word submissive, then burn all copies of the Bible. In that case it will be an honour for me to go to the stake. 'That there is an incitement to violence against women is a pure madness... I reject violence. I respect the fifth commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"".'","Self-help book advises women to be 'loyal and obedient' to their husbands .

The European Union and Turkey have signed agreements which could see the possible lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens travelling to Europe. The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the signing today as a ‘milestone’ in relations between his country and the 28-member bloc. Under the agreements signed in the Turkish capital Ankara, Turkey would in turn, agree to take back immigrants who illegally enter the EU from Turkish territory. Milestone in EU relations: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivers a speech during the Turkey-EU readmission agreement signing ceremony . The deals on visa-free travel and the re-admission of immigrants come weeks after the EU resumed membership negotiations with Turkey that began in 2005 but have been stalled for more than three years, mainly due to Turkey's dispute with EU-member Cyprus and scepticism in some European nations on admitting a populous, largely Muslim country into the group. The EU is refusing to start negotiations in eight policy areas until Turkey opens its ports and airports to goods from Cyprus. The island was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Turkish Cypriots in 1983 declared an independent northern state, which is only recognized by Turkey. Signing ceremony: Mr Erdogan (centre) speaks to Turkey's Foreign Affairs Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (left) and EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom (right) after the signing ceremony today . Turks have long complained about . onerous visa demands from European nations that were designed to . restrict Turkish citizens from flooding labour markets. Prime . Minister Erdogan said Turkey was no longer an exporter of labour and . that the country's dynamic economy over the past 10 years meant that the . country had now become a destination for jobseekers. Mr Erdogan said during the signing ceremony: ‘No one should be concerned when the visas are lifted. ‘We are not a country that is a burden [to the EU] but one that takes away its burdens.’ Easier for immigrants: The agreement could mean that visa restrictions will be lifted, allowing Turkish citizens to travel without restrictions to EU countries . The agreements foresee a deal on the lifting of visa restrictions within 3 years but Mr Erdogan said he hoped it can be done much sooner. The EU resumed negotiations with Turkey in November despite human rights concerns and its criticism over a police crackdown on this summer's anti-government demonstrations. An EU report on Turkey's progress toward membership criticised Mr Erdogan's government for what it called its ‘uncompromising stance’ against dissent and its failure to protect fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and assembly.

Comedian Jim Davidson has been told that he will not be prosecuted over a claim that he assaulted a woman while he was on a trip to entertain troops in the 1980s . Comedian Jim Davidson has been completely cleared of sex assault allegations. The former Generation Game host said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ after learning yesterday that he won’t be charged over an alleged offence in the Falklands Islands. It comes four months after the Crown Prosecution Service ruled he shouldn’t be charged over ten alleged sex offences in the UK. Mr Davidson told the Daily Mail: ‘I’ve always refuted the allegations in both the UK and the Falkland Islands. Now the authorities have decided there will be no further action in both cases.’ ‘I’m particularly pleased about the Falkland Islands because there is no place I love more. I’ve been there at least eight times, it is a special place and the people there are wonderful.’ The Falklands claim made by a woman dated from the 1980s when Davidson visited to entertain troops. In August, officers from Scotland Yard told the 60-year-old that he would face no further action after he had spent eight months on bail following his arrest on suspicion of sexual offences. Prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence in relation to ten allegations. He was first arrested in January by detectives from Operation Yewtree, the national investigation sparked by the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, and re-arrested in March after further allegations emerged. Details of the allegation in the Falklands emerged in May. The investigation was carried out by Yewtree detectives on behalf of the Royal Falkland Islands Police, which has only 16 full-time officers. Critics have claimed Yewtree has become a runaway train, with an ‘arrest first, gather evidence later’ policy. Scotland Yard chiefs insist it is ‘fair and proportionate’. Davidson was first held in January by detectives from Operation Yewtree, the national investigation sparked by the Jimmy Savile (pictured) abuse scandal . A file on the Falklands case was sent . some weeks ago to the islands’ Attorney General, Mark Lewis, who . consulted lawyers before deciding Davidson should not be prosecuted. Had Mr Lewis authorised charges, the five-times married comic would have had to travel 8,000 miles to stand trial. Davidson’s . solicitor Henri Brandman said last night: ‘My client, Jim Davidson, is . delighted to have received news today that there will be no further . action relating to an allegation of an historic sexual nature in the .

An ex-policeman was sacked from a council’s anti-social behaviour combat team after he repeatedly flicked a female colleague’s ears, a tribunal heard yesterday. Debbie Chadwick-Edgar turned and punched Ian Napier after one incident – but then lodged a grievance that he had ‘assaulted’ her. She also accused teammates of shunning her – and admitted calling them ‘f****** b******s’. Ian Napier lost his job with the anti-social behaviour team at Swindon Borough Council (pictured) after colleague Debbie Chadwick-Edgar complained he repeatedly flicked her in the ear . Mrs Chadwick-Edgar, 52, said Mr . Napier, a former firearms officer, flicked her on the ear or the back of . the head up to 12 times over five or six weeks. Mr Napier, 60, later lost his job with the anti-social behaviour team at Swindon Council and went on to claim unfair dismissal. His . former colleague Mrs Chadwick-Edgar, a housing officer seconded to the . team, was called as a witness for the council at Bristol Employment . Tribunals. Mr Napier, who represented himself, asked her when their . working relationship broke down. Mrs . Chadwick-Edgar replied: ‘Our working relationship changed when you hit . me on the head or flicked my ear. It was behind me and I jumped and I . instinctively punched you. Ms Edgar-Chadwick said she instinctively punched Mr Napier after he flicked her ear. She claims he flicked her head or ear 12 times over six weeks . ‘I . was uncomfortable with my own behaviour and uncomfortable with what you . did.’ Mr Napier then asked: ‘Do you agree there was a lot of banter, a . lot of horseplay, within the team?’ She . replied: ‘It was never play. I don’t understand who would play in the . office by physically assaulting another person, because that’s what it . was to me.’ Mrs . Chadwick-Edgar said she broke down in tears and later lodged a written . complaint about the ear-flicking and Mr Napier ‘goading’ her. The council held a disciplinary hearing following her punching of Mr Napier, but she was found to have been provoked. Tony . Howell, who had worked with the team, told the tribunal he had also had . his ears flicked by Mr Napier. Asked why he did not make a formal . complaint, he said: ‘If you knew that it upset me you would have done it . even more.’ Simon Evans, the team’s former line manager, told the tribunal he felt like a ‘nanny between a lot of children’. The tribunal heard that Mr Napier was dismissed for his conduct after an investigation by Swindon council. But . after hearing that other staff were highly critical of the authority’s . handling of the dismissal, employment judge Paul Housego ruled that the . former policeman had been unlawfully dismissed.","Ian Napier lost job with anti-social behaviour team at Swindon Council .

Most voters fear they would be worse off or have made no progress under Labour, according to a damning poll. Six out of ten Britons believe they would be poorer or no better off if Ed Miliband's party was in power today. The findings are a major blow to Mr Miliband as Ukip leader Nigel Farage claims he is now taking more votes from Labour than the Tories in key marginals. Blow: Despite Labour accusing the government of a 'cost of living crisis', most voters do not think they would be any better off under Ed Miliband's party . Some 32 per cent felt they would be poorer if Labour had won the 2010 election and 31 per cent thought they would be 'much the same'. Just a quarter believed they would be wealthier under Mr Miliband. Labour's lead over the Conservatives has narrowed to just four points, down from six in a previous poll. The main opposition party is now on 39, while the Tories are on 35 per cent with UKIP on 11, ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 9. The poll showed that Labour is trailing on economic credibility. Some 42 per cent believe the country would be worse off economically under Labour, with just 21 per cent disagreeing. The YouGov poll for The Sun shows how the Labour leader's vow to ease the squeeze on the cost of living is failing to resonate with voters. Coalition ministers have tried to outflank Mr Miliband's most eye-catching policy of freezing energy prices by matching it with a pledge to roll back green taxes. If Labour had won the last election . How would the economy be doing under Labour? Shoppers stocking up on everything . they need for a Christmas dinner face paying up to 28 per cent more than . they did just three years ago. The . price of turkeys, potatoes, cakes, wine and chocolates have risen . several times faster than wages, hitting families in the pocket. Labour claimed the figures means there will be 'real worry' about the cost of celebrating this year, and accused the government of failing to boost wages as the economy recovers. Figures compiled by Labour show how the price of festive favourites have risen dramatically. Poultry has soared by 14.6 per cent since May 2010, hitting anyone planning to serve traditional turkey on the big day. Even . more alarmingly potatoes have soared by 28.1 per cent, more than double . the rate of inflation of 12.7 per cent over the same period. However wages have risen by just 6 per cent since the election. Anyone . with a sweet tooth will also feel the pinch, with biscuits and cakes up . 21 per cent and sweets and chocolates 18.3 per cent more expensive. The cost of a Christmas tipple has also risen, with wine and spirits up 14.5 per cent. But privately, senior Tories believe that voters will put a party's competence to steer the country out of recession ahead of populist policies. The government has been stung by criticism that despite a return to economic growth most people feel no better off. Wages have risen by a fraction of the increase in prices. But . yesterday Chancellor George Osborne seized on figures from the Office . for National Statistics showing that  average earnings were now keeping . pace with inflation. He told the Commons Treasury Committee: ‘It shows that median gross weekly earnings are increasing at 2.2 per cent. 'That . is, of course, the current rate of inflation. So I think that points to . the broader argument that I have been making, which is that as the . economy recovers, that is the route to a sustained increase in the . living standards of the people who live in that economy, and you can't . pretend that the two aren't connected, that you can have a living . standards plan without an economy plan.’ UKIP Leader Nigel Farage also revealed that his party was taking more votes from Labour than Conservatives in marginal seats. He said he wanted to overturn the myth that by voting UKIP, the country would let in Labour by the backdoor. A poll to be released next week would 'really stun people' he told LBC Radio. 'It's going to show that in most of our target constituencies the vast majority of our votes are not coming from Conservatives. 'Yes, we get Conservative votes but we're picking up huge numbers of old Labour votes from Birmingham and Northwoods but we're also picking up a lot of votes from people who have given up voting completely,' he said. Mr Farage added: 'The idea of ""vote UKIP, get Miliband"" is wrong and there are now some marginal seats in this country where actually the only Party that could beat Labour is UKIP.'","32% think they would have been poorer if Labour won the last election .

Google was accused of trying to avoid British justice yesterday after it claimed that UK courts had no jurisdiction to put it on trial for privacy breaches. The search engine is accused of bypassing security settings on Apple iPhones, iPads and computers to track users’ web browsing without their knowledge and send them targeted advertisements. A group of British internet users has launched legal action against the firm for breach of privacy. Google appealed to the High Court to have the case thrown out claiming action should have been taken in America where its headquarters are. The company's New York office is pictured . But yesterday Google appealed to London’s High Court to throw out the case, arguing that the British claimants should have launched their action in the United States as that’s where the firm is based. Its headquarters are based in Silicon Valley, California, although it also has three offices in London and one in Manchester. The move, branded ‘arrogant’ by the claimants, will fuel anger over Google’s attempts to avoid regulation in overseas markets. The company already avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking UK profits through its European headquarters in Dublin. Antony White QC, acting on behalf of Google, told the court on the first . day of a two-day hearing: ‘It’s not enough to say ‘the claimants are . here and they would like to sue here’. ‘It’s not a starting point . where the claimants are, or where the claimants have their computers, . or that they suffered their distress here. ‘The defendants are there (in the US), its witnesses are there, its documents are there.’ But speaking outside the court, a spokesman for the claimants Jonathan . Hawker, said: ‘Why should ordinary British people have to travel to . California to seek justice? 'Google breached British people’s privacy in Britain. It has offices in the UK, it employs staff in the UK, and it makes a lot of money in the UK. The company already avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking UK profits through its European headquarters in Dublin (pictured) ‘Clearly, if it operates here and makes a profit here, it should answer . to English law, but it wants to act in whichever way it wants, wherever . it wants. ‘This is a point of principle for us because we believe you should abide by English law, no matter how big you are. 'It should answer to English law, but it wants to act in whichever way it wants, wherever it wants.’ ‘Google has more than enough resources to fly its documents and its witnesses over here.’ The test claim is being brought by British internet users . Judith Vidal-Hall, former editor of Index On Censorship magazine, Robert . Hann, director of an IT security company, and Marc Bradshaw, director . of an IT services company – part of a group called Safari Users Against . Google’s Secret Tracking. Apple’s search browser Safari was designed to block software that allowed Google to track what users were looking at online. But . between summer 2011 and spring 2012, Google disabled this safeguard and . monitored people’s internet surfing habits without their knowledge. Claimants allege the company bypassed security settings on iPhones to track their web browsing habits . Google . has already paid out a total of £24.2million to US states and the US . Federal Trade Commission for the same privacy breach. The . claimants argue that Google acted directly contrary to a 2009 amendment . to a EU Directive which required consent before an internet user’s . device could be tracked for behavioural advertising. They say the . company was able to collate a wealth of information on users, from . their their shopping habits to more personal details about their . physical and sexual health, political affiliations, union membership, . financial situation and sexual interests. It then targeted them with advertisements based on the websites they had visited, causing them ‘embarrassment and distress’. Mr White claimed the information obtained was ‘not personal’, so Google had no obligation to keep it confidential. But he appeared to admit that its targeted advertisements were irritating. He told the court: ‘If you have a car parked on your driveway you might get a flier through for a local garage. ‘It’s irritating, it’s unwanted and it is unsolicited but does it cross that threshold, my submission is that it doesn’t. ‘Another example is in my inbox I get unsolicited emails every day. ‘There might technically be a European court action to stop that but you cannot claim damages just because of that.’ He . said he anticipated any damages awarded at the end of proceedings would . be ‘very modest’ and said the nature of the allegations suggested any . breach of privacy had been ‘a nuisance’, rather than serious. But . the claimants’ barrister Mr Hugh Tomlinson QC dismissed the comparison . to junk mail, saying: ‘We say there are very serious and important . issues which relate to how Google, a corporation of immense wealth and . power, deals with private information and the individuals who use their . services. ‘We wholly reject the idea these are trivial and . uninteresting claims sounding in trivial sums and the court should not . entertain them.’ The claimants’ solicitor Dan Tench, said: ‘Google . has a history of making it difficult for people to take legal action . against them. ‘They may be hoping the claimants will drop the case if is heard in America. The proceedings were heard before Mr Justice Tugendhat at The High Court (pictured) ‘Or they may be hoping they will be treated more favourably in America, even if they were tried under English law.’ Google . pointed to a similar US case launched by members of the public. It was . shut down in October when a judge said users had not come to any harm . even if they were tracked. A spokesman said: ‘We’re asking the . court to re-examine whether this case meets the standards required in . the UK for a case like this to go to trial.’ The proceedings were heard before Mr Justice Tugendhat, sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice’s Queen’s Bench Division. The hearing concludes today.","Search engine is accused of bypassing iPhone security settings .

A child protection detective tried to . poison his colleague by switching his Powerade drink with screenwash after . becoming ‘fed up’ when his drink kept getting stolen, a court . heard today. DC Gary Quigley, 46, filled the 500ml . bottle of sports drink with the potentially deadly blue liquid in a bid . to catch the thief and ‘teach him a lesson’, jurors heard. Detective Constable Steve Halfhide . experienced a ‘burning sensation’ in his mouth and throat and repeatedly . vomited after swallowing the noxious substance, Southwark Crown Court . heard. Describing the moment he drank the screenwash, DC Halfhide said: . 'I swallowed two mouthfuls.I instantly felt burning in my throat and then I was physically sick into the sink.' 'I then went into one of the toilets and I was sick.I still had the burning in my throat. 'I obviously wasn't aware at the time of what it was I had. I was quite anxious and a little bit panicky.' He drank milk and brushed his teeth to get rid of the taste and counteract the effects before pouring the rest of the liquid down the sink. 'I then decanted most of the bottle down the sink,' he added. 'It didn't look any different (to Powerade). It smelled to me like undiluted screenwash that was quite concentrated.' DC Halfhide insisted he was unaware of any food or drink going missing or any issues between him and other staff. 'It was a good office', he told the jury. Quigley later told an officer . investigating the incident that it was his bottle and that he had . emptied one of his energy drinks and replaced it with screenwash. He told how he was ‘fed up’ with his bottles of drink being stolen and that he had ‘caught the thief’, jurors heard. The detective said he was ‘dismayed’ when two drinks were earlier stolen from a communal fridge and insisted his ‘sole intention . was to catch the thief', rather than to cause him or her any harm. He claimed he forgot the bottle was in the fridge as he had been busy at work, jurors heard. In interview, Quigley said in a prepared statement: ‘I admit fully and accept all culpability for my actions. Quigley is said to have tipped screenwash into a Powerade bottle later drunk by Det Con Steve Halfhide, right . ‘I am extremely sorry and deeply remorseful for what has happened. It was never my intention to cause any injury to anyone.' Mr Halfhide was advised to go to . hospital after drinking the screenwash on 29 January last year but escaped serious injury, jurors heard. The pair were based at police offices . in Stratford, east London, but did not know each other, said . prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward. She said: ‘The allegation in this case is the . defendant replaced the blue Powerade drink in a sports-style drinking . bottle with screenwash and put it back in the communal fridge in the . office he worked. ‘He says his motive in doing so was . the belief the drink was his, and that the person who had been stealing . his drinks would be taught a lesson. ‘In fact, his colleague Steve . Halfhide had the misfortune also to be a drinker of Powerade, and to . have stored his own Powerade drinks in the fridge. ‘When he drank from the Powerade in . question, he swallowed a mouthful or two of screenwash before . experienced the very unpleasant consequences.’ As Mr Halfhide poured the liquid away into the sink, he smelt it and recognised it as screenwash. The jury at Southwark Crown Court, pictured, heard that Mr Halfhide went to hospital after drinking the liquid . Ms Ledward added: 'Subsequent analysis . of the blue liquid that was left in the Powerade bottle from which Mr . Halfhide drank shows that it contains a number of volatile substances, . also detected in a control sample of screenwash from the (Child Abuse . Investigation) office, including ethanol and various types of industrial . solvents. 'Although no analysis could be . carried out for it, most screen washes contain ethylene glycol, also . commonly found in antifreeze. 'Ethylene glycol is toxic if ingested in sufficient quantities.' Ms Ledward added: ‘The prosecution . say that whether this drink was in fact DC Halfhide’s, or whether he . thought it was, or even if he was stealing DC Quigley’s drink is . irrelevant. ‘This was a dangerous and completely disproportionate thing to do in the circumstances. 'The defendant clearly intended that someone should drink from it or at least must have foreseen that someone might - that was precisely his purpose' - Prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward . ‘By deliberately disguising the blue . screen wash in a Powerade bottle and placing it, unlabelled, in the . communal fridge, the defendant clearly intended that someone should . drink from it or at least must have foreseen that someone might -that was . precisely his purpose.' She added: ‘At the very least, he must have intended that the person should be annoyed by suffering an unpleasant experience. ‘Even if he honestly believed that . anyone who took his drink was stealing it, to replace that drink with at . best an unpleasant substance, at worst, one that had the potential to . be dangerous, was not a reasonable thing to do in the circumstances.’ While Quigley was awaiting trial, he . contacted the drinks manufacturer, Coca Cola Enterprises, to check where the bottle could be traced to, the prosecutor added. Quigley, from Colchester, Essex, denies a single count of administering a poison or noxious substance with intent. The trial, which is expected to last three to four days, continues.

Nick Clegg yesterday accused the Tories of wanting to ‘pull up the drawbridge’ to EU workers as plans for a new migrant cap began to disintegrate. Documents leaked at the weekend suggested the Home Office wanted to limit the number of workers arriving from the rest of the EU at 75,000 a year. The idea drew a ferocious response from the Liberal Democrat leader who claimed it was ‘illegal’, ‘unworkable’ and would be a ‘disaster’ for UK business. Anger: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg tore into the Home Office for leaking 'illegal' ideas instead of focusing on exit checks . And last night Downing Street appeared to agree that, under the EU’s current free movement rules, a cap would be unlawful. Asked . whether David Cameron agreed that a cap on overall EU immigration would . be ‘illegal and undeliverable’, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman . said: ‘There are clear free movement laws. We have to operate within . those.’ He added: ‘As the . Prime Minister has said, do we need to look at free movement? Yes, . because, as he said, there shouldn’t be  a freedom to move to claim . [welfare benefits].” Home . Secretary Theresa May, under heavy fire over the leaked idea, also . indicated the idea was open to revision. She suggested that, rather than . focusing on all EU migrants, the target of any new government crackdown . could be new member states. But . a poll released last night showed Mr Clegg’s position is not shared by . the overwhelming majority of the British public – and restrictions on . free movement of EU workers would be supported. In a survey for the . British Future think tank, only 15 per cent of voters said they were . ‘comfortable’ with the EU’s free movement directive and thought it was . ‘good for Britain’. Tough: Senior Conservatives including Home Secretary Theresa May and PM David Cameron have promised further restrictions on immigration . Tensions are rising at Westminster, with Romanians and Bulgarians due to get open access to the UK jobs market next month. Mr Clegg, at his regular Westminster press conference yesterday, attacked the idea of a cap. He . said: ‘It would be very unwelcome to the 2million or so Brits who live . and work abroad, who I don’t think would thank the Conservative Party . for entering a tit-for-tat race to the bottom where everybody in the EU . starts pulling up the drawbridge. ‘My . advice to the Home Office is to spend less time leaking policies that . are illegal and undeliverable and spend more time delivering on the . policies we have agreed as a Coalition – notably to reinstate exit . checks.’ An announcement on re-instating the counting of people leaving the UK is expected soon.","Lib Dem leader says Home Office should focus on reinstating exit checks .

Music teacher Andrew Turner, 38, went into sudden anaphylactic shock after he ate the bread with some soup while at a friend’s house in the Vale of Glamorgan. Today his family told of Mr Turner's death as they warned other allergy sufferers to take care when staying away from home over Christmas. Andrew Turner, 38, died from a fatal allergic reaction after eating a piece of bread that contained nuts . Speaking from the family home in St Donats, near Cardiff, Mr Turner's mother, Claudette, father, Ian, and brother Anthony, said he had always been 'very careful' to avoid nuts because even smelling them on people’s breath would make him ill. But he had no idea there were nuts in the wholegrain bread when he dipped the crust into the soup.  Mr Turner went into sudden anaphylactic shock and paramedics were unable to save him. Mrs Turner described her son's death on 26 November as a 'terrible tragedy'. She said: 'Andrew was always very careful after being diagnosed with the allergy at the age of three. 'We suspected a horse hair allergy and when he was tested they found one for nuts as well, but Andrew was always very sensible child and he took great care with what he ate. 'He could even smell nuts on people’s breath - and would feel unwell as a result.' Mr Turner, who had just accepted a new job teaching music, was always extremely careful with his allergy . She said her son had been so careful about his allergy that the question of carrying an epipen, used by those with allergies to administer a rapid dose of adrenalin, 'simply never arose'. Music teacher Andrew had been tutoring part time in Swansea but had recently accepted a new job in Cardiff. A spokeswoman for Anaphylaxis UK, a charity that raises awareness of the dangers of allergies, warned people to be especially vigilant over Christmas.

Neil Scarborough (pictured) has claimed he was having sexual relations with a police officer who was investigating him at the time . An undercover policewoman quit her job amid allegations she had an affair with a drug dealer she was investigating, it has emerged. Neil Scarborough, 32, was jailed for 14 years in June after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis following a police probe which exposed a sophisticated drugs ring. Scarborough was part of a gang which possessed heroin and cocaine worth £1.5m and more than £200,000 in cash. He was arrested in 2011 and was among 36 men sentenced to a total of 167 years following a police probe called Operation Oak. Scarborough, of Preston, Lancashire, says he believes the reason he was given such a long sentence is because of his relationship with the officer. In a letter to his local paper, the Lancashire Evening Post, sent from his prison cell at HMP Altcourse, in Liverpool, Scarborough also claimed another Preston criminal was having a relationship with a second officer at the same time. Lancashire Constabulary has confirmed two female officers were investigated over the claims six years ago. But the allegations have only come to light publicly since Scarborough lost his appeal against his 14 year jail sentence in October. He said: 'Myself and a friend were having sexual relations with two police officers, of which one of them was investigating me at the time.' A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Two female officers were investigated for misconduct but resigned in May 2007 before a hearing.' Scarborough also claimed his sentence was tougher because he had been selling cocaine to disgraced solicitor Basharat Ditta, 44, from Blackburn, Lancashire. Last month Ditta was jailed for three years after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice relating to passing on critical information to drug dealers, including Scarborough, about secret investigations into them. Scarborough (left) also claimed his sentence was tougher because he had been selling cocaine to disgraced solicitor Basharat Ditta (right), 44, from Blackburn, Lancashire . He said: 'I feel that because of this I was given a longer sentence than I deserved, I am serving nearly 14 years.' Scarborough was initially jailed for four years and three months in May 2007 shortly after £12,500 worth of cocaine was seized from one of his courier. He was released in 2009 but carried on drug dealing - working with gangs based in Preston and Blackburn, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. In 2011 a major police operation involving hundreds of officers saw a string of drug raids during which heroin and cocaine worth £1.5m was seized, along with more than £200,000 in cash. Scarborough, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis, was one of 36 men jailed for a total of 167 years for their roles in the racket.","Neil Scarborough made claim after losing appeal against 14 year sentence .

Ricardo Pisano has been jailed for 18-and-a-half years for manslaughter and preventing the lawful burial of Michael Polding, 62 . A rent boy dubbed The Artful Dodger has been jailed for 18-and-a-half years after being convicted of murdering a man whose finances he had bled dry. Ricardo Pisano killed Michael Polding and wrapped his body up in bedding two months before police discovered it in at the man's home in Brighton last year. The 36-year-old who had previously escaped from a New Zealand jail claimed he found Mr Polding hanging from a banister in an apparent suicide then fled. A jury at Lewes Crown Court however convicted Pisano of manslaughter and wounding the 62-year-old after a five-week trial. The court heard how 'openly gay' Mr Polding died from a 'blunt force trauma' to the chest. Pisano, who has used several different aliases, previously admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body. He had evaded police efforts to capture him for a year until being arrested in Southampton on May 7 under a different name. The criminal told the court he fled the rented two-bedroom flat after finding Mr Polding's body as he feared deportation to South Africa where a 'fatwa' had allegedly been issued against him. He then told officers a controversial vigilante group had ordered his death because he was deemed 'troublesome' or 'a threat' in the country, and that he would be 'dead in a week' if deported. Prosecutor Philip Katz QC told the jury: 'The prosecution say that really from the word go (Pisano) lived off Michael Polding financially. 'He had no job and no income, and when Mr Polding decided to sell up in Croydon and move to Brighton, this defendant moved with him. 'The Crown’s case is that this defendant and other friends of his effectively bled Mr Polding dry financially and this defendant, while in this period, pretended to act as his carer and even godson. 'In fact, we say he abused and assaulted Mr Polding, resulting in a serious assault. 'We say that he eventually killed him, and having killed him, left him to rot.' The court heard how Pisano (right) depended on Mr Polding's income (left) and shared a home with the man in Brighton . Mr Polding's badly decomposed body was discovered by police at his home on St. George's Road, Brighton (pictured) Mr Polding, who had previously been in a long-term relationship, was drinking heavily and suffered health problems at the time of his death, the court heard. Speaking after the trial, members of the man's family said they missed him 'every hour of every day'. Mr Polding's sister, Mary McKeown said: 'As a family we are pleased that the trial is over and that justice has been done for our brother, Michael. 'The time since we were told of Michael’s death has been a rollercoaster for the family, with far more downs than ups. We have managed to get through the weeks and months only by supporting each other. 'Today’s verdict means that we have justice for Michael although that is little comfort against the thought of how we lost him. 'Michael was a happy, loving and gentle person, always ready to help others when needed. He was fun and always enjoyed the company of family and friends.

'I would like to pay tribute to Michael’s family for their strength and the assistance they have given to me and my officers during the investigation.

Signal: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg left the door firmly open to further welfare reform yesterday . Nick Clegg has signalled he is prepared to consider Tory calls to cut the £26,000 household benefit cap and limit child-related benefits for the jobless - but only if the axe is also taken to pensioners’ perks. The Deputy Prime Minister left the door firmly open to further welfare reform yesterday, saying it was inevitable that more would have to be done in the years ahead. Chancellor George Osborne has indicated that ‘billions’ more in cuts to social security will be necessary after the next election, on top of the £18billion already introduced. Tories have floated a possible reduction in the £26,000 household benefit cap, introduced by the Government this year so that it is not possible to earn more in welfare than on average earnings, and limits on child benefit and other payments for unemployed parents who have more than two children in future. Mr Clegg said it would not be fair to remove child-related benefits from those already in receipt of them, but refused to oppose either idea in principle, agreeing that further reform of the welfare state will be necessary. ‘I’m not going to start drawing great circles around this policy or that policy. I want to look at it in the round,’ the Deputy Prime Minister said. On a lower benefit cap, he added: ‘It’s not something that I’m advocating at the moment because we’ve only just set this new level and it’s £26,000, which is equivalent to earning £35,000 before tax… . ‘I think we need to keep that approach, look and see how it works, see what the effects are, but not rush to start changing the goalposts before the policy has properly settled down.’ Changes: Chancellor George Osborne has indicated that 'billions' more in cuts to social security will be necessary after the next election, on top of the £18billion already introduced . However, Mr Clegg insisted that pensioners’ free TV licences, bus passes and winter fuel payments would also have to be reviewed after the next general election. Labour has already said it would stop paying better-off older people some allowances, which the Tories pledged to protect till 2015. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has said that the party would also end winter fuel payments, normally worth £200 for the over-60s and £300 for those over the age of 80, to 600,000 better-off pensioners, while the Liberal Democrats have long argued pensioner benefits should be reined in. Future: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is among those who are understood to believe that continuing to pay benefits to wealthy pensioners cannot be justified beyond the next election . There is no question of winter fuel payments, free bus passes and TV licences being means tested until after 2015, because David Cameron made a cast iron pledge at the last election that they would be left untouched. However, there are significant internal disagreements in the Conservative Party over whether the Prime Minister should repeat his pledge to ring-fence the payments at the next election, binding his hands until 2020. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is among those who are understood to believe that continuing to pay benefits to wealthy pensioners cannot be justified beyond the next election. Research commissioned by Downing Street suggests that a majority of the public back the idea of slashing handouts for better off pensioners. But the polling also confirms that the Prime Minister risks a ‘crisis of trust’ if he breaks his pledge, at least before the next election. Mr Clegg said: ‘I have pushed within coalition but I have given up now because Conservatives don’t want to know, really. ‘I don’t think there is any realistic prospect of getting anything delivered on that in the next 18 months. I have pushed both George Osborne and David Cameron but it is something they don’t want to do, for reasons they will have to explain to you.’ Mr Clegg said that pensions minister Steve Webb and Cabinet Office minister David Laws were working on ‘very useful’ ideas on reforming universal pensioner benefits, adding: ‘As we put together the Liberal Democrat manifesto, we will make some announcements on this.’ The Liberal Democrat leader said that stripping wealthy pensioners of their benefits would not raise enormous amounts of money but would be ‘symbolically important’.","DPM Nick Clegg leaves the door firmly open to further welfare reform .

A young mother was beaten up on a night out by a woman who was apparently jealous that she was carrying a large wad of cash. Amy Rae Ferris took out £200 from a cash machine in order to buy Christmas presents for her children, shortly before popping into a bar for a drink with friends. But a woman who saw her pull out the banknotes ambushed her in the toilet and brutally beat her, leaving her covered in blood. Warning: graphic images . Attacked: Amy Rae Ferris, 24, was beaten up in a bar because she was carrying a wad of cash . Damage: The young mother had to go to hospital after the brutal and unprovoked attack on Saturday . The attacker took the 24-year-old's money, then went back to her friends at the bar and carried on drinking. Ms Ferris was helped out by another reveller, who took pictures of her horrific injuries before taking her to hospital after the attack at Pic's Bar in Bury, Greater Manchester. 'I feel lucky to be alive as there must have been up to 40 blows to my head,' said Ms Ferris, who has a six-year-old son and a daughter aged four. 'She didn't say a word during the attack - she just kept hitting me. 'I was left on the floor in a pool of blood. I managed to crawl out although I'm not sure if I had been knocked out for a few minutes. 'A lady came and she went to get help and I was escorted out of the back of the club while [the attacker] was still drinking at the bar like nothing had happened. I can't believe someone could do that to another person.' Night out: Ms Ferris had been relaxing with friends before popping out for food and a drink . Bloody: Ms Ferris had a badly cut lip and had to be treated for her injuries in hospital . The attack on Saturday night came after Ms Ferris had been enjoying a 'girlie night in', and decided to go out to get food with a friend in the early hours of the morning. On the way, they went in to Pic's and ordered a Sambuca and Coke each. 'I had withdrawn £200 from a cashpoint because I wanted to go shopping for my children's Christmas presents the next day,' she said. 'We walked past the bar and we thought we would just go in for one cheeky one before we went to get food. We went to the bar and I bought two drinks with the money I had just taken out. 'After paying for the taxi, cigarettes and the drinks I had £170 left in notes then a bit of loose change so I rolled it up and stuffed the money into my shoe. Venue: The attack took place around 2.30am at Pic's Bar in Bury, Greater Manchester . 'When I was in the toilet I felt a hard blow to the face. Then I felt more blows to my head and I fell to the floor. 'Every time I tried to get back up I was pushed or kicked back to the floor. I must have received over 30 or 40 blows. It went on for quite a long while and I was left in a pool of blood on the floor. 'I managed to crawl out of the cubicle and I was escorted out of the back of the bar by staff. I think the woman saw me take the money out to pay for my drinks and I think that's why she attacked me. 'I just remember sitting in Accident and Emergency for four hours. I was shivering but I felt hot at the same time. I was just confused about what had happened to me and I was in so much pain. My head was throbbing. It felt like a really bad migraine.' A woman has been arrested over the incident by Greater Manchester Police.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . PUBLISHED: . 10:12 EST, 16 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:24 EST, 16 December 2013 . An art college has refused to take down a 'disgusting' painting showing Jimmy Savile dressed as a knight in shining armour. The image, painted by a former student, is hung prominently in South Staffordshire College where it can be seen by the college's students. But despite complaints from a member of staff, and concerns expressed by pupils, the college defended exhibiting the image and said it is 'ironic'. Savile the knight: The painting shows Jimmy Savile, thought to be Britain's worst ever peadophile, dressed in shining armour . The image, which shows Savile standing in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House, with his trademark cigar hanging out of his mouth, is hung up in an exhibition space at a campus in Lichfield, Staffordshire. The viewing space, known as the Wedge gallery, is open to members of the public as well as students at the college. Students at the college today said that the work has 'split opinion' in the college, while an Art lecturer has claimed the piece is ironic, and said a caption will be added to 'explain the thinking behind it'. Tutors at the school refused to remove the painting after a cleaner complained when the painting made it on to the walls. Hannah Mattison, 24, first saw the image in storage last week at the college's £3million School of . Art, Design and Media facility, and spoke out when it was put on display. Prominent: . She said: 'I first saw it when I was cleaning an art room and it was stacked in a corner. 'I . was offended but I didn't say anything because it was in a closed-off . area, but after they moved it to a public area I felt I had to say . something.I was disgusted when I saw it up there. 'The head of art won't say who did it because they are a student. He won't take it down and says it is a piece of art and people will interpret it in different ways. 'I worry what affect it could have if a young person who's being abused themselves saw it. They haven't portrayed Savile as a nasty paedophile but as a kind of hero wearing a suit of armour. 'He is not a hero or icon - he's a serial abuser of children and to show him as anything else is wrong.' Today students at the college said that the painting 'split opinion' and should be taken down. Notorious: Since Savile died in 2011, dozens of victims have come forward to say he abused them . One, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It does split opinion in the college. Some people think it's distasteful but some think it's interesting. It causes a debate and I guess that's the point of art in many ways.' Another said: 'I think they probably should take it down now everything has come out about him. It's in the corridor not even in a room so you can't avoid it if you go to the art department. 'They say Savile had hundreds of victims so it's possible a family member of someone affected by him will come to this college. I don't think they would want to see a giant portrait of him grinning like that.' However, the college defended its decision to display the painting by saying that it is intended to be ironic. It released a statement saying: 'The artwork in question is intended to be an ironic comment on organisations that ignore or cover up important issues, going some way to explain why Jimmy Savile's abuse continued undetected for so many years. 'It has received a number of positive comments on this basis and one expression of concern, from a member of South Staffordshire College's non-teaching staff. Controversial: The exterior of South Staffordshire College's campus in Lichfield, where the portrait is on display . 'The person in question has now had the opportunity to discuss the artwork and the college has assured her that the well-being and safeguarding of its learners are at the very heart of its activities, indeed this is one of the concepts behind the painting."" Mr Nash, an Art lecturer at the college, added: 'The purpose of exploring these issues is in enabling discussions to take place rather than allowing them to be swept under the carpet. 'As an additional safeguard we are creating a caption for the piece which will explain the thinking behind it.' South Staffordshire college, which was given a 'good' rating in its last Ofsted inspection, has around 6,000 students across its four campuses and caters for leaners as young as 14. The gallery - named the Wedge Gallery - is said to exhibit the work of 'professional artists and emerging designers.'","South Staffordshire College has displayed the portrait, by a former student .

Paramedics tried to revive Ms Wilson at the scene but she died later in hospital on November 16. Amy Wilson and her unborn son, Harry, died after she collapsed. Her partner Peter Reid (pictured with their daughters, Halle, centre, and Chloe) has been told she may have suffered from a heart condition so rare there are no tests yet to detect it . Her partner Peter Reid is now caring for their two daughters, Halle, seven, and Chloe, two, in Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire. He has been told by doctors that Ms Wilson may have suffered from a heart condition so rare there are no tests yet to detect it. He said: 'I was told they are struggling to find the cause of death. 'She was looked after as well as she could have been and had the care she needed while in hospital. 'Not only do I want to know what happened but the doctors also want to know. 'It . could be that Amy had one of these rare heart conditions that they . don’t know of yet and may not be tested for another 10 years. 'Everything appeared to be normal and it could be that there is no test yet that will give us the answers.' Ms Wilson and Harry were laid to rest in a joint funeral. An investigation by NHS Grampian is ongoing after Ms Wilson had spent time in the maternity unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) in the lead-up to her death. Mr Reid said he will 'struggle' if he does not get answers about Ms Wilson's death . She had previously suffered a bout of extreme sickness and spent the first week of November at the hospital until being released 10 days before she died. Mr Reid has been told her death is not because of the pregnancy but due to a rare heart condition which all standard tests have so far failed to identify. Further tests are ongoing to determine what condition she suffered from. Mr Reid, who works for Bibby Offshore in Westhill, Aberdeenshire, said: 'I don’t mind if I find out one week down the line, two weeks down the line, but the truth is I may never know.

You can't roll over on Twitter or Instagram without crashing into a 5:2 diet hashtag these days, with every man and his pet chinchilla eating whatever they like for five days a week and virtually starving themselves for two. The intermittent fasting eating plan championed by doctors and Beyonce alike is hitting dinner tables around the world, with health experts and celebrities extolling the virtues of encouraging yourself to eat less by severely restricting the amount you can eat for just a couple days every week. There is even evidence that fasting can improve cognitive function in humans and increase insulin sensitivity, hinting that it may guard . against developing certain conditions such as dementia and diabetes. LighterLife's fast packs - which include a carbonara-flavoured meal, right - could spell the end for food-weighing for those doing the 5:2 diet, left .

I mean, how many big-Cs are there in a bunch of kale? What about the hefty wedge of fat in an avocado? And what's the deal with cottage cheese? To help, weight-loss company LighterLife has launched a range of nutritionally-complete 5:2 fast day comestibles, available exclusively from high street chemist Superdrug in time for the post-Christmas gut-shrinking season on Boxing Day.

Unforgettably, there are also powdered versions of popular 'normal' meals, including spaghetti bolognese and pasta carbonara. Fast days have been shown to have greater health benefits than just weight loss . A LighterLife spokesman said: 'This new way of intermittent fasting is . set to revolutionise the way we do the 5:2 and is designed to help . people who are looking to lose weight or simply manage it.

'It’s pretty incredible to see that she's safe, happy and healthy,' Tripp said. 'This is honestly the best Christmas present my family could have ever received.' Together at last! Christy Tripp, 33, has recently been reunited with her long-haired Chihuahua named 'Lily' who went missing on Easter Sunday last year . Lily, a long-haired Chihuahua, escaped from Tripp's Scottsdale, Arizona home in April 2012. After searching . through neighborhoods and putting up fliers for months, Tripp believed she would never see Lily again. 'At about eight months I thought she was gone for sure,' Tripp told KWTX. 'It was then when I decided to leave all memories of Lily behind.' In August, Tripp got engaged and moved to Elm Mott in Texas. Lily had become a distant memory when Tripp received a surprising email about a week ago. Her dog's microchip company in Scottsdale told her a stranger found the pup roaming the streets and brought her in. Reunited at last: Christy Tripp (left) said it felt 'incredible' to have Lily in her arms again . 'Surreal!' Tripp had given up hope of finding Lily, so was shocked a local vet contacted her to say they'd found her pet dog . Overwhelmed with emotion, Tripp frantically made plans to fly Lily to Texas.

That's when Tripp’s former vet clinic reached out to the public through Facebook, asking if anyone flying to Texas could take Lily. 'A good Samaritan volunteered to carry Lily on their flight free of charge,' Tripp said.

Don't let your hangover beat you, order the Christmas Party Hangover Cure from Grazing and knock your dehydration headache on the head before noon . The Christmas party season can be brutal, so make sure you have a couple of morning-after tricks up your sleeve . Research has shown that a lack of productivity the next day means that Christmas parties are more expensive for employers than just a bar bill and a plate of sausage rolls. Grazing's Christmas Party Hangover Cure intends to save companies cash and leave staff feeling less prone to pulling a sickie. The menu, created by a team of chefs in the city, features a fried egg and bacon buttie and provides a combination of nutrients, carbohydrates and protein to give s workers an energy boost. The food - which costs £12.95 per box, with a minimum order of 10 - is transported and kept warm in Grazing's pioneering hot boxes. Other items available from Grazing's menu include the Full Monty Breakfast, veggie sausage buttie, the American muffins and a mushroom omelette. Don't knock chocolate-covered bacon until you've tried it, it's a curiously delicious mix of savoury and sweet, that indescribable umami flavour . Each box contains: . Beetroot, Apple, Avocado, Lime, Mango and Lemon Smoothie: Packed full of superfoods, this amazing smoothie is a favourite with celebrities. The fruits and vegetables contained are cold-pressed rather than heated, to maximise the nutrients, antioxidants and vitamins, and the natural sugars in this healthy mix rehydrate the body, getting the alcohol out of your system quicker. Fausts Awake Potion: This . miracle-in-a-bottle comprises amino acids, guarana, green tea, ginseng, . Vitamins B and C and electrolytes. It works wonders for busy . professionals by neutralising the effects of a hangover. It helps the . body replace lost nutrients, banishing classic symptoms such as . headaches and sluggishness that leave you feeling worse for wear. Bacon & Fried Egg Buttie: Hangovers can cause blood sugar levels to drop. But hot, grilled British back bacon with a fried free-range egg, sandwiched in a soft white roll, with classic condiments (ketchup and HP sauce) on the side ought to help. Eggs and bacon are both rich in cysteine, an amino acid that aids the breakdown of toxins, while loading up on carbohydrates also helps redress the balance. Science aside, if an egg and bacon buttie doesn't help ease the pain of the morning after the night before, it will at the very least satiate even the most severe cases of munchies. Bacon Chocolate: Can't decide between sweet or savoury? Not a problem. This seriously moreish combination of slow-cooked crispy bacon lardons - made from free-range British bacon - dipped in melted Fairtrade chocolate has the best of both. Sounds strange, but these chewy treats are a decadently delicious mid-morning pick-me-up. Plus, they're full of potassium, which gets depleted when you drink, causing you to feel sick and dehydrated.

The BBC introduced Sports Personality winner Andy Murray from Florida before his victory was announced last night with viewers accusing themof 'giving the game away' and 'killing the suspense' Announcement: Minutes later the Wimbledon champion's victory was revealed and the camera zoomed out to show Martina Navratilova next to him holding the famous trophy . From the moment he held the Wimbledon men’s singles trophy in his hands this summer, he was hot favourite to win one of the top awards in British sport this year. His achievement, becoming the first British man in 77 years to win the famous grand slam, also led to him winning more votes than the rest of the nominees combined.

He said he was sorry not to be at the event in person, although his parents and grandparents were there and added: ‘I could not have got into the position I’m in if I didn’t take my training, my preparation, extremely hard.’ He thanked his family for ‘making a lot of  sacrifices’ for him through the years and those who have helped with his training, saying his success was ‘a team effort’. Expressing gratitude to the public, he added: ‘I’m not the easiest person to support, but I have had a lot of pressure on me for a long time. I’m just glad I have managed to break through.’ He also made fun of his own voice, saying: ‘No matter how excited I try to sound, I always sound incredibly boring, but I’m excited right now.

Delight: The reaction of girlfriend Kim Sears summed up the emotions of the nation that afternoon, when her boyfriend made history . Murray, who became the first British man to win the Wimbledon men’s singles since Fred Perry in 1936, announced last week that he would not be attending the awards because he did not want to break his training regime.

The award - named after TV presenter Helen Rollason, who died aged 43 in 1999 after fighting cancer - is given for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity. BBC pundit Hansen was moved to tears by actress Sue Johnston and Anne's brother Danny who delivered a tribute. Sportswear giant Adidas instantly poked fun at tennis ace Andy Murray’s dour persona as soon as he scooped the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Murray, 26, has been ribbed about being grumpy and boring during his career which was topped by his Wimbledon win in the summer.

When we get to adulthood we have a tendency to hold our noses, cover our eyes with goggles and plug our ears when we go underwater. But it's a different story for babies. They have a gag reflex, and being submerged reminds them of being in the womb, meaning when they go under water they look utterly at peace. 'Up to around six months they have a gag reflex which means they hold their breath automatically,' says underwater photographer Lucy Ray. Underwater photographer Lucy Ray, 33, from Greenwich, was a Fleet Street news photographer before embarking on her new career taking photos of children swimming . The baby is submerged, let go for a second while Lucy takes the photos then brought straight back up . Lucy first started to dabble with underwater photography at University when she learned to scuba dive . Lucy, 33, who founded her brand new company Starfish Underwater Photography, takes pictures of the confident waterbabies, capturing a brief moment as they explore an underwater world. The babies have been attending swimming lessons for a while before the shoot in order to get comfortable with swimming and being submerged. 'At the shoot, the parents says the baby's name, then says 'ready, swim!' and then the baby is submerged,' says Lucy. 'They are let go for a . couple of seconds while I take the photos then brought straight back up.' 'It doesn't give me very long to take the pictures but I only need a few seconds as my camera can take six frames per second.' Lucy says the older children especially love dressing up for their photo shoot . The babies aren't underwater for very long but it looks that way as Lucy freezes that split second in time . Lucy takes the pictures very quickly, she only needs a few seconds as her camera takes 6 frames per second . 'I ask that babies have done a term of baby swimming lessons that include submersions. 'This . means they gradually over a few months, build up to going under the . water. It starts with splashing on the head, then face, and builds up to . a full submersion. 'So . in reality the babies aren't underwater for very long at all. It just . looks that way as we freeze that split second in time. Lucy, from Greenwich, London, first started to dabble with underwater photography at University when she learned to scuba dive. 'I have continued experimenting with it for over a decade and have invested heavily in the equipment. My previous work is in stark contrast to the underwater portraiture.' Lucy, who now travels across the UK, including Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Leeds, Maidstone to carry out her underwater snaps, worked as a news photographer for more than a decade. 'It often involved waiting outside in the cold, whereas baby swimming pools are kept at a nice warm 30 degrees,' she says. Eleanor, 6 months, looks serene in her underwater photo by Strafish Underwater Photography . Lucy trained to be a baby and pre-school swimming teacher too so she can teach babies to swim herself . She just decided to take the plunge and see what happens if she devotes all her efforts to a business . 'Also, a lot of the time in news . photography, you have to photograph people who don't want their picture . taking, like people leaving court, but the babies don't complain, . mostly. 'I will certainly . miss the adrenaline rush of news photography: getting a call telling you . to catch the next flight to Budapest, or get to the hospital, The . Dutchess of Cambridge is in labour! 'But I love the creativity of underwater photography and the unusual images you can capture.' 'I've always had an entrepreneurial streak but having worked full time for newspapers my entire working life I haven't had the time to pursue any of my ideas fully. 'I've had a few failed businesses that I ran on the side such as strawberry wine, painted glass and ceramic gargoyles. The underwater photography seems quite sensible in comparison. I just decided to take the plunge and see what happens if I devote all my efforts to a business. 'It feels like every picture you can conceive on land has already been taken, because photography is so popular now, but with underwater, it's a whole new angle. 'I trained to be a baby and pre-school swimming teacher too so I can teach the babies to swim myself as safety is very important. So this really is quite a career change. 'I'm not a mum yet myself but if I have one, it's sure to be the most photographed swimming baby around.' Prices start at Â£30 for half an hour in the pool with up to five other children. Customers get free use of costumes provided and up to six submersions. Pictures are then paid for separately if they choose to buy any, starting at Â£30.","Lucy Ray, 33, from Greenwich was a news photographer for 10 years .

It may not have all the bells and whistles, or the expense, of Apple’s fingerprint scanner, but Google does offer an alternative way to unlock an Android phone - and it involves using your face. The Face Unlock feature was originally introduced in 2011 as part of Android 4.0, also known as Ice Cream Sandwich, but despite this, it is still a relatively unknown tool. It can recognise a person’s face and recent updates mean it can even establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real, or is a photograph. Google launched its facial recognition feature called Face Unlock when it released Android 4.0 in 2011 - but it could be bypassed by holding a photo up to the screen. During the update to Android 4.1 in July 2012, Google added a 'liveness' check. The user must now blink during authentication to confirm they are alive and not a static image. However, some users were still able to bypass this using photo editing tricks . To set up Face Unlock, people with Android phones running Ice Cream Sandwich or higher can go to Settings, Security, click on Screen Lock and select Face Unlock. The set-up wizard will then ask the user to take a photo of their face, using the device’s front-facing camera. It will also advise if the lighting or positioning isn’t clear enough. Once a photograph is taken it is stored in an encrypted file and each time a person wants to unlock their phone with their face, the Android system will cross-reference the image with this original photograph. As a backup, users need to additionally set up a screen lock pattern or PIN, in case the camera breaks or fails to recognise their face. This can happen in poor lighting, for example.

This meant a user would have to blink while using Face Unlock to prove they were alive.

In June, details emerged of a Google patent, pictured, that would let users unlock their phones by pulling silly faces, such as frowning, poking out their tongue or wriggling their nose. The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity .

It is an age-old problem. Why is it so difficult to buy perfume for a loved one? Well, scientists may have come up with the answer - but it doesn’t make picking a gift any easier. We all think we know how certain things smell. But to someone else that same bottle of perfume - or piece of cheese, or glass of wine - may smell completely differently. American scientists have discovered that we all experience odours in a completely different way. Their paper, published in the Nature Neuroscience journal, reveals that 30 per cent of smell receptors differ between any two people. Each single receptor can alter the way each person perceives an odour. Dr Joel Mainland, a molecular biologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia, said: ‘For different items there is a big gap between what you smell and what I smell. ‘The amount of variation was really surprising to us - it was about 30 per cent of receptors are different between two individuals at random. That is a pretty high number.’ The human nose contains 400 different olfactory receptors - and Dr Mainland’s team found that changing a single receptor could dramatically change the way a person perceives a smell. Good or bad? While some detect the aromatic smell of sandalwood from a scented candle, others smell it as pee . Dr Mainland said: ‘The activation pattern . of these 400 receptors encodes both the intensity of an odour and the . quality – for example, whether it smells like vanilla or smoke – for the . tens of thousands of different odours that represent everything we . smell.’ Changing one particular receptor meant . that some people smell a specific type of steroid as a pleasant . sandalwood - while others thought it smells like pee. ‘It is very different,’ Dr Mainland said. ‘One person might find it to be mild and pleasant and by changing that single receptor another might find it to be as a very strong and urinous.’ The researchers cloned 511 receptors and embedded them in host cells in the laboratory. They then measured how each receptor responded to a panel of 73 different odours. The process identified 28 different ways that each array of receptors would respond to the different odours. The team used mathematical models to extrapolate the findings, and came up with the result that 140 of their 400 receptors - about 30 per cent - of any two individuals would be different. Dr Mainland said the results may enable scientists to accurately create different smells. ‘The long-term goal is to figure out how the receptors encode odour molecules well enough that we can actually create any odour we want by manipulating the receptors directly.’","Human nose has 400 different receptors - one change could be dramatic .

The woman who disappeared from her San Francisco hospital room only to be found dead two weeks later in a fire-escape stairwell in the same building had been seen by a hospital employee a week before she was found. A worker at San Francisco General Hospital reported seeing an unconscious woman in a fire-escape stairwell one week before the body of the missing patient, Lynne Spalding, 57, was found in the same spot. Spalding disappeared from her room on the hospital's fifth floor on September 21, two days after she was admitted for treatment of an infection. Tragic: Lynne Spalding, 57, had been missing for two weeks from her hospital room in San Francisco. A week before she was found dead a worker alerted police about an unconscious woman in the stairwell . Her body was found October 8 on the fourth-floor landing of the locked stairwell. According . to sources, a hospital orderly told a nurse on October 1 that he had . seen a woman, apparently passed out, on the fourth floor of the . stairwell. The orderly . said he had stepped over the prone woman twice, once going downstairs . and again when he returned to the fifth-floor door that he had used to . enter the stairwell, according to the SFGate. The nurse contacted the Sheriff's Department, but it is unclear why no one arrived at the scene to investigate. Police have not been able to determine how the department responded on October 1, the sources said. They said it is possible no one responded to the stairwell, or that a deputy was dispatched to the wrong location. It is also unclear whether the woman was still alive when the orderly found her. There . was nothing in the nurse's call to the Sheriff's Department, however, . that indicated the woman might have been dead, the sources said. 'What happened at our hospital is . horrible,' San Francisco General Hospital Chief Medical Officer Todd May . said at a news conference. 'We . are here to take care of patients, to heal them, to keep them safe. This has shaken us to our core. Our staff is devastated.' Hospital . spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said they did not know either how long the . mother-of-two had been left lying there, nor how she had come to be on . the fire escape in the first place. She added: 'It's very concerning. We're distressed and don't know what happened. It's our top . priority to find out.' The . cause of her death is now being investigated by the San Francisco . Sheriff's Department and police. A police investigation was launched . after the 57-year-old British woman first went missing. The . disorientated mother-of-two had been admitted to the hospital for . complications to an infection and was being monitored by staff every 15 . minutes, but disappeared between check-ups. She . is believed to have walked out of her room on her own accord, and was . found with her pocketbook but left her cell phone in her room. Discovery: Ms Spalding's body was still on the premises and was found by a hospital employee in a stairwell . At the time of her disappearance, family spokesman David Perry told ABC that Ms Spalding was on medication, which could have caused her to become disorientated. Mr Perry said: 'We find it disturbing . that someone can go missing from the hospital. One would think there . would be cameras or something.' Ms Spalding, who was originally from the UK but lived in San Francisco, worked in tourism in the West Coast city. She was divorced with two children, a 23-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son.

Snapchat, headquarters pictured, has secured $50m (£30.5m) in funding from New York hedge fund Coatue Management . For an app which is only two-years-old and doesn’t generate any of its own revenue, Snapchat is attracting some serious investment. Reports emerged yesterday that the company had secured $50m (£30.5m) in new funding from an unknown source. Snapchat has now revealed to the Financial Times this investor is Coatue Management in New York. This brings the total investment in the firm to $123m. Almost half a million of that came from Michael Lynton who left his role as chairman of Sony Entertainment to join Snapchat earlier this year. Other investors include Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital. Rumours recently claimed Facebook had tried to buy the firm for $3 billion but had been turned down. Snapchat, which has been dubbed a next-generation messaging service was started by 23-year-old Evan Spiegel and friends. The co-founder of the company reportedly turned down the huge all-cash offer from Facebook - which would have valued Snapchat $4 billion – because the firm is said to be being wooed by other investors and possible buyers . In June, the app was valued at $800m yet analysis from by VCExperts.com during recent funding rounds more than doubled this figure. This latest funding brings the total investment in the firm to $123m. Almost half a million of that came from Michael Lynton who left his role as chairman of Sony Entertainment to join Snapchat earlier this year. Other investors include Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital . Coatue hedge fund manages around $8.5 billion of assets and also invested in the cloud storage company Box. While California-based Snapchat has . no sales or business model, its smartphone app delivers millions of . messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds, making it a truly . instant service, instead of a more permanent record collector like . Twitter or Facebook. According to sources, Mr Spiegel thinks the app’s user numbers have lots of potential to grow and just two months ago, the company’s usage had reportedly risen dramatically to 350 million messages a day, from 200 million in June. However, the company does not disclose its numbers and has not commented on the rumours. Snapchat joins an exclusive club of tech start-ups which have snubbed multibillion dollar buyout offers. Groupon turned down an offer from Google of almost $6 billion in 2010 and Facebook and Twitter have both turned down offers over the years, deciding to grow their businesses organically instead. Snapchat, which has been dubbed a next generation messaging service, is just two-years-old and was started by 23-year-old Evan Spiegel (left) and Bobby Murphy (right). Last week the pair filed a restraining order against Frank Reginald Brown, who co-founded the app, to cease and desist from making any more information public . Snapchat is a photo messaging app for iOS and Android devices, developed by Stanford University students. Using the app, users can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent photographs and videos are known as 'Snaps'. Users set a time limit for how long recipients can view their Snaps (from one to 10 seconds) after which they will be hidden from the recipient's device and deleted from the Snapchat server. The social app is currently delivering more than 350 million photos every day. Snapchat hasn't made any money yet as it doesn't sell adverts or charge people to download or use its app, but it has attracted a lot of investment. It recently added Snapchat stories, which lets users link photos and videos together, where they exist for 24 hours. The app has come under fire from people worried about sexting and cyber bullying. Shervin Pishevar, an entrepreneur co-founder of venture-capital firm Sherpa Ventures, said: ‘There is no shame in getting an Instagram result, but there is tremendous glory in building a stand-alone multibillion-dollar company.’ Facebook snapped up photographic app Instagram for almost $1 billion, just two years after it was founded. Snapchat has carved a niche in the crowded social media marketplace as its messages disappear after 10 seconds and is popular among 13 to 25-year-olds – a group that is increasingly less engaged with more established networks. Facebook admitted that while it is making more money via mobile advertising, fewer young teenagers are using its site regularly to chat to friends. The social network reportedly tried to acquire Snapchat last year for $1 billion but raised its offer to $3 billion, which, if it was accepted, would be Facebook’s largest acquisition to date. While it is expected that Snapchat will . receive more buyout and investment offers due to its popularity, experts . are unsure how the service will make money, but think that one option . might be to help marketing companies create messages that speak to its . young users. While California-based Snapchat has no sales of business model, its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds, making it a truly instant service . Julie Ask, principal analyst at Forrester Research believes this could include more personalised narrative content instead of banner adverts. ‘If you can create content, whether it is a photo or a video or a story, and get it onto one of these instant messaging apps, it has the potential to go viral so fast because the community of users is so big,’ she said. While the app might have the potential to generate revenue from advertising, some analysts believe Snapchat runs the risk of becoming one of many similar services. Benedict Evans, an analyst at Enders Analysis, predicts similar young apps will flood the market as more and more people use smartphones. ‘There are going to be a dozen companies that look something like this, and Facebook can't buy them all,’ he said. Snapchat was started by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford University where he was studying product Design between 2008 and 2012. He told The Huffington Post that he came up with the idea of a temporary photo sharing and messaging service as a friend of his regretted sending a photo. Together with Bobby Murphy, he looked at other apps that were deleting text and photos and realised they had a stigma attached to them because content disappeared. He spoke about the idea in April 2011 in his product design class for his final project and classmates are said to have balked at the idea of impermanent photos. Undeterred, the duo built a prototype and realised it was fun and exciting sending temporary photos back and forth and decided to persevere with the idea and turn it into a business. Mr Spiegel launched the company in September 2011 in his father’s living room. He reportedly dropped out of his Stanford class just three classes before graduation, in order to move back to his father’s house and to work full time on Snapchat. Before that, he had worked as a software developer at Intuit for seven months on ‘a stealth project involving SMS technology’ before starting work on his app. Despite the offer of riches, he still lives at home. In May 2012, 25 images were being sent every second and in November 2012 users had shared over one billion photos on the iOS app. Snapchat rolled out an app for Android smartphones in November 2012. In June this year, the company introduced Snapkidz for users under the age of 13. It allows children to take snaps and draw pictures, but they are unable to send their creations to other users. Writing on his LinkedIn profile, Mr Spiegel said: ‘Snapchatters have shared over fifteen billion unique images through the service since January 2012, making Snapchat one of the top 10 apps in the iTunes App Store.’","Snapchat gained $50m (£30.5m) of new funding from Coatue Management .

With the average Brit set to consume 7,000 calories on Christmas day, it comes as no surprise that the traditional British Christmas dinner has been ranked the fattiest and unhealthiest in Europe. A new survey has revealed that our typical festive lunch on December 25 contains 69g fat and 211g of carbohydrates, that's 42 per cent saturated fat and 30 per cent sugar. On the other end of the spectrum is France, which tops the healthy league table with its menu full of unprocessed foods. Greedy nation: The traditional British Christmas dinner of roast chicken, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding has been voted the unhealthiest in the whole of Europe . A typical French Christmas dinner may be packed with roast chicken, foie gras and thirteen desserts, but it contains a total of just 46g of fat and 29g of carbohydrates per person, which equates to 24 per cent saturated fat and 31 per cent sugar. The 13 puddings represent Jesus and the 12 apostles. They are traditionally set out Christmas Eve and remain on the table three days until December 27. However unhealthy the idea of 13 desserts may sound, many of the courses consist of nuts, berries and fruit, making it a healthier option than our Christmas pudding drenched in brandy cream. The Czech Republic came second in the healthy league with their low-fat festive feast, consisting of fish soup, cold potato salad and sour cabbage. Ireland was voted nearly as unhealthy as Britain but just missed out on the unhealthiest top spot thanks to its starter of prawn cocktail - a higher source of protein. With its processed and cured meats, Germany was also ranked as one of the unhealthiest nations when it came to Christmas dinner. Calorific: A new survey has revealed that our typical festive lunch on December 25 will contain 30 per cent sugar, 69g of fat and 211g of carbohydrates . Healthy: France's Christmas dinner may be packed with oysters, foie gras and Fougasse bread, but it has been revealed as the healthiest in Europe . A spokesperson for health app Lifesum, who carried out the survey by asking staff at European embassies in London about their native country's festive dishes, said: 'Christmas is a time for eating well and enjoying food, but clearly some European countries have, by accident of tradition, dishes that offer far less reason for diners to feel guilty. 'We hope that some people might be inspired by how their European cousins celebrate the day, and consider incorporating some healthy international food options within their own family meals.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:58 EST, 29 July 2011 . Russian air traffic controllers have been blamed for the plane crash which killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others. A Polish report has stated they gave incorrect and confusing landing instructions to pilots - and has put further strain on the relationship between the two neighbours. But it also heavily criticised Polish officials and procedures, and has seen the immediate resignation of Defence Minister Bogdan Klich - whose department oversaw the training of the crew of the doomed flight. Fatal: The plane carrying Polish president Lech Kaczynski crashed near the Smolensk airport killing everyone on board . Today's report challenges a Russian aviation commission report, published in January, that put sole blame for the disaster on Polish officials. That report struck Poles as an attempt to avoid any responsibility for the plane crash in heavy fog at a rudimentary airport near Smolensk. Since then Poland has eagerly awaited its own experts' report. They hoped it would create a more balanced picture of the crash on April 10, 2010, which killed dozens of senior officials along with the president and first lady, in the worst Polish disaster since World War II. As key causes of the crash it cites wrong positioning of the plane during attempted landing, due to insufficient training of the pilots to fly the plane, a Tupolev-154. Poland's President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in the crash . It also said there was a lack of proper cooperation among the crew and an overly slow reaction to an automatic terrain warning system that warned pilots they were flying too low. Incorrect information from the airport control tower on the plane's position prevented the crew from realizing they were making mistakes, it added . Jerzy Miller, the interior minister and head of the investigation commission, said at a presentation today: 'There was no single cause, but an accumulation of causes led to the crash.' In Moscow, deputy chairman of Russia's State Duma's foreign affairs committee, Andrei Klimov, said he believed the Polish pilots were to blame and lashed out at Warsaw for what he called politicizing the investigation. He said: 'This report is not a technical, but a political one. The results were compiled with a nod to the political situation in order to show that Russians were to blame for at least something.' Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Klich submitted his resignation Thursday evening, knowing that the report would point to mistakes in the military training of pilots and flight procedures. He described Klich as an honourable man who did not want to burden the government. General elections are scheduled for this autumn and Tusk's centrist party, Civic Platform, hopes to hold onto power. People stand near the wreckage of a Polish government Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft that crashed near Smolensk airport on April 10 . The Polish plane crashed when Kaczynski and his delegation were on their way to honour some 22,000 Polish officers killed during World War II by Stalin's secret police, a crime known as the Katyn massacres. The symbolism of the plane disaster occurring on a mission to remember the dead added another layer of Polish national grief and resentment in the weeks and months after the crash. At first it seemed the accident had helped Poland and Russia heal some of their historic wounds, because an outpouring of sympathy by Russians was met by Poles with much gratitude. But the Russian report again strained relations, adding to a lingering sense of aggrievement in Poland. Poles remain bitter about the Katyn massacres, the Soviet Union's occupation of Poland's eastern half during the war and Moscow's domination of Poland during the Cold War. Right-wing groups have promoted conspiracy theories, with some saying they believe Russians killed Kaczynski and the others by producing artificial fog that blinded the pilots. Miller said there was no artificial fog at the Smolensk airport that day.

Worn in a dishevelled, boho way all summer, the oversized topknot was the go-to hairdo for relaxed sunny days. But with the Christmas party season in full swing, the topknot is due a sophisticated, polished update. Elegant actress Marion Cotillard rocked this look at the Christian Dior party in Marrakech last week. And with the voluminous style showing no signs of falling out of fashion, celebrity hairdresser Mark Woolley guarantees it will be the most glamorous way to keep your hair tidy all night this Christmas. Here, in FEMAIL's exclusive step-by-step guide, Mark styles MailOnline writer Sara with a party topknot using a bun hairpiece.Scroll down for video . Mark Woolley guarantees the voluminous topknot will be the most glamorous way to keep your hair tidy . Mark explains that the pre-prepared topknots is used for red carpet looks all the time . Marion Cotillard at a Dior event on Sunday, working the voluminous topknot . The first step in creating this red carpet look is backcombing the hair at the crown of the head. This step is key, as it created cushioning and support for the hair piece. Backcomb right to the ends and round the front as well as the back of the hair. Once that's done, pin it in place with kirby grips. Backcomb the roots of the surrounding area for further support. Mark says the key to this look is backcombing the top section which supports the hair piece . For cushioning, backcomb to the ends, from all sides and pin. Then, backcomb the roots of the surrounding hair . Next we need to decide how much of the hair we're leaving out - in Sara's case the sweeping fringe - and part it accordingly. The sweeping fringe is a great alternative for ladies who find scraping all the hair away from their face too severe and prefer to leave something to frame their features. Also, those who have a fringe already can leave that down. Otherwise you can opt for Marion's look for the fashionista edge. Clip any hair you're leaving down out of the way and backcomb the roots of the rest of the hair. Pin it up as you go. Mark decides how much to leave out at the front - here, the sweeping fringe - and backcombs the rest . Now we attach the hair piece - here we're using the Beauty Works Â£29.99 Beehive Messy Bun in colour 33, a Mahogany shade. It's great because it's an exact colour match to Sara's natural hair - and it has clever grips hidden on the inside, . Use plenty of kirby grips to secure in - the last thing we want is the piece to fall out. I'm making sure Sara can party all night. Next is putting the hairpiece on - it's great as it has grips on . Mark says for red carpet looks kirby grips tend to help out hairdressers a lot - he uses plenty for this look . Take the first piece of the remaining hair and start to pin it in around the hairpiece. Begin with one section from each side, first left, then right, and wrap round on opposite sides for a twist effect . It's really nice to blend the natural hair with the hair form the hair piece. Spray with hairspray to secure as you go. What's nice - and what makes this twist and topknot look editorial and red carpet - is the hair has a really natural movement feel to it. Mark brushes the hair, pulls it section by section around the bun and secures, noting the brilliant colour match .

But the butler is back in modern Britain - and now it's been revealed they can earn up to £300,000 for attending to their charges. Being able to juggle wardrobe management and silver service while running a house has proved to be a lucrative career for those willing to serve the super-wealthy.

Elegant: Downton Abbey's Mr Carson, pictured with Mrs Hughes, embodies old-fashioned British elegance . According to the International Guild of Professional Butlers, around 10,000 professional heads of household are working in the UK today, The Times reported. A number of agencies and butler training centres has boomed, meaning that Britain is exporting butlers like never before. And it would appear that this breed of butler is not unlike Downton's serious Mr Carson, who serves as the Crawley family's butler in the award-winning period drama. Loyal service: A common stipulation among the super-rich is that the butler should be British . They earn, on average, between £60,000 and £150,000 a year, although some can command £300,000 or more. And it is particularly British butlers who are the most in demand, according to the The British Butler Academy. A common stipulation among the international super-rich is that the butler should be British, or have learnt the British way of serving. And while they may take home a pretty pay packet, the duties of a butler are varied and complex - so a butler can be expected to work around the clock to serve his client. A butler will be trained in the arts of silver service, etiquette and even British Accent training. There is also laundry and wardrobe management, VIP service, yacht interior crew elite training and cabin crew service skills that must be mastered. Former royal butlers with the right pedigree and long service can command up to £100,000 a year in the private sector. The word 'butler' comes from Anglo-Norman buteler, a version of the Old French botellier 'officer in charge of the king's wine bottles', derived of boteille 'bottle', Modern French bouteille, itself from Gallo-Romance buticula 'bottle'. The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages which in ancient times might have represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.","10,000 butlers are working in Britain today, according to new figures .

No shame: Conejo proclaimed that he is not embarrassed to appear nearly nude on the floor of the chamber . The final step, approval by 17 of Mexico's 31 states, is widely seen as assured. The state-run oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, has had a monopoly since the government took over operations of foreign oil companies in 1938, a move that has been revered ever since as a symbol of national sovereignty. Fear: Conejo and other opponents of the bill believe that multinationals, especially from the U.S., will regain the sort of domination they had over Mexico's oil before 1938 . Opponents say they fear that multinationals, especially from the U.S., will once again regain the sort of domination they had over Mexico's oil before 1938. Mexico remains one of the top five crude exporters to the U.S., shipping more than 1million barrels a day. Leftist lawmakers tried to block discussion of the measure on Wednesday by seizing the main chamber of the House of Deputies, blocking access with chairs and tables. When the debate was moved to another room, they dragged out discussion for 20 hours before the measure was finally approved. ‘The homeland is not for sale! The homeland is to be defended!’ they shouted while holding protest signs and Mexican flags. The proceedings took a strange turn when just before dawn Mr Garcia Conejo took the podium to protest the measuring, shedding his suit and tie. Standing in a pair of black briefs on the dais, the chubby middle-aged lawmaker accused the ruling party of depleting the nation's assets by signing off on past privatizations of telecommunications. 'This is how you're stripping the nation. Where is the benefit? ‘How shameful! But this doesn’t embarrass me,’ he proclaimed. ‘You, too, have a body.’ Victory: Mexican congressmen celebrate after the lower house gave the final approval to a landmark energy reform in Mexico City December 12 . Passion on display: Opposition lawmakers occupy the podium at the National Congress in protest against the newly approved energy reform bill Wednesday . Mexico news outlets and the BBC reported that political rivals Karen Quiroga on the left and Landy Berzunza on the right even came to blows during the tense session, with the latter landing in the hospital with a scratched retina. Despite the protests, most oil analysts had a positive view of the bill hashed out by President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party and the conservative National Action Party. They say major change is needed to rescue Mexico's moribund oil industry, where production has declined, and where Pemex hasn't had the finances or expertise needed to tap the country's vast deep-water and shale reserves. While oil output has been rising in the U.S. and Canada, Mexico's production has fallen 25 per cent since 2004 despite increased investment. According to Pemex statistics, the company has nearly 14billion barrels in proven reserves and up to 115billion barrels in prospective reserves, about half of which are in deep water or shale oil and gas.

Blockade: Leftist lawmakers tried to halt discussion of the measure on Wednesday by seizing the main chamber of the House of Deputies . Public rage: Demonstrators shout slogans against political reforms in front of riot police guarding outside at the National Congress in protest against the newly approved energy reform . ‘The opening of Mexico's markets to put it bluntly, we believe is very good for the people of Mexico and the people everywhere in the world that uses energy,’ William Colton, Exxon Mobil's vice president of corporate strategic planning, said in a webcast before the vote Thursday. ‘It's win-win if there ever was one.’ Supporters say a better energy sector could add at least a full percentage point to Mexico's annual growth rate, which was scaled back dramatically this year from a projected 3.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent. Loud and clear: 'The homeland is not for sale! The homeland is to be defended!' leftists lawmakers cried out . Backers also say it will be a boon to all three countries, the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in the North American Free Trade Agreement. ‘We are going to be able to develop services and competencies in dealing with energy that are transferrable from one country to another, ‘ Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told The Associated Press. Barclays Research, part of the Corporate and Investment Banking division of Barclays Bank, says the process of boosting production will be slow. Pemex estimates it needs more than $60billion a year in investment to explore reserves, and currently gets about $24billion. ‘We have to recognize that this is an important effort in a historic sense. However, the challenges are huge because of the amount that has to be done to implement the reform as it is designed,’ said Michelle Michot Foss, head of the University of Texas' Center for Energy Economics. The measure would allow contracts for profit- and production-sharing as well as licenses under which companies would pay royalties and taxes to the Mexican government for the right to explore and drill. Private companies could post reserves as long as they specify in contracts that all oil and gas belongs to Mexico. The constitution would continue to prohibit oil concessions, considered the most liberal kind of access for private oil companies. The bill also calls for mechanisms to prevent, detect and punish corruption in all new contracts, though the specifics must be worked out in what's known as the secondary laws. It also appears to reduce the influence of the powerful oil union run by Carlos Romero Deschamps, whose family is famous for its ostentatious lifestyle. Pemex has an estimated 155,000 employees, of which about 101,000 are unionized, according to Mexico's Center for Economic Investigation and Education.","Antonio Garcia Conejo, a member of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, staged his protest before the vote .

Angelina Jolie may be called to give evidence in a phone-hacking lawsuit being brought by her stunt double in the United States. Eunice Huthart is the first alleged victim to launch legal action against the Murdoch empire in the U.S. over claims her voicemail was hacked and messages deleted. The British 46-year-old, who won the first series of TV game show Gladiators, claimed The Sun and the News of the World hacked her phone in an attempt to gather gossip about the Hollywood actress. Potential witness: Angelina Jolie may be called to give testify in a phone-hacking case against News Corp brought by her stunt double Eunice Huthart (right) According to the Hollywood Reporter, Ms Jolie is a potential witness in the case who may be called to testify. News Corp responded in September by saying that the case should be transferred to the UK where more than 600 hacking claims were being processed under a compensation scheme. Legal papers filed by News Corp said: 'The compensation scheme has been extraordinarily successful at delivering satisfaction to applicants: it has received 611 inquiries from individuals alleging they were victims of voicemail interception, of whom 426 applied to join the scheme, resulting in 359 being invited to join the scheme, and 272 settling their claims thus far. 'Not a single applicant to date has seen fit to take his or her case to a hearing.' But Ms Huthart's lawyers have branded the scheme 'unfair' and insist that U.S. courts should be able to examine the 'increasing threat to privacy'. Close: Huthart's claims date back to 2004 and 2005 when she was apparently living with Ms Jolie. They are pictured together on the set of 2010 spy thriller Salt . In a statement, they said: 'No claimant has proceeded to a hearing, not because applicants are satisfied with the compensation scheme, but because [News International] controls the scheme and decides whom to accept into it. 'This effectively prevents claimants from having their day in court and from getting to the bottom of defendants' wrongdoing toward them.' News International, the British arm of News Corp, has already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to celebrities and other public figures who were hacked by the News of the World. The stuntwoman claims that News International papers used information found on her voicemail to uncover Ms Jolie's relationship with co-star Brad Pitt during the filming of 2005 hit Mr & Mrs Smith. Her claims date back to 2004 and 2005 when she was apparently living with Ms Jolie - she says the pair were close friends who 'travelled and socialised together' as well as being colleagues on film sets. Allegations: Huthart is the first alleged victim to launch legal action against Rupert Murdoch's empire in the U.S. over claims her voicemail was hacked and messages deleted . Ms Huthart worked as the actress' stunt double on Tomb Raider 2 and Beyond Borders as well as Mr & Mrs Smith. Around the time covered by the complaint, the Sun and the News of the World, which closed down in 2011 after revelations of widespread hacking at the title came to light, ran a number of stories on the burgeoning romance between Ms Jolie and Mr Pitt. The stuntwoman claims that the source of many of the stories was her voicemail, as 'no one except Brad Pitt's bodyguard, Ms Jolie's bodyguard, their respective personal assistants and Plaintiff knew that Brad Pitt and Ms Jolie were now an ""item""'. The court papers also allege that Ms Huthart missed a number of deleted messages from colleagues and family members, leading to inconvenience and emotional distress. Among the messages from Ms Jolie which Ms Huthart never received were apparently 'hotel arrangements where she was staying, code names for hotels and individuals, dinner reservations, meet-up times and, on occasion, when she sought the help of Plaintiff during times of need'. News Corp has so far refused to comment on the allegations. The company has repeatedly denied that hacking took place at the Sun. The phone-hacking scandal came to light in 2001, when it was emerged that the News of the World had hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler. The Sunday newspaper was closed down by Mr Murdoch, and the company has since paid out more than £200million in compensation and legal expenses related to the victims of hacking. A number of former News International executives are currently facing trial for hacking-related offences.","Eunice Huthart claims Sun and News of the World hacked her voicemail .

A 16-year-old boy who was driving a pickup truck that crashed and started a chain reaction of car crashes that ended up killing four people, has been charged in juvenile court with four counts of intoxication manslaughter. Ethan Couch, of Keller, Texas, and seven friends had been drinking for hours before the June 15 wreck. Some of them were even caught on surveillance video stealing two cases of beer from a nearby Walmart in the hours prior to the horrific accident. Couch was also charged with two counts of intoxication assault, according to the Tarrant County district attorney’s office . Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash .

At around 11:45 p.m on June 15th, . Couch and a group his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford . F350 pick-up and were barreling down Burleson-Retta Road in southern . Tarrant County when the truck left the road. As it careered out of control, it . clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, . who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. They were all killed on impact. It was revealed soon after that . Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the limit - and that . his truck was traveling up to 70 mph when it started the chain reaction . of crashes. The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported. Killed: Brian Jennings, 41, was parked on the side of the road when Ethan Couch's pickup truck drove into him and three others . Scene: 911 callers described cars everywhere and kids' lying in ditches' after the June 15 smash . Injured: Sergio Molina remains in a coma whilst Soliman Mohmand, right, was seriously injured.

Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were all killed. Jennings, a Burleson youth minister, . had stopped to help Mitchell, whose vehicle had a flat tire, and Boyles . and her daughter had come out of their nearby house to assist. The SUV . and all four victims were standing off the roadway. The red pickup then hit Mr Jennings’ parked Silverado pickup with two boys inside. Couch’s red pickup flew up into the air, flipped and crashed into a tree. None of the teens in the red truck were wearing seat belts, investigators said. They had earlier stolen a couple of . cases of beer from a Walmart in Burleson about an hour before the crash . and prior to that, they had tried unsuccessfully to buy alcohol at a . convenience store. The theft was recorded by store security cameras. The group had only traveled two blocks when their speeding vehicle came off the road and clipped the broken-down SUV.

Soliman Mohmand and Sergio Molina were seriously injured and remains in a coma with a traumatic brain injury. His medical bills have exceeded $600,000 and could climb into the millions if Mr Molina needs permanent round-the-clock care . His parents are now suing Couch and his family for up to $20 million in a separate lawsuit. The Silverado was pushed into a Volkswagen Beetle, which was being driven by Ashlyn Evans, 18. She and her 14-year-old passenger were also injured. Prosecutors chose not to pursue adult charges but to try the driver as a juvenile and to seek a ‘determinate sentence.’ That means the teen, if convicted, . could start a prison sentence in a youth facility and, after age 19, . complete it in an adult prison. June's car crash wasn't the first time underage drinking had got Couch in trouble. In February of this year, in the town Lakeside, northwest of Fort Worth, police found Couch with a 12-ounce can of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of vodka in the early hours and gave him two citations - one for being a minor in possession of alcohol, the other for consuming alcohol as a minor.","Ethan Couch, 16, from Keller, Texas, and seven friends had been drinking for hours before the June 15 wreck .

Most will be familiar with the advances in technology, industry and trade made during the Georgian period but few realise that the era ushered in a revolution of a different kind - in fashion, media and shopping. Among the men responsible was Thomas Chippendale, a furniture maker whose work, detailed in his groundbreaking 1774 tome, The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Directory, went on to become a byword for good taste. His catalogue, which is filled with examples of his work, was the first of its type and forms part of a new exhibition at The British Library entitled: Georgians Revealed: Life, Style and the Making of Modern Britain. Stylish: The images on show include this illustration detailing the lavish dress of Georgian men and women . Notorious: Courtesan Fanny Murray was at the centre of the UK's first ever celebrity scandal . But it's not all catalogues and chairs: the exhibition also includes some of the first ever British fashion magazines, enormous interior design portfolios by the Adam brothers and the UK’s first celebrity scandal, which was published in some of the country's first tabloids. Other unusual pieces on show include a dashing pair of red leather men's shoes, a stunning silken carnival mask and illustrations detailing the newly popular pastimes of shopping and balls. The most notorious woman to appear in the exhibition is Fanny Murray, the mistress of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, and the star of an early tabloid sensation. Her wanton antics inspired a pornographic poem entitled An Essay on Women, a parody of Alexander Pope's An Essay on Man, which was written by John Wilkes, an early press pioneer. Dapper: A perfectly preserved pair of crimson leather shoes made for a Georgian man around 1790 . Spectacular: An ornate fan decorated with illustrations showing Georgian society's most fashionable members . When the ditty was discovered, more than a decade after being written, it caused a scandal. Wilkes, who was already in trouble with Parliament after writing a disobliging article about the monarch, was forced to flee abroad to escape further obscenity charges. While the scandalous antics of Wilkes and Murray form one of the most eye-catching parts of the display, the exhibition also focuses on other, more innocent pastimes popularised by the Georgians. Among them were following fashion, shopping, gardening and sports, as well as less wholesome pursuits such as theatre, dance and celebrity gossip. Speaking about the exhibition, Dr Moira Goff, lead curator, said: 'We’re thrilled to be telling these fascinating stories from the Georgian period, a somewhat overlooked era. Stylish citizens: The fashion plates of the day, pictured in the UK's first fashion magazine, The Gallery of Fashion .

'We hope visitors will enjoy the exhibition’s playful atmosphere and make the connections between then and now that really bring the period to life.’Accompanying the Library’s collections will be historic objects from the period, including Van Aken’s ‘An English Family at Tea’ from Tate Britain, elegant furniture and crockery from the V&A and a masquerade mask and picnic hamper from the Museum of London.

From a shady villain lurking in the background, to scantily clad women and the suave superspy himself, it is the very essence of a classic Bond movie. And anyone who takes a shine to this original cinema poster for 1962 blockbuster Dr No will this week get a chance to buy it – providing they have rather deep pockets. Experts at Bonhams expect the poster for the first Bond movie, starring Sir Sean Connery, will fetch around £5,000 at the firm’s London auction rooms tomorrow. Iconic: The rare UK poster for the first ever James Bond film, 1962's Dr No,  is expected to fetch £5,000 . Bonhams’ head of entertainments memorabilia, Stephanie Connell, said she expected fierce bidding when the 30in x 40in poster goes under the hammer. She added: ‘Dr No was the movie that launched the whole Bond franchise and this rare original poster would have been used in a UK cinema to advertise it. ‘It is one of the rarest and most sought-after you can find. Stylish: The American poster has been valued at between £300 and £500 . ‘The artists have really captured the . film but it has everything.

Classic: Sean Connery and his Dr No co-star Ursula Andress . ‘Dr . No was the first Bond movie.

When collectors think of Bond, they think of Sean Connery. 'There is a growing market for Daniel Craig but it’s always Connery and his posters which command the best prices. ‘This poster will appeal to movie fanatics, Bond fanatics and anybody who wants an iconic film poster for their wall or office. It’s almost timeless.’ The movie is best remembered for the stunning scene when original Bond girl Ursula Andress, playing Honey Ryder, emerges from the sea in a bikini – a sequence dubbed one of the sexiest in film history.

The top sexual fantasies of women have been revealed in a new book by a prominent female sex writer that aims to revamp Nancy Friday's seminal 1973 bedroom rulebook, My Secret Garden. Garden Of Desires: The Evolution Of Women's Sexual Fantasies by Emily Dubberley delves into the female sexual zeitgeist and explores what's changed (and why) when it comes to women and sex over the past 40 years: specifically, what turns us on these days. In her book Dubberley zones in on five key female sexual desires. And they are? Well. The sexual fantasies of modern women have been revealed in a new book by sex writer Emily Dubberley... and there are five main groups . The post-50 Shades Of Grey, post-Sex And The City era book is a compendium of private stories and innermost thoughts from hundreds of women. As publishers Black Lace comment: 'Female sexual fantasy began in 1973 with Nancy Friday's . multi-million-selling collection of real women's fantasies, My Secret . Garden. 'Until that book was published, female sexual fantasy did not . exist; not even within the pages of Cosmopolitan, their opinion at the . time being: ""Women do not have sexual fantasies, period. Men do."" 'Friday's book changed all that. Now, exactly forty years on from . Friday's masterpiece, leading sex writer Emily Dubberley is curating a . brand new female fantasy classic for the modern era. Dubberley, who who edits online erotica site Cliterati, told Belle De Jour writer Dr Brooke Magnanti of the Telegraph: 'I wanted to bring attention to female fantasy and remind women that the idea that women have a private sexuality is a recent sexual freedom - and not something to be taken for granted or brushed under the carpet.' Her interviews in the book - released by Black Lace publishers on 12 September for Â£10.99 - are with modern women, and exposed five main areas of female sexual fantasy: submissive fantasies, dominant fantasies, exhibitionism and voyeurism, group sex, and partner fantasies. Dr Magnanti explains the groups here. Exhibitionism and voyeurism both appear on the list of women's five main sexual fantasies . SUBMISSIVE FANTASIES . Fantasies of this nature vary from simply being tied-up to the bed all the way through to having a formalised sex contract complete with rules about which way you look, in the vein of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in 50 Shades Of Grey. Props such as whips, handcuffs, gags and blindfolds are common in this type of fantasy. Submissions could be emotional or physical and may involve role-play - in some cases even going as far as pretending to be a rape victim or a sex slave. EL James' erotic trilogy Fifty Shades Of Grey has been credited with more women enjoying the idea of a sexual experience that involved them being submissive towards a man . DOMINANT FANTASIES . When the roles are reversed and the man becomes the submissive to the female dominatrix. Role-play includes cheating on a partner and being in control of a sex slave. With research suggesting it's very popular, and almost a third of people report having these fantasies at some point, the (sometimes literal ball-buster is a very popular role indeed. The fantasy is about the woman being in control of what happens in bed and inflicting both pleasure and pain as she sees fit. More and more women are relishing the idea of playing a dominatrix ordering around a submissive man in bed . EXHIBITIONISM AND VOYEURISM . Whether you're doing it in the garden, the park, on an aeroplane, in the stationery cupboard at work or simply beside an open window in your own home, the idea of being somewhere where you could get caught or even be watched is a big turn-on for women. Indeed, women in the book talk about the secondary eroticism of watching others having sex, and the excitement of being intimate when you know for certain you are being watched. The idea of watching people having sex or being watched yourself is one of the top turn-ons for women . With so much going on when you have sex as part of a group, many women relish the idea of being very, er, well-looked. There is also an element of anonymity in some cases, or, if you are part of a couple, bringing something new, different and exciting into the bedroom. For others the idea of experimenting with your sexuality by engaging intimately with a member of the same sex is where the fantasy lies. Many women are aroused by the idea of having sex as part of a group, whether because they are keen to experiment with their sexuality or because they want to add another person's sexual nuances to the mix . Quite simply, the idea of having sex with a loving, exclusive partner really gets women hot under the collar. Similarly, the idea of regular sex with a specific partner who is not your own is also a fantasy, for example a celebrity, a friend, or a work colleague crush. Many women fantasise simply about regular sex with a partner - whether that partner is their own or one they like to dream about being intimate with .","Garden Of Desires: The Evolution of Women's Sexual Fantasies .

Ruling: Sir James Munby dismissed Essex council's application to have the name of the women whose child was taken suppressed by the media . A campaign by social workers to stop an Italian mother speaking out about the way she lost her child was an ‘affront to humanity’, a senior judge said yesterday. Sir James Munby, the country’s leading family judge, said the attempt to silence the mother was an ‘affront not merely to the law but also, surely, to any remotely acceptable concept of human dignity and, indeed, humanity itself’. He also said the scandal over Alessandra Pacchieri, who underwent a forced caesarean before her child was taken for adoption, was a ‘final, stark and irrefutable demonstration’ of the need for revolution in openness in the family courts. Sir James, President of the Family Division, took over the case this month after newspapers, including the Mail, revealed the story. The pregnant 35-year-old, who suffers from bipolar disorder, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after suffering a breakdown at Stansted Airport last summer. In secret court hearings, a Court of Protection judge ordered she undergo a compulsory caesarean, and a family court judge in Chelmsford overruled her pleas and ordered that her baby daughter should be adopted in Britain. Yesterday Sir James gave reasons for his ruling on an application by Essex County Council, whose social workers are in charge of the care of the child, banning publication of Miss Pacchieri’s name or picture, or that of the father or family, alongside anything that could identify the baby. The judge said: ‘Given the circumstances of the case and the extreme gravity of the issues which here confronted the courts...  it is hard to imagine a case which more obviously and compellingly requires that public debate be free and unrestricted.’ Mother: Alessandra Pacchieri underwent a forced caesarean and her child adopted after she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after suffering a breakdown at Stansted Airport last summer . Ordering that nothing should be published that identified the child, including the mother’s married name, Sir James said the mother should be free to identify herself by her first and maiden names. ‘The mother has an equally obvious and compelling claim to be allowed to tell her story,’ he said. ‘If ever there was a case in which that right should not be curtailed it is surely this case.’ Sir James also disclosed there were five errors in the application for reporting restrictions initially put forward by Essex, including failures to attach documents, state timings, and supply reasons for various submissions.","Sir James Munby dismissed application to restrict media reports of case .

Defendant: Steven Orloff, pictured, a former official at a Boston school district is accused of posing as a 14-year-old boy online to lure teenage girls into webcam strip shows and abusing his foster daughter . A former official at a Boston school district is accused of posing as a 14-year-old boy online to lure teenage girls into webcam strip shows. Steven Orloff, 48, who worked as director of student services for Stoneham Schools, is also in the center of a civil lawsuit alleging he sexually abused and secretly filmed an already traumatized girl in his bathroom while he was her foster father. He is due in federal court in Boston today to answer criminal charges of producing child pornography, after the Department of Children's and Families stalled on the case for eight months and the alleged pedophile was released on bail. Orloff first came to the attention of police in July 2012, when the mother of a 15-year-old girl in Cumberland, Maine, found her daughter had sent pictures of her genitals to a boy named 'Jason Jaffe' of Sudbury. According to the Boston Herald, Cumberland County officials alerted Framingham police and detectives determined Orloff was Jaffe before searching his Framingham home in December 2012. They seized laptops and hard drives that were filled with pornographic images of eight girls. Among those girls was the traumatized teen in his custody, who was filmed using a camera inside a fake plant that was pointed at the shower, police said. 'The defendant's face is visible on several of these videos, as the camera was recording while he was setting it up,' prosecutors wrote in court documents. Orloff's attorney suggested the camera was used to monitor the girl's hygiene habits. Orloff was arrested over a year ago - on December 12, 2012, - and resigned from his position at the school district in January. Later that month, the Department of Children and Families notified the foster child's biological mother of the 'recent' sexual abuse allegations against Orloff. Home: Orloff allegedly abused and secretly filmed the unnamed teen while she was living with him in his Framingham home, pictured . In April, attorney Christopher Hug . filed a lawsuit in Suffolk County Court on behalf of the teen, alleging . DCF failed to properly vet Orloff, failed to do mandatory checks on his . home and kept the already fragile girl in a 'dangerous and unstable' foster home. The failures, he claimed, resulted in the girl suffering abuse at the hands of Orloff from April 2010 to December 2011. 'They . failed her,' the teen's mother, who regained custody of the girl this . year, told the Herald. 'They took a kid that was already victimized once . and victimized her again and again and again. She can't take care of . herself. Life is very difficult for her.' The Herald reported that in February and March, a grand jury returned two separate indictments charging Orloff with a combined three counts of possession of child pornography, two counts of secretly photographing and videotaping a person in the nude, and one count of posing a child in a state of sexual conduct. On March 15, he was released on $50,000 and $20,000 bail for the two state cases, but then progess on the case seemed to grind to a halt. School: Until January this year, Orloff was director of student services for Stoneham Schools, including the high school, pictured . Frustrated by the lack of action, on December 2, Hug made another filing, this time suing for $75,000 and noting DCF had failed to respond to the previous suit. Two weeks later, on December 13, Orloff was charged with preying on girls across several states between March and August 2012, using the name 'Jason Jaffe' and tricking them into stripping on webcams. The abused teen is now a senior in high school and suffers post-traumatic stress disorder as well as other physical conditions, the latest lawsuit states. 'They have no business doing this if they can't do this properly,' the mother told the Herald. 'Someone really needs to look at this, the way they're treating these kids.' The girl now lives in a on-bedroom apartment with her mother, older sister and her mother's roommate. DCF officials refused to comment on the specifics of the case but defended its screening process. 'Our top goal is to ensure that all of the children being supported by DCF, whether it is at home or in foster care, are safe and well cared for,' a spokeswoman said.","Boston man, Steven Orloff, 48, is in the center of a civil lawsuit alleging he sexually abused and secretly filmed his foster daughter, resulting in child pornography .

The new leader of Pakistani Taliban has promised a wave of terror attacks in revenge for the death of his predecessor who was killed last week in a U.S. drone attack. Hardline commander Mullah Fazlullah was elected leader by Shura, the Taliban's supreme council, following the killing of Hakimullah Mehsud, the in a drone strike on November 1. Fazlullah, known for his fierce Islamist views and rejection of peace talks, led the militants' brutal two-year . rule in Pakistan's north-west valley of Swat in 2007 to 2009, and has been linked to the failed attempt to kill schoolgirl education . activist Malala Yousafzai. Threat: The Pakistan Taliban's new leader has vowed to orchestrate a a wave of terror attacks to avenge the death of his predecessor who was killed last week in a U.S. drone attack . Head of the Shura Asmatullah Shaheen said: 'We will target security forces, government installations, political leaders and police.' He said the Taliban's main targets included army and government installations in Punjab province, the political stronghold of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He added: 'We have a plan. But I want . to make one thing clear. We will not target civilians, bazaars or . public places. People do not need to be afraid'. Pakistan . publicly condemns U.S. drone strikes as a breach of its sovereignty but . in private officials admit the government broadly supports them. Militants are mainly holed up in remote areas on the Afghan border where . the army has no presence. Targeted: Hakimullah Mehsud, former leader of the Pakistani Taliban, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on November 1 . 'Pakistan has full information about drone attacks,' said Shaheen. 'Pakistan is a slave of America. It is an American colony.' The Pakistani Taliban are fighting to topple the government and impose Islamist rule in the nuclear-armed nation. Attacks have been on the rise since . Sharif came to power in May, a concern for global powers already . unnerved by the possible security implications of the planned withdrawal . of most U.S.-led troops from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2014. Mehsud . and his allies had been tentatively open to the concept of ceasefire . talks with the government, but Fazlullah, whose men were behind the . attack on schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai last year, strongly opposes any . negotiations. No meaningful . talks have taken place since Sharif's election and Fazlullah's rise . could signal the start of a new period of uncertainty and violence in . the already unstable region. The Pakistani Taliban have links with al Qaeda and are also allied with but separate from the Afghan Taliban. Fazlullah . fled Swat when the army retook the valley, and is believed to have been . in hiding in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. Pakistan says he has . directed attacks on its soil from across the border. His men were blamed for beheading 17 . Pakistani soldiers in a checkpost attack in June 2012, and he appeared . in a video posted online in September claiming a bomb blast that killed a . major general. In another video he vowed to do whatever it took to enforce sharia across Pakistan. 'We will eliminate anything that will . get in the way of achieving this goal: father or brother, soldier or . police, khan or malik (tribal elders) or mullah,' he said in the undated . footage. Pakistani teenage activist Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban for campaigning for girls' education . The . decision to appoint him leader of the TTP was greeted with heavy . celebratory gunfire in Miranshah, the main town in the North Waziristan . tribal area. Taliban . 'will be more brutal' The TTP, an umbrella organisation grouping . numerous militant factions, has killed thousands of soldiers, police and . civilians since 2007 in its campaign against the Pakistani state. The . killing of Mehsud in North Waziristan on Friday came as government . representatives prepared to meet the militants with a view to opening . peace talks. It drew an angry response from Islamabad, with Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar accusing Washington of sabotaging peace efforts. Prime . Minister Nawaz Sharif was more measured, but said his government was . committed to seeking peace through dialogue and stressing that an end to . bloodshed could not be achieved 'by unleashing senseless force'. Sharif . came to power in May partly on a pledge to hold talks to try to end the . TTP's bloody insurgency, which has fuelled instability in the . nuclear-armed nation. Targeted: Hakimullah Mehsud (seated second from left), leader of the Pakistani Taliban, was killed in a U.S. drone strike . Imtiaz Gul, an author and expert on militancy in Pakistan, warned the choice of such an uncompromising leader would spell problems for the embryonic peace process - and a bloodier campaign from the TTP. 'The nomination of Fazlullah is a . continuation of the terror campaign in Pakistan since the creation of . TTP. It means they are not serious about any talks with the government,' Gul told AFP. 'TTP will be more brutal now.' On October 9 last year a masked gunman in Pakistan's Swat Valley . jumped into a pick-up truck taking a group of girls home from school . and shouted 'who is Malala?' before shooting her in the head. Her . father asked his brother-in-law to prepare a coffin for her funeral but . Malala was flown to the UK and woke up a week later at a hospital in . Birmingham. Following treatment she gradually regained her sight and . voice. The world's reaction to her attempted . murder led to the creation of the Malala Fund, which campaigns for . girls' education around the world. She . has since received multiple awards including the prestigious Sakharov . Prize for free speech, which is awarded by the European Parliament . annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov. Previous winners include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Burma's Aung . San Suu Kyi. No clear progress had been made in peace negotiations before the strike on Mehsud, and Shaheen dismissed the whole process as a sham. 'All the drama in the name of peace talks was staged to please America: on one side government wanted to talk to us and on the other side was talking to the Americans in Washington,' Shaheen said. 'We will not talk to the Pakistani government until it announces the complete enforcement of sharia.'Retired brigadier Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal areas, said Fazlullah's appointment had 'completely changed dynamics of the Pakistani Taliban'. 'Fazlullah was ousted from Swat valley, his hometown, and he is living in Afghanistan. He is wanted by Pakistan, so can he run the organisation smoothly from other side of the Durand Line?' Shah said. The Durand Line is the border with Afghanistan. Fazlullah, believed to be about 39, is the first leader not to come from the Mehsud tribe which dominates the TTP, or even the tribal areas, and Shah said this would weaken the movement's unity. 'There are other groups based in North Waziristan who were helping the Pakistani Taliban but they won't help Fazlullah as he can't even live among them,' he said. The Taliban's ruling council, or shura, took several days to reach a decision, indicating a lack of consensus about who should lead them, but Shaheen insisted the movement was united.","Maulana Fazlullah was elected by the Taliban's supreme council .

Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas, had faced 20 years behind bars but walked away with 10 years of probation Tuesday, something that angered his victims' families. 'Money always seems to keep (Couch) out of trouble,' Eric Boyles, whose wife and daughter were killed in the June 15 crash, told the Star Telegram after sentencing. 'Ultimately . today, I felt that money did prevail. If (he) had been any other youth, . I feel like the circumstances would have been different.' Scroll down for video . No jail: Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas, pictured left on Tuesday, had faced 20 years behind bars but walked away with 10 years probation, something that has angering his victim's families . Couch's blood alcohol reading was .24 . and he also had a Valium in his system after he and a group of friends . stole alcohol from Walmart, drank it and later piled into his pick-up . truck. Driving 70 . miles in a 40 miles per hour zone, he struck and killed four pedestrians . as well as injuring two of his own passengers who remain paralyzed. Youth pastor Brian Jennings; mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby Boyles; and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell all died in the accident. A psychologist called by the defense, Dr. Gary Miller, blamed the teen's behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including 'freedoms no young person should have.' Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences. He added that the boy had an 'intellectual age' of 18 but an 'emotional age' of 12. 'The teen never learned to say that youâ€™re sorry if you hurt someone,' Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you sent him money.' State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense. Drunk: Couch's blood alcohol reading was .24 and he also had a Valium in his system when he killed four people and injured several more on June 15 . Mad: Victim Breanna Mitchell's mother Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced Alex Lumas, whose brother was paralyzed in the accident outside of court . She told the teen that he is responsible . for what happened, but she said she didn't believe he would receive the . therapy he needed in jail. If he violates the terms of his probation, . he could be sent to prison for 10 years. Defense attorneys asked that he be sent . to a private rehabilitation home near Newport Beach, California, which . costs an enormous $450,000 a year. His father said he'd foot the bill. Prosecutors said the juvenile justice system also offered counseling. Breanna's mother, Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced the families of the other victims outside of the courtroom. 'He'll be feeling the hand of God, definitely,' she told WFAA.com. 'He may think he got away with something, but he hasn't gotten away with anything.' Alex Lumas, whose brother was paralyzed in the accident, was also in disbelief at the probation. 'To me, it's not right,' he said. However, the widow of one of the victims looked at the defendant in the courtroom and said, 'Ethan, we forgive you,' which caused Couch to swallowed hard and tear up a bit. Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash . Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup . Couch's family did not comment on the . sentence and the teen wasn't allowed to go home with his parents. He . will remain at a detention center until Boyd decided whether he can go . to the plush California facility. The teen admitted he was the driver of the pickup truck that crashed and started a chain reaction of car crashes and said he and seven friends had been drinking for hours before the June 15 wreck. Some . of them were even caught on surveillance video stealing two cases of . beer from a nearby Walmart in the hours prior to the horrific smash. Couch was charged with four counts of intoxication manslaughter as well as two counts of intoxication assault, according to the Tarrant County district attorney's office. In September, he appeared with his lawyers for a detention hearing and was released to his parents on the . condition that he wear an ankle monitor that allowed officials to keep . track of him. At around 11:45 p.m on June 15, . Couch and a group his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford . F350 pick-up and were barreling down Burleson-Retta Road in southern . Tarrant County when the truck left the road. Killed: Brian Jennings, 41, was parked on the side of the road when Ethan Couch's pickup truck drove into him and three others . Scene: 911 callers described cars everywhere and kids' lying in ditches' after the June 15 smash . Injured: Sergio Molina remains in a coma whilst Soliman Mohmand, right, was seriously injured. They were both riding in Couch's truck when the cash occured . As it careered out of control, it . clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, . who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. They were all killed on impact. It was revealed soon after that . Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit, . though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that . his truck was traveling up to 70 mph when it started the chain reaction . of crashes. The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported. Jennings, a Burleson youth minister, . had stopped to help Mitchell, whose vehicle had a flat tire, and Boyles . and her daughter had come out of their nearby house to assist. The SUV . and all four victims were standing off the roadway. The red pickup then hit Mr Jennings' parked Silverado pickup with two boys inside. Couch's red pickup flew up into the air, flipped and crashed into a tree. None of the teens in the red truck were wearing seat belts, investigators said. They had earlier stolen a couple of . cases of beer from a Walmart in Burleson about an hour before the crash . and prior to that, they had tried unsuccessfully to buy alcohol at a . convenience store. Tragic: Jennings, pictured second from left, was a father of three and a youth minister in Burleson . Crash: One of four vehicles involved in the crash was sent flying into a tree . The theft was recorded by store security cameras. The group had only traveled two blocks when their speeding vehicle came off the road and clipped the broken-down SUV. Soliman Mohmand and Sergio Molina were seriously injured and remains in a coma with a traumatic brain injury. His medical bills have exceeded $600,000 and could climb into the millions if Mr Molina needs permanent round-the-clock care. His parents are now suing Couch and his family for up to $20 million in a separate lawsuit. The Silverado was pushed into a Volkswagen Beetle, which was being driven by Ashlyn Evans, 18. She and her 14-year-old passenger were also injured. Prosecutors chose not to pursue adult charges but to try the driver as a juvenile and to seek a 'determinate sentence.' June's car crash wasn't the first time underage drinking had got Couch in trouble. In February of this year, in the town Lakeside, northwest of Fort Worth, police found Couch with a 12-ounce can of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of vodka in the early hours and gave him two citations - one for being a minor in possession of alcohol, the other for consuming alcohol as a minor.","Ethan Couch, 16, of Keller, Texas, had faced 20 years behind bars but walked away with 10 years probation Tuesday .

The Prince of Wales said he 'deeply troubled' by the plight of Christians in the Middle East . The Prince told a reception for Middle East Christians that bridges between Christianity and Islam were being 'deliberately destroyed' ‘The point though surely is that we have now reached a crisis where bridges are rapidly being deliberately destroyed by those with a vested interest in doing so. ‘This is achieved through intimidation, false accusation and organised persecution including to the Christian communities in the Middle East.’ He said this affected Arab Christians in Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt as well as those from other Arab countries. ‘I have for some time now been deeply troubled by the growing difficulties faced by Christian communities in various parts of the Middle East,’ he said. ‘It seems to me that we cannot ignore the fact that Christians in the Middle East are increasingly being deliberately targeted by fundamentalist Islamist militants.

James 'Whitey' Bulger (pictured in his mugshot) was captured after 16 years on the run . Former Boston crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger was moved to a federal prison in Oklahoma on Monday, although it was not immediately clear why. The 84-year-old was being held at FTC Oklahoma City, according to Chris Burke, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons. The facility is a transfer point and its mission is to house inmates as they are moved between prisons, Burke said. He would not say where Bulger is ultimately headed, citing Bureau of Prisons policy. Prosecutors in Tulsa, Okla., have been deciding whether to move forward with a first-degree murder charge against Bulger in the 1981 killing of businessman Roger Wheeler. Bulger was convicted by a federal jury in Boston earlier this year of killing Wheeler and 10 others. He was sentenced to two life terms. Last month, Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris told the Tulsa World that prosecutors would take into consideration Bulger's federal sentence as they decide whether to try him. Wheeler's daughter, Pam, has said she didn't want Bulger extradited to Tulsa, saying it would be a waste of taxpayer money. 'It took this long to come to a partial resolution. Just let it end there,' she told the Tulsa World in August. Federal prosecutors in Boston, the Tulsa district attorney, Bulger's attorneys and Wheeler's son and his attorney did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Spokesmen for the U.S. Marshals Service in Oklahoma City and Tulsa said they had no information on why Bulger was transferred. Bulger was moved out of Massachusetts to a federal prison Brooklyn, N.Y., in November. A federal judge in Boston last week ordered Bulger to pay $6 million in restitution to Wheeler's family. The mobster previously was ordered to pay $19.5 million in restitution to his other victims' families and forfeit $25 million to the government. Bulger has been transferred to FTC Oklahoma City federal prison (pictured) Investigators found $822,000 in cash stashed in his apartment walls when he was caught in Santa Monica, Calif., after more than 16 years on the run. Earlier this month is was also revealed that a macabre selection of personal items that once belonged to 'Whitey' Bulger are due to be auctioned off to raise funds for his victims. The lists of belongings to be sold includes jewelry, clothing and a boxing mannequin that Bulger used to leave propped near the window of his apartment to make it look as though there was someone keeping lookout. The U.S. Marshals Service is set to go ahead with the sale despite some concerns that it may be perceived as glorifying the convicted mobster if items of little value are included. 'The reality is there are lots of people who would be willing to pay money for some or all of the contents of that apartment, and that money is going to victims and victims' families. 'So we want to do what we can to get as much money as we can for them,â€™ First Assistant US Attorney Jack Pirozzolo told The Boston Globe. Officials believe the highest-value items include a claddagh ring estimated to be worth $48,000 and Bulger's replica 1986 Stanley Cup championship ring valued at about $3,000.","The facility is a transfer point but it is not clear where Bulger is ultimately heading .

A cyclist rented a Boris Bike and used it to bike up one of the toughest stages of Tour de France, before returning the bike to London with just 22 seconds to spare. Robert Holden and two friends hired the bike in London's Southwark before crossing the channel on the Eurostar train with the bike in a van. The trio made the 800 mile journey to Mont Ventoux in southern France where Rob cycled to the top of the 6,273ft peak using the Boris Bike's tree gears. Scroll down for video . One man, one Boris Bike: Robert Holden made the painful journey up Mont Ventoux on a Boris Bike he rented in London and took to the south of France . Mr Holden and his friends Ian Laurie and Matthew Winstone then drove all the way back to London and managed to return the bike just 22 seconds short of the 24-hour deadline which would have incurred a £150 fine. Mr Holden said: ‘We went for a cycle and stopped for a coffee. ‘Out of the blue, Ian just said 'I wonder if you can rent a Boris Bike and take it down to Mont Ventoux, ride it up and bring it back within 24 hours.' ‘We all had a bit of a laugh at that, but then we decided to give it a go.’ Mr Holden paid £2 to hire the heavy 22kg bike at 3:59 on Saturday October 26 from a docking station in Southwark, London. Peak performance: Rob Holden, centre, and pals Ian Laurie and Matthew Winstone at the top of the Mont Ventoux . Fight or flight: The trio rented the bike on a 24-hour-hire and after taking the Eurostar to France they drover 800 miles to Mont Ventoux . Freewheeling: The ride up Mont Venteaux is considered one of the toughest stages of Tour de France, and Rob only had three gears to help him on his way . All the way: Mont Ventoux in Provence, France, is over 6,000ft tall, which Rob managed to conquer in just under three hours . The trio then bundled it into a van, . and drove to the Eurostar, and then made their way more than 720 miles . across France to the base of the 6,270ft mountain. Supported . by his friends, Mr Holden had to battle against cramp and exhaustion to . pedal the 14-mile route to the top of the mountain, and managed to . conquer it in just under three hours. He took the toughest southern route which has an average gradient of 7.43 per cent. Rob . battled 25 degree heat, cramp and a heavy bike, unlike professional . riders who have 20-plus gears and ultra-lightweight frames. Rob said: ‘I had no idea what to expect. I was just taking it one kilometre at a time.’ After reaching the summit the trio drove back to London, where they dropped the bike off at a docking station. Sunset mission: So far, the group's their efforts have raised more than £3,600 for Macmillan Cancer Support . Last minute: Mr Holden managed to dock the bike back in London with just 22 seconds to spare . Filmmaker Ian Laurie, from Kingston, Surrey said: ‘The only real thing we could do was see if we got the fine or not. ‘I never for one second thought that we would be that close. ‘We were the last vehicle that was allowed on the Euro Tunnel going back. Then it was ten minutes late.’ Mr Holden and his friends pushed themselves to the limit to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support, and have already raised an impressive £3,600. Ian said: ‘The charity thing was very much one of the reasons for doing it. It would be a waste not to raise money.’ In 1967, British cyclist Tommy Simpson died of exhaustion trying to reach the summit of Mont Ventoux during the Tour de France. The route from the south is 14 miles long and although a professional rider can manage it around the one hour-mark, a trained amateur cyclist can make the ascent in under three hours.","Robert Holden cycled up Mont Venteaux on a London Boris Bike .

A Nashville bar owner who shot dead a popular country music singer and claimed self defense has been released on bail after being charged with murder. The lawyer for Chris Ferrell, 45, says a private investigator he hired has discovered a bullet lodged in the wall of the Pit and Barrel that police missed. That bullet could help prove that Farrell had no choice but to open fire and killed 44-year-old Wayne Mills, a veteran performer who had Blake Shelton, Jamey Johnson and American Idol winner Taylor Hicks open for him before they became stars. Arrested: Chris Ferrell (left) claims he was only protecting himself when he shot Wayne Mills (right) in the head at his bar last month. He has been charged with second degree murder . Ferrell testified that he had received a dozen death threats since the killing - but insisted he acted in self defense . The Tennessean reports that Farrell's lawyer revealed at a bond hearing that he has received more than a dozen death threats and felt compelled to wear a bulletproof vest to his attorney's office since killing Mills, who was married with a young son. However, Farrell claims that Mills tried to kill and rob him in the wee hours of November 23 when he and friends went to the Pit and Barrel after a night of drinking November 23. The two men were previously friends, according to family members. The next night, SPIKE TV was set to feature the bar on . its show Bar Rescue, which brings in a professional restaurant . consultant to give struggling pubs a make-over. The network canceled the new episode and aired a re-run instead.

The Pit and Barrel bar, where Mills was killed, had recently been featured on an episode of the SPIKE TV reality show 'Bar Rescue' On Monday, he was released after posting $150,000 bail.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:01 EST, 17 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:32 EST, 17 December 2013 . Arrest: Linda Cooney shot her adult son nearly 20 years after she shot dead her ex-husband . A mother who was acquitted after shooting her ex-husband dead 20 years ago is now facing charges for shooting her adult son and paralyzing him - with the same gun. Linda Cooney, 64, was cleared in the death of James Cooney on February 7, 1992 amid a bitter divorce battle after she claimed she had shot him in self defense when he came at her with a knife. Then in June 2011, she shot her son Kevin, 32, in the neck in Las Vegas with the same .357 Magnum after an argument about his girlfriend, whom Linda Cooney had been accused of stalking. Again, Cooney, a former legal secretary, claimed she shot out of self defense after her 6ft 9 inch son, a bouncer at a local club, had attacked her during the argument. Attorneys are now discussing whether . or not a jury in the newest case against Linda Conney should know about . her acquittal; her defense team argues it is not necessary as she was . found not guilty. A hearing will be held on Friday to determine the decision. Interestingly, . Kevin Cooney's testimony when he was just 11 years old had been key to . his mother's acquittal, the prosecutor in the case, Peter Magrino, told . the Sun Sentinel. He had initially told police that his father's hands were empty when he saw him killed on the floor, but in the 1993 trial in Palm Beach, Florida he said that his father may have been holding something. Injured: She claimed her son Kevin, pictured, had tried to attack her so she shot him in self defense. He has become less cooperative with prosecutors since speaking with his mother, they said . Charges: Linda Cooney, charged with murder in her ex-husband's death, is taken into court Tuesday. When the hearing continues Monday, Cooney's attorney, Richard Lubin, will ask Circuit Judge Marvin Mounts Jr. to release Cooney without bond . 'Unfortunately, the children were at . such a young age and had been so traumatized, it presented the . prosecution with a problem in terms of the inconsistency of their . statements,' Magrino said. Las Vegas prosecutors are concerned the son could again testify positively for his mother, who has been speaking to him via his brother's cell phone from hospital, authorities say. The argument that led to the shooting came after years of tension over Kevin Cooney's girlfriend, Karina Taylor, whom he met in 2009 but did not tell his mother. Taylor told authorities his friends had said she should avoid meeting Linda Cooney because she was 'crazy and it would cause nothing but problems'. And when Cooney did finally meet Taylor, she was against the relationship - and allegedly sent her a series of texts calling her a 'stripper,' 'w****,' 'prostitute' and 'skank'. She also reached told a non-profit cancer organization where Taylor volunteered and said that she was laundering money and dealing drugs, prosecutors said. Home: They argued over Kevin's girlfriend, whom Linda had allegedly called a 'skank' and 'w****' Prosecutors added that Taylor was genuinely fearful of Cooney, and this led to the argument on June 28, 2011. Police received two calls alerting them to the scene - one from Cooney and one from Kevin's younger brother, Chris, a Las Vegas police officer. But the calls came after a 15-minute call between Cooney and Chris. By this point, Kevin had been shot and reportedly told his brother he could not feel his legs. When Chris called police, he said that his brother had attacked his mother and that she had shot him, and Linda Cooney called police to say her son had been shot in the neck. Cooney refused to answer about who was responsible for shooting her son, although at one point said: 'The gun, it's my fault, it's my fault.' When police arrived, Kevin was lying down with a cloth pressed to the right side of his neck and when they asked him who had shot him, he refused to say - and kept calling it an accident. In November 2011, Chris visited his brother at the hospital and allowed his mother to talk to his brother on his cell phone - and Kevin has since been less cooperative with prosecutors. Linda Cooney was charged with bribing or intimidating a witness to influence testimony but Chris Cooney was not charged. Chris testified last year that his brother had a history of being physically abusive.","Linda Cooney was acquitted after claiming she shot her ex-husband, James Cooney, in 1992 in self defense as he came at her with a knife .

"By . Emma Thomas . PUBLISHED: . 01:30 EST, 18 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:33 EST, 18 December 2013 . A vulnerable dementia patient filled his house with an estimated £15,000 of unwanted Reader's Digest books - in the hope that he'd win a prize. He bought anything and everything - from history volumes to Noddy hardbacks - and hid them in every available corner of his home. As he bought more books, he became more convinced he was moving up the ladder towards winning a Reader's Digest prize. Books: Catherine Shilling's father   filled his house with £15,000 of Reader's Digest books to 'win a prize' His daughter Catherine Shilling was shocked to learn the truth when he was taken ill and moved in to a care home. She found his house, in Inverness, crammed with books stuffed under cushions, stacked in wardrobes and behind cupboards. He'd also been targeted by more than 100 charities, and his underwear drawers were overflowing with their thank you letters. Mrs Shilling has blasted the unscrupulous sales tactics of those who targeted her 89-year-old father and bombarded him with literature. Her MP, Lib Dem Danny Alexander has called more protection for the vulnerable from cold callers and mail order firms. Mrs Shilling, 53, has asked for her father, who lived in Cradlehall, Inverness, not to be named. She believes he spent around £20,000 altogether, the majority on books and some in response to appeals from more than 100 charities, as well as herbal supplements. 'He was actually running out of hiding places for all the books,' said Mrs Shilling. 'I could not believe my eyes. There was everything from countryside and animal books to Noddy hardbacks.' More than 127 charities were also in regular contact with and a paper trail suggests he gave away at least £4,000 to good causes in recent years. Danny Alexander MP, who is also Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has now intervened to try and help the family recover some of the money and investigate the wider issue of how the vulnerable and elderly can be protected from cold callers and mail order firms. Mrs Shilling, of Castlehill Drive, Cradlehall, said the last the family knew of her father's finances he had about £17,000 in his account. 'When we saw how much he had in the last month or two it was down to about £5,000,' she said. 'We think he spent more than this over the last few years. He was going in and withdrawing £900 in cash at a time and what he was doing with the money we do not know. All we do know is he was paying out about £200 a week and he was spending less and less on food.' Help: Danny Alexander MP, who is also Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has now intervened to try and help the family recover some of the money . Her father kept up to date with his bill payments, however, and has left no debts. As well as books and charities, he was persuaded to buy hundreds of pounds worth of herbal supplements by telesales companies that phoned him at home. Some of the tablets could have had a dangerous interaction with his blood-thinning medication and one of the mail-order herbal supplement firms has agreed to refund the family £500. Although they have done nothing illegal, Mrs Shilling believes some of the sales tactics used on her father were unscrupulous. She said Reader's Digest sent him letters saying the purchases earned him honorary points on its customer database for prize draws and he started to believe he was going to win something. 'He was telling us they were going to collect him in a car and take him down to London,' she said. 'He was even asking us if we were free on those dates because he was allowed to take us too.' Readers Digest declined to comment on the case. Yesterday Mr Alexander said everyone had a duty to care for the elderly and companies and charities using direct debit were no exception. 'I am looking into this with my Highland Lib-Dem colleagues and we will do everything we can both to ensure a satisfactory outcome for the family and to make it clear to all companies and charities that they must take a responsible approach to direct debits,' he said. Highland Council's champion for older people, Kate Stephens, said the case highlighted a growing problem and the local authority was organising a seminar to address the issue. 'The environment is changing,' she said. 'People are not aware of all the new ways for financial abuse to occur. The support that is offered needs to be reviewed to make sure that it is fit-for-purpose.' However, Cradlehall councillor Carolyn Caddick believed the organisations involved had done nothing illegal. 'You couldn't even argue that they were morally wrong because they probably were not even aware of the situation this chap was in,' she said. 'This is just something that people need to be aware of, about how vulnerable people are when they are elderly.'","House in Inverness crammed with hundreds of books .

On the day that Guinness Book of World Records owner James Pattison was named as Canada's richest person, Bloomberg announced that Ms Brydson had come in as the third wealthiest overall. She is the cousin of David K R Thomson, . heir to the Thomson media empire, and she owns a 23 per cent stake in . the Woodbridge firm that manages the family's assets. But she lives such a private life that even her age and details about whether she is married or has children is not known. The Thomson family, of which Sherry Brydson is a part, made their money in newspapers. Ms .

Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright, as well as Officer . Woljciech Braszczok, made court appearances last week on October 11. Chance was in court on Friday morning and was the second indicted, following Robert Sims.

'Manipulation': Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, spoke at the Home Affairs Select Committee to dispute Met chief evidence . The police watchdog has told MPs that it is 'almost certain that some manipulation is going on' in the recording of crime statistics by officers. Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, told the Home Affairs Select Committee 'in anything that gets measured' there is an 'incentive, resisted by many, to manipulate the process to make your own performance look good'. And Mr Winsor, the first chief inspector of constabulary to come from a non-policing background, disputed evidence given by the chief of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who claimed inspectors lauded his force's crime data as 'competent and reliable'. His comments come after whistle-blowing police constable James Patrick told the Public Administration Select Committee officers routinely massage crime statistics to boost their forces' performance figures. Asked by Committee chair Keith Vaz MP if there is manipulation occurring, Mr Winsor, a former rail regulator and lawyer, said: 'It is almost certain that some manipulation going on. The question is where, how much, how severe.' He earlier added: 'The fact is in anything that gets measured, once those who are being measured, whose performance are being measured, work out how the system works, there's an incentive, resisted by many, to manipulate the process as to make your own performance look good.' Mr Vaz said Sir Bernard and Sir Hugh Orde, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), had not told the Committee earlier this month that they believe fiddling of statistics is currently occurring. Mr Winsor said: 'Sir Bernard gave evidence, I think to this committee on December 3, where he said that in 2012 HMIC inspected the Met and found their figures in terms of crime recording were ""competent and reliable"". 'I've written to Sir Bernard about this because what HMIC in fact said was that it looked at ""244 incidents logged by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), 30 had been wrongly closed without a crime being raised, while in overall terms the MPS continues to improve its crime and incident data quality, this indicates that crime and ASB (anti-social behaviour) data recorded in London gives some cause for concern"". Dispute: Chief of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, claimed inspectors lauded his force's crime data as . 'competent and reliable' but Mr Winsor has written to him to dispute this . 'So there is a big difference between ""some cause of concern"" and ""competent and reliable"". I have not yet received Sir Bernard's response.' Mr Vaz asked the chief inspector if he was still 'very concerned'. Mr Winsor added: 'I'd just like him to explain the disparity I'd referred to. But with crime recording, some people will call it fiddling, some people will call it honest mistakes, some people will call it the perfectly legitimate exercise of professional judgment.' Asked what he would call it, the chief inspector said: 'It depends on the circumstances of individual cases.' Mr Patrick - who is currently awaiting disciplinary proceedings - also told the Public Administration Select Committee that serious offences including rape and child sex abuse are being recorded as 'crime-related incidents' or 'no crimes'. And a former chief inspector in West Midlands Police told the same hearing about techniques used by officers to improve performance figures known as 'cuffing', 'nodding', 'skewing' and 'stitching'.","Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, spoke to MPs .

Two murderers who escaped from prison by using forged release documents have been caught after spending nearly a month on the run. Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker were taken back into custody on Saturday night after being found in a Panama City Beach motel. Florida police said the men, who were both serving life sentences, were arrested without incident, but it has not been said what led police to the Coconut Grove Motor Inn. Scroll down for video . Great escape: Joseph Jenkins, left, and Charles Walker, right, have been caught after using forged documents to get out of prison where they were both serving life sentences . Walker and Jenkins were mistakenly . released from a Florida prison with forged paperwork, and even showed up . to another prison facility three days later to register as ex-cons. Jenkins, 34, walked out of Franklin . Correctional Institution in Carrabelle, Florida, on September 27 after . submitting a forged order from a judge that reduced his life sentence to time served. Days later, Walker, also 34, used the same paperwork to get his sentence 'reduced' to time served, as well. He was released on October 8. The men were so convinced that their . scheme had worked, they showed up at another correction facility to . register as ex-cons that had been released into the community. Family members and friends of two convicted killers initially thought their release was legitimate and spent time with them, even planning a birthday party for one. But in the weeks after their release, relatives learned that the men were freed because of forged documents that reduced their life sentences to 15 years. Caught: Both convicts were arrested at the Coconut Grove Motel in Panama City on Saturday evening . Henry Pearson, who was described as . Jenkins' father figure, said he brought the convict clothes when he . picked him up from prison, and drove him to see his mother and . grandmother. Mr Pearson . planned a birthday party at his home for Jenkins, who turned 34 on . October 1, a few days later, but he never showed up. At a news conference on Saturday, family members of both men pleaded with them to turn themselves in. 'We . love you. We believe in you. We just want you to surrender yourself to . someone you trust who will bring you back here safely. We don't want any . harm to come to you,' Walker's mother, Lillie Danzy said. Ms . Danzy said the family thought their prayers had been answered when she . got the call saying Walker would be released October 8. She . was so shocked and delighted that she called the prison back twice to . make sure it was true, and was told the same information each time, an . attorney for the family said. Appeal: Walker's mother, Lillie Danzy, her husband Jeff, listen as Jenkins' uncle, Henry Pearson, calls for the men to turn themselves in . Manhunt: The families of the two escaped convicts made an emotional appeal to them a few hours before Jenkins and Walker were caught . Walker was taken by prison staff to a bus station so he could travel home, and the convict even attended church during his pseudo release. His mother said the family have been cooperating with authorities and made no attempts to hide him. Just like Jenkins, Walker registered . as a felon at the jail three days after he was released. Both men signed . paperwork, were fingerprinted and even photographed before walking out . of the jail without raising any alarms. By . registering, the men drew less attention to their forged release. Had . one of the murder victim's families not contacted prosecutors, . authorities might not have known about the mistaken releases. Orange-Osceola State Attorney Jeff Ashton told the Orlando Sentinel he found out about Jenkins' escape after his victim's family told prosecutors that he had been released. That led to the discovery that Walker also was out of prison. Emotional: Lillie Danzy says she called the prison twice after being told her son was due to be released early . 'We're looking at the system's breakdown, I'm not standing here to point the finger at anyone at this time,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said on Friday. The Corrections Department has since changed the way it verifies early releases and state legislators promised to hold investigative hearings. Chief . Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, believes . that the two inmates had outside help in forging the documents. Judge Perry told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I strongly believe they had some help. It is unlikely [the documents] were produced by the inmates.' However he has few leads on who might have falsified the documents and it is unclear how they were filed. Investigations are ongoing. Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, had his signature forged on fake court documents that led to the early release of two convicted murderers . The court orders appeared legitimate, said Judy Perry,  with the county seal, letterheads and identical formatting to real papers. Whoever created the documents had 'elementary knowledge', according to the judge. It is not the first time a Florida convict has used a forged signature from a judge to secure his release. When Judge Thomas McGrady heard of Walker and Jenkins' escape his 'Reaction was ""Oh no, not again"",' he told WTSP. In 2009 Nydeed Nashaddai, 44, used a forged court order bearing Judge Thomas's name to escape prison, where he was serving a sentence for theft. Walker and Jenkins were doing time for more serious crimes however. Walker was serving life for a second-degree murder committed in Orange County in April 1999. Set free: Both men walked out of the Franklin Correctional Facility in Florida after corrections officers were duped by falsified court documents saying the prisoners had been granted an early release . He told investigators at the time that . he had intended to frighten 23-year-old Cedric Slater whom he said had . been intimidating him. Walker fired three shots, one of which struck . Slater and killed him. Jenkins was also serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of a father of six in Orlando in September 1998. Jenkins and his cousin Angelo Pearson had planned a home invasion at the home of Roscoe Pugh, 28. The father of six died from gunshot wounds.","Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, went on the run after being accidentally released from a Florida prison in the last month .

One thousand babies die each year after midwives fail basic checks on mothers-to-be, a report shows. Pregnant women are facing a 'postcode lottery' researchers at the Perinatal Institute say. Some midwives are lacking training in how to spot the warning sigsn of stillbirth and Professor Jason Gardosi, from the institute, urged the NHS to follow guidance. The Times reports hospitals are not using tape measures and charts properly and one in every 200 children is stillborn which gives the UK one of the worst records in the developed world. NHS England says it is urging hospitals to improve measurements of baby growth but Professor Gardosi said the equivalent of a 'classroom of children a week' are dying. His team has worked in the West Midlands and has cut stillbirth rates by 22 per cent over the last five years but nationally rates have not fallen for 20 years. Research published in the BMJ Open medical journal shows hospitals in the North East and Yorkshire use training and stillbirths had fallen as a result. Only 46 hospitals, which amounts to a third of all births in England, have staff trained in spotting growth problems. Professor Gardosi wants to make sure hospitals are using the approved system designed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. He told the Times: 'We hope it will not become a postcode lottery for mothers... at a cost of 50p per pregnancy, the programme should be affordable for even the most cash-strapped unit.' Catherine Calderwood, national clinical director for maternity at NHS England, said the system should be used around the country. Training: Only 46 hospitals have staff trained.

A woman who adopted a dog found wandering the streets following a tornado last month has agreed to return the pet to its original family. Kyla Robinson of Mellott, Indiana said her three-year-old boxer, Rosco, was due to be returned to the Clinton County Humane Society on Tuesday and reunited with the family on Wednesday. The new owner, who has not been identified, had initially refused to return the animal but was reportedly so moved by stories of the family's heartbreak that she agreed to return the dog. The family had tied Rosco outside their house in Mellott, Indiana on November 17 and left for a . baby shower before the tornado ripped through the small town, damaging . the home. Missed: The Robinson family, pictured left and right with their dog Rosco, will be reunited with their beloved after he was taken to a shelter and adopted following a tornado in their town last month . They returned to . find Rosco missing and a day later, he was found wandering in Clinton . County, around 45 minutes away, without any identification or tag. He . was taken to the Clinton County Humane Society and, in keeping with the . shelter's policies, he was put up for adoption and a woman adopted him . five days later. The Robinsons, including 10-year-old daughter Madison, posted information about Rosco on a lost pets Facebook page and found out what had happened to their pet in early December. They pleaded for the pet's return but the new owner initially refused. But now Robinson said that Rosco's adoptive owner agreed to give him up after she was moved . by media accounts of how much the family missed their beloved pet. Damage: They returned home to find their house badly damaged, pictured, and their dog gone . Debris: The dog had been tied up outside at the time and was found 45 minutes away the next day . 'This . lady does have a heart, and she was just thinking of her children too,' Robinson told the Journal & Courier. 'It's not her fault that Rosco . went missing, and I am so thankful that she is giving Rosco back.' She had previously said that her 10-year-old daughter was devastated by the loss of her animal. 'She still cries,' her mother had said. 'She gets . upset, but she tries to let go because she thinks that hopefully these . people will have a heart and give him back.' But following their plea, the shelter's staff said they were unable to help. Jim Tate, the director of the human society, said that once an adoption takes place, the new family legally owns the dog and the shelter is unable to return the animal. Hopeful: Kyla Robinson and her 10-year-old daughter Madison, pictured, found that their dog had been adopted and are now pleading with the other family to return their pet . Adoption center: Another family adopted him from Clinton County Humane Society, pictured, and the center said that the situation is out of their hands as the dog legally belongs to the new family . 'Unfortunately it is out of our hands,' Tate had said. The . family thought they might have some success when, with shelter . officials as mediators, they spoke with the new owners about the dog's . return. But a deal didn't last long. Tate said sympathized with both parties. 'For the original owner, I totally understand that they want their dog back. ... I would want him back if he was mine,' he said. 'On the other side, the lady who adopted him said he is bonding with the family and is perfect for what she was looking for.

Pellets: Jack Hewitt, from Edinburgh, who yesterday pleaded guilty to a charge of culpably and recklessly  discharging a firearm on May 30 . A teenager who shot and injured primary school children with an air weapon was ‘just letting off steam’, a court has been told. Jack Hewitt, 17, opened fire with a BB gun from a window at his parents’ home, hitting several youngsters enjoying their lunchtime break in the playground. One child was struck on the forehead and another just below the eye by the plastic pellets. The youngsters at Gilmerton Primary, Edinburgh, suffered red marks and bruising, although none was seriously injured. Hewitt yesterday pleaded guilty to a charge of culpably and recklessly  discharging a firearm on May 30. Depute fiscal Susan Dickson told Edinburgh Sheriff Court: ‘The children were out playing on their lunchtime break when a number of them reported being hit by what they thought were stones. Later, white plastic ball bearings were found and it became clear that they had been hit by pellets.’ Miss Dickson said that when police called at Hewitt’s home he appeared to be ‘tearful’ and told officers that he had shot the BB gun but said he did not mean to hit anyone. ‘He said he had shot from the bathroom window but was unable to explain why he had done something so stupid,’ Miss Dickson said. Hewitt was taken to the city’s St Leonard’s police station for questioning. Miss Dickson told the court Hewitt had said: ‘That was me. I was just letting off some steam. I’ll never do it again.’ She added: ‘He said that he was sitting higher exams at the time and that the stress had got to him.’ Hewitt’s solicitor handed a letter from Hewitt’s school principal to Sheriff Isabella McColl but it was  not read to the court. The case was adjourned to January 21 for social inquiry reports. Police Scotland confirmed that the weapon used was a BB gun, which was seized by them. The force is now awaiting a destruction order from the court. Chief Inspector Mark Patterson, local commander for Police Scotland covering the south of Edinburgh, said: ‘This was a reckless act against young children, which had the potential to cause serious injury. ‘This incident caused a lot of concern in the school and local community and I am pleased that we were able to arrest this young man quickly in order to keep people safe.’ Jordan Lennox, who was hit in the arm in the attack: Police Scotland confirmed that the weapon used was a BB gun, which was seized by them. The force is now awaiting a destruction order from the court . Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: ‘The public will hope this disgraceful and extraordinarily dangerous act is met with a tough sentence. Pathetic excuses like he was “blowing off steam” should be completely dismissed.’ The debate over the control of air weapons has raged since the death of a two-year-old Glasgow boy in 2005 after he was shot in the head with an air rifle. Drug addict Mark Bonini was given a life sentence for the murder. Last December, the SNP unveiled plans to force owners of Scotland’s estimated 500,000 airguns to apply for a licence or hand in the weapons in a bid to cut the number of offences relating to their use.","Jack Hewitt fired ball bearings at schoolchildren from window of his home .

A woman died after she was attacked by her husband who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, an inquest has heard. Christine Williamson, 62, had repeatedly told authorities that she was being assaulted by her mentally ill husband James. A coroner ruled today that her death could have been prevented if the officials had shared information about the threats that she faced. Doctors said that Mr Williamson 'would not have known what he was doing' when he struck his wife a fatal blow, due to his advanced dementia. Inquest: A hearing at Wellington Civic Centre, pictured, determined that the death of 62-year-old Christine Williamson could have been prevented . Following the deadly incident he was taken into a special care home, but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge him with a crime. Mrs Williamson, from Telford in Shropshire, died from bruising on the brain on October 31 last year, two weeks after she was hit on the head by her husband. Her death triggered a domestic homicide review to identify what could have been done to prevent her death, the findings of which have been reported to the Home Office. The inquest at Wellington Civic Centre found that social workers, police, doctors and mental health nurses all knew about isolated incidents of aggression from Mr Williamson. However, no one was able to flag up the pattern of assaults which made him a danger to his wife because they did not know all the facts. Shropshire coroner John Ellery said that if all the professionals involved in the case had communicated with each other, they could have taken evasive action. He said: 'If early action had been taken, Mrs Williamson would have been protected and her death was preventable.' After the inquest, Chris Ammonds of West Mercia Police said: 'This is a sad and tragic case where the next of kin have not only lost their mother to her injuries, but also their father to his illness. 'This matter has been subject to a domestic homicide review panel to ensure that any lessons to be learnt by all the agencies involved are identified and acted upon. 'The CPS carefully reviewed a file of evidence and has taken into account the illness that Mr Williamson is suffering and the care and treatment being provided by the NHS mental health service. 'Following this they have made the decision that it is not in the public interest to take court proceedings against Mr Williamson in connection with the death of his wife.'

Stewart Marshall was jailed for eight years at Bradford Crown Court after targeting elderly, disabled and blind victims . A heartless conman scoured neighbourhoods for the most elderly and vulnerable people so that he could fleece them of their savings and valuables, a court heard. Stewart Marshall kept notes of the names and addresses of targets alongside descriptions such as ‘nutty old bat’, ‘Mrs disabled’ and ‘Mr has Alzheimer’s’. Posing as a builder, he offered them home improvement work that was either not done at all or carried out to a poor standard. The victims, who had an average age of around 90, handed over thousands of pounds while one woman was persuaded to give up her wedding, engagement and eternity rings. Marshall was jailed for eight years at Bradford Crown Court after being branded ‘mean, selfish and greedy’ by the judge. He was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to burgle over a two-year period and converting criminal property. The court heard Marshall, of Wyke, Bradford, went cold-calling with his ‘conman’s kit’ of bogus identification cards and badges. He scouted residential areas for the easiest prey and tricked his way into the homes of very elderly people with dementia, mobility problems and blindness. Marshall, 44, pretended to be a builder, but in reality was a cruel conman and heroin addict who used much of the cash to buy drugs. Judge John Potter said Marshall primarily ‘extorted’ money from victims. The first victim was Maurice Lobley, 81, who suffered from dementia and was targeted weeks before his death in September 2011. He paid £15,000 for building work on a driveway and £7,000 for a single window. Widow Joan Cottam, 90, issued eight cheques worth more than £11,000 to replace windows that did not need any work. Mrs Cottam said that a man involved in the work persuaded her to hand over her wedding, engagement and eternity rings. Marshall stole the jewellery of another victim, Amy Roper, 94, who is partially blind and disabled, while he pretended to check a water leak. Judge John Potter told Marshall: 'This was mean, selfish offending inspired by greed,' as he sentenced him to a stint behind bars at Bradford Crown Court, pictured . Frank Perkins, 66, who is wheelchair-bound, had a wallet containing £115 stolen. In . June this year Marshall was put under surveillance by police. He . visited an 89-year-old partially-sighted woman who gave him £30 to tidy . her garden, only for officers to film him rolling tin foil ‘consistent . with a drug addict getting a fix’. Passing . sentence, Judge Potter said Marshall had not shown a ‘shred of remorse’ and added: ‘The premises were targeted on the basis of their occupants . being vulnerable or elderly and all were in their homes when you stole . from them. 'This was mean, selfish offending inspired by greed.’ After . the case Mr Lobley’s son David said: ‘I hope his sentence acts as a . deterrent to others who might be thinking of attempting the same thing.

When Freddy Taylor started waking up and playing loudly during the early hours, his parents hoped it was a phase he would grow out of. Unfortunately that didn’t happen. The three-year-old’s nightly play sessions lasting two hours or more became so exhausting that his sleep-deprived parents resorted to drastic action. After taking expert advice they stripped his bedroom of toys and all colourful objects so his imagination wouldn’t be stimulated when he woke up. Freddy Taylor, 3, wakes up so much in the night that his exhausted parents, Kathryn (pictured) and Ryan, took him to see sleep specialists . The tips his mother Kathryn Taylor, 33, received during recent ‘sleep therapy’ sessions did improve the youngster’s sleeping - especially on the two nights a week after attending pre-school . Mother-of-two Mrs Taylor and her husband Ryan, 36, a computer technician, were at their ‘wits’ end’ after enduring two years of sleep deprivation which started when Freddy was one. She said: ‘He will pretend he’s playing with his friends. He uses the same name as his friends at school, and tells me sometimes that he’s been “in a film” with his friends. ‘It sounds like a dream, but we’ve taken him to a sleep clinic where they observed his patterns and said he is definitely awake when he’s playing. ‘I call it sleep parties because he is really having a great time. He isn’t attention-seeking, in fact if you go in, he doesn’t want to be disturbed in his games.’ Freddy goes to bed at 7pm each night and never has a problem nodding off. He can stay awake for up to four hours a night - although it is usually two or three - and is woken at 7am regardless of what happened at night. They were advised to remove anything colourful from his room as it could stimulate his imagination when he wakes up in the night . As a result his parents get about five hours sleep and luckily his one-year-old brother Morgan is in a separate room and manages to sleep through the noise. ‘Freddy has a very vivid imagination. He can be incredibly loud, so much so that I actually went round next door to apologise when our new neighbours moved in,’ said Mrs Taylor, from Sheffield. The sleep practitioner advised them to remove anything with colour that may catch his eye. ‘We’ve taken down his posters, taken out his toys, that sort of thing. His bedroom is painted a calming green colour already so we haven’t had to redecorate.’ They also now given Freddy an extra evening meal of foods such as bananas, peanut butter and oats which help release the brain’s sleep-inducing chemical melatonin. His parents were also told to put him to bed at 7pm and wake him up at 7am regardless of how much of the night he spends awake . But despite these tactics the battle continues. And the Easter break from school caused the ‘parties’ between 1 and 3am to start again every night. ‘It’s utterly exhausting because Ryan and I are obviously not getting much sleep,’ said Mrs Taylor. ‘And because he’s been up all night, Freddy is often difficult during the day, he’s grumpy or wants to go to sleep, so it’s been really challenging dealing with him.’ The parents hope the situation will improve when Freddy starts school full-time. They were also told to give him foods - such as bananas and oats - before bed because these encourage the brain to release sleep chemicals . Vicki Dawson, Founder of The Children's Sleep Charity, said: ‘We take a behavioural approach to children with sleep problems like Freddy’s, any medical problems we refer them to experts. ‘Structure is essential, parents have to implement the guidance we give them for the therapy to work. ‘We offer dietary advice, recommend setting strict bed times and pre-bedtime activity to calm children down. ‘We also recommend taking items out of bedrooms which will catch a child's attention when they wake up. ‘In the vast majority of cases, parents see improvements. We've collected figures which say 89 per cent of children have improved. ‘The other 11 per cent might be parents who haven't implemented what we've recommended, or a child with a medical issue.’","Freddy Taylor wakes up and plays loudly for more than two hours a night .

Controversy: The Bridgend Conservative Club allegedly hosted meetings of a swingers' group . Group: Swingers took to a website to boast about their activities during the meetings . Members of Fab Swingers, a website with the motto 'by swingers, for swinging, for free', claim they held events at the club in South Wales in October and again last Saturday. The organiser of the parties wrote online: 'We must all behave. Everyone who played in view of everyone at the last is skating on thin ice at this next one and that's including myself!!!' She later added: 'Just to remind everyone there is no play on the premises and no fighting. 'Take it outside if there is a problem and if there is any fighting I won't hold another social and it will be spoilt for everyone else. 'The same goes for not playing, I know I was no angel last time but I fully intend to set a good example to all this time!!!!'

Popular: One Direction are currently topping the perfume charts and outselling the others by five to one . Number one: One Direction's frangipani infused Our Moment costs a pocket money friendly £17 .

Behind the American singer are Britney Spears and Nicky Minaj whose Fantasy and Pink Friday fragrances occupied third and fourth slots in the chart compiled by retailer, feelunique. Rounding out the top five is Justin Bieber with his third fragrance, The Key, which has yet again proved popular with teens.

But that's what you'll be expected to fork out if you order a glass of mulled wine from the barkeep at Hush in Mayfair, west London, this year. The Mayfair Mulled Wine, marketed as the world's most expensive, has been crafted by Hush's award-winning mixologist Pedro Solorzano, . and the alcoholic base of this winter special is a 2008 Château Grand Puy . Ducasse and the prize-winning 18-year-old Dalmore whisky. The £50 mulled wine is made with the usual spices, plus tonka berries and saffron, which is worth more by weight than gold . Saffron, left, and tonka beans, right, provide some of the depth of flavour in Hush's pricey mulled wine . Along with . familiar mulling spices such as cloves, bay leaves and cinnamon sticks, . Solorzano has combined the more exotic luxury flavours of Organic goji . berries, anisette balls, tonka beans and saffron, which is renowned for . being worth more than gold. Finishing the tipple off is a glug of . organic Sundance apple juice, made fresh from seasonal ingredients . selected each morning from New Covent Garden Market. Solorzano said: 'The Château Grand Puy . Ducasse, 5ème Cru Classé, is 62 per cent cabernet sauvignon, 38 per cent Merlot, which . make it ideally suited to combine with heady spices such as saffron, . anisette, Tonka beans, cloves, cinnamon sticks and bay leafs. 'The spices . help to explore the aromas of the wine and bring out its magnificent . flavours, while the antioxidants of the Goji berries help to balance the . acidity from the spices. 'In particular, the perfumed fragrance of the . tonka beans lends a rich vanilla aroma, which is enhanced by the depth . of the saffron strands and the liquorish notes of the anisette balls.

New details are emerging about the death of the Hawaii Health Director who authorized the release of President Obama's birth certificate in 2011 who was killed in a plane crash on Wednesday. Loretta Fuddy, 65, was the only person on the aircraft to die  when the plane went down in the Pacific near a remote island. The others, including the pilot, were either rescued by boat or swam ashore. In the final moments of her life, Fuddy . clung to the hand of her deputy after the plane taking them back to . Honolulu crashed in the ocean off the island of Molokai. Scroll down for video . Only victim: Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy was the only death among nine aboard the Cessna Grand Caravan that crashed in the ocean near Molokai, Hawaii on Wednesday . Tribute: Governor Neil Abercrombie (right) said state Health Department Director Loretta Fuddy (left) was loved and respected. Fuddy was the only person to be killed in a plane crash on Wednesday . Fuddy was on her way back to Honolulu . after a visit to what was once Hawaii's leper colony on the island of . Molokai when, officials said Thursday, the Cessna Grand Caravan went . down due to engine failure. Fuddy, who gained notoriety in 2011 for her role in making President Barack Obama's birth certificate public, was one of nine people onboard the flight that went down. In the water, Fuddy held hands with deputy director Keith Yamamoto as he tried to help her relax, said the Rev. Patrick Killilea, who consoled Yamamoto after the ordeal. 'He recounted how he said he helped Loretta into her life jacket and he held her hand for some time,' the priest said. 'They were all floating together and she let go and there was no response from her.' Help: A U.S. Coast Guard rescue team poses in front of a helicopter used in the rescue at Kapolei, Hawaii, on Thursday. The small plane crashed Wednesday, killing Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy. Coast Guard rescuers who arrived after making the half-hour flight from Oahu to the neighbor island said Thursday that the single-engine turboprop aircraft wasn't visible when they got there, only the nine passengers floating across about a half-mile of water littered with random debris. The rescuers in two helicopters and an HC-130 airplane said the people were in clusters and acted calm when help arrived. 'I'm sure they were exhausted,' Aviation Survival Technician P.J. Ornot said. The passengers were wearing inflatable yellow life jackets, floating on their backs in the water, he said. Rescue swimmer Mark Peer said when he swam to Fuddy, she was unresponsive and he couldn't find a pulse. 'It was not a good feeling,' he said. The incident occurred when the single engine of the 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan failed soon after it took off from Molokai and made its turn toward Honolulu, said Richard Schuman, owner of Makani Kai Air, operator of the plane. The crash was calm, orderly and none of the passengers seemed to be very distressed or have any major injuries, said the passenger who swam to shore. Tragic: A memorial for Loretta Fuddy, the director of the state Department of Health, is displayed outside the department in Honolulu on Thursday . C. Phillip Hollstein recalled Friday that the plane had just taken off from Molokai and was making a turn toward Honolulu when it seemed like something on the plane broke. 'We probably weren't a minute out,' he said. 'It wasn't real loud or anything. Just a muffled bang. Then we were a glider.' The plane lost power, he said, and the pilot maneuvered a water landing on the plane's belly. 'Everyone was real quiet. We hit (the water) and it was all about getting the belts off,' he said, describing how everyone started putting on life jackets and remained on the plane until it seemed to start sinking. 'There wasn't panic or anything. It was very orderly,' he said. 'It wasn't like any of the movies or the TV shows.' Bobbing in the water, Hollstein noticed the pilot and seven other passengers seemed fine. 'I didn't want to sit out there bobbing, so I figured I'd take a shot at going to the shoreline.' Sad: Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie, right, speaks at a gathering in memory of Loretta Fuddy on Thursday . He guesses the swim to the rugged shoreline took an hour and a half. He was surprised to hear later that one of the passengers, Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy, had later died. 'She was doing fine out of the airplane,' Hollstein said. 'Her assistant was really watching her. He was taking care of her.' Gov. Neil Abercrombie . said Fuddy was loved and respected. 'Her knowledge was vast, her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience,' he said. About 100 Health Department . employees lined up to pay their respects to Fuddy's family members, who . attended a gathering in her memory at the department's parking lot . Thursday. After the crash, three survivors . were transported by helicopter to a Honolulu hospital. Two declined to . be medically evacuated, officials said.
