So the man who could easily have been our Deputy Prime Minister today contemplates a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice, though few tears will be shed by fellow politicians even among his own Lib-Dem colleagues. And for what? Three points on his driving licence for speeding; three measly points which would have been added to those he already had for using his mobile phone while driving, and possibly cost him his licence. No issue so penetratingly defines the ferocious political ambition of Chris Huhne, nor his stupidity and lack of judgement. Guilty: Chris Huhne, with his partner Carina Trimingham, speaks to the media, outside Southwark Crown Court . His resignation as an MP brings to a full stop the rise of a brilliant man whose life has been marked as much by lies and obfuscation as by the smooth progress characterised by the ease with which he stepped from Westminster school to a first class PPE degree at Oxford. This time last year, Huhne was in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, consummate politician, and one who views any small blemish on his record as a hindrance to advancement. That old summons for speeding on the M11 had been long forgotten. The day when it had dropped through the door of his Hampshire home in June, 2003, Huhne wasn’t even a member of Parliament – that was still two years away. But the then MEP for South East England was always planning a bigger future, at Westminster. A man marked out by his arrogance, he had no intention of remaining merely one of those Euro MPs most people have never even heard of. His practice of dealing expediently with inconveniences went back to his Oxford days at Magdalen College. Then, to help smooth his path to the executive of the university Labour Club, he dropped the name by which he had always been known, Christopher Paul-Huhne, and adopting the chirpy Chris Huhne. That speeding summons had to be similarly dealt with and, as we now know and he will forever bitterly regret, the police accepted the story that his Greek-born, economist wife Vicky Pryce, mother of his three children aged 18 to 25, was driving the speeding car, not him. Ex-wife: Vicky Pryce, Chris Huhne's former wife, arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London for her trial hearing accused of perverting the course of justice. She denies the offence on the grounds of marital coercion . She took his three points. And that would have been that. For her part Vicky Pryce denies the offence of perverting the course of justice on the grounds of marital coercion. But as she would discover, this was not the only time she would be used as a prop to promote his driven political ambitions. Speed forward to the general election of 2005, where Huhne is fighting the Tory-held marginal of Eastleigh, Hampshire, and we find his election literature desperately gushing: ‘Family matters to me so much. Where would we be without them?’ Affair: Chris Huhne, right, arrives at court for his hearing, with Carina Trimingham . Pre-election leaflets shoved through voters’ front doors showed pictures of his wedding with the caption ‘Getting married does not seem like 26 years ago’, and another picture of him feeding a baby, with the caption, ‘I took to becoming a father so seriously I gave up smoking’. Just how important family matters really were to Chris Huhne became crystal clear in June, 2010 when it emerged that, for perhaps two years, he had been having a secret affair with his former press officer, Carina Trimingham, who was in a civil partnership with a woman. He had even been using his Hampshire constituency home for trysts with Miss Trimingham, now 45, and 13 years younger than his wife. Disclosure of the affair in two Sunday newspapers produced an almost comic response from the Cabinet Minister, showing how easily he dismissed moral issues. In a carbon copy of that other Cabinet rank politician, Labour’s late Robin Cook, another dedicated family politician caught bang-to-rights in an affair with his secretary, Huhne immediately issued a statement saying: ‘I am in a serious relationship with Carina Trimingham and am separating from my wife.’ (Cook was actually at the airport about to go on holiday with his wife when he was forced by Alastair Campbell to decide – wife or mistress.) Ms Pryce, a thoughtful figure, is best remembered that difficult day for despatching her son Peter to the newsagents to buy all the papers. But it was a full 11 months later that the allegation which would destroy him first appeared in a Sunday newspaper. Imagine Huhne’s horror at this exposure, the loss of face over something, in retrospect, so ludicrously trivial. Fleeting victory: Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce celebrate his 2010 election win, but Huhne is now contemplating a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice . This is a man used to brushing awkward inconveniences aside, a millionaire politician whose expenses included receipts for bus tickets, milk and loo rolls, as well as £119 for a Corby trouser press, but who had the temerity to declare with typical passion on his (now former) constituency website that ‘MPs should spend the taxpayers’ money more carefully.’ Huhne and Trimingham were living together and he had been hoping that his domestic troubles were behind him. He was even quietly eyeing the party leadership again – despite having thrown his hat twice into the ring and lost – as Nick Clegg struggled to maintain party support within the Coalition. The first time he had lost to Sir ‘Ming’ Campbell in 2006 – impudent, really, for an MP who’d been in the Commons less than a year. A year later, when Campbell stood down, he had another go. This time he lost by a squeak to Clegg. 'Imagine Huhne’s horror at this exposure, the loss of face over something, in retrospect, so ludicrously trivial' No-one supported him more, or was more desperate for him to win, than Carina Trimingham. Indeed, it can surely be argued that Carina’s love and support may well have cost him everything. It is arguable that Carina’s earlier admiration for Huhne cost him the leadership as well. This is what happened. He and Clegg were neck and neck – Clegg with his youthful appeal, and Huhne with that touch of gravitas. The older man was a success, someone who’d lived a bit, who’d worked both as a journalist and in the City and made a lot of money buying properties – currently he has seven. In a party poll of more than 41,000 votes, Huhne lost by a mere 511. What tipped the balance against him was a live debate on the BBC’s Sunday programme, The Politics Show. Before the programme, presenter Jon Sopel had received from Huhne’s team a detailed aide memoire detailing a list of Clegg’s policy fault lines. Astonishingly for a fellow party member, it was titled: ‘Calamity Clegg’. Nothing could have more clearly indicated Huhne’s stop-at-nothing determination to be the party leader, and it is hardly surprising that Clegg made a formal complaint about his opponent’s ‘dirty tricks’ to the party’s chief whip running the leadership election, Lord Rennard. Colleagues: Nick Clegg, right, pictured with Chris Huhne after Clegg won the 2007 Liberal Democrat leadership contest . Huhne denied all knowledge of the document. ‘It’s quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office…I can assure you it did not have my authorisation,’ he declared. It was an over-zealous young researcher who was responsible for drawing up the document’. Oh, and the researcher was not actually on the staff. But the episode turned many Lib-Dem party members against him. In fact, as the Daily Mail discovered, the ‘Calamity Clegg’ document had been created and circulated by Carina Trimingham, who was working as his leadership campaign press manager – although this was before they started their affair. Whether Miss Trimingham considers herself in any way responsible for her lover’s demise, first in sharing his bed and then pushing his leadership ambitions too hard, hardly matters now. She suffered defeat in a contest of her own last year in the High Court, when she lost a privacy and harassment claim against Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail. Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that as the ‘secret mistress’ of a married MP, she was a public figure and only had herself to blame for newspaper articles about her private life. She is appealing against the judgement. As Huhne’s arrogance fades from Westminster, it is impossible to over-estimate the mess that he has made of his life, especially with his children. And the future? No doubt Chris Huhne will revert to his old professional love, finance and property. He might even revert to his old name, Christopher Paul-Huhne. It may not work for a politician, but out in the commercial world it has a ring about it.","Issue defines Huhne's ferocious political ambition, and his lack of judgement .

Mary Creagh, MP for Wakefield, obtained evidence which suggest contaminated horse meat may have entered the food chain . An investigation has been launched after claims a farming family bred and ate one of their own horses which was not fit for human consumption. The horse is believed to have been butchered in the UK and should have gone to France. But instead the meat from the carcass was sent to two farms - one in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, and another in Chorley, Lancashire. Food safety officials say the horse had been injected with phenylbutazone, a drug commonly used to treat inflammation in horses, and should never have been eaten before the test results came back. They also say the banned meat was sent back to the horse's original owner, a farmer in Kirklees, where it was eaten. The owners of the two farms are believed to be related. Mary Creagh, MP for Wakefield, obtained the information after asking the Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs what happened to carcasses which tested positive for phenylbutazone in 2012. The reply given was that most of the contaminated horse meat was shipped to France, but one carcass was divided up and sent to two farms in the North of England. In a written Parliamentary answer, health minister Anna Soubrey said the Food Standards Agency had contacted the relevant local authorities as soon as it realised the food was contaminated - believed to be in September 2012. But she said when environmental health officials visited the farm in question, they were told the meat had been 'purchased for personal consumption - and had already been consumed.' A spokesman at Kirklees Council added: 'We were notified by the Food Standards Agency that contaminated meat had been present at one farm in the area. 'On investigating, we established that the meat had already been eaten.' The shocking news comes only weeks after a nationwide scandal of horse meat found in supermarket burgers. Revelations about contaminated meat in burgers has raised doubts about the security of the food chain (file picture) The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is under pressure to begin testing a much wider range of beef products following revelations that contamination goes far wider than originally believed. It emerged last week that pies and pasties supplied to UK prisons as halal beef actually contained pork, which is contrary to Muslim religious laws. The FSA has been put in charge of handling Britain’s investigation into the contamination of beef products with horse meat and pork. Phenylbutazone, or 'bute' is an anti-inflammatory drug which is regularly given to horses to treat lameness, pain and fever. It is the most commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory in equine practice. Bute is banned from entering the human food chain in the EU because it can cause cancer and other lethal effects. Horses that have been treated with it should have the information . recorded on their passport, but Labour claim the issuing of such . documents is fragmented in the UK, where there are 75 approved issuing . organisations and no national database to track the information. The Food Standards Agency tests to see that horses in slaughterhouses . are fit for consumption and carries out further checks on the meat later . down the line. Ms Creagh has appealed for reassurances that the meat is safe and that regular checks are taking place. 'The public must have confidence that the food they buy is properly labelled, legal and safe,' she said. The Food Standards Agency insisted there was no risk to the public and that none of the meat had been placed for sale in the UK. In a statement it said: 'Horses treated with bute are not allowed to enter the food chain. 'The FSA carries out checks in slaughterhouses to ensure that horses presented for slaughter are fit for human consumption. 'In 2012, the FSA identified five cases where horses returned non-compliant results. None of the meat had been placed for sale on the UK market.' Figures this week revealed that nearly 10,000 horses were killed and butchered for their meat in British abattoirs last year. Just over 150 were tested for 'bute' with nine coming back positive.","Horse is believed to have been butchered in the UK but sent back to the farm where it was bred in Yorkshire .

Jailed: Conman Peter Thirlaway was sentenced for three years and four months after posing as a social worker . A conman who posed as a social worker to steal cash a pensioner had been saving to buy a headstone for his late wife's grave has been jailed. Peter Thirlaway turned up at the 75-year-old widower's home claiming he was there to ensure the pensioner was getting all of the help and benefits he was entitled to after his wife died. But Newcastle Crown Court heard the serial burglar produced a fake social services identity card to trick his way inside the house in Wallsend, North Tyneside. While carrying out an 'inspection' of the rooms, the heartless fraudster helped himself to £260 from a drawer. Judge John Milford QC jailed Thirlaway, who has convictions for 25 previous house burglaries, for three years and four months. The said: 'You masqueraded as a member of social services who had come to help him make a claim for benefit. 'You managed to get into his bedroom and steal £260. 'That was money he had saved to pay for a headstone for his late wife. 'It must have been an immensely distressing experience for him to be duped in this way and to lose money which had such a special purpose and which he could, doubtless, ill afford.' Prosecutor Paul Wardlaw told the court Thirlaway, 43, of no fixed address, had targeted the pensioner in September last year. Mr Wardlaw said: 'The defendant told him he was there to assist him to make a claim for more benefits. He remained inside the address for an hour. 'He discussed medication the complainant was on.' Thirlaway, who has convictions for 25 previous house burglaries, was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court . The court heard the widower, whose first language is Russian, wanted his daughter with him during the meeting but Thirlaway told him their discussions must be confidential. Mr Wardlaw added: 'The defendant inspected the flat, he went all around, making notes. 'At one point it appears he has gone into a bedroom drawer where the complainant was keeping money he was saving to pay for a headstone for his deceased wife and stole £260.' It was only when Thirlaway left that the pensioner realised the money had gone and he had been the victim of the scam. Thirlaway was traced through fingerprints at the scene. Robert Adams, defending, said Thirlaway planned the raid so he could flee the area after gangsters threatened him with a bullet. However, he said the conman has shown remorse for what he did. Thirlaway admitted one count of burglary at a previous hearing.","Peter Thirlaway tricked his way into the 75-year-old victim's home in North Tyneside using a fake identity card .

Earlier this month the US and China made a deal under which the UN Security Council will expand existing sanctions against North Korea for staging a ballistic missile test. North Korea has gradually become more isolated and unpredictable since it started its nuclear weapons testing programme. The fear among the west is that repeated testing will eventually give the country the technology to fire long range nuclear missiles to mainland America. Whether the stress of international pressure explains why Mr Kim is seen smoking in the hospital is unclear, but what is for sure is Mr Kim's penchant for a smoke.

Liam Fox: The loyal supporter of David Cameron may return to quash any dissent as tensions in the party bubble over . Liam Fox is being lined up for a Cabinet return to help crush three fledgling plots against David Cameron’s leadership. Senior allies of the Prime Minister say he is considering making the former defence secretary chief whip to get a grip on his backbenchers as rebellion spreads even further than first thought. The Mail can reveal that Tory whips believe they have uncovered two more plots against Mr Cameron after allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie were exposed last week for promoting him as the next Tory leader. The second plot involves a former Army officer who has attempted to recruit supporters from among MPs who used to serve in the Armed Forces for what the leadership has branded a ‘military coup’ against the Prime Minister. At least one minister and several Parliamentary Private Secretaries have been approached with a view to joining the conspiracy - though party managers believe most have said no. Separately ministers ousted in Mr Cameron’s last reshuffle and those who have never been given a job have also privately discussed whether to act against him. This third ‘plot’ has not yet reached ‘lift-off’ according to MPs in the know. But whips are monitoring this group of the ‘disgruntled and the dispossessed’. Insiders say none of these three plots yet has the momentum to oust the PM, but concede the three groups of plotters are ‘somewhat interlocking’ and reflect ‘widespread dissatisfaction’ with Mr Cameron’s leadership. Treasury minister Greg Clark today dismissed rumours of an imminent leadership challenge as 'a load of rubbish. 'I’ve neither been approached or asked to join anyone’s team. We’ve got a very good leader of the party,' he told BBC radio 4. Current Chief Whip Sir George Young called in Mr Afriyie for a dressing down last Thursday after he was named as the central figure in a plot to oust Mr Cameron. But some of Mr Cameron’s closest aides now want Dr Fox to return as chief whip in a move that would be popular with the Tory Right and give him the authority to act against the plotters. Insiders say he has served his time after quitting over his friendship with lobbyist Adam Werritty and remained loyal. He was a staunch supporter of Mr Cameron’s recent speech on Europe and has remained close to Chancellor George Osborne and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Sir George was ushered into retirement last autumn but recalled after Andrew Mitchell’s resignation one month into the job. Ploy: Adam Afriyie was found to be plotting against David Cameron . The ‘military coup’ plotters have privately discussed their options but unlike Mr Afriyie’s supporters - dubbed the Windsor Set after his constituency - they have not identified a potential leader. Tory chiefs believe Mr Afriyie, who has campaigned to scrap the expenses watchdog IPSA, has primarily won support from MPs who were publicly humiliated over their second homes allowance claims. Those named in connection with one or other of the plots include Mark Field, Bill Wiggin - an Eton contemporary of Mr Cameron - Chris Heaton-Harris, Jonathan Djanogly, Dan Byles and Patrick Mercer, a former Army Colonel. Mr Mercer denies any involvement in plots but is widely reported to have sent a letter to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee calling for a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron.

Mr Wiggin, who is an ally of Mr Afriyie, was ousted from the whips office in Mr Cameron’s reshuffle and also served as a Territorial Army platoon commander with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, is seen by party chiefs as the link man between the three groups. He also faced embarrassment over expenses when he was forced to repay £4,000 claimed on the wrong property. Mr Wiggin, who was a year above Mr Cameron at Eton and whose wife Milly used to date the PM, has denied seeking to oust him but has publicly voiced his admiration for Mr Afriyie’s leadership potential. Yesterday he told a Sunday newspaper: ‘It’s got nothing to do with me.’","Former defence secretary could stage comeback as Chief Whip to rein in mutinous backbenchers .

Coming in a close second was another Californian hotspot, San Francisco’s Mission District. The city’s oldest neighborhood boasts the highest concentration of street murals in the city, plus handfuls of alternative and locally owned bars and restaurants, thrift shops and galleries. First place: Silver Lake, Los Angeles is known as an eclectic enclave with some of America's most lauded food trucks and farmer¿s markets, a well-established arts scene and one of the largest creative class communities in the U.S . Determining the trendiest Hipster hangouts is not exactly quantifiable. As a term that used to describe radical socialists with wild ideas and an artist bent in the Seventies, it now embodies RayBan wearing, fixed-gear bike riding, and beard growing youngsters. The U.S. Oxford dictionary describes a hipster as 'somebody who follows the latest trends and fashions.' So Forbes enlisted the help of San Fransisco-based start up NextDoor, a neighborhood-specific private social networking site with a community focus.

Second place: Mission district, San Francisco has diversity and lack of pretense, with easygoing restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and food trucks in San Francisco's oldest neighbourhood . Third place: Williamsburg, Brooklyn in New York is thought of as the birthplace of hipsterdom as we know it today, with boutique shopping, a thriving music scene, food trucks and great transit options . Fourth place: Wicker Park, Chicago started attracting artists and young adults in the late Eighties, and the community is known for its galleries, music venues, boutiques and trendy food options . Fifth place: Pearl District, Portland, is known for its art galleries, studios and coffee with the second highest concentration of coffee shops per capita on the list . These were then ranked accord to Zagat's ratings, with NextDoor's 'hipness' index also taken into account, which is based on how often words associated . with Hipster, like art, gallery, designer, musician, appeared on . each NextDoor neighborhood’s site pages . NextDoor then conducted a survey . in which members sounded off on their communities, and the percentage of residents who work in artistic occupations was also factored. While Mission, San Fransciso's lower . rents were taken into account for its ranking of second place, with .

The French intervened in Mali on Jan. 11 to stem the advance of the al-Qaida-linked fighters, who had taken over much of the African country and enforced harsh rules on the population. After pushing extremists out of key cities, France is now pushing to hand over control of those sites to African forces from a U.N.-authorized force made up of thousands of troops from nearby countries. Frontline: French soldiers in a British made armored car lead a French supply convoy near Hambori, northern Mali, on the road to Gao, on Monday . Airstrikes: A convoy of French supplies reaches Gao, northern Mali, Monday, while French troops launched airstrikes on Islamic militant training camps and arms depots around Kidal and Tessalit in Mali's far north . 'In the cities that we are holding we want to be quickly replaced by the African forces,' Fabius said Monday. Asked whether the French could pull out of the fabled city of Timbuktu and hand it to African forces as soon as Tuesday, Fabius responded, . 'Yes, it could happen very fast. We are working on it because our vocation is not to stay in the long term.' But it is far from clear that the African forces - much less the weak Malian army - are ready to see the thousands of French troops, fighter planes and helicopters withdraw and take full responsibility, in case the Islamic extremists attempt a comeback from their desert hideouts.","Airstrikes focus on radicals' desert outposts and fuel depots .

For Tony McGuire that something was the walls of the house he and his two siblings had inherited from their father. In front of astonished neighbours, he took a sledgehammer to the £300,000 property and reduced much of it to rubble. Home under the hammer: Tony McGuire outside his family home after reducing to rubble with a sledgehammer . Police were called but were powerless . to stop him destroying the four-bedroom home. Standing in the rubble, . the 49-year-old electrician said: ‘I did what I had to do. This has been . going on for seven years and I’ve had enough.’ He had moved into the Cardiff property with wife Darriel and six children following the death of his father in 2005. The couple say they poured their . savings into extending the property only for it to emerge that his . brother Terry and sister Tina had an equal share in it. Terry appears to . have started eviction . Surveying the wreckage: Tony McGuire says he spent his £200,000 savings on home improvements . Much-loved home: Tony McGuire moved into the house in Cardiff in 2009 with his wife, Darriel, and six children . How it was: The £300,000 semi lived in by Tony McGuire and his family before he took a sledgehammer to it . Last week Mr McGuire demolished the extensions and garage he himself built at an estimated cost of £200,000. ‘Terry’s going to be quite bitter . about what has happened because he will have lost money,’ he said. ‘He . is not going to be calm at all. My sister is going to be livid as well.’ Mrs McGuire, 50, said: ‘We put all our money into the house and were then told we were being evicted by Tony’s brother. ‘It was not nice to smash up our home but I back Tony all the way.’ Terry McGuire later turned up at the . property and said: ‘This whole situation has blown up in the last couple . of days. That is all I know until my solicitor gets back to me and . tells me what the hell is going on. I’m not very good to say the least.’ Neighbours came out of their houses to see what the noise was when Mr McGuire, left, attacked the house . Their sister was said to be shocked. Stuart Rogers, who lives on the other . side of the semi, yesterday told how he had dashed outside to see his . neighbour swinging the sledgehammer. ‘Slates were flying off the roof. I . said, “Tony, what are you doing?”,’ he said. ‘It’s like something out of EastEnders, Emmerdale and Coronation Street all mixed into one.’ Cardiff councillor Fenella Bowden said . she had been called in by worried residents: ‘Tony McGuire was up on . the roof of the garage of the property smashing it down. It almost looks . as if there has been an explosion. If you are going to demolish a . building it is always wise to speak to the planning department first. On . Monday he did register a request to demolish.

A police spokesman said: ‘It appears . there is a civil dispute   and police officers are investigating. Nobody . has been arrested for any offence.’ Ministry of Justice figures show a 700 per cent rise in High Court inheritance actions in five years. Experts linked the surge to the . recession, which has left relatives inheriting less than they expected. As a result, families are left ‘fighting over the scraps’. Lawyers also cited  social changes . such as family breakdown. Remarriage and the growth in second families . mean there are more potential inheritors.

Twitter users were divided, with some claiming the tweet had a racist element because of the use of the word 'monkey' in relation to a dark-skinned man. Rachel Moss said: 'That is absolutely disgusting. Criticism of Ahmadinejad fine. Racist slurs are not.' But McCain was not without his defenders, such as Adil Ray, who said: 'So @SenJohnMcCain makes a joke comparing Ahmedinijad to a Monkey and some say its racist? I'd say its more offensive to monkeys.' Faced with criticism, McCain later tweeted: 'lighten up folks, can't everyone take a joke'. But Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, a fellow Republican, tweeted: 'Maybe you should wisen up & not make racist jokes.' 'Ahmadinejad wants to be first Iranian in space - wasn't he just there last week?' John McCain in diplomatic row after comparing Iranian leader with a monkey . The veteran US senator has been criticised for other recent statements that were judged to be in poor taste. In January he joked at a news conference about the prospect of a Senate colleague being held hostage in Afghanistan, just days after a hostage crisis Algeria killed three Americans and dozens of others. Minutes later he quipped he was looking forward to interrogating Senator John Kerry using waterboarding, a method of torture allegedly adopted by CIA interrogators. Ahmadinehad, himself no stranger to controversial statements, told a group of journalists at an exhibition of space achievements in Tehran that he is willing to risk his own life to be Iran's first astronaut in space. 'I'm ready to be the first Iranian to sacrifice myself for our country's scientists,' he said. 'Sending living things into space is the result of Iranian efforts and the dedication of thousands of Iranian scientists.' Renowned for making provocative public statements, it was unclear whether President Ahmadinejad was serious. The President's popularity has waned since he fell out with parliament and his second and final term finishes in June. However . there was no independent verification of the feat and question marks . were raised after footage appeared to show the heroic returning monkey . looking remarkably different from when it made lift off. The monkey, named 'Pishgam' which . means pioneer in Farsi, was pictured being strapped into a space rocket and had lighter fur and a distinctive red mole above its eye. But the triumphant animal dressed in a tuxedo at a post-flight press conference had much darker fur and no mole. Nonetheless . the launch added to Western concerns about Iran's space programme . because the same rocket technology could potentially be used to deliver a . nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.

We missed him: Analysis of Neanderthal bones using new carbon dating techniques shows they could never have coexisted with humans . Neanderthals and the ancestors of modern humans never co-existed, according to a new study which, if correct, could rewrite conventional accounts of our species early history. The study suggests that our evolutionary cousins became extinct in their last refuge in Spain much earlier than previously thought. Previous dating of bone fossils found at Neanderthal sites in the region put the youngest at about 35,000 years. Now researchers from Australia and Europe have re-examined the bones using an improved method to filter out contamination and concluded that the remains are actually about 15,000 years older. If true, the study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and Neanderthals co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia. Humans aren't believed to have settled in the region until 42,000 years ago, but the new dating has neanderthals disappearing from there around 50,000 years ago. 'The results of our study suggest that there are major problems with the dating of the last Neanderthals in modern-day Spain,' said Thomas Higham, deputy director of the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at Oxford University. 'It is unlikely that Neanderthals survived any later in this area than they did elsewhere in mainland Europe.' The study, which was published today by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, does not completely exclude the possibility that Neanderthals survived until 35,000 years ago. The problem is that the warm climate on the Iberian peninsula quickly degrades a key protein used in so-called radiocarbon dating. The researchers were only able to test bones from two of the 11 known Neanderthal sites in Spain. They were subjected to a new method called 'ultrafiltration.' This removes more recent carbon molecules that have contaminated the bones and made them appear younger than they actually are. Much older: The study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and Neanderthals co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia . Humans living 40,000 years ago in the area around Beijing were already genetically distinct from the ancestors of modern Europeans, DNA analysis has found. An international team of researchers sequenced DNA that had been extracted from the leg of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave near to the Chinese capital. Analyses showed that the Tianyuan human shared a common origin with the ancestors of many present-day Asians and Native Americans - but had already diverged genetically from ancient Europeans. The researchers also found that the proportion of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in the early modern human was no higher than in the present day population of this region. Researchers with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, took nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from a 40,000 year old leg bone unearthed at the Tianyuan Cave in 2003. Study leader Svante Pääbo said: 'This individual lived during an important evolutionary transition when early modern humans, who shared certain features with earlier forms such as Neanderthals, were replacing Neanderthals and Denisovans.' Such techniques often lead to older . radiocarbon dates, said Chris Stringer, a senior research fellow at . Britain's Natural History Museum. 'Science moves on and technology moves . on,' he said. Mr Stringer, who was not involved in the study, said the new techniques should now be applied to other sites in Spain. 'Until this is done, there must be a significant question mark over the possible late survival of Neanderthals in the region.' If the remains from the other sites, too, turn out to be older, any encounter between Neanderthals and humans would have to have taken place earlier than previously thought, he said. 'Evidence from Britain, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy is increasingly pointing to a modern human presence before 40,000 years ago,' said Mr Stringer. 'The new chronology suggests that any interaction between the last Neanderthals and the earliest moderns in Europe will similarly move before, rather than after, 40,000 years.' There is also the chance that Neanderthals survived longer in other corners of Europe, said Rachel E. Wood of the Australian National University in Canberra, a co-author of the study. 'There are some other possible areas that may have also acted as a refuge for the species, such as the Caucasus, but the ""young"" radiocarbon dates in these areas have also found to be problematic,' she said.","New radiocarbon dating suggests Neanderthals disappeared 15,000 years before the arrival of early modern humans .

New procedures will be put in place in memory of Cassie McCord, who died when she was hit by Colin Horsfall's car, despite him failing an eyesight test three days earlier . Drivers who are medically unfit to take the wheel will lose their licenses in a matter of hours after 45,000 people signed a petition in memory of a 16-year-old girl who was killed by a partially sighted 87-year-old. Cassie McCord was hit by Colin Horsfall as she stood on the pavement, three days after he failed an eye test but refused to surrender his licence. Her mother Jackie has campaigned for the past two years for a law to instantly bar unfit drivers. The Department of Transport (DfT) has now announced it is working to 'accelerate' the process to enable officials to seize licences more quickly. Currently, it can take days to revoke the licence of someone who has been deemed a danger by police. But now the DVLA will inform people they can no longer legally drive within hours of being tipped off by police officers. Although not a change in legislation, the procedural improvement has been dubbed Cassie's Law and has been hailed by police as a potential life-saver. Mrs McCord, from Colchester, Essex, said: 'I am confident this is a really good solution. 'The fact the Department for Transport has listened to someone like me who has no power is amazing. 'Next week it will be two years since Cassie died. The timing could not be better.' Cassie, who wanted to become a lawyer, was on her way to college when she was killed. Police were in the process of trying to get Mr Horsfall's licence revoked when Cassie died. Three days before he had driven into the exit of a petrol station in Colchester and then failed a police eye test. He walked with a stick and used a zimmer frame but despite being urged to surrender his licence, he refused. Police were applying to the DVLA for his licence to be revoked but the process took days. Mrs McCord had campaigned for a change in the law but the DfT said it instead has strengthened procedures to enable medically unfit drivers to be stopped quicker. Under the previous system it would take the police up to four working days to notify the DVLA via post or fax. The new plans will enable police to tell the DVLA about eye test failures more quickly through a new electronic system. Drivers will be told they are not allowed to drive within a matter of hours of failing the test. Those who drive after their licence has been revoked could be fined up to £5,000 or sentenced to up to six months in prison. Scroll down for video . Police will be given powers to seize the licence of medically unfit drivers after campaigning by Cassie's mother Jackie, pictured with her daughter's boyfriend Daniel Gordon, left, and her husband John Rason, right. She collected 45,000 signatures . Cassie's mother Jackie, pictured together right, said her daughter 'had a very strong sense of right and wrong' and had wanted to become a lawyer. She was on her way to college when she was hit . A DVLA spokeswoman said officials have been working with the Association of Chief Police Officers to introduce a faster system to deal with roadside eye test failures. She said: 'This new . process will reduce the risk of motorists whose eyesight has been . identified by the police as not of the required standard for driving . continuing to do so.' The department said licences will not . be revoked immediately but communication between the police and the . DVLA will improve and allow licences to be seized within a matter of . hours. It will then be up to the DVLA to decide whether the licence should be returned or revoked. Mrs McCord presented her petition to Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond in October. The MP said yesterday: 'We have every sympathy with Mrs McCord and . would like to thank her for her valuable work in raising awareness of . this issue. 'The DVLA and . the police have worked closely to greatly streamline the process for . revoking a licence when the police identify that a driver's eyesight is . inadequate. 'The decision . whether to revoke a driving licence on medical grounds remains with the . DVLA, though the process for informing drivers that their licence has . been revoked has now been accelerated.' Alan Jones, the Police Federation's roads policing lead for England and Wales, welcomed the decision. He said: 'It seems absolute nonsense a police officer who knows someone has defective eyesight has not be able to do anything. 'We believe what the Department for Transport has suggested is something which would work. 'I know Cassie's Law asked for the police officer to have the authority to suspend a licence. 'In this suggestion, the officer acts as a conduit and we are happy with that.' Mr Horsfall hit the accelerator of his red Astra instead of the brake. Police released CCTV images of his car moments before the impact further up the road . The Astra, right, mounted the pavement before hitting and killing Cassie. Colin Horsfall died three months later . The new process will be operational between 8am and 10pm Monday to Friday. Mrs McCord, who also has a son Sam, 20, and is divorced from her children's father Graham, said: 'People are incredible. We could not have done this without all the people who have supported us and I do not have the words to express my gratitude to them.' Mr Horsfall had pressed the accelerator on his automatic Astra instead of the brake when he hit Cassie. Mrs McCord said: 'Colin Horsfall was just a . very selfish man. I just feel that he knew he was unfit to drive but . that didn't stop him. 'The police don't have the power to . temporarily withhold a driver's licence. Had they had the power to do . that, Cassie wouldn't be dead. And there are other tragedies like hers.'

A major investigation has been launched after surgeons at an under-fire hospital removed the wrong part of a patient's lung. The botched operation, which was conducted at Basildon Hospital in Essex, saw surgeons remove the bottom section of the female patient's lung despite needing to remove the top. The serious error, known as 'wrong site surgery', has been blamed on a mistake in the patient's medical notes. Surgeons at Basildon Hospital removed the bottom part of a woman's lung instead of the top. A mistake in the patients notes was blamed for the error . The female patient survived the procedure back in December last year 2012 but an investigation has been launched to get to the bottom of how the major blunder occurred. A hospital source, who refused to be named, said: 'It appears the medical notes that came with the patient from Broomfield had been filled out incorrectly and showed the wrong area of lung to be operated on. 'Afterwards Broomfield said that was the wrong area. It appears the mistake was made at Broomfield, but the investigation will have to look at whether this should have been picked up at Basildon.' Dr Steve Morgan, medical director at Basildon and Thurrock General Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'In December there was an incident of wrong site surgery. External reviews are taking place into that serious incident. 'No one has been suspended and the nature of the incident is rather complex.' A spokesman for Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, said: 'The Trust is aware of this incident and, in line with its internal safety and governance policies, a full investigation is being carried out. 'It will review its internal clinical procedures after this investigation.' In November, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) issued two warnings demanding immediate improvement at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. It followed an unannounced inspection prompted by a number of serious incidents involving the care of children at the trust. The female patient had the lung operation in December 2012 (posed by model) The inspectors found out-of-date medication that should have been discarded after their previous visit. Staff also told them that some children waited more than an hours to be seen, despite guidelines saying they should be seen within 15 minutes. Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is one of five NHS trusts in England that experienced higher than expected death rates between 2010 and 2012. Speaking about the figures, a spokeswoman for Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The trust is working hard to improve its mortality ratio performance.

'Snooping' powers have risen and include the power to gain entry to check for house plant pests . Public officials have around 1,400 separate powers to enter homes – including the right to inspect fridges and even pot plants. The number of ‘snooping’ powers available to town halls and public bodies has risen despite Coalition pledges to rein them in. Among those which remain are powers to enter a home ‘to see if pot plants have plant pests or do not have a plant passport’ under the Plant Health Order 2005. Another power allows officials to check the energy ratings on refrigerators under the Energy Information Household Refrigerators and Freezers Regulations 2004. Officials can also use the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 to see if a garden hedge is too high. Government departments have been given until next year to identify which powers should be repealed. Even then it may take months or years for them to be scrapped. The Tory manifesto included a commitment to cut back on ‘the intrusive powers  of entry into homes’. Only 15 such laws  have so far been repealed, including the power to enter a home and search for and seize German enemy property dating back  to the 1950s, or to carry out checks on whether illegal hypnotism displays were  taking place. Details of the snooping powers emerged as the Home Office published new rules designed to stop public officials abusing them. The code of practice suggests 48 hours’ notice should be given before a property is raided if that is considered appropriate and that officials should ‘be considerate’ over the time of day homes are entered. Breach of the code will not be a criminal offence. Civil liberties campaigners accused ministers of failing to tackle the issue. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It beggars belief that even after six months of working on this issue, some departments still have no idea what powers of entry they are able to use.’ Lord Taylor, minister for criminal information, said: ‘Powers of entry will always be vital for the investigation of crime, but this new code of practice will ensure they are used proportionately and not abused.’ Lord Taylor, minister for criminal information, said powers of entry are 'vital for the investigation of crime'","Number of 'snooping' powers rose despite Coalition pledge to rein them in .

Apple's 128GB iPad will go on sale online and from Apple stores on Monday, with the most expensive version selling for £739, just £110 cheaper than Apple's MacBook Air laptop computer . The cheapest model with the 128GB memory launched by the company at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, will have a RRP of £639. The upgrade to the fourth generation iPad, which previously stopped at the 64GB version, comes after Microsoft launched its Surface Pro tablet with a 128GB memory. Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said: 'With more than 120 million iPads sold, it's clear that customers around the world love their iPads, and everyday they are finding more great reasons to work, learn and play on their iPads rather than their old PCs.' The new version include a 9.7-inch Retina display and an HD FaceTime camera.

It reported October-December earnings that were flat compared with the year before.

Officials have identified the tragic 15-year-old student who took his own life in his high school’s bathroom yesterday morning. Triston Stephens, who was in the ninth grade, died around 8.35am Monday at Coweta Intermediate High School in Oklahoma. His apparent suicide sparked mass panic as Coweta and its neighboring high school were put on lockdown. Stephens was identified by the state Medical Examiner’s Office, Tulsa World reported. According to the police, the young man died of a single gunshot wound to the head just after the first class on Monday had started. After the lockdown, ninth grade students were led to the school’s gymnasium while all other students were sent home for the day. Classes will continue today as normal, though grief counselors will be on-site. Police are now trying to piece together why Stephens, who was described by teachers as a ‘very fine young man,’ would resort to taking his own life. It is unclear if Stephens left a suicide note. Coweta Superintendent Jeff Holmes told Tulsa World that he did not believe Stephens had been bullied, though at a press conference yesterday afternoon, other officials were more vague.

Experts probing the fire on a Dreamliner which has grounded the whole fleet today released fresh images of the charred battery at the centre of the investigation. Pictures show the blackened remains of the lithium device as well as a frayed and broken earth wire, designed to reduce the risk of electric shock, which was attached to it at the time it ignited. Investigators also confirmed that they had linked the in-flight fire which forced the All Nippon Airways service to make an emergency landing in Japan last month to a similar incident in Boston. Overheated: The charred battery from the Dreamliner plane which made an emergency landing on January 16 in Takamatsu, is inspected by the manufacturer at the headquarters of GS Yuasa Corp in Kyoto, western Japan . Link: Investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery to that suffered by a battery on another Dreamliner which was also forced to make an emergency landing in Boston last month . Damage: A ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred, frayed and broken . The . Japanese Transportation Safety Board released the images as it . continues to look at the reason why an All Nippon Airways flight was . forced to land on January 16. CAT scans of the overheated . lithium ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a . week earlier on January 7 which saw another Dreamliner make an emergency . landing in Boston. All 50 Boeing 787s belonging to eight airlines in seven different countries remain grounded while investigations continue. The . latest probe is said to have found evidence of short-circuiting and . 'thermal runaway' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating. The . All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing in western Japan . after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell . was detected in the cockpit and cabin. An . investigator in Japan at the time said the burned insides of the . plane's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in . excess of its design limits. Experts . from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had already . disassembled the device believed to have caused the earlier Boston fault . in a bid to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted late . last month that they were no closer to reaching a conclusion. Gutted: The extent of the damage to the Dreamliner's battery, left, is best illustrated when it is placed next to an undamaged model, right . Charred: A CAT scan of the damaged battery shows that six of the battery's eight cells were all but destroyed . But a week ago, Elon Musk, the . founder of Tesla Motors said the batteries used by Boeing in its . Dreamliner aircraft are 'inherently unsafe' - after it emerged that an . airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded. All . Nippon Airways (ANA) said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 . aircraft ten times because they failed to charge properly or showed . other problems. And Japan Airlines also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 'on a few occasions'. Lithium . ion batteries are more susceptible to catching fire when they overheat . and are more likely to short-circuit than other types of batteries. Boeing . built in safeguards to gain safety certification for use of the . relatively light and powerful batteries to power various electrical . systems on the 787, the world's first airliner made mostly from . lightweight composite materials. Investigation: The singed battery case from the Japan Airlines (JAL) Boeing 787 Dreamliner which caught fire in Boston is displayed inside an investigation lab at the NTSB Headquarters in Washington, DC . Probe: The state-of-the-art Dreamliner continues to be grounded as the investigation into the cause of the thermal damage continues . Burnt: The NTSB's Joseph Kolly, holds part of the badly fire-damaged battery casing from the plane involved in the Boston incident. The battery has been taken apart by experts in a bid to work out what went wrong . Investigators earlier said they . found no evidence of quality problems with production of the 787's . batteries by Kyoto, Japan-based, GS Yuasa, whose own aerospace ambitions . are on the line. But the issue may have hit the company's business hard judging by its latest figures. Yuasa . said Tuesday that its April-December net profit fell 3.6 percent to 5.5 . billion yuan ($59.6 million) from a year earlier, as demand for . batteries lagged due to sluggish demand in Japan and overseas. The . company has struggled to turn its lithium ion business to . profitability. In April-December its lithium ion business posted a 7.2 . billion yen ($78.2 million) loss, it said, compared with an operating . loss of 3.26 billion yen in the full-year that ended March 31, 2012. Although . Dreamliner aircraft are currently grounded because of unsafe batteries, . it emerged last week that restrictions against carrying the batteries . as cargo were lifted. Pilots . and safety advocates argued that it is too risky to fly with the . batteries on board at all if the plane's battery system makes it too . unsafe to fly. The new . regulations were brought into effect on January 7 - the same day as one . of the batteries caught fire on a Japan Airlines 787 flight. The . aircraft had landed 40 minutes earlier at Boston Airport and almost 200 . passengers and crew had disembarked when a cleaning team smelled smoke . and alerted fire crews. The . Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion . batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving . shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries. The . battery fire is just one of  a series of problems  - including  two . fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit . window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched . three years late. Mike . Sinnett, chief engineer on the 787, said last month that the plane's . batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never . had an internal fault. He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.

Having your bins emptied outside your home doesn’t seem much to expect when paying more than £1,500 a year in council tax. But for the villagers of Bootle in Cumbria, life isn’t quite that easy. Their local council wanted the villagers to drag their 240-litre wheelie bins more than a mile and a half up a steep hill for them to be emptied. Waste of time: Residents of Annaside and Hyton, such as Steven Fell, would have to walk almost two miles with their wheelie bins to leave them for collection before the council's u-turn . The council stopped picking up the bins as a cost-cutting measure, but residents were furious about it . Nicola Brown, pictured, would have to make the a four mile round trip with her wheelie bin if the council refused to collect rubbish . When the residents protested, the . council’s ‘compromise’ was that they could leave the bin behind and lug . the refuse sacks up the hill instead. However, Copeland Borough Council has now backed down. Farmer . Deryck Fell, of Annaside, said: 'It's great that they're going to do . that. But I don't know why they wanted to make the changes in the first . place. They didn't consult us properly.' The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has decided  to remove the litter bins from residential streets, controversially claiming that they attract more rubbish. Officials at the council said that bins on the street encourage fly-tipping, increasing the amount of litter left behind. Local, Amanda Salvesen, 27, a PR manager from Earl’s Court, said: ‘I don’t think they have asked the local residents. They are always full, people use them. They should be adding more, not taking them away.’ Despite objections, the . council claims that when bins are removed from streets, there is only a . slight increase in littering. Kathy Way, head of waste at the council, said in a report: ‘There are two schools of thought regarding litter bins; one is that litter bins are needed for the public to use, indeed that some members of the public look for litter bins in which to deposit waste, otherwise they may take it home or drop it on the street. ‘The other is that litter bins attract more rubbish, some of which can be unpaid-for commercial waste and domestic waste.’ As well as the logistical problems of transporting the bins to the collection point, residents had raised concerns that the large volume of bins, heavy traffic flow and narrow roads would have led to an increase in accidents. Councillor Allan Holliday, portfolio holder for the environment and sustainability, said the council had now organised a ‘mutually acceptable' alternative with the residents. He said: 'We are facing unprecedented funding cuts, and as a result have reviewed all of the services we provide, including waste collection. As a result, like other rural councils, we are having to look at the feasibility of collections from lanes. 'However in this instance, we've listened and have already arranged a mutually acceptable and practical alternative with residents, as we would look to do wherever concerns are raised. Consultation is ongoing.' Keith Parker, Copeland Borough Council's head of neighbourhoods, previously told the Evening Mail the council was ‘no longer able to afford to travel significant distances down lanes to collect people's waste'. A Copeland Borough Council spokeswoman confirmed that there  was no way to practically implement the policy in the Bootle situation so, at the moment, the council would be continuing to collect the waste as normal. The bags would then be collected from a large bin stationed at the end of the lane. The rules, were due to come into effect on . February 15, were part of a cost-cutting drive by Copeland Borough . Council – which had said it was no longer prepared to collect rubbish . from ‘off-route properties’. Before the council's u-turn Mr Fell, 56, said it was absolute ‘madness’ to expect elderly residents to embark on a three-mile round trip. ‘There are at least five residents who are in their eighties and they simply won’t be able to do it,’ he said. ‘It is an absolutely ludicrous . situation and we’re frankly disgusted that the council would allow this . to happen considering how much we all pay for our council tax.’ Bootle residents Hazel Fell, David Cross and Deryck Fell, above, spoke out against the council's decision to cut the bin service from 14 houses . Mr Fell, who lives with his wife Hazel . in Bootle, added: ‘It doesn’t make environmental sense to have 14 homes . running 14 vehicles up the road to drop their bins off. There is no . room for bins where they are proposing to have it collected. You’ve got . loads of cars and school buses going down that road. ‘There have already been accidents – this will make it worse.’ Until now the residents, whose annual . council tax bill is £1,569, put their rubbish in individual . wheelie bins and a wagon has driven up Church Lane in Bootle once a . fortnight to collect it. The authority hoped the scheme would save £120,000. It will still make assisted . collections for disabled residents but has said this will be carried out . with smaller vehicles. Councillor Allan Holliday, a spokesman for the . environment and sustainability, said: ‘We are facing unprecedented . funding cuts and have reviewed all of the services we provide, including . waste collection. ‘As a result, like other rural . councils we are having to look at the feasibility of collections from . lanes.

Gary Mayall, 36, travelled from . his home in Oldham, Greater Manchester to break into isolated dwellings in Shropshire and Herefordshire. Andrew Holland, defending, told Shrewsbury Crown Court . that Mayall was a career criminal but followed a 'code' under which he never targeted a house belonging to a pensioner. But the argument did not save him from prison after he admitted to three burglaries and asked for a further nine to be taken into account. The thief was yesterday jailed for four years and eight months. Mayall was caught after he travelled to picturesque Leominster in Herefordshire and broke into a house on November 23 last year. Five days later, he journeyed to Church Stretton, Shropshire, where he burgled two neighbouring houses. But suspicious locals in Church Stretton spotted him lurking by a house and rang the police.

Businessman Timothy Turner originally claimed he had been forced to take part in the raid by unknown people . A company director who took part in a gang raid on a brothel to try to solve his financial problems has been jailed for four and a half years. Timothy Turner, 33, posed as a customer and made an appointment at the Exclusive Girls brothel in Camberley, Surrey. He joined three other masked raiders, armed with guns and a machete, at the raid and made away with nearly £1,000. One gang member, armed with a loaded shotgun, threatened to shoot brothel manager Miranda Fuoco and hit her in the face with a gun butt, leaving her bleeding and with loose teeth. Customer Eddie Lau was robbed of £150 and his debit card while three prostitutes fled the detached house in Crawley Ridge. Turner, of Vale Road, Ash Vale, was arrested after Mr Lau reported the getaway car's registration number. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob at Guildford Crown Court and admitted a separate charge of possessing cannabis. Jailing Turner, Judge Michael Addison said: 'It must have been a terrifying experience for Ms Fuoco.' The judge said that the use of the loaded shotgun to threaten and attack the brothel manager was an aggravating feature of the case, though he acknowledged the defendant was not the man who attacked Ms Fuoco. Gino Connor, prosecuting, said Ms Fuoco had opened the door of the property to what she believed was a customer with a booking. The balaclava-clad gang charged into the house, led by the man with the shotgun described in court as the ringleader. He screamed at Ms Fuoco: 'Where's the f***ing money?' Mr Connor said: 'He threatened to chop off her head and slice her face. She was almost delirious with shock. 'She was gratuitously struck on the side of her mouth with the butt of a firearm.' Ms Fuoco eventually told the gang that there was cash hidden in the kitchen. When the man with the shotgun got his hands on the cash, about £980, he yelled: 'Is that it? You're f***ing kidding me.' Mr Connor said: 'The woman believed she would be killed because of the way that he was behaving. 'Because the men were wearing balaclavas, it's not possible to say which part the defendant played.'

Judge Michael Addison, sitting at Guildford Crown Court, pictured, told Turner that the raid must have been 'terrifying' for brothel manager Miranda Fuoco . The £980 was found at his home, along with a BB handgun and machete-style weapon. Police also found thousands of pounds unconnected with the robbery, as well as shotguns for which Turner held a firearms certificate. Philip Rule, defending, said his client had been reluctant to get involved in the robbery on December 2 2011 and was not the gang member who attacked Ms Fuoco. Turner originally claimed he had been forced to take part in the raid by others unknown. But Judge Addison refused the basis of Turner's plea. Mr Rule said: 'This has been a salutary experience for Mr Turner. He does express remorse.' The court was told that the premises where the raid took place is under new ownership and is no longer a brothel.","Timothy Turner, 33, jailed for four and a half years for his part in the December 2011 raid in Camberley, Surrey ."

War of words: Hector Timerman compared Falkland Islanders to illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank . A senior Argentine politician has sparked outrage by claiming his country will run the Falklands within 20 years. Hector Timerman, the country’s  foreign minister, also compared the islanders to illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Mr Timerman escalated the war of words over sovereignty during his first visit to London. Although he ruled out another military invasion of the islands, he went on to denounce the British as ‘fanatics’ who were only interested in the windswept South Atlantic outcrop because of its potentially lucrative offshore oil reserves. In an interview, Mr Timerman made his . controversial predication of future Argentine sovereignty over the . Falklands, saying:  ‘I don’t think it will take another 20 years.’ He added: ‘I think that the world is going through a process of understanding more and more that this is a colonial issue.’ Mr Timerman also snubbed a member of . the Falklands government who tried to present him with a letter . dismissing Argentina’s claim over the islands, and then refused to . attend a meeting with Foreign Secretary William Hague because members of . the island parliament would be there. Mr Timerman made his unprecedented . visit to the UK to discuss issues relating to the Falklands a month . before around 1,500 islanders hold their first vote on whether they want . to remain British. The historic referendum, set for March 10-11 and . which will be overseen by international observers, is expected to send a . clear message to Argentina to keep its hands off. Hector Timerman, left, has refused to meet William Hague, right, because the British politician insisted on a representative of the Falkland islanders being present . But during heated exchanges in . Westminster, Mr Timerman claimed the vote over the future of the islands . – known in Argentina as Las Malvinas – was meaningless. He said: ‘The . self-determination referendum doesn’t apply to the Malvinas. It is a . colonised territory.’ He compared the situation to Israel’s . breach of UN resolutions by building homes on Palestinian territory in . the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr Timerman said: ‘A few weeks ago, . Britain complained to Israel because of building in the settlements and . said that was against the peace process. 'It is strange that you behave . one way in the Malvinas but complain about the settlements. ‘The people living in the Malvinas are . subjects, they are not native. 'It is a population that came after the . invasion of the territory. It is like asking settlers in the West Bank . if they want to be Israelis or Palestinians. It does not make sense.’ Mr Timerman said they has been trying to negotiate a peaceful solution to the dispute for the past 180 years . The Argentine politician said a referendum on whether the islanders want to remain British is meaningless . Diplomatic friction between Britain . and Argentina has increased since 2010 when oil exploration was . authorised in the waters around the islands, which have been under . British control since 1833. Mr Timerman added yesterday: ‘I think . the fanatics are maybe in the UK. [Britain] is using the people living . in the islands for political reasons and to have access to oil and . natural resources which belong to the Argentine people.’ Labour MP Chris Bryant said Mr . Timerman’s comments were ‘offensive’ and Lord O’Neill, a Labour peer, . blasted Buenos Aires for using ‘megaphone diplomacy’. Dick Sawle, a member of the Falkland . Islands parliament, had tried to present a letter to Mr Timerman but was . brushed aside. The letter stated: ‘The referendum next month will make . it very clear that we do not wish to be ruled by Argentina. No amount of . harassment and intimidation by your government against our community . will change this fact.’ Last year the Argentine government . accused the UK of ‘militarising’ the South Atlantic. Britain currently . has four warships, four RAF fighter-bombers and around 1,200 troops on . the islands.","Foreign minister Hector Timerman said Britain only wants Falklands oil .

The discovery of a new feathered dinosaur will change the way we look at birds forever, scientists claimed today. The fossil of a 30cm long creature from the Jurassic period is set to challenge widely accepted views on the origin of flight. In a groundbreaking study, experts have revealed how the Eosinopteryx roamed the earth long before the bird-like beasts it was thought birds evolved from. How Eosinopteryx might have looked: Scientists studying the fossilised remains of the new dinosaur say its discovery will rewrite theories of how birds evolved the ability to fly . Scientists previously believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs called theropods from the Early Cretaceous period, about 120-130million years ago. But recent discoveries in north-eastern China of much older feathered dinosaurs from the older Middle-Late Jurassic period have cast doubt on the old theory. The Eosinopteryx would have been around on Earth more than 145million years ago. Dr Gareth Dyke, Senior Lecturer in Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Southampton, Hants, co-wrote a report on the exciting findings. He said: 'This discovery sheds further doubt on the theory that the famous fossil Archaeopteryx - or ""first bird"" as it is sometimes referred to - was pivotal in the evolution of modern birds. 'Our findings suggest that the origin of flight was much more complex than previously thought.' An artist's impression of Archaeopteryx: Dr Gareth Dyke, of the University of Southampton, says the study casts doubt on this creature's role in the evolution of flight . The fossilised remains found in north-eastern China indicate that, while feathered, this was a flightless dinosaur, because of its small wingspan and a bone structure that would have restricted its ability to flap its wings. The dinosaur also had toes suited to walking along the ground and fewer feathers on its tail and lower legs, which would have made it easier to run. Dr Dyke is based at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. He worked on the report, published in the journal Nature Communications this week, with fellow experts from Belgium and China.",Eosinopteryx roamed the earth long before the bird-like beasts it was thought birds evolved from .

The organization is discussing ending a longstanding ban on gay members and allowing local organizations to decide their own policy. The President said he supported the change today as he gave an interview ahead of this year's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. Changes: Barack Obama told Scott Pelley on CBS that the Boy Scouts should reverse their policy which puts a ban on gay members in his traditional Super Bowl interview . Obama was speaking to Scott Pelley on CBS before the game between the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens. He has given an interview with one major network on the day of the Super Bowl every year that he has been President. Pelley asked Obama whether the Boy Scouts should be open to gay members to which he responded: 'Yes.' The President continued: 'I think that my attitude is that gays . and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybody . else does in every institution and walk of life.' During the interview he also said that football was a 'great sport' but that safety fears over the game must be addressed. The Boy Scouts have been debating on whether to lift the ban on gay members. A change in policy would mark a dramatic reversal for the 103-year-old organization, which only last summer reaffirmed the rules amid heavy criticism from gay rights groups and some parents of scouts . There have been years of protests over the rule, including petition campaigns that have prompted come corporations to suspend donations to the Boy Scouts. Change: The Boy Scouts of America announced it is considering a dramatic retreat from its controversial policy of excluding gays as leaders and youth members . The BSA, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010, has long excluded both gays and atheists. Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's right to exclude gays. Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies, and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy. More recently, amid petition campaigns, shipping giant UPS Inc. and drug-manufacturer Merck announced that they were halting donations from their charitable foundations to the Boy Scouts as long as the no-gays policy was in force. Unfair? Jennifer Tyrrell, pictured last June, hugs her son Cruz Burns, 7; she was ousted this summer after they discovered she was a lesbian . The Boy Scouts won a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the organization to ban gays in 2000, but has come under increasing public pressure in recent years from activists. They include Zach Wahls, an Eagle Scout with two lesbian mothers, and Jennifer Tyrrell, a lesbian mother from Ohio who was ousted as a Scout den leader and treasurer. 'This is absolutely a step in the right direction,' said Wahls, who is founder of Scouts for Equality, a group that includes 3,151 other Eagle scouts. Wahls said he would turn to persuading local councils to enact nondiscrimination policies if the change is approved. Tyrrell said she looked forward to a day when she and her family might participate in scouting again. 'An end to this ban will restore dignity to countless families across the country, my own included, who simply wanted to take part in all Scouting has to offer,' Tyrrell said in a statement. GLAAD, an anti-discrimination advocacy group, began to press for a reversal of the Boy Scouts policy after Tyrrell was removed from her son's den and more than 1 million people have signed petitions on Change.org seeking an end to the policy. More than 462,000 people signed a petition on Change.org calling for the Boy Scouts to grant an Eagle Scout application for Ryan Andresen, a California resident who is openly gay. Andresen's scoutmaster refused to sign the application because of his sexual orientation. A review board for the California chapter recommended he receive the rank, but its recommendation was never forwarded to national headquarters. The organization has faced pressure from board members - Ernst & Young chairman and chief executive Jim Turley and AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson have spoken out against the ban - and some corporations withdrew support over the policy . Patrick Boyle, whose 1994 book 'Scout's Honor' was among the first to examine sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts of America, said on Monday the 'striking reversal in policy' was likely the result of growing pressure from corporations. The Boy Scouts of America signage is seen on the Cushman Watt Scout Center, headquarters of the organization for the Los Angeles Area Council, in Los Angeles . This is a safe way out of this mess for the national organization, which takes the fight back to the local level, and says to a local leader, 'you make the choice that's right for you',' Boyle said. 'It's essentially the Boy Scouts' version of states' rights.' However, critics of the Scouts suggest that its recruitment efforts have been hampered by high-profile controversies - notably the court-ordered release of files dealing with sex abuse allegations and persistent protests over the no-gays policy. The BSA's overall ""traditional youth membership"" - Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers - totaled 2,658,794 in 2012, compared to more than 4 million in peak years of the past. There were 910,668 Boy Scouts last year, a tiny increase from 2011, while the ranks of Venturers - a program for youths 14 and older- declined by 5.5 percent. In addition to flak over the no-gays policy, the Scouts have been buffeted by multiple court cases related to past allegations of sexual abuse by Scout leaders, including those chronicled in long-confidential records that are widely known as the ""perversion files."" Through various cases, the Scouts have been forced to reveal files dating from the 1960s to 1991. They detailed numerous cases where abuse claims were made and Boy Scout officials never alerted authorities and sometimes actively sought to protect the accused. The Scouts are now under a California court order, affirmed this month by the state Supreme Court, to turn over sex-abuse files from 1991 through 2011 to the lawyers for a former Scout who claims a leader molested him in 2007, when he was 13. It's not clear how soon the files might become public. The BSA has apologized for past lapses and cover-ups, and has stressed the steps taken to improve youth protection policy. Since 2010, for example, it has mandated that any suspected abuse be reported to police.","Obama gave interview ahead of the Super Bowl in New Orleans .

The only existing buildings are the caretaker's house, a postwar military structure, the ruins of a cabin and a dry stone wall along the beach. The Spiaggia Rosa (Pink Beach) on the south-eastern side of the island owes its distinctive colour to microscopic fragments of corals and shells. Budelli was the backdrop for the 1960s film Deserto Rosso, Red Desert, starring a young Richard Harris opposite Sixties Italian screen siren Monica Vitti. Politicians have been swift to wade into the debate. Sardinian regional president Ugo Cappellacci, called on the federal state to buy the island, saying it is 'a national treasure that should never be put up for sale'. Stella Bianchi, of the PD Democratic Party: 'The island of Budelli can not be put up for auction and should as soon as possible return to being part of public property.'

Beloved children’s author Dr Seuss had a fabled collection of wacky and wonderful hats all his own that inspired the famous headwear of the Cat in the Hat, among many others. The collection of hundreds of hats was secretly stored in a closet, hidden behind a bookshelf in his home in San Diego, but can now be seen by the public for the first time. Oh, the hats you'll wear: Dr Seuss had a legendary hat collection that was hidden in a secret closet in his home; for the first time, a selection of the beloved authors many toppers are on display at the NYPL . The cat in the hat: Variations on Dr Seuss' hats were prominently featured in the author's children's books, including 'The Cat in the Hat,' left, and 'The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins,' right . Hats off: Dr Seuss wearing a particularly eye-catching feathered number . Pen name: Dr Seuss, real name Theodore Seuss Geisel, pictured in 1979 in his San Diego home . The writer– real name Theodor Seuss Geisel – was known among his social circles for his collection of hundreds of hats, which he would often wear at dinner parties and when he was penning his latest books. The prolific children’s author, cartoonist, and artist owned hundreds of hats in all shapes and sizes, and insisted that his guests wear some of the least conventional ones when at his home. His wife, Audrey Geisel, said in a 1999 interview that these hats were the life of the party. ‘Believe me, when you get a dozen people seated at a fairly formal dinner party and they’ve all got on perfectly ridiculous chapeaus, the evening takes care of itself.’ The legendary collection is being displayed for the first time in an exhibit at the New York Public Library, at the Children’s Center on 42nd St in Manhattan in honor of the 75th anniversary of ‘The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins.’ Included in his collection are a Baroque . Czech helmet, a colonel’s hat from WWII, and a feathered red felt hat . that no doubt inspired one of Bartholomew’s many hats. He was also gifted a faux-fur marching band hat from San Diego State University in 1986. The . author was born in 1904 in Springfield, Massachusetts and later . attended Oxford University, where he met Helen Palmer, who would become . his wife in 1927. As the New York Times notes, . hats were much more common at the last turn of the century, but even . so, Geisel favored hats with a flair, and would find the most . ostentatious head wear he could find.

A team-mate of four footballers accused of sexually assaulting a teenager in a hotel room while she slept claimed he was shown a graphic mobile phone picture by a fellow player. Ben Sampayo, 20, told the Old Bailey he was asleep at the time of the alleged assault by Anton Rodgers, 21, Lewis Dunk, 21, George Barker, 21, and Steve Cook, 21, on the 19-year-old. The defendants had met the girl in a nightclub but Mr Sampayo said he could no longer remember anything about the night, when they all shared a hotel room following a cup final. Accused: Anton Rodgers, 21, left, and Lewis Dunk, 21, right, have denied sexual assault and voyeurism . Defendants:  George Barker, 21, and Steve Cook, 21, are accused of assaulting a 19-year-old in a hotel room . Mr Sampayo, who was shown his earlier witness statement, and said he had just opened his eyes when one of the players showed him the snap on a mobile phone. The defender said: 'A team mate came up to my bed. I don’t remember who it was. He showed me a photo. I think it was on a mobile phone. I think I saw some d**** and a hand.' Mr Sampayo had gone back to sleep but woke again to find the girl awake. 'She seemed fine' he added. But after being shown his statement he said she told him that 'she felt something had gone on, something about photographs.' 'She asked me 'Why did you do it?' I said 'It wasn’t anything to do with me. I was asleep. I had no part to play. Take it up with them.' Asked by prosecutor Richard Barton, 'did you have anything to do with those photographs?', he replied: 'No.' Mr Sampayo added: ‘She asked me why did they do it. I said I don’t know why they would have done it, you will have to speak to them. 'I said here [in the statement] she appeared a bit angry, disappointed and upset.' Trial: Anton Rodger is accompanied to court by his father, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . He said he and other players from Brighton and Hove Albion had gone out to celebrate after winning the Sussex Senior Cup in July 2011. The footballer remembered a group walking back to the Jury’s Inn Hotel, Brighton, with the woman in the early hours. Brighton players Rodgers, Dunk and Barker and former team-mate Cook, who plays for Bournemouth, deny sexual assault and voyeurism. The prosecution says the players assaulted the drunken woman when she was asleep and took pictures as a 'record of their conquest'. Mr Sampayo said he had been drinking and had little or no recollection. He had been interviewed by police after being arrested with the others in January, last year. Mr Sampayo had not been charged but five months later was summoned to the magistrates’ court and been ordered to make a statement. Asked by Mr Barton: 'Do you want to be here today?', he replied: 'No.' Allegation: Jury's Inn, Brighton, where the assault is alleged to have taken place following a night out . He used the statement to refer to in the witness box and his voice was barely audible. Brian O’Neill QC, for Dent, asked him to raise his voice 'as loud as if you were on the pitch'. The court heard Mr Sampayo previously played in the Chelsea Academy team with Rodgers, who is the son of Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He agreed with Rodgers’ barrister Peter Lodder QC that Rodgers 'kept himself to himself' and was the type of person who ‘joins in’ rather than leads. Mr Sampayo said the atmosphere when they got back to the hotel after the night out at a local club was laughing and joking.' Cross-examined by Peter Lodder QC, for Rodgers, Mr Sampayo agreed he may have been mistaken about what was said. Mr Lodder suggested that the reference to 'hands' was to their own hands rather than someone else's hands. The alleged victim has told the court she blacked out during the night out with the footballers and woke up to find herself lying next to Rodgers half-naked. She then discovered around 30 photos on Rodgers' phone. One of the snaps featured Barker putting his face next to her backside and giving a thumbs-up sign, it is alleged. The trial was adjourned to Monday. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Ben Sampayo told the Old Bailey he was asleep at the time of alleged assault .

Demand to see the first major show of Edouard Manet’s portraits in the UK when it opens in London on Saturday is sky high. So, for twice the regular price of £15, the Academy is offering ‘exclusive’ Sunday evening openings to enjoy the 19th century masterpieces in relative peace. Such is the demand for the Royal Academy exhibition that organisers are offering 'exclusive' Sunday evening opening times . The £30 tickets, available in March and April, include a drink and audio guide. The Academy has also put on extra tickets and extended opening to 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays to meet demand for the exhibition, Manet: Portraying Life. One of the 50-plus exhibits, The Amazon from 1875 featuring a woman on horseback, still had not arrived yesterday from a museum in Brazil. The exhibition opens on Saturday but some key paintings have yet to arrive having been held up by the snow . It has been held up by the snow at Heathrow but Academy bosses promised it would be on display in time for the opening. Important . characters from the artist’s personal life feature in the exhibition, . which showcases his pioneering technique of blurring the lines between . portraiture and genre painting. One blonde young man who features in several works could be Manet’s secret son, critics have claimed. The truth behind the paternity of Leon-Edouard Koella Leenhoff - the son of the woman Manet later married - is shrouded in mystery. But he appears in more paintings by the artist than any other male model, including five displayed at the exhibition. In The Luncheon - described as one of the ‘most exciting’ paintings in the show - Leon is depicted wearing a straw boater looking towards the viewer. The Manets were a comfortable, middle class family living in Paris when 19-year-old Dutch pianist Suzanne Leenhoff, became a piano teacher to Manet’s younger brother Eugene in1849. She is thought to have had relationships with both 17-year-old Manet and his father, the judge Auguste Manet, and gave birth to her only son, Leon, in 1852.","Royal Academy offering £30 tickets so art lovers can avoid the crowds .

Mr Cole told The Independent On Sunday: 'A lot of people have come out of the woodwork since we said were closing but where were they during the past five years?' He added: 'I see people come in, try on stuff, and then I never see them again. They find websites selling things cheaper than I can afford.'

Oldest pimp in town: Raymond Telford, 77, leaving Leeds Crown Court today after being ordered to pay a £140,000 fine for running two brothels . A grandfather slapped with a £140,000 fine for running two brothels has said he was only trying to 'keep women safe'. Raymond Telford, 77, who has been operating the brothels for more than 25 years, also called for prostitution to be legalised and said he 'will open up more premises' if it is. He claimed to have operated premises for gay, lesbian, transvestite and transsexual clients over the years and said people should not ridicule his work because it 'saves lives'. The pensioner was speaking after being ordered to pay £140,000 at a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Leeds Crown Court today. His case related to police raids on addresses in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in December 2010, when prostitutes were found to be working and clients accepted they were paying for sexual services. Telford said he was refusing to call time on his career as a brothel owner, and added: 'I suppose at my age I should be calling it a day. 'But I think one day it will be legalised in this country and, if I'm still around when it is, I will open some more premises.' Reacting to the decision of the court, he said: 'Life is life and I will just have to pay it. 'But what most people don't understand is that by closing me down they are just endangering more working girls. 'They will continue working whatever happens but this time they will be doing it on their own where they are more vulnerable. 'At my place the working girls were much safer, they had health visits each month by a doctor and got condoms and everything they needed. We have got to look at things in perspective. 'I think if it went to a vote most people would agree that prostitution should be legalised as long as brothels are properly regulated.' Telford said he had spent years working in construction, based in Holland and Saudi Arabia, before opening his first brothel in Leeds in the 1980s. He said: 'I have been around working girls for most of my life and nearly all of them are decent people. To do what I did you need to know how their brains work and what makes them tick. 'People may look down their noses and ridicule and criminalise people who get involved in this industry but I think prostitution saves a lot of lives. Making it legal would save even more.'

The Government is set to allow supermarkets to continue to sell mince which is less than 50 per cent meat despite EU rules aiming to crack down on mislabelling of food. Officials say that stopping retailers from bulking up mince with fat and connective tissue would cost the industry hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. But with the revelation following closely on from the recent horsemeat scandal, it could raise further fears that Britons are inadvertently eating impure food. Rules: The EU is cracking down on the amount of meat found in minced pork and beef (file photo) EU regulations set to be introduced next year will impose strict limits on the amount of fat and collagen which can be included in minced beef and pork. Lean beef mince will be allowed to contain no more than 19 per cent filler, while regular beef mince will have up to 35 per cent. Minced pork will be allowed nearly as much filler as meat, with a maximum of 48 per cent collagen and fat. Collagen, which is best known for its role in cosmetic surgery, is a protein found in animals' tendons. Currently a large proportion of the meat on British supermarket shelves breaches the purity regulations, meaning it could no longer be labelled as mince once the EU rules came into force. Ministers have therefore asked for an exemption - or 'derogation' - to the new regulations in order to safeguard the UK's food industry, according to the Daily Telegraph. Opt-out: Defra officials are seeking to exempt British supermarkets from the rule . In an 'impact assessment' of the rules issued last year, officials wrote: 'A significant proportion of mince meat currently sold in the UK contains a greater proportion of collagen than would be permitted. 'Adopting this derogation avoids costs to businesses arising from not being able to sell such minced meat in the UK as minced meat.' The Government claims that if the regulations were imposed in full, they would cost food manufacturers more than £800,000 a year. However, Labour MP Barry Gardiner attacked ministers for failing to safeguard consumers, describing the plans as a 'national disgrace'. 'Why should British people eat mince which is not the same standard as the rest of Europe?', he said to the Telegraph. 'They seem to be more concerned with wiping out regulations than in what consumers are eating.' A spokesman for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said that a 'final decision' had not yet been made on how to implement the rules. 'These regulations are about striking the right balance between improved information for consumers and red tape on food businesses,' he added. Minced meat has been in the headlines over the past few weeks after it emerged that a number of supermarkets had been selling hamburgers which contained horse meat. The contaminated mince came from a factory in Ireland, which blamed it on a supplier in Poland.","European regulations set limit of 35% filler for minced beef and 48% for pork .

A woman who racially abused her elderly Irish neighbours and their grandchildren during a 14-year campaign of harassment has been banned from speaking to the couple. Denise Godefroid repeatedly yelled at Veronica and James Hagans to go back to Ireland and, on one occasion, screamed at them to keep 'those bloody Irish children' quiet. A court heard the 63-year-old also called the couple 'f****** stupid Irish', banged loudly on their wall while making whale noises at 3am, and peered into their bedroom from her adjoining balcony. Southwark Crown Court was told Mrs Hagan has been so badly affected by Godefroid's behaviour that she does not leave the flat on her own - even to just put the rubbish out in the corridor. Judge Stephen Robbins today issued Godefroid with an indefinite restraining order preventing direct or indirect contact with the Hagans. She was also given a two year community order and ordered to keep to a six-month long curfew between 9pm and 7am at her home in Pimlico, central London. Prosecutor James Fletcher said that Mr and Mrs Hagans moved in next door to Godefroid at the Joseph Conrad House flats in 1997. He said: 'Since they moved in, over that period there have been a number of antisocial and nuisance type behaviours from the defendant towards Mrs Hagans and her husband. 'This included the defendant knocking loudly on wall in the early hours of the morning, at 3am, and singing or making whale noises, peering into their bedroom from an adjoining balcony and being verbally abusive. 'On at least two occasions the Crown has advanced evidence the harassment was racially aggravated. 'Mrs Hagans is Irish and on one occasion the defendant made comments such as 'You f****** stupid Irish. What did you come here for? Why are you in this country? 'On another occasion the defendant started swearing at Mr and Mrs Hagans' grandchildren saying 'Those bloody Irish children. Keep those f****** children quiet and get back to Ireland you f****** Irish. Neighbours: Mr and Mrs Hagans moved next door to Godefroid at Joseph Conrad House in 1997 . 'Mrs Hagan has been badly affected by the behaviour to the point that she felt that she could not leave the flat on her own, even to go out in the corridor to put the rubbish out.' Godefroid had admitted a charge of racially aggravated harassment on or before June 9 last year. She denied a second charge of racially aggravated harassment putting another in fear of violence and the offence was ordered to lie on file. During today's sentencing hearing defence counsel Lance Murray said Godefroid wished to change her plea from guilty to not guilty. Curfew: Godefroid was told she must remain in her Westminster home in London between 9pm and 7am . He told the court Godefroid, who has been diagnosed as suffering with mixed personality disorder, agoraphobia, dementia and panic attacks, among other issues, had pleaded guilty because she 'if she proceeded with a trial it would kill her'. He said: 'At one point we had my client on the floor on her knees so upset with the idea that the following day there would be a trial. 'She however insisted she was not guilty of the offence she had been charged with and she simply wanted it to go away.' Judge Robbins ruled that it was 'not in the interests of justice' to allow Godefroid to change her plea.

The manager of the police force's speed camera unit later admitted the error, but the company would not relent and Mr Kellerman is still looking for another job. He was on his way to deliver electrical goods to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when he noticed a speed camera flash as he drove along the Hatfield Road in St Albans. Paul, of Cudworth in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: 'I saw the signs and knew it was a 40 mph zone but I knew I wasn't doing much more than 30 mph. 'I was gutted but I knew I was well under the limit. It's a high street, you can't do 103 mph and I wouldn't do that anyway.' His van even had a speed limiter on it, meaning it cannot go above 70 mph. Mr Kellerman contacted the police to complain and officers admitted their mistake. A letter from the speed unit manager said: 'On further investigation it is apparent that you were travelling within the speed limit at 34 mph in a 40 mph zone and the ticket was issued as a result of operator error.' The unit manager even telephone Mr Kellerman's boss but his job had already been filled. The speed camera had wrongly recorded the speed of Mr Kellerman's vehicle and the operator failed to check the speed before issuing the notice. Mr Kellerman, who worked up to 80 hours a week for £320, also called the speed unit and said they could not apologise enough. He said: 'I was told it was an error on their part. They kept saying they were sorry and I wasn't the first person but I have still lost my job.' Mr Kellerman has lost a stone and a half in weight since being sacked. He has also signed up for housing benefits and has had to ask for help in paying his rent. Error: Mr Kellerman was travelling at just 34 mph when he was flashed by the speed camera (library image) He said: 'I tried to explain to my boss that I would never drive so fast but was replaced straight away because of the constant flow of work. It's not him I'm mad at it is the police. 'I know everyone makes mistakes but not on that scale. If I'd not got a letter of apology nobody would believe me. 'I would have had to go to court and would have got an automatic ban. Other people have got to complain.' A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'A notice of prosecution was issued in this instance in error. 'As soon as it was brought to our attention we retracted the notice and apologised to Mr Kellerman. 'We have written to him to confirm non further action will be taken in respect of the notice and have also offered to write to the company but Mr Kellerman declined this offer. 'We have also spoken to the employer to explain the situation. The subject of his employment is a matter for him and the company.'

"A staggering 316 million 'little household jobs' are undone in the UK . By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 08:50 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:50 EST, 5 February 2013 . Vowing to clean up was one of the most common New Year's resolutions at the start of 2013. But it would seem many of us are still procrastinating when it comes to keeping up with our household chores. The average busy Briton currently has 12 jobs which need doing around the house, new research has revealed. A lack of time, forgetfulness and being daunted by the prospect of starting them are the main reasons that tasks such as cleaning the oven and scouring the bath are languishing on the 'to do' list. 'I'll get around to it': Cleaning our ovens is the top most avoided chore by Britons . 'I can't face it': It seems the prospect of beginning task puts us off starting them, sometimes postponing it for years . Other 'get round to it' jobs include removing hair from plugholes, sorting through the fridge and wiping skirting boards. With 12 jobs needing attention in every house, that means a staggering 316 million 'little household jobs' are waiting to be carried out around the UK. Yesterday a spokesman for Oven Pride, which carried out the research, said: 'We all lead such hectic modern lives that it's sometimes hard to keep on top of everything. 'Of course the longer you leave a job, . the worse it usually is when you finally get round to facing it, but . making sure you have the right tools for the job can make household . chores less of a nightmare. When it comes down to it, the thought of doing a job you've put off is usually a lot worse than actually getting it done.' 'I'm too busy!':We blame not doing chores like touching up scuffed walls on our modern busy lifestyles . The dreaded task of cleaning the oven emerged as the most hated chore of all. Half . of the 2,000 people studied admitted they struggle with the nightmare . of maintaining a modern home while balancing work and family life. 1.      Cleaning the oven . 2.      Cleaning the windows . 3.      Painting walls - touching up scratches/marks . 4.      Dusting . 5.      Vacuuming the stairs . 6.      Sorting out a bedroom cupboard . 7.      Defrosting the freezer . 8.      Cleaning the skirting boards . 9.      Moving furniture to clean behind . 10.    Hoovering under the sofa cushions . 11.    Cleaning cooker hoods . 12.    Organising the garage . 13.    Mowing the lawn . 14.    De-scaling the kettle . 15.    Cleaning the bathroom . 16.    Cleaning out the fridge . 17.    Painting a fence . 18.    Ironing shirts . 19.    Cleaning the toilet . 20.    Scouring the bath . And the same number have a job they know they should tackle but have tried to forget it completely rather than attempt it. Cleaning cooker hoods, descaling the kettle and dusting make the list of jobs that are most commonly avoided. While the prospect of having to iron shirts dampens the spirit for many and features inside the top twenty most disliked chores. A defeated 55 per cent of people have attempted a chore but found it so daunting or difficult that they've abandoned it mid-way. A tenth of people have a job at home that they've put off doing for over five years. While three in ten have put a job off for at least a year or two. And a cheeky 48 per cent actively avoid doing a job in the hopes their partner will do it for them. But a stressed out 45 per cent of people admit to being kept awake at night over a job that they haven't been able to cross off the to-do list. But a visit from the mother-in-law spurs one in ten to conquer their cleaning while one in four can no longer put it off if it starts ruining the look of a room. And an all or nothing one in five say their approach is to let things mount up for a few weeks before tackling it all in one massive spruce up. The Oven Pride spokesperson added: 'The results show it's not uncommon to put off a job even for years at a time. 'What's important to consider though is whether leaving these things will impact the quality of your lifestyle or bring about long term damage that might cost you in the long run.'","Cleaning the oven tops our list of most avoided job .

As wedding season looms on the horizon there is bad news for maids of honour, bridesmaids and best men everywhere as it is revealed that the cost of being part of the ceremony just keeps on rising. The average Briton spent over £750 in 2012 helping family and friends celebrate their big day. A new YouGov survey has revealed that Brits . splash the cash on parties, presents, accommodation and travel . throughout the wedding calendar with women spending around 19 . per cent more than men (£857.69 vs £721.57). You may be happy for them, but bridesmaids are likely to be less happy about the £700 they spend helping their friend celebrate . The average Briton spent over £750 in 2012 attending the nuptials of their nearest and dearest. Having a role as part of the wedding party means even more strain placed on the purse: the average bridesmaid spends over £732 on each wedding they attend while the best man doesn’t fare much better, spending on average over £625 per event. The survey, which  was commissioned to celebrate the DVD release of wedding day rom-com, The Knot,  showed that the average couple spends over £1,500 a year attending the weddings of friends and family, and it seems the price only rises with age . Couples who are 55 and over spend over £500 more than their younger counter parts, parting with an astonishing £2000 a year, while solo wedding attendees over 55 spend £1200 per year. The cost of throwing the stag or hen their 'do' can add substantially to the cost for the bridesmaids and best man . Bridesmaid's often have to buy their own dress for the ceremony, which added to the cost of travel, accommodation, the hen do and a present, means costs can get very high . Londoners spent the most per wedding as guests (£697.74) putting to shame the rest of those from the South of England (£463.94) and the East who spent just over a meagre £200 at each wedding. However, Southerners were revealed as spending around 17 per cent more than Northerners overall.

A once morbidly obese man has transformed his life by dramatically losing 10st after he couldn't fit on a fairground ride seat with his son. Father-of-one Mark Rushmer put an end to his junk food diet after finding he couldn't take his son Morgan, nine, on a ride at Skegness Pleasure Beach. Morgan had begged Mark, who was 25st at his heaviest, to go on the white-knuckle fair rides but he was simply too big to fit in the seats. Mark's weight has dropped from about 25 stone (left) to an svelte 15 stone 2 pounds (right) Mark, from Derby, said: ‘We only get to go Skegness once a year. ‘I've always managed to squeeze into the seats of the children's rides so I could go on them with Morgan but it was painful. ‘Now he is nine years old, he wanted to go on the bigger rides that went upside down but I couldn't fit in them. ‘It was horrible for him. Other dads were going on with their children but I couldn't.’ As soon as he returned from the trip last Easter Mark decided to make a change. Mark, 40, said: ‘I began researching on the internet for local dieting groups. ‘I've messed about with diets my whole life. Every new year's resolution would be to lose weight. ‘I'd diet for a week or a fortnight and then always stop. Whether it be Weight Watchers or Slimming World, I'd always give in. ‘Because I work long hours and I get home late, I never really had the time to do it or I wouldn't be bothered. Mark (right) was spurred to lose weight when he could no longer fit on a fair ride seat with his son Morgan, aged 9 . Mark ditched his high carbohydrate diet for the Lighter Life diet where all food is replaced by specially prepared meals and sachets. He has now reintroduced 'normal' healthy foods into his diet . ‘I was touching 40 so I knew I had to do something. I knew of people around me who'd had heart attacks and diabetes and it scared me.' Logistics manager Mark says that as a young child he was always 'chubby'. He said: ‘Up until I was 22, I was quite slim, but when I was 25 I started to get bigger. ‘I'd been introduced to pubs, clubs and takeaways and I got even bigger over the next 15 years until I reached 25st, which was my heaviest.’ Breakfast: A bowl of porridge, fruit and fibre or muesli . Lunch: Fruity cous-cous and a yoghurt . Dinner: Low-fat protein such as chicken with plenty of green vegetables . Exercise: Mark now does lots of  high-energy sports including squash, horse riding and go-karting . His previous diet would include skipping breakfast, indulging in carbs and a lack of exercise. Mark said: 'I'd get up at 4am and not eat anything until around 9am when I'd have a big breakfast with bacon, sausage, the works. ‘I never bothered making a packed lunch so I'd buy sandwiches, crisps, pop and chocolate. Then in the evenings I'd eat quite healthily but it would be carbohydrates like pasta and rice. ‘I used to eat a lot of bread as well. I'd eat four to six slices of toast in one go.’ In May last year, he turned to the LighterLife weight loss management programme, a counselling service in Littleover, weighing in at 24st 12lb. He undertook the Total programme, where ordinary food is replaced by specially-formulated food packets per day alongside weekly counselling sessions to assess the psychological issues behind over-eating. Mark said: ‘There were packet soups, breakfast porridge, cereal bars, even shepherd's pie and chilli con carne, but you had to add water to it all. His weight loss has allowed Mark to spend his weekends doing high-energy activities including sports, squash, horse riding and go-karting with his son . ‘The porridge was more like a hot milky drink.The first two to three weeks were very very hard but I was determined to do it. 'We even went on an all-inclusive holiday to Menorca in July and I stuck to the diet. I had no alcohol or ice-cream.’ He later moved on to a diet where 'proper' food was gradually introduced. Four months later, in September, he achieved his target weight of 16st. He then took the dieting even further and dropped to 15st 2lb. Now his daily routine includes eating a healthy and balanced diet. He said: ‘I'll have porridge, fruit and fibre or muesli for breakfast. ‘Now I feel good about myself, I've found that I stop worrying about what people think about me' says Mark . Then fruity cous cous and a yoghurt for lunch and lots of green vegetables and chicken or protein in the evening. ‘Now I only eat pasta or rice once a fortnight.’ To celebrate his weight loss he took his partner Caroline and Morgan to Alton Towers. Mark said: 'Morgan absolutely loved it. ‘He is extremely proud of me, telling everyone we meet what his dad has achieved. The sheer delight on Morgan's face was worth every second.’ Now Mark spends his weekends with high-energy activities including sports, squash, horse riding and go-karting. He said: ‘We're so much more active now. ‘Doing things together as a family unit has made a difference to Caroline and Morgan. We're much happier and closer. ‘Life is all up for grabs now, Caroline and I have booked a flight in a helicopter and I'm finding that I want to try anything and everything. ‘We've been horse-riding and I play more sports than I ever used to. I even join in with Morgan when he goes go-karting. We're pretty evenly matched, too, so often it's touch and go as to who wins. Not only does Mark feel better, he says he looks better too. He said: ‘A few people have said I'm much cheekier now, I'm not 100 per cent sure what they mean by that, but I have definitely noticed that my confidence has received a major boost. ‘Now I feel good about myself, I've found that I stop worrying about what people think about me. ‘I used to dread going shopping with Caroline as there was probably only one place where I could realistically buy clothes from but now there's no stopping me. ‘It tends to be me dragging her around the shops, buying more clothes than I could ever possibly need.’","Father-of-one Mark Rushmer lost 10 stone to reach his goal of 15st 2lbs .

A British grandmother sentenced to death by firing squad for smuggling cocaine into Bali has lost her High Court battle to force the UK Government to help her appeal. Lindsay Sandiford, 56, was accused by the court of damaging the . image of Bali and received the sentence despite prosecutors asking for only a 15-year jail term. Her family took legal action after the UK Foreign Office refused to help pay for 'an adequate lawyer' so she can launch an appeal. Scroll down for video . Running out of time: Lindsay Sandiford with her sister Hilary Parsons who says she fears her sister will be executed because she has run out of money for a legal challenge . But two judges sitting in London dismissed the case today. Mrs Justice Gloster, sitting with Mrs . Justice Nicola Davies, said the court understood 'the deep concerns of . Mrs Sandiford and her family about Mrs Sandiford's predicament' but her . case must be dismissed for reasons to be given on Monday next week. The High Court was told that a notice . of appeal was filed with Indonesian officials earlier this week and she . was given a 14-day deadline to file grounds of appeal. Aidan O'Neill QC said Sandiford was . urgently in need of funding because she is without legal assistance and . her family have exhausted all of their available resources. Her sister Hilary Parsons is terrified that Sandiford, who is locked up in Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison, will run out of time to launch an appeal against her death sentence, which must be filed by February 12. But . with the family's finances dried up, the search for a top lawyer who . will take on Mrs Sandiford's appeal for little or no payment has so far . defied the desperate efforts of Mrs Parsons. 'Unless I can get someone to help, I fear the worst for Lindsay,' she said as she arrived at the gates of the prison on her daily visit. 'With no appeal launched the death sentence moves along.' And she has told the legal rights charity Reprieve: 'I can't imagine what we will do if we miss the opportunity to save Lindsay's life.' Staying in a cheap hotel in Bali, Mrs Parsons cannot even afford to pay the travelling expenses of an Indonesian lawyer who has offered to take on the case for no payment. Neither Mrs Sandiford nor or sister have any hope of raising money by selling their story as British laws prevent convicted people and their families from benefiting financially from their crimes. Mrs Parsons admits she is in a 'terrifying position' as she struggles to find ways to help her sister when she does not speak Indonesian and has not found any assistance in understanding how the country's criminal justice system works. The two women have turned to the British government for help – if for nothing more than to cover the costs of a lawyer who will act for Mrs Sandiford for no fee. Caught: Sandiford was arrested at Bali's international airport with 10.6lb of cocaine in her possession . Death sentence: The court told the grandmother she had shamed Bali's tourism reputation by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island's international airport . The British grandmother is being kept in Kerobokan jail in Bali, Indonesia. Her appeal must be filed by February 12 . But the government has made it clear it does not pay for the legal representation of its citizens arrested in other countries. 'I am so scared that we will lose the chance to appeal,' Mrs Parsons told the charity group. 'A lawyer should have started work on the case a week ago and every day that goes by is a day that Lindsay loses for preparing her appeal. 'We have nowhere else to turn. We desperately need the help of the British Foreign Office to ensure that Lindsay has a lawyer.' Even if she finds a lawyer to launch her appeal, Mrs Sandiford, originally from Teeside, faces up to eight years in prison as her pleas for a lesser sentence grind through the notoriously slow Indonesian courts. Even the first week since she was given the death sentence has proved a nightmare, with Mrs Sandiford hardly moving from her cell for exercise. Convicted of carrying 10lbs of cocaine, worth £1.7million when she arrived at Bali airport last year, she spends most of the time sleeping in her small cell, which she has to share with several other women. A warder said Mrs Sandiford was 'deeply depressed' and found little comfort even when her sister visited her each day. Mrs Parsons has been telling her sister of her efforts outside the jail to find a lawyer – but both women are aware that the clock is ticking away against the condemned grandmother.","Lindsay Sandiford, 56, sentenced to death in Bali after being found with 10lbs of cocaine worth an estimated £1.7million .

Condemned: Lindsay Sandiford could be executed within weeks after Indonesia signalled its intention to resume state executions . Condemned British drug smuggler Lindsay Sandiford could be executed within weeks after Indonesia signalled its intention to resume state executions. No one has been put to death in the country since 2008, and because of this at least 12 death row inmates believed they had avoided execution. However, attorney general Basrief Arief has announced that death sentences will be carried out again soon. Sources in the Indonesian province of Bali, where Mrs Sandiford, 56, is being held after being sentenced last month, have suggested her crime has led to the decision to resume executions. She was caught smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine through Bali airport last year. Mrs Sandiford has to lodge an appeal by February 12 but is having difficulty in paying for a lawyer to handle the process. If the deadline is missed she must then rely on presidential mercy. If the current 12 death row inmates are executed, they will be the first to die since November 2008 when three terrorists convicted of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings were tied to posts in an orchard and killed by a firing squad. That year, 10 people were executed, compared to a total of 11 in the previous decade. Although Mr Basrief has said earlier that the respite in executions since 2008 had been due to long appeals processes, which he wanted shortened, he is also said to have been dismayed at the brazenness of drug smugglers in recent years.

Hundreds gathered in New York City to attend a memorial for tech pioneer Aaron Swartz, where he was remembered for being an icon for the internet era and not a criminal facing numerous felony charges. According to the Associated Press, . the memorial, held at New York's Cooper Union, had several high-profile . speakers who re-affirmed their support for Swartz's work. Perhaps the most emotional tribute for Swartz came from Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, his girlfriend, who was also the first to discover his body. She reflected on him taking his own life, saying 'I'm so sad we'll never see all the ways he'll change the world from here on out.' Government at fault: Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, Aaron Swartz's girlfriend, had critical words for the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston . Stinebrickner-Kauffman's eulogy did not shy away from criticizing the role the government played in Swartz's suicide. 'He faced a deeply dysfunctional criminal justice system, one that he is far from the only victim of.' In reference to the prosecutor overseeing the case on behalf of the U.S. Attorney's office, she said he was 'hell-bent on destroying [Swartz's] life.' In the days following Swartz's death, a number of members from the internet elite poured in their sentiments about his work with online transparency and it created a national dialogue about what should be free on the internet. Paying respects: Damien Kulash, of the band OK Go, was just one of a number of speakers and performers at Swartz's funeral in New York City . Edward Tufte, a professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale, also spoke on Saturday. He was an admirer of Swartz, and following his death he wrote on Twitter, 'Heartbreaking news that my dear friend Aaron Swartz has died at 26. Imaginative, smart about everything, and, best of all, different.' Showing how Swartz's work resonated outside the internet community, the memorial also featured a performance from Damien Kulash, a member of the pop group OK Go. Swartz, 26, . killed himself on January 11, just a month before he was set to go on . trial in Boston for thirteen felony charges. A maximum sentence would . have carried decades in prison and huge fines. Prosecutors . contended that Swartz had broken into the computer database at . Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in 2010 in order to . access the scholarly website JSTOR, which is pay-access. He was indicted in July the following year. Internet titan supporters: Glenn Otis Brown, the director of business development at Twitter, speaks during the memorial service for Aaron Swartz, whom he met as a teenager . The Boston-based U.S. Attorney overseeing the case, Carmen Ortiz, when asked previously about the charges filed against Swartz noted that  'stealing is stealing.' Following the news of Swartz's death Ortiz seemed shaken, even close to crying, when talking to reporters. Though she said that the U.S. Attorney's office was 'terribly upset about what happened,' the case was handled fairly . Many are still questioning if the prosecutors went too far in their case against Swartz. The scrutiny will likely continue as memorials for Swartz go on around the country. When talking about the future of online freedom, Stinebrickner-Kauffman expressed some positivity, saying, 'Out of today phoenixes are already rising from [Swartz's] ashes. Earlier this week Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) posted a proposal for an amendment to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act onto Reddit.'We should prevent what happened to Aaron from happening to other Internet users.' It is currently called 'Aaron's Law.'

Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s partner - popularly known as the country’s ‘First Bloke’ - has landed himself in hot water over a jokey comment he made while giving a lecture about prostate cancer. Tim Mathieson told members of the West Indian cricket team at the Prime Minister’s home,  The Lodge,  in Canberra that when being tested for the disease the best way was to ‘look for a small female Asian doctor’. He was suggesting that because the physical test involved a finger check a smaller hand would be more comfortable. Tim Mathieson, partner of Prime Minister Julia Gillard, made a joke about prostrate exams that has landed him in hot water . ‘We can get a blood test for it but the digital examination is the only true way to get a correct reading on your prostate so make sure you go and do that and perhaps look for a small Asian female doctor is probably the best way,’ he said to chuckles among the team. But one person was definitely not amused - Miss Gillard,  who was present and who refused to join in the mirth. And today,  a few hours after the remark, Miss Gillard admitted that Mr Mathieson’s comments were in poor taste. After he had apologised, Miss Gillard said he had done the right thing to say he was sorry – but defended his commitment to men’s health causes. ‘He did his best to persuade notoriously reluctant men to get health checks,’ said Miss Gillard, who had simply stared at him from behind his back as he made what he thought was an amusing statement. ‘It’s important to get that message across’ she told ABC radio. ‘Obviously, there’s various ways of getting that message across but he’ s certainly acknowledged that the joke cracked last night was in poor taste.’ Miss Gillard told Australian radio: 'He's certainly acknowledged that the joke cracked last night was in poor taste' Mr Mathieson, 55, a real estate agent and former hairdresser who has been Miss Gillard’s partner since 2006, said today that his remarks were aimed at raising awareness about prostate cancer and the need for men to get regular checks. A supporter of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and a volunteer ambassador for the Australian Men’s Shed Association – a male support group - Mr Mathieson admitted today that he had got it wrong. ‘It was meant as a joke and on reflection I accept it was in poor taste,’ he said in a brief statement issued by the Prime Minister’s office. ‘I apologise for any offence caused’ Shadow attorney general George Brandis said Mr Mathieson was lucky he didn’t tell his joke after an anti-discrimination bill – currently before parliament - became law. ‘If he did, he’d probably have been carted away to the re-education camp by the thought police,’ Senator Brandis told Sky News, adding that the joke was in poor taste. Radio host Ray Hadley said it was ironic that Mr Mathieson should have made a comment that would be offensive to Asian women after Miss Gillard had last year accused the leader of the Liberal opposition, Tony Abbott, of being a misogynist. The couple, who have been together since 2006, met Prince William at the Royal Wedding in 2011 . Mr Mike Kelly, Labour’s parliamentary secretary, said that while Mr Mathieson had been a tireless promoter of men’s health issues, the joke would have been better left unsaid. ‘It’s a poor choice of words,’ he told Sky News. Social media commentators were divided over whether the comment was tasteless. Cheryl Critchley wrote on Twitter that ‘Tim Mathieson’s comment was dumb but at least it’s got everyone talking about prostate exams.’ Another commentator wrote: ‘I’m offended by Tim Mathieson’s allegedly sexist/racist joke. Time to take him to a Gillard-approved kangaroo court?’ A supporter of Mr Matthieson’s comment wrote that it was ‘not offensive at all, and if it makes just one bloke book a prostate exam, then the exercise has been worthwhile.’","Tim Mathieson joked smaller hands make the physical test more bearable .

Brighton antique dealer, who has been cleared of smuggling but was . charged with drug possession, was the last of the so-called British . ‘gang of four’ said to have plotted to bring 10.6lb of cocaine into the . holiday island from Thailand. Ponder was also fined one billion rupiah, around £65,000, by the court in Bali. Two other Britons have . received light sentences – Ponder’s lover Rachel Dougall, 38, has been . sentenced to a year in jail for failing to report a drug crime, and . 40-year-old Paul Beales from Milton Keynes, has been sent to prison for . four years for possession of marijuana. Mrs Sandiford, who is . understood to have made no profit from the drug smuggling operation when . she was arrested with the cocaine hidden in the lining of her suitcase . last May, has accused Ponder, Miss Dougall and Beales of being the major . players. ‘I’ve become the scapegoat in . all this,’ the Cheltenham woman told narcotics squad officers as the . investigation into the smuggling operation continued last year. ‘I . cannot be made to pay for the more serious crimes of others.’ Through her co-operation in . pointing an accusing finger at the others, prosecutors asked for a . 15-year-jail sentence and not mandatory death – but she was shocked when . last week a panel of judges ignored the prosecution request and . sentenced her to execution. The court accused Sandiford of damaging the image of the resort island. Ponder and Miss Dougall lived . in a £1,000 a week palatial villa in Bali and because of their aloof . behaviour and extravagant lifestyle villagers described them as the King . and Queen of Bali. When Mrs Sandiford led police . to Ponder after her arrest, he told officers that he thought packages . she had given him were sweets for his six-year-old daughter, Kitty. Scroll down to watch . 'Major player': Ponder, seen in a holding cell before the hearing today, was sentenced to six years in prison . Jail time: Ponder will spend six years behind bars for his part in the plot, in contrast to Lindsay Sandiford who faces death by firing squad . 'Aloof': The extravagant lifestyle enjoyed by Ponder and his partner Rachel Dougall on the Indonesian isle saw them dubbed the 'King and Queen of Bali' by locals . Mrs Sandiford plans to launch an . appeal against the death sentence, a process that is expected to take . years as it drags through the courts, and she has also started action . against the Foreign Office claiming it has failed to support her . appeal. She is understood to have exhausted . all her family’s finances and cannot afford a lawyer to fight the . appeal, documents for which must be filed by February 12. If she misses the deadline, the human rights charity Reprieve said she could still appeal for presidential clemency. Plot: The British former antique dealer's punishment has been met with disappointment from police in Bali, who regard the six year sentence as a 'let-off' 'King of Bali': Ponder, seen right with his translator in court in Bali, had bragged that he would not receive a death sentence in the days leading up to the verdict . Verdict: Former antiques dealer Ponder leaves the temporary cell to make his way to the hearing at Denpasar district court in Bali today . The charity has engaged solicitors in . Britain to file a judicial review on Mrs Sandiford’s behalf against the . Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Reprieve alleges the FCO has failed to . take all reasonable steps to ensure that Mrs Sandiford does not face . the death penalty and does not suffer degrading treatment. The charity also alleges that the FCO is in breach of its obligations to have ensured that Mrs Sandiford received a fair trial. Ponder, cleared of smuggling but convicted of possessing 23g of cocaine, faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. But . the prosecution asked the judges to impose a penalty of seven years - . and then, in a reversal of the way the judges treated Mrs Sandiford, . they reduced his sentence to six years. So . he, like his partner Miss Dougall and Paul Beales, has got off lightly . when at first all of them, including Mrs Sandiford, were facing the . death penalty. End of the road: Lindsay Sandiford has been sentenced to death by firing squad . 'Scapegoat': Mrs Sandiford, from Cheltenham, plans to launch an appeal against her death sentence . 'Extravagant': Ponder's lover Rachel Dougall, 39, has been sentenced to a year in prison for failing to report a drug crime . With time served and because of her good behaviour behind bars, Miss Dougall hopes to be back home in Britain before the summer. Ponder can also expect to have up to a year taken off his six year sentence. Paul Beales is likely to be released shortly after he has served three years of his sentence for marijuana possession. That would leave only Mrs Sandiford behind bars, facing a bleak future of years of appeals and, even then, the grim prospect of being taken to waste ground and gunned down by a firing squad. In her case, the prosecution had asked for her to be sent to jail for 15 years, but she, the police and lawyers were shocked when the judges handed down the death penalty.","'Major player' in £1.6million cocaine-smuggling plot sentenced to six years in Bali .

For centuries, they been a source of national pride – as well as some good-humoured merriment. And for those who feared Britain’s regional accents may be dying out, take heart - as it appears they will be with us for a good few years yet. From the Scottish brogue to the Welsh lilt, new research shows local accents are actually getting stronger as people struggle to retain a sense of identity. Experts had originally predicted that local dialects would die out in the last half century with the rise of social mobility -  but the study shows the opposite is true. On the up: Researchers at Aston University in Birmingham have found accents are getting stronger . Researchers at Aston University say people are now choosing to hang on to the way their parents and grandparents speak as a marker of local allegiance. They say accents no longer hold a stigma and instead allow people to feel more connected with where they were brought up. Dr Urszula Clark of Aston University, who lead the project, said: ‘The implications of our research are far reaching, revealing how far people’s relationships with linguistic variety have changed. ‘Rather than being a mark of social stigma, people are choosing certain features of accent or dialect to mark an identity with a particular place, instead of with a particular social class or ethnic group.’ Researchers found that many felt connected to their home and family through their accent (stock image) The study, on people living in the West Midlands, showed many chose to use dialect and accent forms deliberately and self-consciously. This finding is consistent with research undertaken by other researchers in the UK in relation to those living in Bristol, Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield. The research indicates that drawing upon linguistic features of a particular variety, such as Black Country English, cuts across ethnicity, gender and class boundaries. However, while speaking with a regional accent is socially acceptable in the world of entertainment and sport, the study found there is some snobbery in areas like education, the law and government. The West Midlands English: Speech and Society project was set up to investigate and describe the range of accents and dialects of the West Midlands today. The research looked at the ways in which performers, including comedians, poets, and dramatists, used accent as a way of expressing a place identity. Researchers attended 20 performances at local venues across the Midlands and interviewed the performers as well as audience members. Dr Clark added: ‘The reasoning behind the project is to draw the wider public’s attention to the change in people’s relationships with linguistic variety. ‘This is not to say anything goes: a regional variation of English is linguistically just as rule governed as standard English, but with different rules, which in many cases can be traced back historically to Middle English, a time pre-dating the emergence of standard English.’","Experts originally predicted local dialects would die out in the last half century with the rise of social mobility .

Suing: Prison guard Jeremy Stodghill, pictured, filed the lawsuit after his wife, Lori, died of a heart attack at St Thomas More hospital in Canon City, Colorado, along with her unborn twin boys in 2006 . A Catholic hospital has defied its own long-held belief that life begins at conception by arguing that fetuses are not people in a wrongful death case. Prison guard Jeremy Stodghill filed the lawsuit after his wife, Lori, died of a heart attack at St Thomas More hospital in Canon City, Colorado, along with her unborn twin boys in 2006. The heavily pregnant 31-year-old was brought into the hospital's emergency room on New Year's Day, vomiting and with shortness of breath. By the time Mr Stodghill parked his car and returned to the ER, she'd lost consciousness. Less than an hour later, she suffered a fatal heart attack and her twins died with her, having been left inside her womb. But Mr Stodghill is arguing the twins could have been saved if doctors had performed a perimortem Cesarean section. Despite being paged by the hospital, the on-call obstetrician, Dr Pelham Staples, who was also Lori's personal obstetrician, never arrived. Mr Stodghill recalls speaking to him on the phone. 'He said, ""Well, what do you want to do? Take the babies? Take the babies?""' Jeremy told Westword.com News. 'I kept responding, ""I'm not a doctor!""' A nurse listened for fetal heartbeats but didn't hear any so the ER doctor John Pelner decided against a Cesarean section. Eventually all three were pronounced dead. Two years later, Mr Stodghill sued the hospital, Dr Staples and Dr Pelner for the wrongful deaths of his wife and twins. The hospital, and the healthcare provider that runs it, Catholic Health Initiatives, which operated 78 Catholic hospitals in 17 states, have argued that nothing could have been done to save Ms Stodghill. But despite claiming to follow the . directives of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops that states the . sanctity of life begins 'from the moment of conception until death,' Catholic Health's lawyers have turned the teachings of the Church on . their head in their defense against the twins' deaths. Hospital: Lori Stodghill died of a heart attack at St Thomas More hospital in Canon City, Colorado, pictured . They are arguing that a fetus is not a person and 'unborn persons' cannot be the subject of a wrongful death case because they do not have the same rights as those born alive. One of the defense attorneys, Jason Langley, argued in documents filed with the Colorado Supreme Court that the judge 'should not overturn the long-standing rule in Colorado that the term ""person,"" as is used in the Wrongful Death Act, encompasses only individuals born alive. Colorado state courts define ""person"" under the Act to include only those born alive. Therefore Plaintiffs cannot maintain wrongful death claims based on two unborn fetuses.' Many Catholics are supporting the Stodghills over the church in the court battle because they believe a win for the plaintiffs would be a win for pro-life advocates. The Catholic Health attorneys have so far won decisions from Fremont County District Court and the Colorado Court of Appeals based on this argument but in September, the Stodghill's appealed the case to the state Supreme Court. It is not yet clear whether the high court will hear the case or send it back to the appellate court.","Jeremy Stodghill filed the lawsuit after .

Instead the eagerly awaited expansion of Street View showcases one of the seven wonders of the world as a lush and green expanse with extensive woods. The internet search company in October sent staff lugging backpack-mounted Street View cameras to capture the views around the trails of the geological scar that carves a swathe across Arizona. Those images have now been processed, stitched together and turned into panoramic, scrollable images available to view on Google Maps. The view towards Phantom Ranch: The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon ('Ongtupqa' in the Hopi language) a holy site and made pilgrimages to it. Outstanding natural beauty: Grand Canyon .

The wife of a Florida police officer has been arrested for allegedly running a prostitution ring from two apartments in Boca Raton. Denise McCoy, 34, and her apparent business partner Sara Marin, 42, were charged with pimping and money-laundering on Tuesday and are being held in the Palm Beach County jail. McCoy's husband, Samuel McCoy, has been put on paid administration leave following the prostitution bust, according to Boca Police Chief Dan Alexander, though he hasn't been arrested. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Busted: Denise McCoy, left, and Sara Marin, right, were charged with pimping and money-laundering . 'It's very early (in the investigation),' Alexander told the Sun Sentinel. According to the newspaper, a Brazilian sex worker helped police unearth the local prostitution ring. She told detectives the two women pimped her out for nine months after insisting that no sex would be involved when they offered her the job. When one of the male clients demanded intercourse, the woman refused but she said Denise McCoy threatened to have her jailed as an illegal immigrant if she didn't comply. According to the unnamed woman's affidavit, Denise McCoy and Marin advertised several girls using online classified website, Backpage.com. She said the women arranged for the girls to have sex with johns at apartments at 22312 Calibre Court and 22042 Boca Place Drive in two shifts from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. On leave: McCoy's husband, Samuel McCoy, pictured, has been put on paid administration leave following the prostitution bust . The clients paid $200 per hour plus tips to the hookers who split the cash evenly with McCoy and Marin. According to the Sun Sentinel, the woman . told police she worked six days a week, having sex with anywhere from . six to 12 men each day. Using the tip, police set up surveillance at both apartments over several months and reported seeing women entering the apartments for long periods, followed by a stream of men who spent 10 minutes to 1 hour inside. The police also went undercover, with a Boca Raton Police investigator paying $200 for McCoy to masturbate for 10 to 15 minutes, the Sun Sentinel reported. In another operation, a sergeant paid $150 for oral sex and intercourse with Marin, but created a 'ruse' in order to leave. Sex scene: The accused arranged for the girls to have sex with johns at an apartment at 22312 Calibre Court, pictured, . Surveillance officers spotted the women . handing something to Denise McCoy, who then drove to a Bank of America . ATM, or to a Boynton Beach home where police say Marin lived. Several johns admitted paying for sex acts in the . apartments when they were cornered by police as they left. Boca police subpoenaed bank records for Denise McCoy, and found 62 cash deposits totaling $29,640.38 between March and November 2012. The Sun Sentential reported that Marin's bank records for three accounts showed deposits totaling $40,779, $36,940, $35,885 and $11,723 between January and September 2012. Some of the money apparently moved between Marin's accounts. This isn't the first time Samuel McCoy, 31, has been suspended from his police job. He was put on leave twice in 2011, according to the Sun Sentinel. In April, he was suspended for 36 hours after he was caught taking pictures of his genital area while on duty. Other location: Men also visited girls at 22042 Boca Place Drive, pictured . McCoy said he had a medical condition that he needed to document and insisted he said he never sent the photos to anyone and they were deleted. In July 2011, he was suspended for 84 hours for looking at pornography on his work computer. He said he was looking for jujitsu videos online and clicked on other links that 'piqued my interest,' according to the newspaper. That investigation was prompted by a city official who found out that Samuel McCoy was part of an adult social networking site for swingers. The mayor of Boca Raton, Susan Whelchel, told WPTV.com that no one has indicated officer McCoy was involved in the alleged prostitution ring. 'The investigation will prove whatever it proves and if he had absolutely nothing to do with this then he's a fine person and he will continue,' she said.","Denise McCoy, 34, and Sara Marin, 42, were charged with pimping and money-laundering on Tuesday .

A woman has died after her van was 'riddled with bullets' while she was driving on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive early this morning. The shocking slaying comes days after a 15-year-old girl was randomly gunned down in a south-side neighborhood on Tuesday and brings the city's death toll for 2013 to at least 43. Today's shooting occurred at around 4 a.m. on the Lake Shore Drive ramp leading to Interstate 55. The 32-year-old woman was traveling south with a 37-year-old female passenger in her 2000 white Dodge when a 'brown full-size van' pulled in next to them and someone opened fire.

Cities in Germany have warned that ‘social peace’ there is at risk due to an influx of economic migrants from Bulgaria and Romania. In a stark warning to the UK, reports tell of an epidemic of illegal working, chaos in schools because so many children can’t speak German, and an alarming increase in organised crime since the migrants arrived. Dortmund, Hanover, Berlin and Hamburg say they are struggling to absorb a six-fold increase in economic migration from the two countries since 2006. A Roma community in Bulgaria. Both Bulgaria and Romania are relatively . poor, rendering employment in the Germany and the UK attractive prospects . The rise is exacerbated by the euro . crisis, which has forced Bulgarians and Romanians to seek a better life . in their nearest big economy. A report by the German Association of Cities says they face ‘significant . costs as a result of this poverty migration’. They are demanding . financial support from Chancellor Angela Merkel, telling her ‘the social . balance and social peace is extremely endangered’. It comes as worried councils in the UK appeal for help with an expected . influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when they are given free . access to our jobs market from the start of next year.

UK: Bulgarians and Romanians who come to Britain from January 1, 2014, will be eligible for most benefits if they have work, are self-employed or seeking a job, have an address and intend to stay. They would be means tested, but could get: Jobseeker’s allowance, housing benefit, working tax credits, incapacity benefit, disability living allowance, income support and child benefit. Germany: Immigrants can claim child benefit until the child is 18, or 25 if still in education. It is £160 per month for each of the first two children, £165 for the third and £187 for each subsequent one. A scheme barring EU citizens from jobless benefits until they have worked in Germany for a year is being legally challenged. Romania and Bulgaria: The only government welfare payments are child benefit, which is £3.50 per youngster per week in Bulgaria and £3.69 in Romania. Councillor Nickie Aitken said: ‘We need some firm answers from the . Government both on numbers and whether we can expect any extra help for . bulging school rolls and housing services already squeezed to the . maximum.’ Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 but under ‘transitional . controls’, most low-skilled workers have continued to require permission . to come to the UK.

An Afghan woman who was jailed for adultery after being raped by her cousin's husband has now been forced to marry the man to restore the family's honour and avoid becoming a social outcast. The 22-year-old woman, who is known only as Gulnaz, married her attacker last week in Kabul, after spending more than 13 months as a virtual prisoner inside a women’s shelter. Her heartbreaking story highlights the . desperate plight faced by thousands of women in Afghanistan, who despite . years of efforts by western agencies, endure horrific abuse . and have no effective recourse under the law. Desperate plight: Afghan rape victim Gulnaz with the daughter she had after becoming . pregnant in the attack. She has now married her attacker . after spending 13 months as a virtual recluse in a woman's shelter . Gulnaz was found guilty of 'adultery by force' following the brutal attack in 2008 which left her pregnant. She was sentenced to two . years in jail, which was later increased to 12 years on appeal. A first release offer, which she eventually agreed to, stipulated she must marry her attacker. However her sentence was then cut to three years after a third appeal, and, according to reports at the time, the requirement for her to marry the man, who himself was jailed for seven years, was dropped. Gulnaz gave birth to her daughter in the Badam Bagh women's prison . in Kabul before President Hamid Karzai took the highly unusual step of freeing her with no pre-conditions in December 2011. But free from prison, Gulnaz faced a life of isolation and poverty as mothers without husbands are shunned by their communities and their own families and become social outcasts. It has now been suggested that she reluctantly accepted the terms of the deal that had been offered to her in prison and approached the rapist's family to arrange terms. While she was staying at the shelter she reportedly used a needle to tattoo her rapist’s name on her hand - a sign of love. The marriage was formalised at a family court in Kabul on Saturday but many involved in the case fear Gulnaz will be consigned to a life of domestic slavery as the rapist's second wife. There are even fears she could be killed to restore his family honour. Heather Barr of Human Rights Watch . Afghanistan said: 'I think her concern is less for herself and more for . her daughter and the discrimination she might face. 'But it is difficult to imagine that . the life that awaits them will be a pleasant one. Gulnaz will . effectively become the second wife of the man that raped her. Gulnaz faced a life of isolation and poverty as mothers without husbands are often shunned by their communities and their own families and become social outcasts . 'Sadly there are dozens and dozens of these cases and a seriousl failure by the government to take them seriously. 'President Karzai has brought in laws which make rape a crime and make child marriage a crime but there is very little effort made to enforce them and the people who continue to commit these crimes enjoy impunity.' Gulnaz's case had been condemned widely by human rights groups. An online . petition started by Motley has been signed by more than 6,000 people. Her lawyer, American Kimberly Motley said Gulnaz had been 'systematically brainwashed' by Afghan officials, some of whom were women, into agreeing to the marriage and that she remained concerned about the future.. Her story was to form part of an EU-funded documentary about Afghan women in prison but its release was banned on the grounds it would adversely affect European relations with the Afghan government. The filmmakers also  feared it might compromise the safety of the women involved because it showed their identity. Director Clementine Malpas told the Times she believed that Gulnaz had married to give her daughter a chance for a future. She said: 'Marrying the man she told us had raped her isn’t what we had hoped for Gulnaz but the current cultural context of Afghanistan leaves very few options, especially for a woman with a child out of wedlock'. Under the rule of the Taliban between 1994 and 2001, women were stripped of many of their rights and forced to wear a burqa in public at all times. The were banned from employment, from appearing in public without a male relative and from speaking loudly in public on the grounds that no stranger should hear a woman's voice.","Woman known only as Gulnaz was brutally raped by her cousin's husband .

Jasmir Womack, 17, of Philadelphia, pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and conspiracy to recklessly endanger another person. Rahmiiyah Henderson, 16, pleaded guilty to the same charges on Tuesday in the September 25, 2012, attack. The girls are among six teens who . allegedly kicked and beat the mentally ill woman on her front steps and . then continued the violence inside after she tried to escape. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Guilty: Jasmir Womack, 17, of Philadelphia, right, and Rahmiiyah Henderson, 16, left, pleaded guilty this week to aggravated assault and reckless endangerment charges . Both teens were also sentenced to two years of consecutive probation, according to the Delaware County Daily Times. Investigators used a cell phone video of the beating that was uploaded on YouTube to identify the defendants. The four juveniles in the case were charged as adults. In court yesterday, Womack's attorney, Tracie Burns, described the incident as 'a very bad act.' According to the Daily Times, Burns said it was 'a poor, poor, poor exercise in judgment that resulted in injury to somebody else.' But she blamed comprehension and foresight difficulties that mean Womack is unable to understand the consequences of her actions. Young suspects: Jonyea Bell, 16, left, and Jamia Davis, 15, right, will be tried as adults . The teen said sorry for her part in the beating and said she hopes the victim is OK. The girls will attend school and anger management classes in addition to serving out their sentences. Three other defendants - Jamia Davis, 15, Janyea Bell and Anye Dennis, both 16 — have hearings scheduled for March 11 and could still be tried as juveniles. Takia Nicole Edwards, 19, who is the sole adult in the case, is due in court on February 26. The six teens were arrested on September 28 for allegedly brutally beating a mentally disabled woman 'just for fun,' and then posting a video of the savage attack on Facebook. The attack on the 48-year-old woman shook Chester, a city just outside Philadelphia. Grave allegations: Anye Dennis, 16, left, Takia Nicole Edwards, 19, right, were charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and a host of other counts in connection with the attack . Anye Dennis, 16, Henderson, 16, Jamia Davis, 15, and Janyea Bell, 16, were charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, reckless endangerment and harassment charges, according to Philadelphia Inquirer. They have been held in the Delaware County Prison on $50,000 bail each. According to police, the suspects attacked the woman, whom police described as 'mentally challenged' at random as she sat on the stoop outside her home on September 25. The victim was punched, kicked and hit with a shoe and chair, and suffered cuts and bruises but no broken bones, authorities said. Her name was not released. 'It appears just for fun,' Chester police Detective James Nolan said at the time. 'There hasn't been a discernible explanation as to why.' Gang: A group of brazen Philadelphia teenagers viciously attacked a random, unsuspecting woman after they came across her sitting outside her home and recorded the entire ordeal . Police Commissioner Joseph M. Bail Jr. said the victim treated for . lacerations and abrasions but survived the attack without serious injury. Chester Police Detective James Nolan said that the girls initially showed no remorse. 'It was a big party and they're still . defiant,' Nolan said. 'There's no discernible reason for what happened . other than fun, sport.' The video, in which the teens . approached the 48-year-old woman outside her . home, was uploaded onto Facebook.

Brutal: Police said that the attack took place at 9:15 p.m. on Tuesday . They laugh and joke with one another before turning their attention on the woman sitting on her stoop a few feet away. 'Talk to her first. Talk to her first,' one of the girls can be heard saying in the cell phone video. They approach the woman, saying something indiscernible, and she responds. Then, without warning, one of the teens punches the woman, the others following her lead. The woman crawls inside her home, but the girls follow her, kicking and hitting her the whole way. The victim climbs to her couch but the teens crawl on top her, one even hitting her with a chair. Throughout the whole ordeal, the girls laugh and complain that the woman's home is 'stinky.' The attack lasts about 90 seconds. The girls can be seen running out of the home when they are through. 'We out. We out. We out,' one of the girls says. The woman sought medical attention after the incident, but never told authorities. Remorseless: Police said that the random attack was carried out 'just for fun,' and even in jail the teenage girls do not feel sorry for their actions . 'Her face is all beat up, swelling,' neighbor Ken Worly said to ABC. Detective Nolan said it was rare to have proof of such an attack. 'This is something that occurs in the city that normally we don't have evidence of,' he said. 'You hear about things like this, but you generally don't see them firsthand, as in this account.' District Attorney Jack Whelan said he . did not hesitate to charge the teenagers as adults. 'The message is clear, if you are . going to act violently, if your behavior is equivalent to animalistic . behavior, then we will treat you accordingly, we will treat you as . adults in the criminal-justice system,' he said.

Rick Sheehy, pictured, resigned his post abruptly on Saturday after questions were raised about improper cell phone calls he'd made to four women . Nebraska's Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy has abruptly resigned after it emerged he'd made thousands of improper calls to women late at night on his state-issued cellphone. Governor Dave Heineman announced the departure at a hastily scheduled news conference this morning and said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the revelations about the 53-year-old who he was grooming to succeed him in office. Sheehy quit after the Omaha World-Herald obtained public records that detailed some  2,000 improper cellphone calls he had made to four women who were not his wife over the past four years. 'I've got a knot in my stomach. I'm deeply disappointed,' Heineman told reporters. He confirmed Sheehy's resignation followed disclosures made in a public records request but declined to discuss what those disclosures were. Henieman did, however, note that the resignation involved 'personal decisions' made by his lieutenant governor. 'I had trusted him, and that trust was broken,' he said, adding that the whole thing had happened 'very, very rapidly.' It is unclear what the nature of the calls was or who the women are. The World-Herald said many of the calls were long conversations held in the early hours. Last July, Sheehy's wife, Connie Sheehy, filed for divorce after nearly 29 years of marriage. Her divorce filing stated the 'marriage of the parties is irretrievably broken.' Frontrunner: Sheehy, pictured second from left with his wife and children, was the frontrunner to be the next governor . Scandal: The Omaha World-Herald revealed Sheehy had made thousands of improper calls to women other than his wife on his work phone . Sheehy, a Republican, had been considered the front-runner in the 2014 gubernatorial race and had been endorsed by Heineman. He has been traveling throughout the state, making speeches and holding public events. Sheehy was the mayor of Hastings before Heineman selected him as his running mate. They were elected by a record margin to their first full term in 2006 and re-elected in 2010. Heineman said he doubted Sheehy would run for the governor's office now. 'And no, I would not support him under the circumstances,' Heineman said. Sheehy . did not appear at the news conference, and Heineman declined to answer . questions about what had occurred that led Sheehy to resign. 'You'll have to ask him about that,' Heineman told reporters. Sheehy's office failed to answer calls from the Associated Press. Disappointed: Gov. Dave Heineman announced the news on Saturday and said he was 'deeply disappointed' Divorce: Sheehy's wife, Connie, pictured right, filed for divorce in July . The governor would not say whether he asked Sheehy to resign or if Sheehy acted on his own. But he said: 'As public officials, we're held to a higher standard. Rightly so.' Heineman said he will begin the process Monday of looking for a new lieutenant governor, and will appoint someone in the coming weeks. If something were to happen to Heineman before he selects a new lieutenant governor, Speaker of the Legislature Greg Adams would ascend to the governor's post. Sheehy's announcement shakes up an already turbulent 2014 governor's race. Another Republican candidate, former Nebraska Speaker of the Legislature Mike Flood, entered the race briefly but withdrew in December after his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. Trust is broken: Governor Dave Heineman, pictured at a press conference today, said he was 'deeply disappointed' Several Democratic candidates have signaled an interest in running, a list that includes University of Nebraska Regent Chuck Hassebrook and Nebraska state Sen. Steve Lathrop of Omaha. In recent weeks, party activists have also approached state Sen. Annette Dubas, of Fullerton. 'We're going to have a very strong candidate in 2014,' said Vince Powers, chairman of the Nebraska Democratic Party. 'This doesn't change anything, other than it really demonstrates that when you have one party in power for too long, arrogance and corruption and scandal follow it. It doesn't matter if it's Democrats in power or Republicans in power.' In an email to the Associated Press, Hassebrook said he is 'taking a hard look' at running for governor in 2014. 'I recognize that no human is without failing. So I wish Rick Sheehy and his family the best as they seek to heal from this disappointing episode,' he said. Sheehy changed his Twitter account settings to private before Heineman's press conference. Shortly after, his account appeared to have been deleted.","Rick Sheehy's shock departure came after it emerged he'd made some 2,000 calls to women who were not his wife from his state-issued cellphone .

Immigrants are to be banned from taking driving tests in 19 foreign languages in a bid to stop cheating and boost road safety, it was announced Tuesday. As well as beating fraud and keeping unsafe drivers off UK roads, the move to end foreign translations and translators will increase ‘social cohesion and integration’ in Britain and cut costs, the Government said. Those learning to drive can currently take their theory and practical driving tests in any of  21 languages. Consultation: Plans to outlaw the test being carried out in 'non-national languages' have been set out in a major consultation by the Government's Driving Standards Agency . Nearly 145,000 tests are taken every year in languages other than English and Welsh – from Albanian to Urdu - at a rate of around 2,700 a week. Of these, 108,374 were for the theory test and 35,000 for the practical test. The evidence also suggests that many were re-takes. Plans to outlaw the test being carried out in ‘non-national languages’ are set out in a major consultation by the Government’s Driving Standards Agency. Official figures show that since 2009 some 861 people had their theory test passes revoked after being coached on what to do during their theory and practical tests by ‘back-seat’ translators. Nine DSA-approved interpreters were also struck off for their part in such frauds. Ministers are also concerned about handing licences to people who are unable to read road signs. Currently people whose first language is not English or Welsh can request pre-recorded voice-overs for the computer-based car and motorcycle theory tests in 19 foreign languages. Variety: Nearly 145,000 tests are taken every year in languages other than English and Welsh - from Albanian to Urdu - at a rate of around 2,700 a week . The 19 Languages covered by interpreters are: Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Dari, Farsi, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Kurdish, Mirpuri, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Pushto, Spanish, Tamil, Turkish, Urdu. Candidates can also use approved interpreters on theory tests, usually if a voice-over is not available in a candidate's native language, or where a candidate speaks a dialect that would make a voice-over difficult to understand. Interpreters can also be used in practical tests to translate the examiner's instructions. Candidates have to pay for interpreters themselves, but the cost of developing and updating voice-overs for the theory test is met by the DSA. Ministers say the service, introduced by Labour, costs taxpayers £250,000 a year. There are currently 122 approved interpreters for the theory test where the potential for fraud is seen as more acute. However, a DSA spokesman said: ’For the practical test, candidates can bring anyone to interpret for them’. Road safety minister Stephen Hammond said allowing interpreters on tests for those whose first language is not English 'presents the risk of fraud' Of 1.68 million theory tests carried out in 2011-12, some 106,112 used foreign language voice-overs  and 2,262 involved  an interpreter being present, making a total of 108,374. When individual theory candidates are counted, some 57,361 requested voiceovers and 1,690 requested interpreters in 2011/12, suggesting many re-sat their tests at least once. Of the 1.57 million practical driving tests conducted in 2011-12, ‘around 35,000 were conducted with an interpreter present,’ says the new report.  When individual practical test candidates are counted, some 19,555 requested interpreters, again suggesting that many took their test more than once. Announcing the plans to remove voice-overs on the theory test and scrapping the use of interpreters on all tests, road safety minister Stephen Hammond said allowing interpreters on tests for those whose first language is not English ‘presents the risk of fraud’. Launching the eight-week public consultation, Mr Hammond said the Government’s ‘preferred choice’ was to remove all voice-overs and translation services in non-national languages. He added that interpreters could, for example, ‘indicate the correct answers to theory test questions’. Mr Hammond said: ‘There is a potential road safety risk of drivers not understanding important traffic updates or emergency information, but allowing interpreters on tests also presents the risk of fraud, for example if they are indicating the correct answers to theory test questions.’ It would reduce fraud by addressing ‘the problem of an interpreter attending for test with a learner driver and communicating advice beyond a strict translation of the theory test questions or the instructions given by the examiner.’ Lives could also be saved by improving road safety, he stressed, saying: ‘There is concern about the ability of non-English or Welsh speakers to understand road signs and other advice to drivers.’ He said the move would also help to ‘enhance social cohesion and to encourage integration in society by learning the national language’. Mr Hammond noted: ‘We want to ensure that all drivers have the right skills to use our roads safely and responsibly. We also want to keep test fees to a minimum for candidates, and I am not convinced that providing translations is the most effective use of resources'","Theory and practical driving tests can currently be taken in 21 languages .

Jeremy Browne will condemn cultural sensitivities for hindering the fight against forces marriages, honour crimes and genital mutilation . Immigrant communities cannot adopt a ‘pick ’n’ mix approach’ to living in a liberal democracy, a Home Office minister will insist today. Liberal Democrat Jeremy Browne will attack multicultural doctrines which have meant the state turning a blind eye to so-called ‘honour crimes’, forced marriage and female genital mutilation. He will condemn ‘misplaced cultural sensitivities’ for a failure to tackle such issues in Britain. Speaking at an event in the House of Lords, Mr Browne will warn that ‘thousands – perhaps hundreds of thousands’ of women and girls in this country are not enjoying the proper ‘benefits of living in our liberal society’. He will add: ‘That is not because of some accident or oversight. It is because of a deliberate rejection of the emancipation revolution and the equal opportunities now afforded to women and girls. ‘This situation is wrong. It is unacceptable for the individual women and girls whose freedom and opportunities are stifled. 'And it is wrong for our society. There cannot be a pick’n’mix approach to living in a benign liberal country. The benefits must be universal, without exceptions or exemptions. ‘I do not believe that cultural relativism provides an excuse to opt out of our shared liberal social settlement. Everyone should enjoy the freedom to make their own choices, without the fear of social coercion.’ Mr Browne will insist that forced marriage has ‘no place’ in British society, pointing out that the victims are ‘overwhelmingly young women and girls’. Up to 8,000 young women a year are being pushed into marriage without their consent in Britain, it is feared. Their families are mainly from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and East Africa. Mr Browne says fears over offending minorities have dogged the fight against forced marriages . Currently, the authorities have to try to prove that other laws, such as kidnapping, false imprisonment, harassment or assault, have been broken by those responsible. But Mr Browne will say the Coalition will create a specific criminal offence making it illegal to force a child or grandchild into a marriage against their wishes. Ministers argue a blind eye has been turned to extremism for too long for fear of offending minorities. Some schools have even refused to put up posters advising pupils about forced marriage for fear of causing offence or being branded racist. Mr Browne will also express alarm about the ‘abhorrent’ practice of female genital mutilation, citing evidence that around 20,000 girls in Britain are at risk.","Multiculturalism should not allow crimes like forced marriages, says minister .

At least five people were killed today when a powerful earthquake followed by a damaging tsunami struck the small Pacific nation of the Solomon Islands – where Prince William and his bride spent a holiday last September. The major 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Santa Cruz islands, which are part of the Solomons, just 250 miles from the private island of Tavanipupu, where Prince William and Kate enjoyed a brief visit five months ago. Waves of 1.5m struck the western side of the Santa Cruz Islands, smashing down at least three villages and destroying up to 50 homes. Scroll down for video . Villagers have fled for high ground after a quake struck the beautiful Solomon Islands . Hospital officials in the local town . of Lata said that five bodies – those of a boy aged about 10 and four . elderly people – had been brought in and many other people were being . treated for broken bones and cuts. 'We're expecting quite a few more casualties' said Mr Augustine Pilve, the hospital's director of nursing. Reports from the region, lying to the . east of the Solomons capital, Honiara, were still coming in last night, . but Mr Pilve said he believed hundreds of people around Lata may have . been affected by the tsunami which was stirred by the earthquake. The Solomons police commissioner, Mr . John Lansley, said police patrols were sifting through damaged villages . looking for dead and injured residents. 'Sadly, we believe some people have . lost their lives,' he said as the local hospital began counting the dead . who were being brought in. This was some of the damage a tsunami and an earthquake inflicted on the Solomon Islands in 2007 . This bulletin released by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center shows the area affected by the tsunami warning following a major earthquake measuring 8.0 magnitude off the Solomon Islands . When the quake hit, the Pacific . Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii, noticing that waves had been . generated, put out a widespread alert throughout the South Pacific, . warning that a tsunami might strike the Solomons, Vanuatu, Nauru, Papua . New Guinea, Tuvalu, New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and . Samoa. The warning resulted in thousands, . including tourists, leaving their homes, hotels and places of work to . flee to higher ground – in case a large wave came sweeping in. In the Solomons capital, Honiara, . people stood on hilltops looking out to sea, 'trying to observe if there . is a wave coming in,' said Mr George Herming, a spokesman for the Prime . Minister. The earthquake was yet another . reminder of the undersea danger that exists for nations on the so-called . Pacific 'Ring of Fire', an enormous zone of volcanic instability that . encircles the Pacific Ocean. The 'ring' embraces Indonesia in the . west to the coast of Chile in the east in a 40,000 kilometre arc of . seismic violence that unleashes earthquakes and volcanoes around the . Pacific ring virtually daily. The ring is actually an . interconnected circle of cracks in the Earth's hardened upper crust . which are under constant pressure from molten rock below. Just how volatile – and dangerous – . the region is was demonstrated on December 26, 2004, when a 9.4 . magnitude quake struck off Indonesia, unleashing tsunamis that smashed . into Indian Ocean shorelines killing more than 220,000 people, including . 149 Britons, and left millions homeless.

Atenia Tahu, who works for the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corp in Honiara, said most people were remaining calm. 'People around the coast and in the capital are ringing in and trying to get information from us and the National Disaster Office and are slowly moving up to higher ground,' Tahu said. 'But panic? No, no, no, people are not panicking.' Dr. Rooney Jagilly, the medical superintendent at the National Referral Hospital in Honiara, said the hospital asked about half its 200 patients to leave and stay with families or friends as a precautionary measure because the hospital is located near the shoreline. Those patients who weren't mobile enough to move stayed, but the hospital remained ready to evacuate them. Jagilly said there had been no flooding and he hoped the hospital would return to normal on Thursday. He said his staff was ready to mobilize to Santa Cruz because the small hospital there has no doctor after the previous one recently died. An official at the disaster management office in Vanuatu said there were no reports of damage or injuries there. More than 50 people were killed and thousands lost their homes in April 2007 when a magnitude-8.1 quake hit the western Solomon Islands, sending waves crashing into coastal villages. The Solomons comprise more than 200 islands with a population of about 552,000 people. They lie on the 'Ring of Fire' - an arc of earthquake and volcanic zones that stretches around the Pacific Rim and where about 90 percent of the world's quakes occur. The U.S. Geological Survey said Wednesday's quake struck 81 kilometers (50 miles) west of Lata at a depth of 28.7 kilometers (17.8 miles).","Solomons Islands likely to be the worst affected region in the Pacific .

The photo showed Chaudhry in a shiny striped designer hooded tracksuit type jacket, baseball cap with a Dolce & Gabbana bag and sporting a huge smile as he waved his giant wad of £10 notes at the camera. An investigation revealed the Chaudhrys - who wore expensive clothing, designer watches and holidayed in exotic locations - had their home lavishly furnished using cash from their ill-gotten gains. Officers recovered counterfeit clothing worth £250,000 and more than seven kilograms of cannabis with a street value of around £70,000. At Manchester Crown Court, Basit, who ran clothing firm Gino Trading, was jailed for three years and four months after he pleaded guilty to possessing class B drugs with intent to supply and money laundering.

'They lived lavish lifestyles off the back of it while many people have been struggling to make ends meet in difficult financial times. 'They may have briefly enjoyed the trappings of so-called success, such as expensive watches and luxury holidays, but they are all distant memories to them now as they languish in jail.

A drunken trainee teacher who crashed her car sparked a huge emergency by pretending she was in an accident involving 10 people. Hannah Sneade, 20, tried to avoid a drink driving charge by telling a 999 operator that she was in a taxi with 10 friends which had crashed on a country road. This resulted in four ambulances, three police cars and two fire engines racing to the scene. An air ambulance was put on stand-by and hospitals were warned to expect a flood of casualties. But when emergency services arrived at the remote spot all they found was bleary-eyed Sneade shivering in her pink pyjamas. Police noticed she smelled strongly of alcohol and a breath test showed she was more than twice the legal limit for driving. Sneade confessed she made up the story about the crash in the taxi to avoid being prosecuted for drink driving. Police found her damaged Peugeot car nearby and an investigation revealed no other vehicle was involved. Magistrates at Welshpool, Mid Wales, heard Sneade's wild claim caused 'significant strain' for the emergency services. Paul Inns, defending, said: 'Miss Sneade has not covered herself in glory with this matter. 'She had been out celebrating a friend's birthday and had been dropped off at home. 'For some inexplicable reason she decided to get into her vehicle and drive to see her boyfriend.' On her Twitter page Sneade describes herself as 'Welsh farmers daughter studying to be a teacher at Chester University! Work hard - play hard!' The night before her arrest she tweeted: 'Just about to let rip on the sauce yet again...

Struck off: Kelly Baker lied that a young member of her family had cancer so that she could take time off work on full pay . A 'disturbed' teacher has been banned from teaching after lying that a young member of her family was dying of cancer so she could get extra holiday. Kelly Baker, 31, claimed the child was terminally ill so she could take time off of work at her village primary school with full pay. She was given paid leave during her 'elaborate story' about the young relative's cancer ordeal and kept it going for more than a year costing her school more than £100,000. A disciplinary hearing was told she even phoned into the school saying she couldn't face teaching her classes - because the child had lost the use of his legs and fallen into a coma. Baker produced fake medical certificates on her home computer in a bid to back up her story. But her web of lies was exposed when her headmaster tried to visit the boy in hospital to deliver a get well soon card. Education chiefs suspended her from her £30,000-a-year job at Cwmcarn Primary School at Cwmcarn , near Newport, South Wales, after becoming suspicious about her story. After admitting two counts of fraud last year, Baker was given a six-month jail sentence suspended for two years . Yesterday, the General Teaching Council for Wales banned her from teaching after finding her guilty of unacceptable professional conduct. She didn't attend the hearing in Cardiff but was given a prohibition order banning her from teaching for four years. Baker cannot reapply for registration until 2017 and there is no guarantee she will be reinstated. The panel concluded: 'We have heard evidence that Miss Baker's persistent and dishonest behaviour did adversely affect the emotional wellbeing of her pupils. 'She abused the trust of the school authority and her colleagues and her conduct did have serious financial implications for the school.' At her trial at Cardiff Crown Court last July, the jury was told the school called in the police who arrested her for fraud. She had caused a loss of £100,000 to the school including her wage and the cost of supply teachers to cover her absence. Prosecutor Steve Harmes told the hearing: 'Staff and pupils at the school were distressed believing her relative had cancer. 'Baker initially took a month off citing family trauma and saying the child had been taken ill. 'Then, 18 months later, she said he had had lost the use of his legs before falling into a coma caused by a faulty ventilator starving him of oxygen. Lies: Baker was suspended from her £30,000-a-year job at Cwmcarn Primary School, pictured, near Newport, South Wales, after education chiefs became suspicious about her story . 'Two months later she said he had regained consciousness but was in a high dependency unit and unable to recognise members of his family.' Mr Harmes added: 'Headteacher Gwyn Evans travelled to the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, to take a card to Baker and was told she was not there. 'In the days following his visit Baker said the child had to be transferred to Spire Hospital in Cardiff and needed six months of rehabilitation. 'But a phone call to the hospital by Mr Evans revealed the boy was not being treated there and they had taken no transfer from the Princess of Wales. 'Mr Evans then went to an address given on Baker's job application where a relative toldhim the child was perfectly well and had never been in hospital.' The school later sacked her after discovering she also lied to them about needing time off work for her father's funeral. Baker had also faked 13 health problems of her own to take time off from her job. She claimed she was suffering from 'viral fatigue', a broken arm, fractured ribs, dislocated hip and a urinary tract infection . The school even discovered that Baker, a qualified teacher, had forged one of her references to get the job at the school. Vaughan Britton, defending, said: 'She had created a fantasy world and then couldn't separate that from reality.' But Judge William Gaskell told her: 'You are clearly a very disturbed lady. 'You alleged your relative was suffering from cancer and was in a coma and had lost the use of his legs - all wholly unture. 'It was a complete fabrication and anyone listening to the facts would regard your deceit as appalling. 'This is a strange and very unusual case and would cause anyone who hears about it to be wholly sickened.' Baker admitted two counts of fraud and was given a six month suspended sentence suspended for two years.

A 20 stone man who crushed a drinker's ribs and broke his collarbone by sitting on him during a row in a pub garden has been spared jail. Michael Eldin, 47, was told by judges that he had used his weight as a 'weapon' to pin his victim, Daniel Watson, to the ground. Hull Crown Court heard that Eldin, who walks with a stick, had an argument with Mr Watson about his son in the garden of The Plough Inn in Snaith, East Yorkshire. The father-of-two grabbed Mr Watson by the throat and pinned him against some wooden patio railings before repeatedly banging the victim's head. When Mr Watson dropped to the ground, Eldin knelt on his 12 stone victim, breaking his ribs. Eldin was given a four month suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay £200 compensation to Mr Watson which will be deducted from his benefits over the next year. Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'All the evidence was on CCTV, it was very quick. 'He bashes his head against wooden railings five times and he kneels on his ribs.

Blushing bride: Laxmi Sargara looks delighted on her second wedding day after her first marriage - performed when she was just one - was annulled . A child bride, who hit international headlines after being the first in India to annul her marriage, has wed for the second time. Laxmi Sargara, now 19, happily exchanged vows with Mahendra Sargara, 23, at a traditional Hindu ceremony . Around 150 people, including her parents and extended family and friends, were apart of the celebrations after a tumultuous year. Speaking from her new home, in Jodhpur, central India, Laxmi said she believed it was the right time to marry again. ‘My . first marriage was against my wishes, I wasn't satisfied at all and it . left me very unhappy,’ she said. ‘But I am now very happy. I have . overcome my past life and hope I have a bright future ahead of me.’ Laxmi . was only a year old when her parents, father Teja Ram Sargara, 50 and . her mother Sukdi, 45, married her to a three-year-old boy in a . traditional child marriage ritual in Khera village, Rajasthan. Oblivious of the marriage, Laxmi grew up with dreams of an exciting future until her parents told her the truth when she was 18. She . refused to join her husband and in-laws and ran away, turning to the . Sarathi Trust, a social organisation run by Rehabilitation Psychologist . Kriti Bharti, who helped her legally annul the marriage. Laxmi became a symbol of hope for child brides all over the world. She . said: ‘I have gone through a tough time. Annulling the marriage wasn't . accepted by my society initially so I went through a lot of pain but . thanks to Kriti we got through the tough time together.’ Laxmi’s family met Mahendra, a farmer, at a neighbour’s wedding last year. Her own choice: Laxmi's father Teja Ram Sargara and mother Sukdi (with her in left picture) had married her when she was just one according to Hindu traditions. She did not find out until she was 18 and then immediately ran away until her marriage was annulled. The 19-year-old has now found happiness with Mahendra Sargara who she wed last week (right) Fresh start: Laxmi, seen here with one of her guests, had feared her ex-husband's family would interrupt her second wedding . Initially, it was feared Laxmi would never marry again because of the stigma attached to her controversial annulment. Hindu . tradition does not allow child brides to marry again unless money is . exchanged under the Naata Pratha tradition. But thankfully Mahendra and . his family understood. Nata Pratha is a traditional system in . Rajasthan where a married woman can go with another man in lieu of . money paid to the husband or his family by the second man. Family life: Laxmi said her new husband had been mature enough to accept the past . Laxmi added: ‘It was going to be difficult for me to remarry but my family stood by me and chose a mature husband for me.’ She also feared her former in-laws might turn up at the wedding demanding money from her new in-laws but thankfully they stayed away. ‘My new husband has been mature enough to understand my position and he accepts my past. My life was almost ruined but now I can see a happy life and future.’ Laxmi is now settling into her new home and plans to work while also supporting her new husband. She added: ‘Child marriage affects children both mentally and physically. It’s torture in every way possible. 'I hope all parents realise that marrying their children at such a young age threatens their future. They need to stop, now.’ Kriti Bharti, 25, said: ‘Laxmi has been on a huge journey and she’s learnt to live her life again. I helped with her rehabilitation and to build her confidence again. 'She’s now living her life to her own agenda and I’m very happy for her. She looked very beautiful at her wedding, and more importantly happy.

The trial of her ex-boyfriend Joseph Davies is ongoing . A little girl was found clutching her doll and standing by the body of her mother, who had been stabbed to death, a court heard. The body of Kelly Davies, 31, was found by a family friend at her home in Farnworth, Bolton, on June 4 last year. Her ex-boyfriend Joseph Davies - no relation - is accused of stabbing her 22 times two days earlier - the day after he had been released from prison. Davies, 36, of no fixed address, denies murder. He was arrested in The Netherlands after being hit by a train in The Hague the day after Ms Davies' body was found. His injuries were so severe that he had to have his right leg amputated below the knee. Family friend Vincent Walmsley told Manchester Crown Court that he discovered the body when he went to collect Ms Davies and her young daughter to take them to a party. Mr Walmsley, 65, had acted as a carer to Ms Davies and had taken her to appointments for several years. Mr Walmsley told the court how he let himself into the flat using his key just before 1pm on Monday June 4 last year. There was no sign of a break-in, the patio doors were shut, but Ms Davies was lying 'prone' on the sofa. Mr Walmsley told the court how he put his hand on Ms Davies' chest to see if she had a pulse but there was none and her face was white. The television was on, but not tuned to a channel and her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was standing by a wall. '(The girl) was standing there clutching a little doll,' said Mr Walmsley, who rang the emergency services. Mr Walmsley told the court how he had known Ms Davies since she was a teenager but for the last few years of her life had acted like a carer, taking her to appointments three or four times a week and helping her beat her heroin addiction. The prosecution alleges that Joseph Davies stabbed his ex-girlfriend 22 times at her flat in Queen Street, Farnworth, Bolton, only a day after his release from prison . He said that in the months before her death she had been winning her battle and had been testing negative for drugs. Davies, . the father of Ms Davies' three children and her former long-term . boyfriend, was released from Haverigg prison in Cumbria on June 1 and . had made arrangements to stay temporarily with Mr Walmsley. The . pensioner told the court that on that morning he had taken Ms Davies to . the Stonehill Medical Centre, where she was seeking treatment for . depression. He received a . call from Davies just after 1.30pm saying he had dropped bags of clothes . off at Mr Walmsley's house before going to the community drugs team . centre to get a methadone prescription. Mr . Walmsley said he collected Joseph Davies from the centre and took him . to Ms Davies' flat in Queen Street, even though a judge had ruled the . former couple should not be in contact. He added the pair wanted to talk before deciding to visit friends in nearby Tonge Moor, so he gave them a lift in his van. Floral tributes at the funeral of mother-of-three Kelly Davies, who was found dead at her home on June 4 last year . After receiving text messages from Ms Davies later that evening, asking him to pick them up again, he did so, taking them back to Ms Davies' flat. Mr Walmsley said the pair had been drinking but were not in a bad mood until later on in the journey when Joseph Davies accused Ms Davies of seeing other men while he was in prison. He added that during the conversation Ms Davies referred to a previous occasion when Davies had threatened to chop her up and throw her in the river. She then swore on her children's lives that she had not been seeing anyone. 'I know now you're telling the truth because of the way you answered,' Davies is then said to have told Ms Davies. On the morning of June 2 Davies turned up at Mr Walmsley's home, saying he wanted to go shopping in Bolton to buy some clothes for Ms Davies. Mr Walmsley said Davies had a graze above one eye but did not explain how he got it. The pensioner drove Davies into town and then went with Ms Davies to collect her daughter from a party and take them back to the Farnworth flat before he returned to Bolton to collect Davies. Family friend Vincent Walmsley found Ms Davies 'prone' on the sofa at her Farnworth home with her young daughter standing in the same room holding a doll . Davies was carrying a polythene bag containing three dresses he had bought for Ms Davies and a mobile phone. When the two men got back to Ms Davies' flat she came outside to collect the bag from the van and Mr Walmsley drove off. He was never to hear from either of them again. Two days later he went back to the flat to help Ms Davies take her daughter to another party, only to find the mother-of-three dead. The court had previously heard that she had suffered multiple stab wounds to her throat, face and hands. The prosecution allege this occurred on Saturday evening, shortly before Davies took a taxi to Manchester Airport and then on to London, where he caught a Eurostar train to Lille.

Costly courting: For romance to blossom into a long-term relationship you have to have 22 meals out together, two holidays and spend at least £3,000 on gifts, according to researchers . Perhaps this is why the 2011 census found the number of single adults in the UK rose by more than 3million to 15.7million, while the number of married couples hardly moved at all in ten years. The statistics were mirrored in the research by lifestyle advice site Socked.co.uk. Managing director Mark Hall said that while singletons are now able to meet online, as well as through old fashioned means, such as in bars or through mutual friends, the disposable nature of society seems to be catching, with people investing less time – and hard cash – in love. Mr Hall said: ‘We’ve sat down and done the actual maths and if we’re correct, it’s a wonder that the human race has actually managed to survive this long.

According to the research by Socked, long-term love requires: 22 meals out as a couple; five meals out with friends in groups of four or more; two holidays; meeting the parents; two stays at the parents’ house. It also involves seven major arguments; finding approval of at least 55 per cent of partners’ friends and relatives; at least £,3000 spent on gifts.","The number of single adults in the UK rose by more than 3million .

Lewis Hamilton suffered an embarrassing first day at the office in his new job this morning - slamming his Mercedes into a barrier just 15 laps into his debut for the Formula 1 team. The British star locked his brakes at 170mph heading into turn six of the Circuito de Jerez in Spain before careering across the gravel trap during the morning testing session. It was not exactly a dream start for Hamilton, who ended his lengthy association with McLaren at the end of last year to join Mercedes in a deal believed to be worth at least £15million a year. Blow: Lewis Hamilton lost control of his Mercedes after completing just 14 laps of testing in Jerez . Hamilton was not injured in the crash, which will come as relief to his glamorous pop singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. The 28-year-old has recently bought a £20million private jet - with a personalised registration of G-LCDH, standing for Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton - to ease the pressure of their long-distance relationship. Today's accident caused the session to be . red flagged as Hamilton's brand new Mercedes W04 was transported back to . the garage.

'Obvious damage to the front wing and nose; we are checking the car over now. Lewis himself is fine.' Team-mate .

Bonus: Ann Barnes pocketed £33,000 over 21 months instead of the £19,954 she was supposed to be paid . A health worker paid almost double her salary for two years because of an NHS error was caught after she bragged about buying hot tubs and ballgowns. Telephone operator Ann Barnes, 47, had been struggling for money while working part time at a health board in Cwmbran, South Wales. But after a promotion, she began being paid two salaries for working 16.5 hours a week - and pocketed £33,000 over 21 months, instead of the £19,954 she should have been paid. She was caught out, however, when she started boasting about her spending on luxuries - including holidays and a house extension. Her boss at out-of-hours GP service Aneurin Bevan Health Board told the court she had noticed that Barnes had gone from 'rags to riches' after the double pay blunder. Line manager Ann Poyner said Barnes had thought she would lose her home in 2006 because of financial difficulties. But Mrs Poyner said Barnes's financial problems 'seemed to disappear'. She said: 'I offered her a bank holiday shift, thinking she would need the money because of her previous financial problems. 'I was a bit shocked when she said she couldn't work the shift because she was going for a meal with her husband. 'She said she was then going to a garden centre to look at buying a hot tub. 'After 2009, she started talking about buying an expensive ballgown for her daughter's graduation, a holiday, and having an extension built on her house.' Mrs Poyner eventually contacted payroll after realising something wasn't right - and Barnes was arrested. She kept the mistake hidden for two years until her boss became suspicious, Cardiff Crown Court heard . A court heard the double pay blunder began in 2009 when Barnes was given a promotion and a pay rise. Following the promotion, she started getting paid a double salary into her bank account because of an administrative error by NHS office staff. The court heard that payroll officer Saide Titcombe spotted Barnes was receiving two wages and queried it with her. Mother-of-two Barnes lied that she had two jobs for the NHS, the court was told. Prosecutor Nicholas Gedge said: 'Barnes then got away with dishonestly receiving two wages for two years.' Barnes's colleagues spotted the error after she began talking of buying a hot tub, ballgown and holiday (file pic) Barnes, of Crumlin, South Wales, admitted stealing £13,326 between April 2009 and January 2011. Robert Hawkins, defending, said she would write a cheque to the Aneurin Bevan Health Board and pay back all the money she stole. Judge Stephen Hopkins said: 'You were clearly very highly thought of at work. 'Initially, the double payment was an administrative error - but your vice was that you didn't correct it. 'The fact you will repay the outstanding sum is good but you cannot pay your way out of it. 'You were a woman of previous clean character, which you no longer are, which makes this all the more sad.'

Embarrassing: Germany's education minister Annette Schavan has been stripped of her philosophy doctorate after her university found her guilty of plagiarism . The German minister for education is under pressure to resign after being stripped of her philosophy doctorate for alleged plagiarism. Annette Schavan, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been rocked by the decision of the University of Duesseldorf after they said parts of her 1980 doctoral thesis had been copied. Incredibly, she is the second minister to be accused of plagiarism in the German government after defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was also found to have copied work for his thesis and quit in 2011. The University of Duesseldorf launched an investigation after an accusation against Mrs Schavan was posted online by an anonymous blogger. A faculty committee concluded that her work, which dealt with the formation of conscience, included a 'substantial number of unaccredited direct quotes from other texts'. In a statement declaring the doctorate invalid and withdrawing it from Ms Schavan, the faculty head Bruno Bleckmann said they had 'decided by secret ballot, by 12 votes to two, with one abstention'. Mrs Schavan has said she will take legal action against the decision, but it is an untimely distraction for Angela Merkel ahead of September's national election. 'I will not accept the decision of the University of Duesseldorf and I will file a lawsuit against it,' Mrs Schavan, 57, told reporters during a visit to Johannesburg, South Africa. She declined to make any further comment for legal reasons. Pressure: The scandal surrounding Mrs Schavan (left) is an unwelcome distraction for Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) ahead of German national elections in September . The accusations of plagiarism are especially embarrassing for Mrs Schavan because she oversees Germany's universities and had previously been scathing in her criticism of Mr Guttenberg, who resigned a month after losing his doctorate. 'An education minister who is proven to have grossly violated academic rules cannot continue in the post,' said Renate Kuenast, a leading member of the opposition Greens. 'I assume that Frau Schavan will spare herself and education a prolongation of this affair by resigning.' Mrs Merkel has not publicly commented on the Schavan case. But members of her centre-right coalition said the minister had fallen victim to a politically motivated campaign to damage the government ahead of the autumn federal election. Recurring problem: Mrs Schavan is the second government minister to be found guilty of plagiarism after former defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg who resigned in 2011 . Plagiarised: The University of Duesseldorf said Annette Schavan's work had a 'substantial number of unaccredited direct quotes from other texts' The German media has been mostly critical of Mrs Schavan. 'If the education minister has cheated in her doctoral thesis, it is like the finance minister secretly hiding away his money in Switzerland or the traffic minister driving a car while drunk,' said the Bild newspaper. 'There is no alternative (to resignation) for her.' In Tuesday's ruling, the Duesseldorf University commission said Schavan had 'systematically and intentionally presented intellectual performance that in reality she did not generate herself'. The decision left Schavan without an academic title, an important symbol of status in German politics and business, as her degree programme in philosophy finished solely with a PhD. Since the allegations first arose in May last year, Schavan has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said she wrote her dissertation with a clear conscience. Her lawyers have said the proceedings of the commission had been riddled with mistakes and were unlawful, not least because information was leaked to the public in the process.","Annette Schavan, 57, under pressure to resign after decision .

Winston Churchill's one and only effort at poetry as an adult has come to light more than 110 years after he put pen to paper. The wartime leader was a brilliant speechwriter, prolific author and winner of the Nobel Prize for literature. Yet despite being a lover of poetry, he was only known to have written verse once - and that was for a competition when he was at Harrow School. Now, a 40-line poem - describing the eve of a naval battle - penned over two pages in blue crayon by Churchill while he was in the Army, has emerged for sale at auction in London. Our Modern Watchwords - a 40-line poem describing the eve of a naval battle - was penned over two pages in blue crayon by Winston Churchill while he was in the Army. It is now set for auction . The poem is signed by Churchill (above) and was written while he served in the 4th Hussars, in about 1898 . Unsurprisingly, the poem is a rousing celebration of the British Empire and of going to war to defend her. It is said to have been influenced by Kipling and Tennyson. It is signed by Churchill and was written over two sides on the headed notepaper of his regiment, the 4th Hussars, in about 1898. The first ten lines of the work, entitled Our Modern Watchwords, read: . The shadow falls along the shore . The search lights twinkle on the sea . The silence of a mighty fleet . Portends the tumult yet to be. The tables of the evening meal . Are spread amid the great machines . And thus with pride the question runs . Among the sailors and marines . Breathes there the man who fears to die . For England, Home, & Wai-hai-wai. The poem makes reference to obscure cities under the rule of the British Empire like Wai-hai-wai - Weihai in China - Sokoto in Nigeria and Karochaw in Japan. It was most certainly written by the former Prime Minister before 1901 as there is a reference to Queen Victoria. It was acquired several years ago by Roy Davids, a retired rare manuscript dealer from Great Haseley in Oxfordshire. Mr Davids, 70, said: 'This is the only poem in Churchill's handwriting as an adult. 'There is one at Harrow School but that was one he wrote as a boy and it was for a competition. 'The archive at the Churchill College at Cambridge University has never heard of another poem and that is a pretty certain statement. Unsurprisingly, the poem is a rousing celebration of the British Empire and of going to war to defend her. Above, Winston Churchill in Bangalore in 1896 . 'I don't think it's a bad effort, it is quite competent. It is quite rousing stuff and is an imperial celebratory poem that references cities that stretch across the British Empire. 'It is interesting that nearly 50 years after the death of the most famous Englishman of the 20th century, we are still discovering new aspects of his life.' At the time of writing the poem, Churchill, who was also a talented artist, was an Army war correspondent and had served in countries such as India and Sudan. He produced it before he fought in the second Boer War a year later. Allen Packwood, the director of the Churchill Archive Centre at Churchill College, Cambridge, said: 'Of course he was a great writer and orator and he used poetry in some of his famous speeches. The wartime leader was a brilliant speechwriter, prolific author and winner of the Nobel Prize for literature . 'He was someone who was greatly influenced by poetry and was able to memorise and recite large parts of other people's poetry. 'But it is rare to find a piece of poetry by him as an adult. I am not aware of any others that exist. 'Having read it, it seems to me that it was part-influenced by Kipling and Tennyson and the sort of poems he would have read at school.' A spokesman for auctioneers Bonhams said: 'We don't of course usually think of Winston Churchill as a poet but perhaps we should not be surprised to find that he wrote verse. 'He was a man of many parts who, over the course of a long life, threw himself enthusiastically into a whole range of activities beyond his main calling as a politician and statesman. 'The work certainly provides a fascinating extra insight into the life of one of the country's greatest figures.' The poem has been given a conservative estimate of £15,000. It will be sold at auction on April 10.","Our Modern Watchwords was written on two sides of headed notepaper of his regiment, the 4th .

Her boyfriend, referred to in the inquest only as 'Shahin', then disappeared leaving Turkish police and British authorities little hope of finding out what had happened to her. Her father, Ken, said Miss Mitchell would regularly call him and her mother Patricia at their home in Berkshire to tell them of the beatings she experienced. 'She used to cry over the phone and plead with us to get her out of there but the next moment we would get a phone call saying he's apologised', said Mr Mitchell. 'I never believed any of it - she was always in fear of her life.' Picturesque: The pretty town of Fethiye in Turkey where Beverley Mitchell died . Mr and Mrs Mitchell, from Calcot, near Reading, visited their daughter months before her death but said on their trip she had seemed happier. 'If we'd have known she was unhappy that day we would have found some way to have brought her back but you can't say to an adult ""you're coming home with us.""' Mr Mitchell said his daughter had been offered a job by a friend when the IT company she was previously working for went bust and so decided to stay in Turkey. 'She said she felt safer there than she did over here, surprisingly enough,' he told the inquest in Newbury, Berkshire. 'When you take it at face value, Fethiye is a nice place.' Beverley Mitchell (pictured) was asked to come home by her parents on a number of occasions . Christopher Sandford, a British shopkeeper who befriended Miss Mitchell in Fethiye, told the hearing that although she had initially seemed happy he would often see her covered in bruises or drunk - and that she had told friends she turned to alcohol to take away the pain of the beatings. 'You would see her come in with bruises,' he told Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford. 'She was very thin and not eating properly,' he added. 'We knew of Shahin. He wasn't in our circle of friends but we knew of him and I can only describe him as one of the many Turkish rogues. 'The perception is it happens to so many British single women, from 15 to 90, they fall in love with a good looking guy and end up spending all their money on him. Shahin was of that ilk.' The inquest was told how Shahin was controlling of Miss Mitchell and her friends suspected she was being forced to spend all her money on him, leaving her without enough to eat. Another of Miss Mitchell's friends, Steve Tristram, said in a statement given to the hearing that on May 24 last year she had been raped by two men. Local Turkish newspapers reported that the men had been armed with guns. However the coroner said that he had been given no evidence this was the case. 'She appears to have been followed by two men who dragged her to the ground and raped her,' said Mr Tristram's statement. 'On leaving the police station with her Turkish boyfriend Shahin, he attacked her, blaming her for being raped and beat her again.' Mr Tristram also said Miss Mitchell had reported to Turkish police that she had been beaten. However she did not name Shahin as the perpetrator, as she was 'terrified of him.' Miss Mitchell had also reported she had been raped before in Turkey. The coroner heard Miss Mitchell fell ill in the fortnight before she died and would rarely leave the house. Another friend, named as Willy, visited and suggested Shahin take Miss Mitchell to hospital but when he returned at around 5pm he found her unconscious. He then called an ambulance and Miss Mitchell was rushed to Fethiye State Hospital but later died July 16, 2012. Mr Tristram's statement said: 'If Shahin had taken her to hospital at 9am, would the outcome have been different?' Mr Bedford said he had only been given her cause of death as 'respiratory failure', and being of 'pathological origin', and that a second post mortem examination carried out in the UK was also inconclusive. However, two toxicology reports both said she had not consumed alcohol or drugs and there were no signs she was bruised or had suffered any injury. Mr Bedford said that Shahin had given Turkish police a statement in which he described Miss Mitchell as a 'friend'. The inquest was told that Shahin had since vanished and that Turkish police were not investigating the matter further. Mr Bedford said: 'There's no evidence that the beatings, the alleged rapes or anything of that kind were a factor and the description from Steve and Willy of vomiting and sweats suggests a more disease-related problem. 'I have no clinical evidence beyond that.' Mr Bedford said he had no option but to record an open verdict and that although there was scope for this to be re-examined should more information come to light - he doubted this would be the case. Speaking after the inquest Mr Mitchell warned other young women about the perils of emigrating to Turkey. 'How many other people, young women, will move in the future, or have been to Turkey and fall into the same trap. 'My advice to any young woman is that it's not as safe a place as people think. 'She was just looking for love and never actually found it.'

David Cameron today declared he is a 'marriage man' as he defended plans for same-sex weddings in the wake of a deeply divisive Commons vote. More than half of Tory MPs - including several senior ministers - last night refused to back the Prime Minister's proposals to allow gay people to marry. With the backing of Labour and the Lib Dems MPs voted in favour of the new law by 400 to 175. At Prime Minister's Questions today, the Prime Minister defied opposition from 136 Tory MPs to hail the 'great' result which meant 'two gay people who love each other will now be able to get married'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron today hailed the 'great' result in last night's vote on gay marriage, despite failing to get a majority of his Tory MPs to back the plans . In last night's free vote, just 127 out of 303 Tory MPs voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and . Welsh Secretary David Jones voted against, while fellow Conservative . Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, and Attorney . General Dominic Grieve stayed away. In the Commons today, Tory MP Christopher Chope, who voted against gay . marriage, called for heterosexual couples to be given an equal right with . homosexuals to enter civil partnerships. But Mr Cameron rebuffed the proposal, telling Mr Chope: 'Frankly, I am a marriage man. I am a great supporter of marriage - I want to promote marriage, defend marriage, encourage marriage. 'The great thing about last night's vote is that two gay people who love each other will now be able to get married, and I think that is an important advance. 'I think we should be promoting marriage, rather than looking at any other way of weakening it.' Passed: The Commons voted in favour of same-sex weddings by 400 votes to 175, a majority of 225 . The PM had launched an eleventh hour appeal to Tory MPs to back the policy, but he failed in his bid to get a majority of his party to support the plan. Several Tories who rejected the measure . said they objected to being described as ‘rebels’, since it was a free . vote. Labour also suffered a split, with 22 of its MPs voting against. Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott said last night's vote was a victory for equality and demonstrated that while the 'arc of history' may move slowly, it 'bends towards justice'. Mr Cameron replied: 'I agree very much. I think last night's vote will be seen not just as making sure there is a proper element of equality but also helping us to build a stronger and fairer society. 'I thought many of the speeches made last night were very moving, very emotional and I would pay tribute to all those people who have actually made this case, some of them for very many years, saying they want their love to count the same way that a man and a woman's love for each other counts.

But, despite her unique place in British history, the only monument to Lady Thatcher’s achievements in her home town of Grantham is a small plaque on the wall of the property where she grew up. And that is the way it could stay, after disagreements over plans for a larger-than-life statue of the former premier. Lady Thatcher stands next to the £150,000 white marble statue of her in 2002. Shortly after, it was famously decapitated by a protester. Now restored, it has been offered to the Grantham Museum . More than two decades after her fall . from power, the Lincolnshire market town is split over whether to accept . the white marble artwork for display at Grantham Museum. The museum said yesterday that any . decision would be taken with the views of local residents in mind. The . 8ft £150,000 artwork by sculptor Neil Simmons was commissioned by the . House of Commons and was decapitated by a protester within weeks of . going on display at a gallery in the City of London in 2002. It has spent much of the period since its repair in storage at the Commons. Yesterday, the volunteer-run museum, . which already boasts a Spitting Image puppet of Mrs Thatcher and one of . her blue suits, said a decision had not yet been made about the offer of . the statue. The statue of Margaret Thatcher at the Guildhall Art Gallery . A Labour councillor in Grantham . suggested that displaying a monument to Lady Thatcher could be ‘asking . for trouble’. Charmaine Morgan said some of Lady Thatcher’s policies . remain controversial and the statue might be open to more attacks if it . was erected in her home town. ‘Placing it anywhere in a public place in . Grantham, it could be open to a similar event occurring,’ Miss Morgan . said. Lady Thatcher, who won three general . elections and was Prime Minister between 1979 and 1990, was born and . went to school in Grantham. But at the former grocery shop and post . office where Margaret Hilda Roberts grew up, there is nothing more than a . small plaque. The shop is now a holistic centre, and . her childhood bedroom is used for massage therapy. Despite calls from . successive mayors for a statue of Lady Thatcher, her legacy seems to be . so divisive that such proposals have never got beyond the planning . stage. Grantham lies within Tory-controlled South Kesteven District . Council. The Neil Simmons statue was unveiled . by the former prime minister in 2002, but attacked with a metal pole at . Guildhall Art Gallery by theatre producer Paul Kelleher two months . later. Jayne Robb, manager of Grantham . Museum, said: ‘It does need to go somewhere, but how the town responds . to the life of Margaret Thatcher has to be a town decision.’ Grantham already has a statue and . shopping centre dedicated to a famous son, Sir Isaac Newton, and many . think it is time for Lady Thatcher, now 87, to be honoured. ‘If you were walking through the town . you would never know she had anything to do it,’ said poultry manager . Duncan Attwood, 39. ‘Tourists come from all over the world because it is . where she is from.’ Teaching assistant Michelle Carter, . 33, added: ‘A lot of things she did weren’t popular with Labour voters . but she was our first woman prime minister and for that she should be . recognised. Who knows when the next one will come along?’ A bronze statue of Lady Thatcher, unveiled in 2007, stands in the Members’ Lobby at the House of Commons. At the former grocery shop and post office where Margaret Hilda Roberts grew up, there is nothing more than a small plaque to mark its connection with the future Baroness Thatcher . The former British Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street with David Cameron in 2010. A Labour councillor suggested that displaying a monument to Lady Thatcher in a prominent place could be 'asking for trouble' The grocer's daughter, who went on to be PM from 1979 until 1990, was born in Grantham and went to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School.

The ease with which traders at Royal Bank of Scotland rigged interest rates has been laid bare in a series of damning emails. As the state-backed bank was yesterday fined £390million for its part in the Libor scandal, financial regulators released some of the swaggering messages swapped by its traders. In messages littered with spelling mistakes, the RBS traders joked about manipulating rates up and down. Royal Bank of Scotland must almost £400million to US and UK regulators for its part in the Libor-rate fixing scandal . A message from one said: ‘can we lower our fixings today please?’. He was told: ‘make your mind up, haha, yes no probs’. The trader then replied: ‘I’m like a whores drawers’. Another trader boasted: ‘its (sic) amazing how much libor fixing can make you that much money’. The behaviour – described as ‘truly . outrageous’ – went on between January 2006 and November 2010, even . continuing after the bank received a £45billion taxpayer bailout during . the financial crisis. Revelations that Libor had been . repeatedly manipulated by traders stunned the banking world last year . and led to the exit of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. Now damning evidence showed how . traders at RBS in London were also part of a global conspiracy to . manipulate rates. Libor is the key interbank lending rate, used to . determine the mortgage and savings rate, and is linked to trillions of . pounds of investments around the world. Indicating how endemic the scandal . was, the Financial Services Authority said RBS effectively encouraged . rate-rigging, sitting traders next to colleagues responsible for . submitting interest rates. Chancellor George Osborne condemned the 'totally unacceptable' behaviour at RBS as Business Secretary Vince Cable called for a return to traditional values in banks . Last night Chancellor George Osborne . promised those responsible would face the ‘full force of the law’. RBS . chief executive Stephen Hester said he was ‘disgusted’, adding: ‘What is . profoundly depressing is this is an extreme example of the selfish and . self-serving culture that the whole industry has been tagged with since . the financial crisis.’ But he refused to resign or hand back a £1.5million bonus from 2010, despite taking the helm in November 2008. RBS was hit with £300million in fines . from the US Department of Justice and the Commodities Futures Trading . Commission and an £87.5million fine from the FSA. It dwarfs the . £290million fine slapped on Barclays last summer. Swiss bank UBS was hit with a £940million penalty in December. Six of the 21 workers found guilty of . wrongdoing are still working at the bank, although some are still . awaiting disciplinary action. Just six had been sacked for misconduct, . including two managers, while the remaining culprits quit before any . action could be taken. RBS also faces the prospect of criminal sanctions in the US. Evidence of the 'truly outrageous' behaviour at RBS emerged after Business Secretary called for a return to traditional values at banks in a speech yesterday.","State-backed RBS has been fined £390m for its part in Libor scandal .

Education Secretary Michael Gove hopes to end two decades of racial profiling in the adoption system with the new law . The racial bar that has stopped tens of thousands of children living in state care from finding new families through adoption is to be lifted under a new law published yesterday. In future, social workers will no longer be legally bound to take the ethnic or religious or cultural background of a child under their care into account when they decide his or her future. Instead the rules will say that finding ‘a perfect or partial ethnic match’ must not become a barrier to finding new parents for child. The reforms designed by Education Secretary Michael Gove to end two decades of racial profiling in the adoption system are contained in the Government’s Children and Families Bill. They come as ministers press social workers to speed up an adoption system that has failed to increase numbers of children in care finding new families despite more than a decade of pressure from both Tony Blair’s and David Cameron’s governments. In the 1970s, some 20,000 children were adopted each year, including many babies. But even though there are 67,000 children in the state care system, last year only 3,450 children were rescued from children’s homes or frequently-changing foster homes by adoption. Among them were just 70 babies. Official figures show that in 2011, a third of children living long-term in state care failed to learn to read by the time they were seven. Seven out of eight failed to reach the benchmark for a decent education, five A*-C passes at GCSE or equivalent including English and maths. Critics have accused social workers opposing adoption and putting up barriers to prevent children being settled with new parents. Alongside race rules that have forbidden adoption unless a child and its adoptive parents are a perfect ethnic match, adoptions have been prevented because couples are too old, because one of them smokes, or because they have unacceptable views. Poor figures: Just 3,450 children were adopted last year despite 67,000 children being in the state care system (stock image) In Rotherham, social workers recently removed children from their foster parents when they discovered the couple were UKIP supporters. And in Birmingham,  a recent report on social workers criticised them for insisting that one of an adoptive couple must give up their job before they can bring up a child. The new law will give ministers powers to strip local council social workers of their right to run adoptions and hand them to an outside agency or firm if adoptions are going too slowly and suitable couples are being rejected for spurious reasons. Children’s Minister Edward Timpson said: ‘I am determined that every young person should be able to fulfil their potential regardless of their background. For this to happen we must tackle the disadvantages faced by our most vulnerable children and families. Our measures do just that. ‘In this Bill we will overhaul adoption - breaking down barriers for adopters and provide more support to children. ‘ . The new law also includes an attempt to cut delays in the secretive and over-stretched family justice system which deals with the cases of children in care. A new rule will bring in a time limit of 26 weeks on court decisions to take children into state care. Another will reinforce the responsibility of both parents in a separated couple for their children. The legislation will also introduce the Coalition’s flexible working scheme, which will give all employees the right to ask for flexible hours and give both parents the right to share statutory parental leave after a baby is born.","Social workers will no longer have to take a child's cultural background into account when finding them a new home .

Some retailers have now limited shoppers to one toy each in an attempt to stop buyers from stock- piling the most sought-after items and re-selling them at inflated  prices online. Analysis of the Toy Retailers Association’s top 12 Christmas toys ‘dream list’ found many selling at twice or three times the recommended retail price (RRP) on eBay. And The Moshi Monsters Moshling Tree House, usually priced at £18.99, is being sold for as much as £198.98 – more than ten times the recommended amount. The plastic tree house by Vivid has monsters hidden inside the trunk. Stocks are low in the shops but there are 65 available on eBay. The LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer learning tablet should be £79.99, but John Lewis, Argos, Tesco, Toys R Us and even the LeapFrog store have sold out. However it can be found on marketplace websites at up to £225 – nearly three times the price.

Snail mail will become even slower beginning this summer due to new delivery cutbacks that the U.S. Postal Service is expected announce on Wednesday. The Postal Service, which is losing $40 million daily, will stop delivering mail on Saturdays but continue to deliver packages six days a week under a plan aimed at saving about $2 billion, the financially struggling agency says. The Saturday mail cutback would begin in August. The financially struggling U.S. Postal Service plans to stop delivering mail on Saturdays, but it will continue delivering packages six days a week . The move accentuates one of the agency's strong points – package delivery has increased by 14 percent since 2010, officials say, while the delivery of letters and other mail has declined with the increasing use of email and other Internet use. The service lost $16 billion last year due to declining deliveries. To combat its loss in revenues, the USPS has cut more than 35 percent of its workforce, closed hundreds of offices,and cut back hours at the ones that remain open. Under the new plan, mail would still be delivered to post office boxes on Saturdays. Post offices now open on Saturdays would remain open on Saturdays. Over the past several years, the Postal Service has advocated shifting to a five-day delivery schedule for mail and packages – and it repeatedly but unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to approve the move. Though an independent agency, the service gets no tax dollars for its day-to-day operations but is subject to congressional control. The move accentuates one of the agency's strong points ¿ package delivery has increased by 14 percent since 2010, while the delivery of letters and other mail has declined with the increasing use of email and other Internet use .

But the agency clearly thinks it has a majority of the American public on its side regarding the change. Material prepared for the Wednesday press conference by Patrick R.

The 45-year-old from St Albans, was travelling to work one cold February morning in 2010 when a passenger pointed out the spare seat next to her to an elderly gentleman. 'He said at the top of his voice: ""I can't sit next to THAT! There's not enough room."" I was absolutely devastated,' she says. Scroll down for video . Weight-loss wonder: Sharon Farrell was 20st 3lb as her heaviest. She has now slimmed down to 10st 1lb (r) In tears, Miss Farrell got off at the next stop - almost hyperventilating - and struggled into work on foot. But the size 30 worker was so unfit that the 15 minute walk took her an hour. 'I arrived at work hot, flushed and sweating for half an hour afterwards. I realised I had to do something,' she said. Sharon Farrell is now a svelte size 10 . Miss Farrell weighed 20st 3lb with a body mass index of 47.1 - which placed her in the morbidly obese category. But it wasn't until that moment that she could face up to the truth. 'I was in such a bad way . and was just existing, not living,' she said. Sharon had always been bigger . than her friends as a child but her eating went out of control after a family tragedy. 'When I was 19 I lost my father. I was so close him. I didn't realise then but I started eating for comfort.' She became a yo-yo . dieter, losing a few stone only to put it back on - and more. Her eating habits became even worse after her mother became seriously ill in 2004. Sharon struggled to juggle work with caring with her mother at evenings and weekends. 'I was getting out less and less and . eating all the wrong foods, like sausage rolls and pastries, crisps, . chocolate and biscuits, plus a fat-laden ready meal or takeaway for . dinner,' she said. 'If I did go out in the evening, I'd down about five or six . pints of real ale.' By 2006, Sharon was put on anti-depressants and took a career break to look after her . mother full time during her final months. She returned to work but by now was a size 30. She said: 'I was so unfit I couldn't walk . anywhere without getting out of breath but until the incident on the . bus, I didn't have the impetus to do anything about it.' In March 2010 she joined a local slimming club and within five weeks lost her first stone. She went to three exercise classes a week, kept a food diary and ate a little and often. 'Everything felt so much easier after I . had lost about 3st. My depression lifted, I felt happy for the first . time in ages and was taken off medication,' she said. After two years she had lost 9st and had slimmed down to a healthy size 12. Today she weighs 10st 1lb, having lost half her body weight, and is a healthy size 10. She said: 'I still count my calories . as it's second nature now. I also do 10 minutes of toning a day, with . exercises like squats and lunges.' Her success has earned her the title of Rosemary Conley's Over 40s Slimmer of the Year 2013. She received her award - along with . £1,000 - from Rosemary Conley at a glittering London ceremony.

Behind bars: Eddie Ray Routh has been charged with two counts of murder and is being held on $3million bail. He went to his sister's house after the murders and allegedly confessed . The sister of the Iraq War veteran accused of killing a former Navy Seal sniper and his friend at a Texas shooting range made a terrified call to 911 after her brother allegedly 'confessed' to the crimes. 'My brother just came by here ... he's now left but he told me he committed murder and I am terrified for my life because I don't know if he'll come back here,' said Laura Blevins of her sibling, Eddie Ray Routh. 'He said he killed two guys. They went out to a shooting range,' Blevins added, according to the five-minute call which was obtained by the Dallas Morning News. Blevins can be heard telling someone to 'get your shoes on, let's go' as she and her family flee the home. The dispatcher instructs them to head to the police station where they'll be safe. Blevins then had to hand the phone to her husband because she was too emotional to speak clearly. The husband tells the dispatcher what kind of car Routh was driving and how he had recently left a mental hospital after being diagnosed with PTSD. Routh had told his sister he had 'traded his soul for a new truck', it has been claimed. Routh, 25, is charged with the murders of Chris Kyle, author . of the best-selling book 'American Sniper,' and his friend Chad . Littlefield at a shooting range in Glen Rose. He is on suicide . watch in the Erath County Jail, where he's being held on $3 million . bond. Routh had been taken to a mental hospital . twice in the past five months and told authorities that he was suffering . from post-traumatic stress disorder, police records show. According to an Erath County arrest warrant  affidavit obtained by WFAA-TV after the shootings Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that he 'traded his soul . for a new truck.' Police . said that Routh was driving the truck of victim and ex-Navy SEAL Chris . Kyle at the time of arrest. Routh, a member of the Marines Corps Reserve, was first taken to a mental hospital on Sept. 2 after he threatened to kill his family and himself, according to police records in Lancaster, where Routh lives. Scroll down for video and 911 recording . Victim: Chris Kyle, a sniper with the most confirmed kills in U.S. history, was at the range with Routh and a friend because they were trying to help him with his PTSD . Authorities found Routh walking . nearby with no shirt and no shoes, and smelling of alcohol. Routh told . authorities he was a Marine veteran who was suffering from . post-traumatic stress disorder. 'Eddie stated he was hurting and that his family does not understand what he has been through,"" the report said. Routh's mother told police that her son had been drinking and became upset when his father said he was going to sell his gun. She said Routh began arguing with them and said he was going to ""blow his brains out.' Police took Routh to Green Oaks Hospital for psychiatric care. Dallas police records show Routh was . taken back to the same mental hospital in mid-January after a woman . called police and said she feared for Routh's safety. Scene: The shooting took place at Rough Creek Lodge in Glen Rose, Texas on Saturday afternoon. The group arrived at the range at around 3.15pm and the two mens' bodies were found just after 5pm . Green Oaks will not release patient . information, citing privacy laws. Most people brought by police to the . hospital are required to stay at least 48 hours. In May, Routh's mother reported a . burglary that included nine pill bottles and her son was involved, . according to a Lancaster police report. No other details were available. Authorities say Routh, Kyle and . Littlefield arrived at the sprawling Rough Creek Lodge at about 3:15 . p.m. Saturday, and a hunting guide called 911 about two hours later . after discovering the bodies. Kyle and Littlefield were shot multiple . times, and numerous guns were at the scene, according to the affidavit. Jailers used a stun gun on Routh on .

Then they put Routh in a chair that restrains his arms and legs in his . solitary confinement cell, Bryant said. Bryant said Routh has an attorney but hasn't met with him at the jail in Stephenville, about 75 miles southwest of Fort Worth. Author: While in Iraq, Kyle survived being shot twice . and he lived through six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie . company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat. He wrote about his experiences in the best-selling book American Sniper . Kyle recorded more than 150 sniper kills - the most in U.S. military history - between 1999 and 2009 . Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Routh's mother and sister were unsuccessful Monday. Sundae Hughes, an aunt of Routh's, . said she watched him grow up but hasn't seen him since his high school . graduation in 2006. Hughes was in disbelief that her nephew could be . involved in such an incident. 'He has a kind heart (and was) someone willing to jump in and help, no matter what it was,' she said. Routh joined the Marines in 2006 and . rose to the rank of corporal in 2010. His military specialty was . small-arms technician, commonly known as an armorer. He had been stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., and served in Iraq from 2007-08 and in the Haiti disaster relief mission in 2010. Caught: Police searched for Routh for hours following the shooting on Saturday afternoon but he was found after his sister called him in, as he fled to her house in Kyle's pick up truck and proceeded to confess to the killings . Criticism: Former Texas congressman Ron Paul posted a controversial message about the shooting . He is now in the individual ready . reserve. He could be called to duty, but it's uncommon unless he . volunteers, 1st Lt. Dominic Pitrone of the Marine Forces Services public . affairs office said. Travis Cox, director of FITCO Cares . -- the nonprofit that Kyle set up to give in-home fitness equipment to . physically and emotionally wounded veterans -- said he believes that .

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 07:14 EST, 8 February 2012 . Adolf Eichmann at the height of his power as the Nazi SS Lieutenant Colonel in charge of Hitler's Jewish bureau . Lifting a half-century veil of secrecy, Israel's Mossad spy agency is opening its archive this week to reveal the story behind the legendary 1960 capture of Nazi mastermind Adolf Eichmann. The 'Operation Finale' exhibit, curated by a Mossad officer who can't be fully identified, displays never before seen items, names and documents that led to Eichmann being snatched in Argentina. It also discloses new details, such as how forensic experts identified Eichmann by his ears. Eichmann was in charge of implementing Adolf Hitler's 'Final Solution', the plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe. Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II. Mossad's exploits typically become . known only when something goes wrong. This exhibit tells a success . story, offering the most comprehensive picture to date of the complex . operation that helped shape the agency's image - bringing a top Nazi . criminal to justice. 'This is the first time Mossad carried . out a huge operation overseas, and it had to invent all this ""James . Bond"" stuff in the process,' said the curator, who can be identified . only as Avner A because of agency regulations. 'This operation made Mossad,' he . said. 'It proved to itself and to the entire world that it could pull . off an operation at the end of the world with a variety of bodies, under . all kinds of identities and with various technical and technological . means.' Avner said the agency's tactics and . strategies have evolved since then. Even so, the exhibit was initially . intended to remain classified, but 'the Eichmann story is so strong that . we just couldn't keep this one to ourselves'. Among the highlights of the exhibit at . the Beit Hatfutsot museum of the Jewish people in Tel Aviv are the . original Mossad file on Eichmann, code named 'Dybbuk' - Hebrew for 'evil . spirit,' the briefcase with a concealed camera that took the first . pictures of Eichmann in Buenos Aires, the fake licence plates the agents . made for vehicles to track Eichmann, the gloves used to nab him, the . needle used to sedate him and the forged Israeli passport his captors . used to smuggle him out of Argentina. Eichmann's 1961 trial in Jerusalem . captivated the country and the world with gripping public testimony of . more than 100 Jews who survived extreme torture and deprivation in . concentration camps and brought to life the horrors of the Nazi 'final . solution.' Eichmann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and was hanged the following year, the only time Israel has carried out a death sentence. After the war ended in Germany's defeat, Eichmann escaped American captivity and fled to Argentina in 1950, assuming the name Ricardo Klement. On display: A photograph of 'Ricardo Klement', right, used by forensics experts to compare and identify Adolf Eichmann, left and top . Items in the Operation Finale exhibit reveal the story behind the Mossad spy agency's legendary operation . A forged Israeli passport used to smuggle Adolf Eichmann out of Argentina, is on show . There he kept out of sight until 1957, when his eldest son, Nick, befriended a girl named Silvia. Her father, Lothar Hermann, was a Holocaust survivor. After becoming suspicious of the young Eichmann, he dispatched a letter, displayed in the exhibit, to Fritz Bauer, a fellow Jewish Holocaust survivor, who was the German state of Hesse's chief prosecutor. Bauer informed the Israelis, who started investigating. Two years later, Mossad agent Zvi Aharoni located the family home in Garibaldi Street in Buenos Aires and returned with photographs of Ricardo Klement that matched those taken of Adolf Eichmann. Israeli forensic experts matched the details of the ears in each photo for final confirmation. The needle used to sedate Adolph Eichmann during the daring 1960 capture of the Nazi mastermind .

Adolf Eichmann, who died June 1962, is pictured in the box during his trial at the Jerusalem Supreme Court in Tel Aviv . On the evening of May 11, 1960, a seven-man team waited near the bus station where Eichmann arrived each evening from his job at a Mercedes Benz factory. After Eichmann got off the bus, agent Zvi Malkin jumped on him, making sure to put his gloved hand inside Eichmann's mouth, in case he had a cyanide pill hidden inside a tooth as some former top Nazis were known to have in case of capture, Avner said. Two agents helped shove Eichmann into the getaway car where a fourth agent, Aharoni, awaited. Adolf Eichmann, writing a letter in his Ramla prison cell in Israel April 15, 1961 . Eichmann relaxing on his bed, reading a book in his cell at the Teggard Fortress near Nazareth, just before he was taken to trial in Jerusalem . 'If you move,' Aharoni told Eichmann, 'you will be shot in the head,' according to the Mossad exhibit. Eichmann mumbled back in German: 'I accept my fate.' The exhibit also showcases the personal effects found on Eichmann's body - a comb, a pocket knife and a plastic cigarette holder. Eichmann was held in a safe house for nine days until the group flew out in an El Al Israel Airlines plane that had brought an official Israeli delegation to mark Argentina's 150th anniversary. Eichmann was drugged, dressed in an El Al uniform, seated in first class and passed off as a crew member who was ill. Eichmann has been portrayed on screen many times. Here Stanley Tucci plays the Nazi mastermind alongside Kenneth Brannagh as General Reinhard Heydrich in the BBC's 2002 film Conspiracy - The Meeting at Wannsee . The Nazis were responsible for the deaths of six million people during the Holocaust. Here children are pictured behind a barbed wire fence at the infamous concentration camp at Auschwitz in southern Poland . Auschwitz was liberated on January 27, 1945, by the Russians. There they found scenes of unspeakable horror . The operation was so secret that even diplomat Abba Eban, who later became Israel's foreign minister, had no clue he was providing cover for a plane to return to Israel with Eichmann and the Mossad team, leaving Eban and other diplomats behind. In researching the operation, Avner said he made several new discoveries. For instance, there was a Plan B, should the airlift fail, to smuggle Eichmann in a freighter ship transporting frozen meat, and even a Plan C that called for him to be dropped off at a halfway house in Europe before a final trip to Israel. Avner even found the Israeli optometrist who agreed to prepare glasses for Eichmann, after his original pair were broken during his capture. The glasses were made of plastic to prevent Eichmann from using glass to slit his wrists. 'The more I discover new details, the more I realize that I don't have the full story,' said Avner, before adding. 'We'll probably never truly know the full story.'","Spy agency Mossad opens its archive into legendary capture .

The sanctions, aimed at trying to derail the country's rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, bar North Korea from testing or using nuclear or ballistic missile technology, and from importing or exporting material for these programs. The latest sanctions resolution again demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program and cease launches. It slapped sanctions on North Korean companies and government agencies, including its space agency and several individuals.","Footage of Wednesday's launch taken from a camera fixed to the rocket .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . UPDATED: . 17:04 EST, 30 October 2011 . Former astronaut Edgar Mitchell has reluctantly given back the space camera he brought home from his 1971 Apollo 14 moon mission, rather than face a federal lawsuit over its ownership. The 81-year-old argued the data acquisition camera was a gift from NASA, and earlier this year - four decades after taking it to space - he tried to auction it through the British firm Bonhams. NASA says the camera is U.S. government property and sued Mr Mitchell to get it back after learning in March the device was up for sale. Camera battle: NASA forced Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell to hand over the camera which took this picture of him on the moon in 1971 . Legal wrangle: Mr Mitchell said the 16mm motion picture camera was a gift from NASA and had put it up for auction with a guide price of $80,000 . His for forty years: Mr Mitchell, 81, argued the camera would have been space junk otherwise . In papers filed Thursday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami stated Mr Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, will 'relinquish all claims of ownership, legal title, or dominion' of the 16mm motion picture camera. Mr Mitchell agreed to allow Bonhams' New York auction house, where the  camera was consigned for sale last June, to release the artifact to the government. Bonhams had estimated the camera's value at $60,000 to $80,000. Once returned to NASA, the space agency will pass it on to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington for display within 60 days. Both sides will pay their own legal expenses. A judge was expected to sign off on the settlement in the coming days. Mitchell’s attorney Armen R. Vartian said his client decided the settlement was the best way to resolve a conflict with NASA. 'I think both sides saw the lawsuit as something that should not continue,' he added. Mr Mitchell is one of 12 humans to have walked on the moon. He later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The . data acquisition cameras (DAC), measuring six inches, by four inches by . two inches, were taken into space to record engineering data and lunar . surface imagery. This particular camera was one of two that went to the moon's surface on the Apollo 14 mission, which Mr Mitchell piloted. It shot the final five minutes of the lunar module, named Antares, landing on the moon. Moon mission: Edgar Mitchell, pictured, was the sixth person the walk on the moon and spent nine hours working on the lunar surface . Historic: Mr Mitchell pictured working with a Hasselblad camera, not the one he took, before his mission with Alan Shepard and Stuart Roosa . During the mission, Mr Mitchell and Alan Shepard spent hours collecting nearly 100 pounds of lunar samples. They also demonstrated that astronauts could walk long distances safely, covering about two miles on one expedition. Mr Shepard's attempt at swatting a golf ball on the moon can be viewed on the internet. The mission plan called for the DACs to . be left in Antares to save weight aboard the command module, the capsule . that would return the two moonwalkers and pilot Stu Roosa to Earth. But Mr Mitchell saved the camera and . brought it back to Earth along with various other spacesuit and . spacecraft hardware the team chose to keep as mementos. The . camera remained in Mr Mitchell's possession for 40 years but when he . tried to sell it, NASA issued a legal suit demanding back the 'exclusive . property of the United States'. Public viewing: Once returned to NASA, the space agency will pass it on to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington for display within 60 days . Mr Mitchell countered by referring to a practice in the 1970s that allowed the Apollo astronauts to keep equipment that had not been intended to return from the moon, so long as the items did not exceed weight limitations and were approved by management. Mr Mitchell argued that if he had not brought it home, the camera would still be space junk, unwanted by NASA. The government has won out, though, despite never making clear what distinguished the camera from other Apollo-returned hardware. Since his retirement, Mr Mitchell has devoted much of his life to exploring the mind, physics, the possibility of space aliens and ways of linking religion with scientific fact.","Edgar Mitchell hands over 16mm motion picture camera .

A plan to make a film about the Sandy Hook massacre has been met with fury by residents and politicians. Director Jonathan Bucari is facing a huge backlash after announcing plans to film the story of a mentally ill boy who is affected by the school shooting. The French-born director said he wanted to film the TV movie, called 'Illness' in Ridgefield, Connecticut, just 20 miles from the Newtown school where gunman Adam Lanza fatally shot 20 children, six teachers and himself in December. But the project has been heavily criticised as it comes just two months after the massacre. A poster for the planned film Illness, about a 13-year-old boy with mental health problems affected by the Sandy Hook massacre, was uploaded onto fundraising website Indiegogo . The script focuses on a 13-year-old boy called Benjamin, who has a 'terrible mental illness' and 'the ever-growing fear of his parents' following the school shooting. Despite the plot Mr Bucari reportedly wrote in a posting that he was not making a movie about what happened in Newtown 'and never will do so.' However, Mr Bucari's Twitter page appears to have been taken down and a link to the Facebook page of the film, called Illness, was no longer working on Tuesday. The messages sent to Mr Bucari on Twitter included one from randirants, who wrote: 'j_bucari took his account down. No one wants him anywhere near Newtown. You aren't welcome here, or anywhere else.' Another from a user called GuerillaGirl who wrote: 'From what the Newtown residents tell me (my friends) they don't want him either. Opportunist slime.' LightTheSkySandyHook wrote: 'CT doesn't want of NEED this... Please respect us enough to stay away. Ridgefield is outraged. Families are not happy. RESPECT.' Ridgefield resident calicab said: 'Keep out of Ridgefield and give up on a movie about the Newtown tragedy. Way to soon, way out of line, and not welcome in our town.' The backlash began when Mr Bucari told local news stations he planned to visit Ridgefield, which has a population of 25,000, to scout out locations for the film, including a school. Ridgefield schools superintendent Deborah Low said the timing is 'poor'. The director, who lives in New York state, said he had chosen the town because it looks like the scene of the shooting but did not want to upset Newtown residents so soon after the killings. Local politicians have heavily criticised Mr Bucari since the announcement was made. Adam Lanza, 20, murdered 20 children and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut. The gunman also killed his mother and then himself . Ridgefield town leader First Selectman Rudy Marconi was quoted in Chron.com as saying: 'I will do everything in my power to prevent this. 'It's a bad idea. If you were to poll the residents in town, they'd be overwhelmingly against it.' Mr Marconi also said they would not grant a permit to allow the crew to film in Ridgefield. In a message on crowd funding website Indiegogo producer of the project Carina Rush asked for help in raising $3,000 to start the project. She wrote: '""Illness"" is a story about the tragic fate of Benjamin, a thirteen-year-old boy with a terrible mental illness, and the ever-growing fear of his parents after they learn about the shooting in Newtown in December 2012.' She said they needed to raise money to pay for actors, music, post-production, and to apply for film festivals, including this year's Cannes Film Festival in the official short film competition. Ms Rush wrote: 'We are doing the film because we believe in the power of cinema; because we believe in telling real, compelling stories. 'We believe that everyone can relate to this film and that we can make an impact on mental illness.' She added that 'all funds and prizes' won through festivals will be used to create a foundation to help families with chidlren with mental health issues. Mr Bucari's internet Movie Database page lists one completed directorial project, a TV pilot called The Sacrificial Lamb. The page said he moved to the US from France in 2010 and is currently working on another film called 'Max's Fantastic Adventures'.","Jonathan Bucari wants to film in Ridgefield - 20 miles from scene of shooting .

George Barker arriving at court today where jurors heard he exposed himself in front of a sleeping teenager so his team-mates could take a photograph . A footballer told a court today that he had exposed himself in front of a sleeping teenager so his team-mates could take a photograph. George Barker, 21, said he and five other footballers were 'laughing and joking' in the Brighton hotel room where the 19-year-old had joined them. Barker told the Old Bailey that his friend Anton Rodgers, 20, was the first to pull his boxer shorts down and pose for a picture. Brighton and Hove Albion players Barker, Rodgers, Lewis Dunk, 21, and former team-mate Steve Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, deny sexual assault and voyeurism. The offences are alleged to have taken place in July 2011 after the Brighton players went clubbing to celebrate a win. The woman, who is now 21, admitted telling police 'a pack of lies' after missing work the next day but said she revealed what happened after a row with her boyfriend months later. Barker, the first of the players to give evidence, claimed that the alleged victim was . ‘openly pursuing’ Brighton footballers that night and kissed different . members of the team. In a prepared statement he said he left the club early with Rodgers and they returned to their room at the Jury’s Inn Hotel and went to bed. He was woken by the sound of voices and saw the woman sitting on their double bed. He said: 'She was talking to us, having a laugh and joking, getting involved in the banter. 'She got into the bed and got in between us under the duvet. We carried on laughing and joking for about 15 minutes. 'Then she started kissing Anton, kissing his lips, snogging. She then rolled over and started kissing me on the lips. 'It was a bit of a shock to start with. She rolled back to Anton and started kissing him again, then she rolled back again and then started kissing me again. Then she fell asleep.' He added: ‘She appeared to want to have sexual intercourse. I did not want to have . sexual intercourse with her. She initiated kissing and cuddling. ‘I felt very awkward as a result of her actions towards me. I was embarrassed by her advances towards me in front of others.’ He said fellow players Ben Sampayo and Leon Redwood were also in the room. Barker said: 'I remember there was talking, suggesting photographs would be taken. 'I remember someone saying, ""Anton, you have got the biggest d***, so get it out"". 'It was to make the boys laugh, I guess.' Steve Cook, 21, left, who now plays for Bournemouth, and Anton Rodgers, right, the 19-year-old son of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, pictured today outside court . Lewis Dunk outside court today. The four footballers are alleged to have committed the offences at a hotel in Brighton in July 2012 . He said Rodgers posed for a photograph standing on the bed next to the woman with his genitals exposed. 'I was laughing at him,' added Barker. He said he also pulled his boxer shorts down and posed but, like Rodgers, did not touch her. Barker added: ‘I stood next to her and had my photo taken. I did not have any sexual gratification from doing so.’ Barker said he left the room and when he returned he saw someone had written his initials in foam on the woman’s thigh, and he posed with his thumbs up next to her. He said he saw four pictures taken before leaving the room, and the only time he saw any of the pictures was some days later when Rodgers allegedly sent him a copy of the GB picture. The court was told it was the only picture found by police on any of the players’ phones. Barker denied that the Brighton . footballers described the alleged victim as a ‘slag’ but admitted he . thought she was a ‘bit of a slapper.’ He said: ‘After kissing Ronald [Bergkamp] in the club, texting Leon . [Redwood], then kissing me and Anton, I was thinking... she liked to . kiss.’ Prosecutor Richard Barton asked what was . funny about taking a picture of the alleged victim sprawled out on the . bed, Barker replied: ‘The fact she was passed out, that was it.’ Mr Barton said: ‘You ended up masturbating over her... group shots of you masturbating over her unconscious body.’ Barker replied: ‘No.’ Mr Barton: ‘The purpose of these photos was that they were humiliating . for her. You were humiliating this slapper, as far as you thought... and . you were all in that together.’ Steve Cook, 21, admitted that two of his teammates exposed themselves . while taking photos of the ‘half asleep’ woman. But he denied they touched her with their genitals and added: ‘It was just a laugh, just a bit of boy banter.’ The Old Bailey has heard how Cook and Rodgers, the . 19 year-old son of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, Lewis Dunk, 21, and Barker, 21, met the alleged victim at a club while celebrating a . cup final win in July 2011. She said she woke up to find herself lying half naked next to Rodgers and discovered the ‘humiliating’ photos on his phone. They showed the footballers touching themselves while standing around . her and putting their genitals on her hand and face, jurors heard. Allegation: Jury's Inn, Brighton, where the assault is alleged to have taken place following a night out . During his interviews in January and February 2012, Cook told police . that he did not touch the 19 year-old and was fully clothed. But he admitted that he saw some of his teammates taking a couple of photos with their genitals ‘out’. Summarising the interview, prosecutor Richard Barton said: ‘He wasn’t . sure who was taking them. They had a laugh, she was half asleep. She was . half and half, drifting to sleep. ‘When the two people had their penises out they were just laughing and joking. He thought one of those was Anton Rodgers. ‘He believed a couple of photos were taken. No-one touched her with their penises. It was just a laugh, just a bit of boy banter. ‘The defendant did not pose for any photographs and had his clothes on all night.’ Cook also denied seeing any photos posted on the internet or hearing discussions about it around the football club. Asked whether he was one of the men masturbating over her chest, he . replied: ‘No, not a chance, no. I never got my penis out in that room . that night. I never took a photo.’ Dunk told police that he did not see any photos being taken. ‘All I saw was the shaving foam,’ he added, claiming that another . player, Leon Redwood, sprayed the letters GB in foam on the woman’s leg . while she was asleep. The trial was adjourned to tomorrow. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","George Barker, 21, said he and five other footballers were 'laughing'

A transgender teacher is suing a Catholic prep school claiming he was discriminated against and branded 'worse than gay' before his employment was terminated. Mark Krolikowski, 59, taught at St Francis Preparatory School, a 150-year-old Catholic institution in Queens, New York, for 32 years. But in August last year the school laid him off. Eight months earlier he told authorities he was transgender following a complaint by a parent. Mark Krolikowski (pictured) claims he was relieved of his responsibilities after he admitted to school officials two years ago that he was transgender . Mr Krolikowski alleges he was discriminated against and that the school's attitude toward him changed after he came out. Mr Krolikowski has filed a lawsuit saying the school and its principal, Leonard Conway, broke the law with his termination and that as a result, Krolikowski has been distressed. 'Teaching - it's my life,' Mr Krolikowski told CNN. 'I feel that has been taken away from me.' His lawyer Andrew Kimler said Mr Krolikowski's case has 'significant ramifications for the LGBT community and is a wake-up call to employers in terms of employment practices.' Conway would not comment but referred questions to his lawyer, Philip Semprevivo Jr. Mr Semprevivo said he could not discuss details of the case since it was in litigation but said Mr Krolikowski's contract was terminated legally. 'We deny all the allegations,' he said. Mr Krolikowski says he started being treated like a pariah after a parent became suspicious of his long hair and fancy nails and went to school bosses with her concerns in August last year . Former students of St Francis have launched an online petition that describes Mr Krolikowski as a beloved and well-respected teacher and urges the school to apologise. Cristina Guarino, who started the petition on Change.org, said Mr Krolikowski always had a 'feminine edge,' though it was nothing shocking. 'I really never questioned his gender identity despite his somewhat feminized looks,' she said. 'It just didn't seem to matter, and it never affected his teaching style or his opinions. He never imposed anything on us.' St Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens,. where the teacher worked for 32 years . She told CNN Mr Krolikowski's sex education class called Human Sexuality and Love was one of her favorites during her four years at St Francis. Mr Krolikowski's gender identity never was an issue in class, she said. He was the kind of teacher who told jokes and acted silly in class to make students feel more comfortable talking about sex. 'Teaching - it's my life. I feel that has been taken away from me.' Mr Krolikowski . 'I still laugh to this day when I remember it. Mr. K was someone who brightened our lives,' Miss Guarino said. Mr Krolikowski said he was overwhelmed by the show of support from his students. 'I didn't realize I touched that many people,' he said. 'It makes me feel that my teaching career was worthwhile.' Mr Krolikowski said in the lawsuit that after he came out he was asked whether he would 'appear as a woman' in the next school year and was told that he was 'worse than gay.' The school officials then allegedly told Mr Krolikowski that he could not be seen at public events. The teacher wanted to remain at the school and said he would 'tone down' his appearance by removing his earrings and French manicure. The lawsuit states that Mr Krolikowski was unlawfully discriminated against because he did not conform to the school's perception of how a male should dress and act. 'His appearance hasn't changed very much, so no one understands why this happened,' Miss Guarino said. 'It wasn't an issue for 32 years. Why is it a problem now? It seemed very sudden.' The termination, the lawsuit says, violates New York state and city law. New York state's human rights law states that an employer cannot discharge an employee because of 'an individual's age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status, or domestic violence victim status.'","Mark Krolikowski taught at St Francis Prep School in New York for 32 years .

The Liberal Democrat former energy secretary formally left Parliament today, by the archaic procedure of accepting appointment to the Chiltern Hundreds, and a date for the by-election is expected to be announced soon. There had been speculation that Mr Farage would take the opportunity to fight a second by-election in the Hampshire constituency, having scooped 952 votes there in UKIP’s first bid to win a Westminster seat in 1994. However, there were doubts over whether the seat - a Lib Dem and Conservative marginal in the last four general elections - would be an attractive venue for a high-profile campaign for UKIP, even when the party is riding high in the polls. Writing on The Daily Telegraph’s website, Mr Farage said the idea of fighting Eastleigh 'has its romance'. But he said that he did not want to be distracted from his priorities of leading the party into the English county council elections in May and heading the UKIP group of MEPs in Brussels. 'Today UKIP is no longer a small group of idealists,' said Mr Farage. 'We are becoming a serious player in British politics. As leader I am responsible for what is in the party’s best interests. 'UKIP continues to grow, and as it does, so the calibre of its candidates improves. We already have a dozen excellent people who have put their names forward to stand as the UKIP candidate in Eastleigh. 'Whoever is chosen will have my full support, and the support of everyone in the party.

Miss Clarke managed to escape out of a window and hid in bushes outside on September 22 last year. But Surfleet, of Osgodby, Lincs., found her cowering in the garden and dragged her back to the house by her hair where he punched her again. Miss Clarke fled to the bathroom where Surfleet followed with a lighter and an aerosol can, which he used as a makeshift flame-thrower to burn her face and head.

He said that he felt pressured into carrying out the crime as Rogers had allowed him to share a bed with her daughter Robin, then 14, let him use her car, and bought him marijuana and other gifts. 'Blackmail': Sandra Rogers, left, allegedly convinced Jonathan McMeekin, right, to help her attack her ex-husband and his new wife in May 2003 by threatening to reveal their affair . 'She would cook for me, clean, do my . laundry, give me lunch money, those kinds of things,' McMeekin said, the Chicago Tribune reported. 'She told me that I owed her.' In the middle of the night on May 19, 2003, the pair allegedly broke into Rick Rogers' and Angela Gloria's home in Lincolnshire, Illinois and Rogers allegedly repeatedly hit them over the head with a sledgehammer. The couple were left hospitalised and were lucky to survive, prosecutors said. 'She said if I didn't go with her, she . said she would tell Robin I was having sex with her,' McMeekin, said. 'I decided to go with her because I . didn't want Robin to know.' McMeekin pleaded guilty to  two counts of attempted murder in 2004 and has already served 10 years of a 20-year prison sentence. 'Lovers': Rogers and McMeekin, pictured after their arrests, had been having sex for six months . Sandra Rogers, who is now 56, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, attempted . murder and home invasion, and has also spent the last decade in prison . after accepting a 2004 plea deal. But that deal was dismissed last year when Judge John Phillips said she was . tricked into admitting her part in the crime, which paved the way for the trial. But she remains in jail on a $4 million bond. Her lawyers have tried to suggest it was her daughter, Robin, who took part in the attack with McMeekin, pointing out that the teenager said she wanted to kill her father. But prosecutors have dismissed these simply as teenage outbursts. McMeekin has suggested that Rogers had her own motives to carry out the attacks, as her husband had just re-gained custody of her two daughters. She also told her young lover that she worried she would be arrested as she allowed her 14-year-old daughter to share the same bed as McMeekin, even though her father was against it. Scene: On May 19, 2003, the duo broke into the house on this Lincolnshire, Illinois street and attacked Rogers' ex-husband and wife with a sledgehammer as they slept . He had initially told police he acted alone and led investigators to a river near the couple's home where his bloody clothes and a sledgehammer were found. But several months later, he claimed Rogers had organised the attack and was the one who had made the near-fatal blows with the weapon. One of the victims, Angela Gloria, also took the stand on Monday. She said she remembered going to bed before waking up in hospital days later. 'I called myself Peanuthead,' she said. 'I had . an indent on the side of my head. I had nine plates in my head at one time. I looked like Frankenstein.' Scars can still be seen on her face and her speech stumbles. She also suffers from short-term memory loss and had to learn how to walk again, she said. The trial continues.","Sandra Rogers' ex-husband had just won custody of their two daughters .

Asda has removed four own-label brands of frozen burgers from sale following the discovery of beef contaminated with horse meat at a manufacturer in Northern Ireland. The move is a precautionary measure and was made despite assurances from food watchdogs that it was not necessary. The decision followed revelations that a consignment of beef containing high levels of horse meat had been found at a cold store operated by Freeza Meats of Newry. Empty: Shelves in the frozen section of Asda in Bristol today which have been cleared of burgers . Withdrawn: Price ticket for frozen burgers on empty freezer shelves at Asda in Bristol today with handwritten message 'product withdrawn'. The manufacturer, which makes burgers for Asda and many pubs, cafes and restaurants, appears to have been the innocent victim of an attempt to shift suspect horse meat. It received a shipment of minced beef from a company in the south of Ireland in September, which was hoping to sell it. Freeza Meats put the consignment in its cold store and then decided to reject it. It was then inspected and quarantined by local council environmental health officers. Tests in the last few days have revealed that three out of 12 samples of the beef were as much as 80 per cent horse. Two weeks ago, Asda removed a much . wider range of frozen burgers from shelves after it emerged they were . made by a company in the south of Ireland that was known to have . manufactured products containing horse meat. The firm involved, Silvercrest, made contaminated burgers for Tesco, Burger King, the Co-op and Aldi among others. The . company that supplied the suspect meat to Freeza Meats has been named . as McAdam Foods Services of County Monaghan. It has not yet commented on . the discovery. Asda Smart Price burgers were some of the products withdrawn from the supermarket's shelves . Asda said: ‘Although all the science says there is no trace of horse in our burgers produced by Freeza Meats, we can’t and won’t take any chances when it comes to the authenticity of ingredients in our products. ‘As a precaution we have taken all four frozen burger products off sale produced in that factory, and have instructed Freeza Meats to segregate and hold any frozen burgers currently in production or in their supply chain destined for Asda.’ The withdrawn products are own-label 100% Beef Quarter Pounders; Beef Quarter Pounders, packs of eight beef burgers and pack of four ‘big eat’ burgers. McAdam Food products are an Irish meat export and wholesaling company that specialises in beef and pork wholesale products delivered throughout Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the export of meats into the UK, Germany, Denmark and much of Northern Europe. On the McAdams Foods website it says that the company was founded in 2005 and is run by people with extensive experience in beef and pork products.

President Obama will push for an 'urgent' resumption of peacemaking talks between Israel and Palestine when he visits the Middle East in the spring. The White House confirmed yesterday that the President will visit Israel, the West Bank and Jordan to discuss a wide range of issues in the region with Syria and Iran the most pressing. And the U.S ambassador to Israel says he will seek an 'urgent' peacemaking agenda in Israel after efforts during Obama's first term fell apart. New agenda: President Barack Obama will push for a new peacemaking deal between Israel and Palestine when he visits the Middle East in the spring . Speaking to the Israeli media today, Dan Shapiro said: 'We have a very complex agenda about . Iran, Syria and the need to get Israel and the Palestinians back to the . negotiating table, so it's important to begin as fast as possible.' Obama's trip, his first to Israel since taking office, signalled that he intends to make the volatile Middle East - where Iran remains locked in a nuclear standoff with the West and Syria is caught up in a bloody civil war - a top priority in his second term. While the White House gave no exact dates for the trip, Israel's Channel 10 television station cited unnamed sources in Washington saying Obama would start his visit to the Jewish state on March 20. The choice of Israel, a close U.S. ally, for Obama's first foreign travel since his January 21 inauguration will give the president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a chance to try to repair their notoriously fractious relationship. Negotiation: The relationship between Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu have been frosty but the President's second term gives them a chance to start afresh . Their dealings have been especially testy over the past year because of differences over how to best confront Iran's nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu is now occupied with forging a new governing coalition after center-left challengers made surprising gains in last month's elections, something that Obama's aides believe could strengthen his hand with the hawkish prime minister. But with Israel and the Palestinians deeply at odds over how to resume negotiations that broke down more than two years ago, any new U.S. peace effort would face major obstacles. Obama and Netanyahu discussed the president's coming trip in a January 28 telephone call, the White House and the Israeli prime minister's office said. 'The start of the president's second term and the formation of a new Israeli government offer the opportunity to reaffirm the deep and enduring bonds between the United States and Israel and to discuss the way forward on a broad range of issues of mutual concern, including Iran and Syria,' the White House said. Netanyahu's office said only that the leaders had discussed a visit timed for after a new Israeli coalition takes shape.","Renewed talks top of the agenda during President's second term .

Their rivalry was such that John Prescott once likened Peter Mandelson to a crab. Now it has been reignited after Lord Mandelson was appointed to a prestigious role in the former deputy prime minister’s home city of Hull. Lord Prescott has written an ‘irate’ letter to the local council after being passed over for the post of High Steward in the city where he was an MP for 40 years. New Labour wars: Lord Mandelson has beaten his great rival Lord Prescott to the role of High Steward of Hull - Prezza's home city . Instead, the Labour-controlled council . has appointed former business secretary Lord Mandelson to act as the . city’s new ambassador. He will try to attract business and investment to Hull. The post is being revived after almost 40 years. Lord Prescott, who recently failed in . his bid to become Humberside’s first elected police and crime . commissioner, responded by firing off a letter to city hall demanding to . know why he had not been consulted. One source said councillors who saw the letter were ‘rolling about on the floor laughing’ at his self-important tone. ‘It reeked of a sense of entitlement,’ the source said. ‘It was a “don’t you know who I am” letter.’ Lord Prescott had a spiky relationship . with Lord Mandelson during the New Labour years and in 1997 they . battled over who was ‘minding the shop’ while Tony Blair was on holiday. Lord Prescott was MP for Hull East from 1970 to 2010, and missed out on becoming Humberside's police and crime commissioner last year . During a Thames visit, Lord Prescott was presented with a Chinese mitten crab, which he christened Peter. Yesterday he insisted he was unfazed by the council’s decision. The roles date back to 1583 but lapsed . in the 1970s. The city recently restored them after petitioning the . Queen in a ‘loyal address’. Lord Mandelson’s grandfather, the wartime Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, once held the post. To add insult to injury a junior role of High Sheriff has gone to former Tory Cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley. The . latest snub for Lord Prescott comes after he was defeated in his bid to . become the police and crime commissioner for Humberside. Lord Prescott admitted he had contacted the council demanding to know why he had not been asked about who should become chosen to be High Steward. The political heavyweights who played a key role in New Labour's have had a long-running rivalry . Lord Prescott said: ‘I was notified . about the decision late on Monday afternoon and have contacted the . council for further information. ‘I . am surprised it wasn't discussed with me earlier but I will continue to . do what I have done for the last 43 years - to promote Hull and fight . to bring jobs and investment to the city. ‘I also have no interest in being a steward again - I did that job on the liners for ten years.’ Council . leader Steve Brady confirmed Lord Mandelson and Baroness Bottomley had . accepted the unpaid posts: ‘We looked very strongly at the family . connection with Lord Mandelson, secondly he was previously Business . Secretary and thirdly he has very strong connections throughout Europe. ‘Although . this is a civic office I am sure he will understand the problems of . Hull and work with the people who care about this city, including John . Prescott. ‘All I am concentrating on is getting as many people battling for Hull as possible with influence to make a difference.’ In 1997 Lord Prescott christened a Chinese Mitten Crab 'Peter' in a swipe at his great rival . Other council figures insisted Lord Mandelson was the right man for the job. Former Lord Mayor Colin Inglis said: ‘As a former European Commissioner and Business Secretary Lord Mandelson is precisely the sort of highly placed and well-connected individual Hull needs to press its case.’ Labour Cabinet member Phil Webster added: ‘We made a strategic choice and we never set out to upset anyone. If it has caused offence we are sorry for that.’","John Prescott writes 'irate letter' to city council after ceremonial role is given to his great rival .

Staff watched children's performances, enjoyed a buffet and listened to speeches as they toasted to the 75th anniversary of one of Russia's most notorious Gulag camps. The bizarre party to celebrate the founding of a forced labour camp and attended by local officials and former guards gave little indication to the horrors of its past. Usol'Lag camp in Solikamsk, near the Ural mountains, held both criminal and political prisoners during the Soviet years and was set up during the early Stalinist purges aimed to clean the communist union of those with undesirable political opinions. Partytime: Current and past members of staff at the Usollag gulag camps celebrate the 75th anniversary of the opening of the brutal camp with dancing, toasts and balloons . Contrast: Prisoners at a Russian gulag in the Dnieper region pictured in the late 1920s doing hard labour in the great quarries . Usol'Lag held thousands of political prisoners at any one time and had the higest death rate of any camp under the gulag. The Gulag was the organisation which ran the forced labour camps during the soviet years and is an acronym for Chief Administration of Corrective Labour Camps and Colonies. Gulag has also become the noun used to describe the forced labour camps of Soviet Russia. It was mainly in function from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, 53 separate camps and 423 labour colonies in use in March 1940. Their camps were spread across Russia and would hold both criminal and political prisoners whose crimes could be anything from stealing a loaf of bread to being suspected of spreading anti-Stalin propaganda. It is estimated that over 25 million people passed through the Gulag system, either through imprisonment in work camps, deportations or ‘labour colonies’. Due to the closed system and the common practice to release prisoners as they were about to die, the number of deaths caused by the Gulag has been estimated to 1.6 million, but could be as much as 10 million. Proudly announcing the anniversary of the camp, the Solikamsky regional department of Russia's prison service said the Stalinist police ‘instilled traditions in the camp that still hold value . today.' In a statement released to Russian press yesterday the 'corrective colony' said these proud traditions include 'allegiance to the motherland, mutual assistance and respect for war veterans.' ‘So hard were the times in which the . Usol'Lag camp was founded, so heavy were the burdens it overcame!’ wrote Sergei . Yerofeyev, deputy chairman of the camp's museum. Usol'Lag was founded in 1938, and functioned as a timber processing plant. It held 10,000 to . 30,000 prisoners at any given time, a number which included criminals as well as those convicted of . ‘counter-revolutionary activity’ and other political crimes. More than . 16 per cent of prisoners died of malnutrition and overwork, one of . the highest rates in the Gulag. Following the 1953 death of Joseph Stalin, Usol'Lag transferred its remaining . political prisoners in 1955 and was closed in 1960. Horror: Millions of Gulag prisoners died due to the appalling conditions in the working camps, such as wooden planks as beds with only a blanket to protect them against the Siberian climate .","Staff of past and present at notorious Gulag camp celebrated anniversary .

Thugs: Margiris Jogela and an accomplice stole the intoxicated victim's wallet and mobile phone . A mugger caught after police followed his footprints in the snow struck just two days after arriving from Lithuania to start a new life. Margiris Jogela, 22, sneaked up on a student as he tried to unlock his bike at 4am after a drinking session. The victim was clouted on the head and punched, ending up on the ground. With an accomplice, Jogela then stole his wallet, mobile phone and cash before running off. But they were spotted by a CCTV operator who alerted police and two officers were able to follow their trail. Jogela’s shoes matched the snow prints and he was arrested. Yesterday he was jailed for 32 months after admitting the robbery in Norwich last month. However, the second man escaped, the city’s crown court heard. Judge Peter Jacobs, who was shown footage of the attack on the University of East Anglia student, said it was a ‘serious and frightening’ offence which the men had obviously planned. He told Jogela: ‘You were caught almost red-handed because it was possible to follow the footprints.’ The judge added that committing the crime so soon after coming to Britain showed his presence was ‘totally undesirable’. But, he said, there was ‘nothing he could do about that’. 'It's a serious matter - you've used force of sufficient nature to put him to the floor. 'There was obviously some pre-planning.' He added: 'You targeted a vulnerable victim, you were involved with one other person and the offence was committed at night.' Big mistake: Jogela, 22, was captured on CCTV and officers then traced his footprints in the snow . On the trail: One set of footprints matched the Lithuanian's shoes. His accomplice was never caught . Jailing him for 32 months, a judge said Jogela's presence in the UK was 'totally undesirable' Chris Youell, prosecuting, showed the judge CCTV footage of the vicious attack. Mr Youell said: 'It did prove useful for police in the end as they were able to follow some footprints.' He said that after sneaking up behind their target and 'clouting him towards the back of the head', Jogela and his friend rifled through the youth's pockets and took his UEA student card. The drama was followed by the city's CCTV operator before two police officers trailed 'fresh footprints in the fresh snow' and caught Jogela.

Target: The University of East Anglia student was said to have been drunk when he was attacked in the city . Mr Youell said his shoes matched the prints and he was arrested.

The Edge Of Glory singer is being sued by her O'Neill, who claims Gaga owes her $380,000 in overtime payments because she was forced to spend 24 hours a day with her, but the superstar insists the ex-staff member doesn't 'deserve' the money as she will just go 'and buy another tube top'. According to The Sun newspaper, she testified: 'Now her parents will keep paying for her and keep her until my cheque comes through, which she doesn't deserve and I'm not giving to her. She doesn't deserve the money:  Lady Gaga has said personal assistant Jennifer O'Neill (pictured) doesn't deserve any payment as she will 'just spend it on a tube top' 'She doesn't deserve a dollar more.

I'm not going to give it to [Jennifer] so she can go and buy a new tube top.' Jennifer insists Gaga's diva demands during her 'Monster Ball' world tour in 2010 left her exhausted. According to court documents, she claims . she had zero privacy and was forced to share the same bed as the . 26-year-old star, who would wake her up in the middle of the night to . change DVDs because she didn't want to walk across the hotel room. She doesn't deserve it! Lady Gaga has said her money should go to another member of staff . In her testimony, Gaga branded Jennifer a 'f**king hood rat' and slammed her demands for overtime payments. She ranted: 'She thinks she's just like the queen of the universe. And, you know what, she didn't want to be a slave to one, because in my work and what I do, I'm the queen of the universe every day.' 'I was by her side virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” O’Neill said in her deposition. 'That includes sleeping in the same bed with her. Because she did not sleep alone.' When asked if it was requirement for O'Neill to share the same sleeping quarters with Gaga, she responded: 'I felt it was.' Demanding: O'Neill says that Gaga made outlandish demands during her time as PA to the star . O'Neill said that she was the only member of Gaga's entourage that didn't have her own hotel room. 'Unlike anybody else on that tour, I did not have my own hotel room. I was not asked if I wanted my own hotel room,' she said. 'I had no privacy, no chance to talk to any family, no chance to talk to any friends, no chance to have sex if I wanted to have sex. There was no chance to do anything.' In the deposition documents, obtained by the New York Post, O'Neill does not make any suggestion that she and the singer had any kind of sexual relationship. But she claims that Gaga was incredibly demanding, not giving her anytime to do anything for herself. 'And she was quite irate that she couldn’t reach me on my phone a couple of times, and was quite angry and asked me why she was paying for this hotel room if I was unreachable,' she said in the deposition. O'Neill also describes one time that Gaga made several demands whist O'Neill was trying to get her hair cut. 'She might have said I need some tea, I need — can you get my computer for me, can you get my phone, my battery is dead, I need a tampon, the toilet doesn’t flush,' O’Neill said. 'Another thing she would do in the middle of the night, would be wake me up to have me change the DVD in the DVD player because she didn’t want to watch that DVD any more and she couldn’t get up to walk across the room to change the DVD herself.' Gaga tweeted somewhat of a response to the new emerging details on her Twitter account on Saturday, claiming that O'Neill had, as well as being her personal assistant, been one of her good friends. 'Everyone's headlines need an updating. ""former assistant"" is actually ""my best friend from NY since I was 19."" Painful stuff,' she wrote. O'Neill launched her legal action against the Poker Face singer, claiming she was overworked and underpaid, at the end of last year. O’Neill, from Long Island, was employed by the star for 13 months, accompanying her on her Monster Ball world tour in 2011. She alleges that she she put in 7,168 hours of unpaid overtime and is now owed more than $380,000, according to the report in the New York Post. The 41-year-old claims she had to cater to the singer's at times unreasonable demands around the clock. She insists she had to ensure 'the . promptness of a towel following a shower and serving as a personal alarm . clock to keep [Gaga] on schedule.' Legal action: Gaga's former personal assistant launched . her legal action against the Poker Face singer, claiming she was . overworked and underpaid, at the end of last year . She was not given breaks for meals 'or, at times, even sleep,' and needed to be available at the star's 'earliest waking hour' or for 'spontaneous, random matters in the middle of the night,' according to the court papers. O’Neill, who was paid $75,000-a-year, also had to ensue 'the availability of chosen outfits'. Gaga is, of course, famous for her eccentric wardrobe and once wore a meat dress to MTV Video Music Awards. She filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court in December against the superstar’s Mermaid Touring company for unpaid overtime. Gaga dismissed Jennifer's lawsuit in in a video-taped deposition from August last year in New York, saying: '[Jennifer is a] f***ing hood rat who is suing me for money that she didn't earn. 'She thinks she's just like the queen of the universe. And, you know what, she didn't want to be a slave to one, because in my work and what I do, I'm the queen of the universe every day. 'She knew there was no overtime, and I never paid her overtime the first time I hired her, so why would she be paid overtime the second time? This whole case is b******* and you know it.' O'Neill is not the first personal assistant to complain about working for the star, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta. Former employee Angela Ciemny also claimed she was required to sleep with Gaga most nights because she refused to be alone, according to the book Poker Face: The Rise and Rise of Lady Gaga.

Heather Graham's luxury apartment was set on fire by candles in the bathroom . The Broadway building where a blaze in Heather Graham's penthouse took the FDNY 45 minutes to put out . 'It was candles that maybe caught some clothes that were left near the tub,' FDNY Chief John Bley told the Post. Graham rushed back to the 12th-floor property after firefighters had put out the blaze. Representatives for Graham have so far declined to comment. While Graham lives in the penthouse of the Broadway block, she isn't the only famous face to reside in the building.

Actress Heather Graham rushed back to her apartment as soon as the fire was extinguished . Braff acquired the property from Broadway legend Tom O’Horgan, director of 1970s musicals Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar. Graham made her major breakthrough with her role as a young porn star named Brandi in the award-winning 1997 picture Boogie Nights. Since then she has starred in movies such as Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and The Hangover.

Away from the pressures of high office, a man is surely entitled to loosen his collar, ditch the tie and relax a little. Tony Blair, however, went a step too far, adding one of those 1970s-style gold neck chains for good measure. Coupled with his perma-tan and gleaming white teeth, the effect was more used car salesman than elder statesman as Mr Blair, 59, joined a party hosted by tycoon Sir David Tang. Medallion man: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair looked tanned and relaxed alongside wife Cherie at Sir David and Lady Lucy Tang's Chinese New Year Party . Relaxed: Mr Blair had a glass of white wine close to hand as the rich and famous partied at the annual bash . He was, to be fair, strictly off-duty and no doubt free to follow whatever fiftysomething fashion he fancied – even if it did involve a medallion and a glimpse of chest. The former Prime Minister and wife Cherie, 58, joined a host of celebrities at Sir David’s Chinese New Year party at the China Tang restaurant at the Dorchester Hotel in London. With a glass of white wine in hand, Mr Blair, seated next to artist Tracey Emin, laughed and applauded. Other guests included the Duchess of York, who left arm in arm with supermodel Kate Moss. Her daughters, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, greeted the Blairs at the door of the restaurant.

Tom Jones, whose tan rivalled the former Premier’s, Stephen Fry, and Jemima Khan – seen linking arms with Elisabeth Murdoch –  were also at the party. Many of the guests went back to Sir David’s Chelsea home, continuing the celebrations until 6am yesterday. Since leaving Downing Street in 2007, Mr Blair is thought to have earned up to £80million through a series of speaking engagements, property investments and advisory positions with banks and foreign governments. However, in an interview last year he denied being motivated by wealth, saying: ‘This notion that I want to be a billionaire with a yacht — I don’t. I am never going to be part of the super-rich.

And the men of Britain, it seems, have loved them all. Football star David Beckham has the hairstyle that most men are dying to emulate, a new study has revealed. David Beckham has the hairstyle that most British men want - one in ten to be precise . As many as one in ten men attempt . to keep up with the former England captain's crop, whether it's shaved, pony-tailed, plaited, corn-rowed or mo-hawked. The father-of-four, 37, beat Take That frontman Gary Barlow - who came second - and Twilight star Robert Pattinson - who nabbed third place - to the top spot of a survey carried out by hair brand Fudge. The study also revealed that cycling Olympic champion Bradley . Wiggins has inspired men to grow sideburns with 3.6 per cent of the . population copying the Sports Personality of the Year. Heartthrob Harry Styles missed out on a . place in the top five. The One Direction star finished sixth with only . 2.5 per cent of the vote compared with Beckham's 10 per cent, Barlow's eight per cent and Pattinson's four per cent. While scissor happy Becks has come up top he's still very much unlike the usual British man, who will only change his hairstyle 'four times in his lifetime' The results also revealed that - unlike Beckham - the average British man will only change his hairstyle four times in his lifetime. Regionally, while only half of men admit they check their hair in a mirror during a night out, Essex men are the most likely to examine their locks every single time they pass a mirror. More than a third of men from Newcastle, Sheffield and Manchester visit salons at least once a month - while only one in ten Bristol and Brighton-based chaps go for even a monthly trim. The average British male spends 24 minutes perfecting their hair before a big night out, with Glaswegians topping the list at half an hour.

Many men are happy to get guidance from their partners as one in ten admitted their other half picked their current hairstyle. And a quarter of of the 2,000 males questioned revealed they secretly use their partner's hair styling products. More than one in three Essex men check it every time they see a mirror . British men are curious about creating new styles as 10 per cent admitted to using their partner's hair dryer or straighteners to perfect their look. Half of British men revealed that having good hair makes them feel more confident, while a further third said it makes them feel more attractive. The biggest ageing concern for men is going bald, as one third are worried about losing their hair, rather than getting a beer belly and getting wrinkles. John Vial, Creative Director for Fudge, said: 'From Kevin Keegan's perm to George Best's sideburns, footballers have always been powerful when it comes to influencing the hair styles of the nation's men. 'It's no surprise that David Beckham is the modern man's hairstyle icon, his versatile styles are ultimately achievable by the man on the street. 'I'm not surprised that Bradley's mod cut has out-styled the likes of Harry Styles and Brad Pitt. 'The man of the moment's influence on the hair of the nation confirms that when a sportsman endorses something, it automatically makes it more masculine and ultimately, desirable.'","Beckham's ever-changing style won him most fans .

Revealing his secrets to a happy and long-lasting relationship, Mr Betar told ABC: 'Get along. Compromise. Live within your means and be content,' before adding, 'and let your wife be the boss.' Truly, madly, deeply: Ann and John Betar, from Fairfield, Connecticut, aged 97 and 101 respectively, will be recognized as the longest-married couple in the U.S. after they celebrated their 80th anniversary in November . The Worldwide Marriage Encounter, a faith-based marriage enrichment program, will recognize the Betar's for the longest U.S. marriage on Saturday at their granddaughter’s house in Fairfield. The couple are just six years shy of The Guinness World Record for the longest marriage, which belongs to Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher, of North Carolina, who have been married for 86 years. Mrs Betar, who married her husband the year Franklin D. Roosevelt was president and the country’s unemployment rate was 24.1per cent, explained that for a relationship to survive, it is important to let go of anger and resentment. 'You know what your commitments are . and you try to live by them and understand one another,' she said. 'If you don't . hold a grudge, you can face anything.' They said the hardest thing that they have faced over the years, was losing two of their children. Mrs Betar explained: 'There . are so many things in a lifetime that can make you very, very happy and . very, very sad, but if you can do it together then it's happiness.' 'Let your wife be the boss... If you don't . hold a grudge, you can face anything' The couple met growing up in the same Syrian community in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Mr Betar immigrated to the U.S. as a young . child in 1921, along with his brother and father. After attending grammar school he began working as a fruit peddler and soon after he met Mrs Betar, then Miss Shawah, in the neighborhood. Recalling the sequence of events, he said: 'I fell for her right away. 'I used to have a Ford Roaster and I used to pick her and her . friends and drive them to high school.' Always and forever: Mrs Betar, then 17, eloped with the 20-year-old Mr Betar on November 15, 1932, marrying in the small town of Harrison in New York . Despite his attraction, Mrs Betar, then aged 17, was arranged to be married to another man, 20 years her senior, who her parents had selected. However after getting to know Mr Betar, . she decided to break with tradition and elope with him, marrying in the . small town of Harrison in New York. 'At 17, you wonder if you're making . the right choice,' she said. 'We had good . times together and we knew each other very well. And it's turned out to . be 80 years... We've been very . fortunate.' 'It is just unconditional love and understanding' After leaving their families they set up home together and Mr Betar continued selling fruit, until in 1938, he opened up his own grocery . store, Betar's Market, in the south end of Bridgeport. Meanwhile Mrs Betar stayed at home and raised their family. Five children produced 14 grandchildren and 16 great children. Her husband said: 'She was a great mother. She raised five children and she was a wonderful caretaker.' Today they still live independently on the beach in Fairfield. Mrs Betar enjoys painting and both are keen chefs, cooking up dishes from scratch. Their daughter Renee Betar said. 'They have this wonderful ability to . accept life as it comes. Married bliss: To the later generations of children and grandchildren, the Betars serve as role models for how to live and love in life . Happy family: Mr and Mrs Betar with with daughter Judy Metro, (left), and granddaughter Heather Mitchell .

On Sunday, Ann and John Betar marked . their oak wedding anniversary surrounded by . family and friends at the St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church in . Bridgeport. One of their daughters, who ordered a . cake for the occasion, told how the baker called back, to confirm that it should read - 'Happy 80th Anniversary' instead of 'Happy . 80th Birthday'. 'We are very fortunate. It can be repeated and repeated,' Ann, 97, echoed. 'It is unconditional love and understanding. We have had that. We consider it a blessing.' To the later generations of children and grandchildren, the Betars serve as role models for how to live and love in life. 'I'm always blown away by their incredible optimism, deep sense of compassion and modesty,' said granddaughter Heather Mitchell. 'They are true beacons -- inspirational people who emit such joy without even knowing it.'","Ann Betar, 97, was arranged to be married to another man 20 years her senior in 1932, but she eloped with her husband, John, now aged 101 .

A baby girl who had her nose and lip bitten off by her crazed father when she would not stop crying has died. Five-month-old Radha's condition deteriorated rapidly five days after she had had reconstructive surgery on her mauled face at the Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital in Jaipur, India. She was being breastfed by her mother when milk entered her lungs. Medics put her on a ventilator but were unable to save her according to NDTV.com. The child's father Bhadar Singh, a farm labourer from Siyana village of the Bikaner district in Rajasthan, will be charged with murder. Singh, 36, launched the attack on Radha on January 26 when he returned home drunk to find his wife Santosh and his sister Saroj were applying mehendi (henna) to their hands. He asked his wife to do some work. But she refused saying that she needed to wait for the patterns to set. Singh flew into a rage and began to abuse and beat his wife. His older daughter Bhanwar Kanwar, three, started crying and he turned his fury on her, allegedly biting her on her back, hands and other body parts before throwing her to the ground. The noise woke up baby Radha, who was sleeping in a neighbouring room, and when she too began to cry, her father attacked her. Both girls were initially taken to the  Prince Bijay Singh Memorial (PBSM) Hospital in Bikaner for treatment. Doctors said that Radha would need to undergo extensive plastic surgery so she would be able to speak and eat normally. She was moved to Jaipur for specialist treatment where she died yesterday.

Locked up: Polish man Michael Minorczyk, who moved to Britain to find work, has become one of the first men in the UK to be jailed for squatting . A Polish man who moved to Britain to find work has been jailed under tough new anti-squatting laws for refusing to move out of an empty house where he had been sleeping. Former soldier Michael Minorczyk, 27, was arrested by police after defying requests to move out of the empty property in Blackburn. The Polish immigrant, who exploited EU border control policies to settle in the UK in 2005 only to end up homeless and an alcoholic, was prosecuted following the scrapping of squatters rights in September last year. At Blackburn Magistrates' Court in Lancashire, Minorczyk pleaded guilty to a new squatting offence and was jailed for 15 weeks. The court heard Minorczyk was arrested on January 31 after police acting on a tip off found him inside the boarded up property in New Wellington Street, Blackburn, which is empty due to renovation. The officers got into the house through a broken door and could see Minorczyk was sleeping on a makeshift bed in a downstairs room. They woke him up and told him he was squatting and had to leave and was told not to return. But 20 minutes later police returned to check on the house and found him back inside the property lying in a drunken stupor sleeping in the same makeshift bed. He was arrested when he refused to leave. In mitigation Ian Huggan, defending, said Minorczyk had come to the UK from Poland in 2005. He got a job and everything was fine until the breakdown of his relationship. He returned to Poland 'to straighten his head' but when he came back to Blackburn found that his former partner had started a new relationship. Prosecuted: Michael Minorczyk defied police requests to move out of an empty house where he had been bedding down at night . 'He had hoped to reconcile the relationship and was unable to cope with the situation he was faced with,' said Mr Huggan. 'He . started to drink and unfortunately the drink has taken over his life. He hasn't caused any difficulties other than being in a property he . shouldn't have been in.' Michael Minorczyk has been jailed following a successful prosecution under new squatting laws. Previously, . police could not evict squatters as soon as they moved into somebody's property. So a homeowner's main option to get them out was through a civil court . order - which could be time consuming and costs many tens of thousands . of pounds. These rules were changed and new legislation introduced in September last year. The new offence protects homeowners . or legitimate tenants who have been excluded from their homes. It will . also protect those who own residential buildings that they don't live . in, such as landlords, local authorities or second home owners. But . homeless charity Crisis said the new law would criminalise vulnerable . people, leaving them in prison or facing a fine they cannot pay. Last . August Minorczyk gave an interview to a local newspaper investigating . street drinking in the town - with many of the culprits being men and . women, from Eastern Europe. He . said: 'I came to England with my girlfriend in 2005 but shortly after . we broke up. I started work but with the spiralling economy, I ended up . losing my job and finding myself sleeping on my friend's sofa and . drinking hard, which he didn't like. 'I returned home to Poland for a short time before eventually returning to Blackburn where I found myself living on the streets. 'I now sleep in the abandoned cars in King Street. I am an alcoholic and I need alcohol to survive. I have recently started suffering severe fits and if I don't drink they get worse. I am scared I am going to die. 'I often drink up to six litres of Frosty Jacks cider in a day. I am going into rehab. I don't want to be like this anymore. 'I get in trouble with the police for stealing so I can pay for drink. I have been doing this for seven years and that is too long.'

Left to babysit: Thomas Durkin is standing trial after baby John-Jay Connor died from swelling on the brain and extensive internal bleeding . A man left to babysit his new girlfriend’s nine-month-old baby allegedly shook the boy to death. Thomas Durkin, 24, is standing trial for manslaughter after baby John-Jay Connor, known as JJ, died because of injuries caused by ‘deliberate and violent shaking,’ Plymouth Crown Court heard today. JJ’s mother Andrea Glover, 26, waved goodbye to her ‘giggling’ baby as she left him with Durkin for a few hours on June 14 last year. The woman from Exeter, Devon returned home to discover that JJ had been rushed to hospital suffering from a swollen brain and extensive internal bleeding. He later died of his injuries and experts who examined him say they could not have been the result of an accident. Durkin, of Plymouth, Devon, claims he picked the baby up and put him on his chest and when he fell asleep, JJ fell to the floor. He denied harming the baby and insisted what happened was a ‘complete accident’. Prosecutor Martin Meeke told the court: ‘This defendant killed a baby who was just nine-months-old. ‘We say he did that by deliberately shaking that child violently, or it may have been a violent shake and throwing down onto a soft surface such as a sofa or a mattress. ‘As a result of this conduct the child died. It was not an accidental fall or gentle or more rigorous shaking that killed JJ but deliberate and violent shaking in which it must have been obvious that shaking would cause some injury, even if he would not have supposed that it would cause death.’ The court was told Durkin moved in with JJ and his mother at the end of March 2011 after she split with the child’s father, John Joseph Connor, 27. Miss Glover left JJ at home when she went out in her car at 11:45am with her other son, Keaton, 3. At 1:05pm Durkin rang 999 to report that JJ had somehow ‘fallen off his chest’ while he slept in a chair and was ‘barely responsive’. Appearing for the prosecution, Miss Glover told the court: ‘I had got up and fed both of the kids and Tom was having a lay in. ‘At about 11am I woke Tom up and asked him if he would help me to take some stuff out of the car. ‘He said to me don’t worry about doing that and that he would look after JJ and I should go with Keaton. ‘Just before I left JJ he was giggling . and kicking his feet and Tom had taken him out of his bouncer and he was . waving at me and Keaton from the window.’ A 'complete accident': In Plymouth Crown Court (pictured), Durkin claimed he picked the baby up and put him on his chest and when he fell asleep, the boy, known as JJ, fell to the floor . The court heard that when Miss Glover returned, she was told by a neighbour JJ had been taken to hospital. Mr Meeke said: ‘He says that JJ was in the rocker and apparently smiled at him, so he took the child out of the rocker and put him on his chest. ‘He told police and doctors that they both fell asleep and he woke up suddenly to find that JJ was on the floor, his eyes were half open and he was making a gargling noise but not moving. ‘He then said JJ was vomiting and he picked him up, he pinched his fingers and lightly slapped his face to get a reaction, then he shook him gently. ‘After this did not work he splashed him with bath water before calling 999.’ The jury was played a harrowing recording of the 999 call made by Durkin on the day JJ died. They heard Durkin trying to perform CPR with the advice of the operator, before remarking: ‘He’s got bubbles coming out of his mouth. ‘It is coming out of his nose too, he is looking straight at me - he is looking as if he’s not even alive.’ During the 20 minute call, he was heard saying ‘oh my God,’ and pleading with the baby, saying ‘come on, come on boy, come on boy,’ and ‘come on JJ’. He also told the operator JJ simply ‘fell off of him while he was asleep’. Durkin then panicked, saying: ‘He’s going cold now, seriously, what should I do with him now? ‘He’s gone floppy and he’s cold, seriously, I think he might die, I think he’s going to die.’ Joanna Brown, the first paramedic on the scene, told the court how Durkin showed her how he shook little JJ. Emergency call: Paramedics rushed to the scene after Durkin called 999 and JJ was airlifted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital (pictured) where he was later pronounced dead . She said: ‘The one thing I remember is the fact that he said he had shaken the baby to try and wake him up. ‘I remember him saying he may have been asleep with the baby and his arm fell away and the baby fell down. ‘We were in the car and he put both hands in front of him and said he shook the baby to try and wake him up.’ Referring to her statement she said: ‘I’ve described the action as not vigorous but enough to make the baby’s head go back and forward.’ After paramedics raced to the scene, JJ was airlifted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where he was later pronounced dead. The court heard how pathologists found no evidence that JJ died of natural causes as he was found to have haemorrhaged retinas and brain damage. Police arrested Durkin and took him in for questioning but he stood by his account of what happened. Durkin denies manslaughter. The trial continues.

'Driven by revenge': Vicky Pryce ex-wife of Chris Huhne pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court yesterday . It was the day when the pure fury felt by Vicky Pryce over her husband’s infidelity was laid bare to the world. A jury heard how she hatched a plot to ‘destroy’ Chris Huhne after discovering he had left her for another woman. Pryce, 60, decided to ‘bring Chris down’ and ‘nail him’ as an act of vengeance after the Lib Dem Cabinet Minister walked out on her after 26 years of marriage for Carina Trimingham, the court was told. Driven by a thirst for ‘revenge’, she decided to leak the sensational story that he forced her to take his speeding points to escape a driving ban. In one email she wrote: ‘I really want to nail him. More than ever actually, and I would love to do it soon.’ Southwark Crown Court heard how Pryce hatched a plot with a journalist from the Sunday Times to ‘set up’ Huhne in a series of taped phone calls which were yesterday played to the jury. But the wary politician had refused to admit the offence in a series of heated exchanges which only served to illustrate the bitterness of the couple’s split. In one call, Huhne accuses his former wife of telling the papers that he has split up with the woman he left her for, his bisexual former press adviser Miss Trimingham. Pryce responds: ‘I’m very pleased for you that you are still with that man of yours.’ In another call she complains her home is under siege from journalists saying: ‘I can’t even get home, whether it’s to do with your ****ing man or whether it’s to do with your ****ing points.’ In separate heated exchange Pryce calls Huhne a ‘moron’ for suggesting she might be colluding with the press.

Yesterday Pryce returned to the same courtroom accused of dishonestly accepting the speeding points in 2003. She admits her involvement but denies the offence on the grounds of ‘marital coercion’, meaning Huhne bullied her into helping him. 'Driven by revenge': A smiling Vicky Pryce arrives at court yesterday . But prosecutors branded her a ‘strong-minded and manipulative woman’ who deliberately passed the story to a Sunday newspaper. Anger: Vicky Pryce called her husband a 'moron' after he accused her of colluding with the press . Opening . the case at Southwark Crown Court, Andrew Edis QC, said Pryce was fully . aware the damaging allegations would torpedo Huhne’s political career. He . claimed that far from being a ‘bullied woman’ she took the ‘line of . least resistance’ and ‘played ball’ with her then husband over the . penalty in 2003. But by 2010, within months of him leaving her for his PR aide Carina Trimingham, 46, Pryce decided to use her knowledge of what they had done as her revenge. Mr Edis said there was ‘no doubt’ the mother-of-five was left ‘distressed’ by the ‘terrible’ and sudden end to her marriage. He said: ‘But there is also no doubt at all that she was not only distressed but extremely angry and she wanted some revenge. ‘And her revenge was in the end to pass the story about the 2003 crime to the newspapers so that it would be published in the end, that it would destroy her husband’s career.’ Addressing the jury on her decision to take the points, he added: ‘Focus not on whether she was persuaded but whether she was in a situation where she had a choice. Chris Huhne, with his partner Carina Trimingham, outside Southwark Crown Court in central London on Monday. Huhne pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice . Huhne, the former Energy Secretary, . stepped down as Lib Dem MP for Eastleigh on Monday by accepting the post . of Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds. His . guilty plea meant he did not go on trial with his wife over the ticket . he received for speeding in his black BMW as he returned home from . Stansted Airport on March 12, 2003. He . admitted asking Pryce to accept the points so he could avoid an . automatic six-month ban as he already had nine points on his licence. In court yesterday, Mr Edis revealed details of emails and phone calls outlining how Pryce plotted her revenge after he left her eight years later. On March 1, 2011, Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott told Pryce her claims could ‘inflict maximum, perhaps fatal damage’ if she spoke openly. She said this would achieve the ‘dual purpose’ of ‘bringing Huhne down’ without seriously damaging Pryce’s own reputation in the process. Pryce replied that she was unsure whether to publish the explosive story before or after her divorce was finalised. She added: ‘So I need reassurance that it would indeed bring Huhne down. I have no doubt, as I really want to nail him. More than ever actually, and I would love to do it soon.’ The two women then secretly recorded four phone calls between Pryce and Huhne as they tried to get the politician to incriminate himself. Mr Edis told the court Huhne ‘did not fall for it’ and the calls simply showed two ‘manipulative’ people ‘trying unsuccessfully’ to manipulate each other. The jury of eight women and four men was told Pryce is using a special legal defence available only to wives, claiming she was coerced into committing a crime. Mr Edis told them that it ‘may surprise you but it is true, that is what the law says’. He said they must decide whether Pryce was ‘weak- minded’ and forced into accepting the points or acted of her own free will. The trial was adjourned until Thursday when Miss Oakeshott will be called as a prosecution witness. The other woman: Carina Trimingham, the press adviser who became Huhne's lover . Vicky Pryce’s burning hatred for her husband’s new lover echoed across a courtroom yesterday. In a series of phone calls played to a jury, she repeatedly brands Chris Huhne’s bisexual partner Carina Trimingham a ‘****ing man’. The angry outburst took place after the Cabinet Minister accused his former wife of leaking a story to the Press that he had split up with the woman he had left her for. Pryce, once a top Government economics adviser, responds bluntly: ‘I don’t give a s*** about that because you are nothing to do with me.’ Later, she added: ‘I’m very pleased for you that you are still with that man of yours.’ In another call, Pryce complains her £2million family home in a private street in Clapham, south London, is under siege from journalists. She said: ‘They are pressurising all the ****ing time, I can’t even get through the front door, whether it’s to do with your ****ing man, or to do with your ****ing points.’ Pryce and Isabel Oakeshott, the political editor of the Sunday Times, planned to secretly record four phone conversations with Huhne in April 2011. The pair were desperate to obtain hard evidence of the politician incriminating himself so the story of his dishonesty could be published. Yesterday the jury was played the tapes which reveal Pryce fiercely barracking her former husband, insulting his new partner and brow-beating him over the points. She repeatedly tried to provoke Huhne into confirming he committed the crime, but he was wary of what she was up to and resolutely denied it, telling her not to speak to the Press. At times in the phone calls played to the court, the former Energy Secretary repeatedly fends off his wife as she rants over his denials, but on other occasions he is more conciliatory. At one point he tells her: ‘Can I suggest, if you want to stop journalists door-stepping you, you stop telling ridiculous stories to the Press?’ Pryce also dishonestly denies having any involvement in the Fleet Street rumours in a bid to find some common ground between them. She said: ‘Why would I tell anyone about me taking your points? It’s not in my interests. Are you a moron?’ Huhne cautiously tells her the newspapers cannot publish the story if she does not ‘stand it up’ and she must not speak to them. Yesterday's Daily Mail . When Huhne accuses her of ‘maliciously briefing the Press’ to ruin his  political career Pryce points out their ‘entire family’ knew she had taken took his points. She insisted: ‘You know full well that I took your points.’ But her former husband dodged the accusation and avoided confirming her claims. Huhne advised Pryce not to  take calls from Miss Oakeshott, and said: ‘They have no story and they  cannot have a story unless you give it to them. ‘There’s no reason for you to give them a story because it isn’t true.’ He told his former wife not to tell ‘false stories’ and compared the situation to ‘rubbing Aladdin’s lamp’ and letting the ‘genie of the bottle’. In another conversation Pryce said she did not want to ‘perjure’ herself by denying she had taken the points for him. She added: ‘It’s one of the things that’s always worried me when you made me take them in the first instance.’ As their relationship deteriorated further, Huhne said the truth was that Pryce was ‘maliciously briefing the Press’ to ruin his political career. At one point the exasperated MP told her: ‘You are behaving in an entirely unbalanced way.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Vicky Pryce colluded with newspaper to bring Huhne down, a court heard .

It may have seemed like a clever advertising ploy but a company's attempt to use 'real' customers to promote itself has backfired after they were targeted in a series of Twitter attacks. In the series of commercials Verizon FiOS urges viewers to contact Liana Rowe, Mike 'The Goose' Steinmetz and Regina Schneider who claim to love the company and want to share their experiences. But instead of genuine inquiries about download speeds, the trio have been besieged by hundreds of irrelevant, odd and very funny questions. Scroll down to watch ad . Mike Steinmetz is one of the three Verizon 'real customers' who have been bombarded by irrelevant questions since the campaign began . Many of the questions have been about how much the three have been paid to promote Verizon . Questions have ranged from whether the . three are actually robots to if the fast download speeds can help one . user find his mother. The three, who say they are real customers, have also been revealed to be working actors. Rowe and Steinmetz work for New York theatre companies and Schneider is an actress based in Long Island. They say while they have been 'incentivized' to promote the company, all their good experiences are genuine. Garrett Wilson summed up the tone of most of the messages with his question to Mike Steinmetz: 'How much are they paying you to promote this s*** man.' Liana Rowe, who is also a working actress, has been asked if she can help find one Twitter users mother and help another with his cocaine problem . Regina Schneider had to tell one another that she wants to talk about Verizon and not if she likes unicorns . When another user insinuated Liana Rowe was . only talking about Verizon for the money she retorted: 'I don't know why . this upsets you so much. I'm trying to answer questions and help . everybody out :)' Many other Twitter users have wanted to know why she had not used her account for two years before the campaign began. Mike wrote: 'Why no tweets in your 2 years history then all sudden you become activate. If you are fake then my whole life has been a lie.' She replied: 'A lot of people ask that. I made a twitter just to follow  celebs and stuff. I used by fb for social networking. It's not fake.' Each of the three featured customers has a disclaimer written on their page: 'This Twitter user is a real FiOS customer incentivized by Verizon to share his/her own opinions and thoughts on FiOS service. 'The thoughts and opinions expressed by participants in this program are completely independent of Verizon.' However, when questioned neither of the three will reveal how much they have been paid to promote the company. Other questions have been more unusual. DJMarcRecordz pleaded with Rowe to use the company's fast speeds to help him find his mother, while some men were concerned with how quickly they would be able to download porn. One man asked Schneider whether she liked unicorns and Lowe was asked to help one person with their cocaine addiction. However, despite the provocation the Verizon trio do not seem able to retaliate but have to be polite at all times.","Verizon FiOS used 'real' customers in their latest advertising campaign .

Assassination: Tunisian opposition politician and human rights activist Choukri Belaid was shot dead outside his home in Tunis today . Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Tunisia after an opposition politician was murdered yesterday. Lawyer Shokri Belaid, who died in hospital after being shot four times outside his home in Tunis, was a leading member of the Popular Front party and a constant critic of the government. As news of his murder spread, protesters gathered outside the interior ministry, many calling for the fall of the moderate Islamist-led government elected after an uprising drove out veteran ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. There were angry demonstrations in several cities amid warnings of civil war in the country that launched the Arab Spring. Talks on a cabinet reshuffle to include a wider range of parties in a coalition led by the Ennahda party have broken down. Ennahda insisted it had nothing to do with the murder of Mr Belaid, 47, whose family said he had received regular death threats. The killing, coupled with angry demonstrations in several cities, sparked warnings of a new wave of violence following reports Al Qaeda-linked militants have been accumulating weapons with the aim of creating an Islamic state. Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali, who said the identity of the attacker was not known, condemned the killing of Mr Belaid as an ‘act of terrorism’ and a strike against the Arab Spring revolution. Mr Belaid, who died in hospital after being hit by four bullets, was a lawyer and human rights activist who accused the Government of being a puppet of the rulers in Gulf Arab state of Qatar, which Tunisia denies. Gunned down: Shokri Belaid, a leading member of the opposition Popular . Front party, was shot four times to the head and chest outside his . home in the capital Tunis as he set off for work . Evidence: Forensic inspectors examine the scene. Tunisian prime minister condemned the killing as a political assassination and a strike against the 'Arab Spring' Protesters also took to the streets . in Sidi Bouzid, where jobless university graduate Mohamed Bouazizi set . himself on fire in despair after police confiscated his unlicensed fruit . cart, triggering protests that toppled the president. Police used tear gas to break-up the crowds and dozens were said to have been arrested. Distraught: Mr Belaid's wife Basma Choukri after hearing that her husband had been killed . Ennahda party president Rached . Gannouhi immediately distanced it from the killing of one of their . leading critics, insisting Ennahda had nothing to do with the shooting. ‘Ennahda is completely innocent of . the assassination of Belaid ... Is it possible that the ruling party . could carry out this assassination when it would (only) disrupt . investment and tourism?’ he said. He blamed those seeking to derail . Tunisia’s democratic transition after the 2011 uprising, adding : . ‘Tunisia today is in the biggest political stalemate since the . revolution. We should be quiet and not fall into a spiral of violence. 'We need of unity more than ever.’ Mr Belaid had been a fierce critic of . Ennahda, claiming that it turns a blind eye to violence perpetrated by . extremists against other parties. His family said he regularly received . death threats - the most recent on Tuesday - but had refused to limit . his high-profile activities. President Moncef Marzouki cut short a visit to France and cancelled a scheduled appearance at a summit in Egypt to return home. He warned last month escalating tension may lead to ‘civil war’. Tunisia was the first Arab country to . oust its leader and hold free elections as uprisings spread around the . region two years ago, leading to the ousting of the rulers of Egypt, . Yemen and Libya and the civil war in Syria. Since the revolution, the government . has faced a string of protests over economic hardship and Tunisia’s . future path, with many complaining hardline Salafis were hijacking the . revolution in a country dominated previously by a secular elite. Declining trade with the crisis-hit . euro zone has left Tunisians struggling to achieve the better living . standards many had hoped for following Ben Ali’s departure. Crowds: The body of Shokri Belaid is carried into an ambulance after he was shot. He was a staunch secular opponent of the moderate Islamist-led government .

Millions of Monopoly fans worldwide voted on Facebook after the manufacturer launched its first public poll to choose which of the eight tokens to ditch, and what to replace it with. The iron, which has featured in the game since the 1930s, secured just 8 per cent of a vote and will now be removed. But the cat, regarded as a dead cert to win because of their huge popularity online, came top with 31 per cent of the poll. Scroll down for video .

The pieces identify the players and have changed quite a lot since Parker Brothers bought the game from its original designer in 1935. Rhode Island-based Hasbro announced the new piece Wednesday morning. Other pieces that contested for a spot on Monopoly included a robot, diamond ring, helicopter and guitar. Fans from more than 120 countries voted. 'We put five new tokens out for our fans to vote on and there were a lot of fans of the many different tokens, but I think there were a lot of cat lovers in the world that reached out and voted for the cat to be the new token for Monopoly,' said Jonathan Berkowitz, vice president for Hasbro gaming marketing. The online contest to change the tokens was sparked by chatter on Facebook, where Monopoly has more than 10 million fans.

Most of the pieces were introduced with the first Parker Brothers iteration of the game in 1935, and the Scottie dog and wheelbarrow were added in the early 1950s. The social-media buzz created by the Save Your Token Campaign attracted numerous companies that pushed to protect specific tokens that reflect their products. That includes garden tool maker Ames True Temper Inc. of Camp Hill, Penn., that spoke out in favor of the wheelbarrow and created a series of online videos that support the tool and online shoe retailer Zappos which pushed to save the shoe, Berkowitz said. 'We've even had some companies like Jolly Time Pop Corn reach out and petition to have a popcorn token added to the game, even though that's not one of the new five tokens,' he said.

Caught on camera: Investigators filmed Stuart Collier hulking around heavy tool-boxes (left) and jogging along as he pushed a friend’s car (right, circled) Investigators filmed Collier hulking around heavy tool-boxes and jogging along as he pushed a friend’s car, and they also found that he had taken on jobs as a chef at two football clubs.

A reckless 64-year-old lorry driver ignored motorway warning signs ordering drivers to slow down and ploughed into the back of a family car - killing a four-year-old girl, a court heard today. Robert Booth, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, was driving his HGV at its maximum speed of 55mph seconds before he smashed into stationary traffic on the M6 motorway near Coleshill, Warwickshire. His lorry collided with a Vauxhall Zafira, sending it careering across the road into a concrete barrier on the hard shoulder, leaving Priyanka Bhogal, of Coventry, West Midlands, with fatal head injuries. Tragedy: Robert Booth (right), 64, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, was driving his HGV at 55mph on the M6 motorway near Coleshill, Warwickshire, seconds before a crash that killed Priyanka Bhogal (left), four . Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours. Booth, who denies causing death by dangerous driving, ignored several signs on overhead motorway gantries warning of a minor collision further ahead and ordering them to drive at a maximum of 40mph, Warwick Crown Court heard. The brightly-lit signs also instructed drivers to move from the inside lane to the middle lane in order to avoid the accident - which Booth also allegedly ignored. Priyanka died in the smash, but Booth denies one charge of causing her death by dangerous driving. Prosecutor Nigel Wilkins said he paid ‘no attention’ to the signs or the brake lights ahead of him. He said: ‘It was night time and at the time Mr Booth was driving a heavy goods vehicle, it was an articulated lorry. Also on that stretch of motorway were Mr and Mrs Bhogal. ‘They were travelling in a Vauxhall Zafira, a people type carrier, and in that vehicle were their children including Priyanka. She was sitting in the rearmost near side seat. Scene: Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours (file picture) ‘The defendant drove into the rear of that vehicle and as a result of him colliding with that vehicle it was pushed into a barrier at the side of the road. ‘And tragically the four-year-old child Priyanka, despite being taken to hospital with injuries, died later that same morning of effectively a serious head injury which was caused by that collision. 'Mr Booth did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead. We know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say Mr Booth caused' Nigel Wilkins, prosecuting . ‘Along that stretch of road on that day there had been another incident, I believe it was some sort of minor accident but it had caused a build up in the M6 itself. ‘Because of that incident the relevant gantries were being displayed to both control the speed of traffic and to warn traffic of the problem ahead. ‘There was a 40mph speed limit being shown to traffic and the gantries were showing that a lane ahead was closed and for traffic to move from lane one to lane two when safe to do so. ‘Mr Booth did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead. We know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say Mr Booth caused.’ Trial: Warwick Crown Court (pictured) heard Booth ignored several signs on overhead motorway gantries warning of a minor collision further ahead and ordering them to drive at a maximum of 40mph . The court heard the Bhogal family had been driving home to Coventry after a family member's 40th birthday party the day before in Walsall, West Midlands. In a statement, Priyanka’s mother Baljit Bhogal, who was driving, said: ‘We left the party at about 11.30pm. I know Priyanka was wearing her seatbelt. Priyanka was sitting in her booster seat. ‘I looked up in my inside mirror and then . I heard a screeching from behind. I saw a lorry coming up very quickly . behind me in lane two. 'I could see a bead of blood on her forehead and her eyes were partly open. She appeared to have no soul left in her' Joginder Bhogal, father of Priyanka . ‘I knew I needed to get away from it so I steered to the left to get away from the lorry.  Within seconds of seeing this lorry it hit our car from behind pushing our car off the road into the barrier. ‘I went to Priyanka first, I held her head for a bit and said Priyanka. She did not say anything, she just fell forward. I continued holding Priyanka's head through the back of the smashed window. ‘Two women came up to me and took me away from the scene. I was taken to hospital and the doctors told me Priyanka had died.’ Priyanka's father, Joginder Bhogal, added: ‘I could see a bead of blood on her forehead and her eyes were partly open. She appeared to have no soul left in her.’ Tachograph records from Booth's lorry were analysed and showed police he was travelling at his maximum speed of 55mph. The trial continues.

Brainchild: The concept of bringing ice to a hot climate was the idea of Frederic 'The Ice King' Tudor . Having ice cubes in your drink as you relax on a hot beach is an enjoyable, but not innovative concept. But the idea of bringing ice to a warm climate was in fact the revolutionary idea of Frederic 'The Ice King' Tudor. His vision was to carve frozen water out of a Massachusetts pond and send it to hotter exotic climates. By 1805 ice had taken its place as a summertime luxury with the wealthy residents of Boston . During that year, it was suggested to Tudor, reportedly while he was at a party, that there was a market for overseas ice. The idea appealed to Tudor's entrepreneurial skills and he decided to set up a business of harvesting ice in tropic lands. His supply of ice was obtained nearby from Fresh Pond, a reservoir in Cambridge. His plan of a foreign ice trade proved difficult to put into practice - it failed many times as the ice melted while he shipped it to Martinique and Cuba, reports The Atlantic. But Tudor was determined to bring his plan to fruition and realised he could minimise the melting by packing the ice tighter as well as insulating it with sawdust . instead of straw. His perseverance paid off and Tudor made his first profits by 1810. But his good luck took a turn for the worst when he landed in debtor's prison after being swindled by a business partner. His spell in prison did not not put . him off and once he was released, he secured a loan from friends and . family enabling him to continue with his obsession. He . later summed up his determination at the front of his thick ledger . which over the course of the years became his 'Ice-House Diary,' according to Ice Harvesting USA. Innovative: Tudor's workers divide a pond into a chessboard pattern and cut ice into two-foot square blocks . Ice truck: The blocks of ice were packed in sawdust - a good insulator - and poor conductor of heat - to prevent it from melting while being moved . 'He . who gives back at the first repulse and without striking the second . blow' he wrote, 'despairs of success has never been, is not, and never . will be a hero in war, love, or business.' His business model proved to be simple but effective - at first Tudor gave away his ice . for free, reasoning customers would return and pay for ice once they had experienced the new sensation. After people tried their . drinks cold, they could 'never be presented with them warm again,' Tudor boasted. The ice was laboriously cut by hand with saws, until Tudor hired a new foreman named Nathaniel Wyeth. Vision: Tudor summed up his determination at the front of his thick ledger which over the course of the years became his 'Ice-House Diary' The Tudor Ice company continued to be a success and ship around the world until domestic electric refrigerators became available in the early 1900s . Wyeth developed a horse-drawn ice plough and a system cutting ice into blocks about two feet square. His plan was to Tudor's advantage - the mass-produced ice was easier to transport and store, reducing his costs significantly. Wyeth also invented above-ground ice houses, with double walls for insulation. 21st century living: Having ice in your drink as you relax on a hot beach is an enjoyable, but innovative concept . As the Dictionary of American Biography states, '[I]t was said at his death that practically every implement and device used in the ice business had been invented by Nat Wyeth.' But Tudor's real success came in 1833 when he set his sights to India and decided to transport ice 14,000 miles across the ocean. The large clear blocks unloaded on one of the first shipments to India by Captain Codman in the ship Nantasket, proved to be a source of amazement with the crowds gathered at the quay. In comparison to the slush residents were used to for only a few weeks a year, Tudor's crystal clear ice proved an instant hit. The India Gazette thanked him for making 'this luxury accessible, by its abundance and cheapness' and Calcutta became his most profitable destination. At one point in Tudor's incredible . career, he had owned ice-houses all over the world - in Havana, Jamaica, . New Orleans, Charleston, Mobile, Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Galle, and . Singapore. According to iceharvesting.com, he died at 80 years old, worth about $12 million in today's rate. Although he died in 1864, the Tudor Ice Company carried on the name for a number of years. By 1900 nearly every family, grocer and barkeeper in the USA had an icebox. During the early 1900s domestic electric refrigerators became available, and by the 1940s they were common in U.S. homes. Frederic 'The Ice King' Tudor's dream was to bring ice cut from the frozen water of a Massachusetts pond to ship it to hotter exotic climates. Tudor had labourers who would . painstakingly cut out blocks of ice from the frozen Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, during the winter using pickaxes and saws before transporting it in hay-lined carriages to . be stored in ice houses. But . once his ice was prepared, he faced an even bigger challenge - how to . transport the ice, possibly for several months, and then store it in a . hot country without it melting. Tudor . had packed his ice in hay but later discovered sawdust was the best at . preventing ice from melting. Despite . finding a way to stop his ice from melting during the voyage overseas, . he couldn't find a merchant willing to ship water - even if it was . frozen - inside their ship. Tudor . was eventually forced to buy his own brig called the Favourite for . $4,750 and set sail for the Caribbean in 1806 with 130 tons of ice cut . from a pond on the family estate outside Boston. The ice survived the three-week voyage but melted away in Martinique because there were no icehouses to store it. In 1825, Tudor teamed up with one of his suppliers, Nathaniel Wyeth, who invented a two-bladed, horse-drawn ice cutter. Sea merchants refused to store water inside their ships so Tudor eventually bought his own brig called the favourite, similar to the one pictured above, to ship his ice cargo abroad . Previously, the ice had been laboriously cut with saws. Wyeth's horse-drawn ice plough sped up the process and meant ice could be cut into blocks about two feet square. The device scored an ice sheet into a checkerboard grid of blocks that could easily be pried out with iron bars. Tudor then took on his biggest challenge - a 16,000-mile journey from Boston to Calcutta in 1833. The large clear blocks unloaded on one of the first shipments to India by Captain Codman in the another ship Nantasket, proved to be a source of amazement with the crowds gathered at the quay.

One of the world’s ugliest creatures could hold the key to beating chronic pain, scientists believe. The star-nosed mole, which boasts a bizarre snout fringed by 22 waggling tentacles that are highly sensitive to touch, could lead to new painkillers for people whose lives are blighted by arthritis and other conditions that leave them in constant pain. The tiny creature, native to North America, lives underground in almost total darkness and so relies on its nose to ‘see’. Potential: The star-nosed mole, which boasts a bizarre snout fringed by 22 waggling tentacles that are highly sensitive to touch, could lead to new painkillers being developed . The points of the ‘star’ rapidly survey the floors and walls of its tunnels for tasty worms and grubs, much in the same way as a blind person uses a cane to hunt out obstacles. After hitting on a tasty morsel, the mole, which weighs less than a bag of sugar, takes just 230 milliseconds to decide if it is edible and gobble it down. Quicker than the blink of an eye, this is less than half the time a motorists needs to begin braking on seeing a red light, and makes the creatures one of the fastest eaters on the planet. The centre of its snout is particularly responsive to touch, with more than 100,000 nerve endings packed into an area one centimetre square, making it the most sensitive patch of mammalian skin known to man. Now, scientists are starting to unravel the secrets of its remarkable nose, in the hope of helping people whose bodies are extra-sensitive to pain and for whom current drugs offer little benefit. A study of star-nosed moles caught in Pennsylvania pinpointed genes thought to be key to feeling touch and pain. Receptors: University of California researcher Diana Bautista said: ¿By studying the star-nosed mole, we have identified candidate genes that may mediate touch and pain' If the same mechanism is at play in the human body, it be exploited to develop new treatments for persistent pain, the journal PLoS ONE reports. University of California researcher Diana Bautista said: ‘By studying the star-nosed mole, we have identified candidate genes that may mediate touch and pain. ‘These genes represent new potential targets for the development of much-needed drugs and therapies to treat chronic pain.’ Chronic pain often takes the form of headaches, back ache or neck pain and can be caused by an injury, cancer or arthritis. However, it some cases, it has no obvious cause. Millions of Britons suffer pain almost daily, with almost 8 million working days a year lost to back ache alone.","Creature's snout has 22 waggling tentacles packed with nerve-endings .

Beyoncé's half-time extravaganza at the Super Bowl may have impressed fans but her raunchy leather-clad performance failed to pull in more viewers than Madonna's record breaking 2012 appearance. In fact, fewer people watched Sunday's thrilling Super Bowl than the previous two championship games, according to figures released on Tuesday. Although Beyoncé, who prepared for five months for the hotly anticipated gig, reunited Destiny's Child and sung live, viewing figures showed the 31-year-old was watched by 104 million viewers, compared to Madge's audience of 112.5 million. Scroll down to watch both performances . Sasha Fierce... but not in viewing figures: Beyoncé failed to beat Madonna's 2012 ratings for her half time show . What did you think of Beyoncé's Super Bowl performance? Nielsen, a company that tracks the ratings, reported the actual game drew 108.4 million viewers, which is a drop from last season's tally of 111.3 million viewers. Madonna's performance in 2012, which sparked controversy after M.I.A swore at cameras, was criticised on Twitter but its lavish nature - the slot featured CeeLo Green, Nicki Minaj and LMFAO - meant the show was certainly noticed. Nearly half of all households that own a television were tuned into Sunday's game, the company added. Massive gig: Madonna, seen performing with Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., spoke out about the British rapper swearing during the Super Bowl halftime show last year branding it 'negative' The showdown, where the Baltimore Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers, scored a 46.3 rating and 69 . share in its overnight ratings. For the Nielsen measurement, one ratings point represents 1,147,000 households, or 1 percent of . the nation's estimated 114.7 million TV homes. The share means that 71 . percent of TVs that were on at the time were tuned to the Super Bowl. Oblivious: Madonna said she didn't know about the swearing until she had left and was on the way to the airport . How rude! The 36--year-old rapper was seen swearing into the camera during the live broadcast of the show . At CBS' request the ratings figure . from last night did not include a 30-minute period when there was a . partial power outage in the Superdome. But viewership actually increased after the power outage, as the game measured a 52.9 rating during its final moments, CBS noted. Not surprisingly, Baltimore ranked first among cities watching the championship game. The game drew a 59.6 rating and share of 83 there. In second place was New Orleans, where the game was played. The contest drew a 57.1 rating and a 77 share. Crazy In Love: This year's Super Bowl's half-time show comes in at second in the most watched league . San Francisco did not rank in the top 10 cities for viewership. The network also drew criticism by the Parents Television Council for not moving quickly enough to edit out a profanity said by Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco shortly after the game. Flacco was caught by microphones describing his team's victory as 'f------ awesome.' The game also illustrated the explosive growth of second screen activity. The company Trendrr TV, which tracks activity on Twitter, Facebook and other social networks, estimated there were 47.7 million social media posts during the game. That compares to 17 million during the 2012 Super Bowl and just 3 million the year before that. Last year's Super Bowl, when the New York Giants beat the New England Patriots, drew a Nielsen rating of 47.8 and had a share of 71. The only non-Super Bowl to have reached the 100-million viewer benchmark was the series finale of MASH in 1983.

"By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 12:18 EST, 24 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:16 EST, 25 January 2013 . Welcome to Columbia. A beautiful city nestled in the clouds. Where the sun’s constantly shining and its inhabitants live a life of bliss. Rapture, this isn't. But for those yearning for the damp, claustrophobic atmosphere that made the last two games such hits, it's not long before Columbia reveals its sinister underbelly. Sky's the limit: You'll often just want to stand and stare at the stunning views. But most of the time, you'll die very quickly if you do. Set in 1912 during a period of American Exceptionalism, you play former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt who's on a rescue mission to save a lady called Elizabeth. Upon finding himself in Columbia (after one of the game's splendid in-game cutscenes) he's soon harried and chased by the dystopia's warring factions - the nativist Founders and the Vox Populi. He's also on the run from the Songbird - a menacing flying robot who's been Elizabeth's guardian for the 12 years that she's been imprisoned. Immediately noticeable are the graphics - which are based on the Unreal 3 Engine - almost unrecognisable given the amount of customisation Irrational Games have done. Beauty and the beast: Elizabeth has been kept captive for 12 years, and is guarded by a huge metal beast called the Songbird. Buildings stand tall, proudly displaying their Venetian-esque splendour. Intricately-laid cobbled roads are frequently interrupted with extravagant water fountains. There is no doubt that the sun-kissed world of Columbia is a graphical masterpiece. Gameplay, however, stills feels very much like a Bioshock game - albeit with a few tweaks. Guns are used by the right trigger, while powers and mutations, the left. Mutations available in the preview were a fireball - which engulfed foes and reduced them to charred embers, birds that could be released to tear people apart, and Possession - which can be used to turn enemies against each other. Similar to the Adam and Eve in the previous games - DeWitt can collect Salts, which - when he has enough - can be used to trigger the mutations. This will come in handy: This claw-like weapon can be used to traverse the city's sky lines, however, it also acts as brutal melee weapon. There are also plenty of man-made weapons, ranging from the trusty pistol to the high-velocity machine gun. But it's a claw-like melee device that is perhaps the most useful. This allows you traverse the city's skylines - and being magnetic - lets you perform death-defying leaps. Indeed, this is much more vertically-layered than its predecessors - levels clearly designed to encourage gamers to explore and experiment. The claw is also a brutally powerful . melee weapon - a press of the button sees DeWitt jam it into an enemy's . skull one minute, or cleanly decapitate them the next. Sometimes, you'll walk into areas designed to give you optional battles. For example, you may decide to gun down a load of NPCs, which will alert guards to your position. If, instead, you leave them be, the nearby guards will be none-the-wiser to your location and you'll avoid a firefight. It's a bold move changing a winning formula, but Bioshock Infinite may be one of the rare examples where the risk pays off. It's released on March 26. SPOILER ALERT!

Apple shares fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading Wednesday night as the world's largest technology company reported lower than expected iPhone sales in the latest quarter. The company shipped 47.8 million of the flagship product, less than the 50 million that Wall Street analysts had predicted for the period ending December 29, sending the stock down. Sales of the iPad came in at 22.9 million in the fiscal first quarter, about in line with forecasts. Apple said today that its fiscal first quarter revenue rose to $54.5 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $54.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. This is the slowest growth rate for the company since at least 2009. Drop: Shares of Apple fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trades following the latest earnings report, after closing up 1.8 per cent during the regular session . Shares in Apple fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trades following the earnings report, after closing up 1.8 per cent at $514.01 during the regular session. For the fiscal first quarter, the company posted net income of $13.07 billion, or $13.81 a diluted share, compared to $13.06 billion, or $13.87 a share, a year earlier. Sources this month have pointed to production cutbacks at Apple's component suppliers as a sign that demand may be waning for the iPhone, which accounts for half of the company's sales, and the iPad. The disappointing numbers come after Apple undershot revenue targets in the previous two quarters. The results will prompt more questions on what Apple has in its product pipeline, and what it can do to attract new sales and maintain growth. Apple is tonight expected to record its first drop in earnings since 2003 . The technology giant's shares have dropped around 30 per cent since September, erasing about $190 billion in market value amid concerns that the world is falling out of love with iPhones and iPads. It comes after less than stellar sales of its iPhone 5, and as the company faces rising production costs, competition from rival Samsung, and slowing growth in smartphones. This afternoon's earnings report was expected to show that first-quarter net income slipped 2 per cent to $12.8 billion, or $13.48 a share, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The actual earnings, however, were better than expected. Such a drop would have been the first fall in earnings since 2003. Analysts projected sales would rise 18 per cent to $54.8 billion. But they fell short at just $54.5 billion - which equates to the slowest growth for the company since at least 2009. Some have attributed the decline to the market becoming saturated with other smartphones, meaning growth for Apple is slowing. Rival Samsung offers more than 80 touchscreen smartphones and many are opting for alternatives to the newest - and expensive -  iPhone 5, which starts at around $199 with a two-year contract. Problems are believed to have arisen when the iPhone 5 made its debut. Critics of the new, larger screened model, complained it was riddled with errors its predecessor did not have. One of its most useful features, Google maps, was replaced by an in-house version which contained glaring errors and missed entire areas. The long awaited model also 'scratched too easily' according to die hard Apple fans, and many became disenchanted with the company's until now unrivaled magic. Earlier this month it was revealed . that Apple has dramatically cut component orders for the iPhone 5 amid . weaker than expected demand for the device. The California-based tech giant . reportedly slashed the number of screens it wanted in half and reduced . orders on other parts too. Apple is said to have have told its . suppliers about the change last month. It will apply to orders from now . until the end of March. Many feel that after the death of its founder Steve Jobs, it is just a matter of time before it runs out of steam. Since Jobs' death Apple has made some rare missteps that almost certainly would not have happened were he still alive. Former CEO Steve Jobs introduced the new iPhone in January 2007. Some have attributed the decline to the underwhelming launch of the iPhone 5 and the rise in other smartphones . Its chief executive Tim Cook admitted the company ‘screwed up’ with the its new maps service. It also launched the iPad Mini even though Jobs specifically said before his death that Apple should never do so. However, Wall Street on average still . predicts that 48m iPhones will have been sold over Christmas, bringing . the total since its launch in 2007 to 320m. Only Samsung comes close, having sold 100m of its Galaxy S phones since 2010. Stuart Jeffrey, an analyst at Nomura . Equity Research, said: 'If iPhone 5 sales really are disappointing so . soon in the product’s refresh, then it seems fair to worry about likely . sales volumes in the next few quarters before the iPhone is next . refreshed.' One solution which Apple is considering is the introduction of a budget iPhone. And in addition to a cheaper . smartphone, experts say Apple could also consider a new comprehensive . television product with services that link it to the iPhone and iPad . The company now only sells a $99 device that plugs in to a TV. Some analysts, including Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley, have said the worries about Apple’s growth are overblown, and suggested investors use the recent stock slide as an opportunity to buy. And Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co, said if growth continued at the same pace for another five years, revenue would reach $1.2trillion, or the size of Australia’s gross domestic product.","The company shipped 47.8 million of the flagship product, less than the 50 million that Wall Street expected .

Revealing study: The Norwegian team say that 'less-attractive' people are often less conscious of their bodies than 'good-looking' people . For better or for worse, society has 'ideals' in terms of what an an attractive body is. Ask people to define a physically good-looking person, and most will list being 'thin' and 'in-shape' as characteristics, and perhaps they will offer up Michelangelo's David or the Venus De Milo as good archetypes. But a surprising study from Norway suggests that those who are furthest away from these 'ideals' are just as satisfied with their appearance. In fact, the study found those with 'good looking' bodies were more likely to be self-conscious about their appearance. The study, at the National Institute for Consumer . Research, saw researchers Mari Rysst and Ingun Grimstad Klepp hold in-depth interviews with 20 Norwegian men and women. According to Science Nordic, half of the group was categorised as 'bodily deviant' - either struggling with obesity for years, suffering burn damage, or with physical handicaps. The 'bodily deviant informants' were asked to describe an attractive or sexy body . and - while acknowledging the slim and fit ideal - stressed that personality as well as charm and charisma were the most . important and attractive features. Pulling out examples from the study, the team point to one obese woman who found men 'who cared for others to be . sexy and that 'a good-looking body may just as well be chubby as . thin, really. To me it doesn’t matter.' The 'most obese informant' meanwhile said 'a sexy body has a . lot to do with the personality that shines through'. Rysst suggested the overweight participants would downplay the importance of appearance 'to legitimise and normalise their own oversized and untrained bodies' and 'feel better about themselves'. Reflections of beauty: The Venus de Milo is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty . Rysst added: 'Some of those whose bodies were obviously too large said they were pretty satisfied. One participant, a 30-year-old known as Storm, had severe skin damage due to a fire injury. But . he told the researchers that was accustomed to his scars - and instead . noticed other things about his body that he would like to change. He said: 'One has to accept what it is impossible to do anything about, otherwise things get too difficult.' 'One obese woman had learned to completely ignore her own body and led a life with good confidence and a good job.' The team conclude that those outside 'the norm' will accept their body features as they are difficult or impossible to change. Meanwhile those in the study with average and good-looking bodies seemed less satisfied than those with deviant bodies. Rysst told Science Nordic: 'It was surprising to us that those who were rather fit and slim were dissatisfied with their looks. 'I think people are affected by pictures that are displayed in media, advertisements and public space without really knowing it. 'Our ideas of the perfect body is shaped by what we're exposed to, and we're exposed to it no matter if we like it or not. 'But this reflects the society we live in – you can't be too good-looking.'","Study from Norway suggests 'good-looking' people notice their body imperfections more than larger or handicapped people .

A Polish war hero with an incredible story of survival during World War Two has died aged 91. Flight Lieutenant Czeslaw 'Tony' Rogers braved a 830-mile trek on foot across the Soviet Union's frozen wastes to India after being freed from a prison camp before eventually making it to Britain. He then became a decorated Spitfire and Lancaster bomber pilot who flew daring RAF missions against targets in Germany. Lt Rogers, who adopted the English surname of his screen heroes Roy and Ginger, had fought in 1939 when his native country became a target for oppression following the non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin. The German Luftwaffe decimated the Polish air . fleet and pilots like Lt Rogers were handed machine guns and told to fight on . the ground - against German forces invading from the west and Russian . soldiers from the east. Lt Rogers was then taken prisoner by the Russians and sent to a gulag in Siberia. Best friend Gordon Scott-Whale, 85, of Fairford, Gloucestershire, recalled: 'In Krakow Tony told me he and his comrades hid inside graves at a cemetery. 'Can . you imagine firing at Russian tanks from inside a grave? One of his . friends was killed but Tony escaped and managed to make it back to his . village.' He was later arrested by the NKVD secret . police and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, deported in a cattle . truck which took three days to reach a prison camp in Siberia. Mr Scott-Whale said: 'There were women and children in . the trucks and whenever a child died en-route they just had to throw . their body out into the snow.' Following Hitler's invasion of Russia in 1941, . Stalin allied with Britain and America against the Germans. Prime . Minister Winston Churchill requested the release of Polish nationals . from Siberia - and Lt Rogers was one of them. Remembering what his friend had told him . about escaping from the gulag, Mr Scott-Whale said: 'They opened the gates of the . camp and told them to go. 'At . first they thought it was some trick and that they'd go out and get . shot. But off they went in groups of ten, on specially made sledges. 'In .

German . fighters were waiting for the planes to rise but they kept at low . level, but many crews were lost and the missions were stopped afterwards . for being too risky. Following the German invasion of Poland, many Polish pilots - a great number of whom had fought the Luftwaffe - escaped and made their way to France and Britain. In June 1940 the Polish Government in Exile formed a Polish Air Force in the UK, with two fighter squadrons - 302 and 303 - composed of Polish pilots and ground crews, with British commanding officers. The two fighter squadrons went into action in August. Most of the Polish pilots had hundreds of hours of pre-war flying experience and were among the most experienced in the battle. They had learned from combat experience to fire from close range. Between them the Polish pilots claimed 201 aircraft shot down. 303 Squadron, in which Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz served, claimed the highest number of kills - 126 - of all Allied squadrons in the Battle of Britain. The Polish War Memorial on the outskirts of RAF Northolt was dedicated in 1948 as a commemoration of the Polish contribution to Allied arms. Lt Rogers continued to serve in Bomber Command flying Lancasters, until his retirement from the RAF in 1948. His service log books highlight 12,000 flying hours in a variety of . aircraft types: Spitfires, Lancasters, Wellingtons and after war ended . Meteor jets. Before the war, Lt Rogers had originally wanted to become a doctor in 1930s Poland, but was attracted to a career flying aeroplanes by a friend of his brother, who was part of the pre-war programme to strengthen the Polish Air Force. In the early 1950s Lt Rogers and his family moved to Singapore, where he was the personal pilot to General Sir Gerald Templer, British High Commissioner in Malaya during the Communist insurgency. Mr Scott-Whale said: 'Tony would fly light aircraft such as the Auster to spot terrorist activity in the Malayan jungle so that the ground troops could move in and flush them out.' Lt Rogers won the RAF Air Crew Europe Star, the Defence Medal and the highest accolade of Polish medals, the Virtuti Militari. Gordon commented: 'In later life Tony would always be guest of honour at Battle of Britain memorial dinners at RAF Brize Norton, and sit at the top table with the Commanding Officer. 'He also met the Duke of Kent in 2002 at Fairford Air Tattoo, and last year met the Queen in London at the unveiling of the bomber command memorial.' Lt Rogers was eventually immobilised by a stroke and the RAF Benevolent Fund stepped in to provide a mobility scooter. He was so inspired by this that he went on to become a keen supporter of the RAF Benevolent Fund. In memory of his friend Gordon said: 'There are not so many of these chaps left now. Tony was a perfect friend and a wonderful man. I hope his story is not going to be forgotten.' Lt Rogers passed away on January 15 at Hyperion Nursing Home in Fairford, Gloucestershire.","Tony Rogers braved 830-mile trek on foot across Russia's frozen wastes .

The 'Mr Yummy' ice cream man filmed smashing the van window of his Mr Whippy rival has been spared a jail term. Zeheer Ramzan, 34, was given a six month prison sentence, suspended for two years, at Preston Crown Court yesterday. He was found guilty of assaulting father-of-three Mohammed Mulla in Palatine Road, Blackburn, Lancashire, in an apparent turf war. Scroll down for video . Zeheer Ramzan, 34, (right) was given a six month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after the row, which saw his rival Mr Whippy collide with his van after the attack . Ramzan, left, armed himself with a crowbar and smashed the window of rival Mr Mulla's ice-cream van . The judge also ordered Ramzan to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, pay £100 compensation and £800 costs and made him the subject of a two-year restraining order. The argument in June last year, in which Ramzan was armed with a crowbar, was caught on video by horrified neighbours and led to one million hits on YouTube. The court heard in November that Mohammed Mulla, 41, had operated his Mr Whippy van for 12 years in the Lancashire town. In March last year, Ramzan, who lives 30 miles away in Halifax and was selling ices on a commission basis, arrived at a school where Mr Mulla operated. Mr Mulla told him: 'You can’t come and trade here.' He also complained to Ramzan's employers that he was driving dangerously. 'Mr Yummy' was filmed smashing the van window of his Mr Whippy rival with a crow bar, and the glass shattered over the victim . Terrified Mr Mulla then hit the back of Ramzan¿s Mr Yummy van as he tried to get away . After the two men had vied for customers, it escalated into Ramzan assaulting his rival - but he has been spared jail . Ramzan was not deterred, however, and the two men vied for customers. Locals said one would offer four two-scoop cones with a chocolate flake for £2, after which the other would offer the same deal for 10p cheaper. Matters came to a head on June 2 when Mr Mulla pulled into a street to find the Mr Yummy van already parked in front of him. He was seen breaking a window in the Mr Whippy van of Mr Mulla, who then hit the back of Ramzan’s Mr Yummy van as he tried to get away. Ramzan, of Halifax, had previously pleaded guilty to criminal damage and possession of a weapon in a public place. After a trial in November he was found guilty of assault with intent. Speaking after the verdict, Mr Mulla said: 'It’s a relief to see justice done. It has been a nightmare since this happened. 'The incident was terrifying and I was frightened to go out afterwards. I am very relieved.' VIDEO: Mr Yummy's attack on 'Mr Whippy' caught on camera . In November the former Mr Yummy driver had previously pleaded guilty at Blackburn magistrates’ court to criminal damage and possession of a weapon in a public place, but denied assault. But magistrates said his account of events was 'untruthful'. The 34-year-old Halifax man had told Blackburn police his victim Mr Mulla, had purposefully driven into the back of his van. But magistrates accepted Mr Mulla’s version of events, that he had been struck on the arm with the wrench, and then showered with glass from a smashed window. Police recalled Ramzan for questioning after viewing the YouTube footage. He answered, 'no comment' to a series of follow-up questions and claimed the glass smashed accidentally. Prosector Eddie Harrison asked if he had left his vehicle armed with the tyre wrench both times he approached Mr Mulla. Ramzan replied 'No'. He said: 'I just ran at his van to scare him away, he had been following me. I went back to the van for it because he had waved a claw hammer at me.' Mr Harrison then showed CCTV footage from Mr Mulla’s van in which he can be seen holding the wrench both times he approaches. Mr Ramzan replied 'It was months ago.' Mr Ramzan had also told the court he had never been in trouble with the police before to which Mr Harrison produced documents showing court convictions for driving when uninsured and obstructing justice. Defending, Tahir Mahmood said there was no evidence from the CCTV that the tyre wrench caused later bruising to Mr Mulla's arm. He said: 'There is not even sound on the audio track of the CCTV to suggest that.' Mr Harrison said: 'You told a pack of lies to the police to blacken the name of a rival seller. 'Without the video evidence, Mr Mulla may have been the defendant.'","Zeheer Ramzan found guilty of assaulting rival 'Mr Whippy' Mohammed Mulla .

A routine trip to the dentist has ruined a father's life after it left him with a condition which makes it too painful to talk or eat. Bob Lodwidge has suffered excruciating toothache for more than a year and is now five-stone lighter as he cannot bear to eat. The furniture store owner claims his life has been ruined after a routine tooth removal left him in unrelenting agony despite taking 25 painkillers daily. Following surgery the father-of-two, . 52, of Winchester, Hampshire, was diagnosed with left-sided trigeminal . neuralgia. This condition causes shooting pains through his face constantly, . leaving it too painful to talk or eat. His condition has also made it impossible to work and run his new furniture shop. Mr Lodwidge said: 'Before this I was a . happy, outgoing, larger than life character but now I'm depressed in . constant pain so can't talk and I have lost all my confidence. 'I feel I am half the man I used to be and it is heart-breaking to see the affect it is having on my family.' As a result of his toothache Mr Lodgwidge sleeps 15 hours a day and his diet is limited to porridge and yoghurts. Bob and his wife Rose-Marie Lodwidge pictured in summer 2011 before he underwent dental treatment which has left him in agony . His condition - considered to be one . of the most painful known to man - has also affected his marriage to . wife of 32 years wife Rose-Marie. Rose-Marie, 50, said: 'He's not the man I married; he has no quality of life at all. 'We don't get to spend any time together, and I know our children and granddaughter Sian are desperate to spend time with him too. It's horrible to see him like this.' Trigeminal Neuralgia is an extremely severe facial pain that has unpredictable sudden shock-like attacks. The pain can be triggered by light touches, and is described as stabbing, shooting, excruciating or burning. It usually lasts for a few seconds but there can be many bursts of pain in quick succession. One theory is that it is caused by the trigeminal nerve wrongly sending out inappropriate pain signals. Trigeminal neuralgia is a long-term condition that often gets worse over time. It is normally treated with surgery or painkillers. After numerous trips to his GP and . Southampton General Hospital Mr Lodwidge has been given various . medications to try and ease the pain but as of yet nothing has worked. His daily dose of drugs includes oral morphine. The father, who now has a phobia of dentists added: 'Doctors have suggested alternative painkillers and a balloon compression. 'This involves inflating a balloon over the trigeminal nerve to relieve pressure but I think surgery is the only viable option. 'It is just running my life. I really do hope that this nightmare will be over soon so my family and I can get back to our happy life.' A spokesman from Southampton General Hospital added: 'Mr Lodwidge has a rare and painful complaint. 'He is now under the care of our neurosurgery team as we look to help find a safe, appropriate and effective solution for him.'","Bob Lodwidge has been left with trigeminal neuralagia after the routine tooth removal procedure .

A porn addict found with paedophile images in a massive collection seized by officers in a raid took police to court - in a failed bid to get it all back. Disabled Anthony Gerrard, 59, downloaded so much adult material it would have taken more than a month of non-stop viewing to watch it all. He also had tens of thousands of photographs - including 11 indecent ones of eight girls and three boys. Police arrested him three times on suspicion of possessing indecent child photos and seized six PCs and laptops from his home in Knowle, Bristol. But he escaped prosecution when experts revealed the child images had probably been 'unwittingly' downloaded as the adult porn was automatically sent to his computers. They said they were found on parts of the computers that four-times married Mr Gerrard could not have accessed without specialist tools or techniques. Police returned two of the computers - but retained those containing the child pornography. They took Mr Gerrard to court for the forfeiture and destruction of the hard drives they had kept which had a massive 888GB of adult movies and 2.5GB of adult photos. A district judge found in the police's favour last July, saying they could not return hard drives containing child porn because they would be distributing illegal material. Mr Gerrard appealed, claiming they could delete or transfer the child images and return his huge stash of adult pornography. The . former lorry driver claimed: 'I'm not interested in child porn. I don't . think it's fair they are keeping my computers when I haven't done . anything illegal. The father downloaded so much adult material it would have taken more than a month of non-stop viewing to watch it all . 'I paid £40 for a month's subscription to a website and I was downloading films from it day and night. I wanted to get my money's worth. 'They cost me a couple of thousand pounds in total. Every time the police took two computers away, I would buy another two.' Mr Gerrard, who is estranged from his son, added: 'The good thing about having a computer is you can switch it off when you've finished - you can't switch off a wife.' But his appeal was rejected by Judge Julian Lambert, sitting with magistrates Simon Brookes and Chris Barke, who said the police were entitled to keep the computers. They said there was no foolproof way of deleting the offending material from the computers before returning them. And the law states that if it is not 'practicable' to do that the item should be forfeited to the police. Digital evidence recovery officer Scott Eggins told the court: 'Deletion in a computer sense is a very complicated matter. 'There is no such thing as a permanent deletion on computers unfortunately - or fortunately. 'There is no way of permanently deleting it, short of putting it through a shredder.' 'I don't talk to kids or touch them - I only get out once a fortnight' PC Ben Jefferies, who arrested Mr Gerrard, said: 'The vast proportion of images that were recovered from Mr Gerrard's PC were adult in nature. The pornography that he had searched for was all adult. 'The 11 (child pornography) images had been downloaded unwittingly, probably.' The police also said that because of the sheer volume of legal porn possessed by Mr. Gerrard it would take days to transfer it to an external hard drive. That would cost up to £100 per new drive, plus police time, and Mr Gerrard had refused to pay for that. Judge Lambert said: 'We see no way, on the evidence in front of us, that the hard drives could be returned to the appellant with the images deleted so that they cannot be recovered.' Mr. Gerrard, who said he only had £100 in savings, was ordered to pay £1,533 costs. After the case he said: 'If they had just been able to delete the images and give me my computers back it would've saved a lot of court time and money. 'I'm gutted, but I've had my day in court and I thought the judge was very fair.' He said he was paralysed after breaking his neck in an accident at home but has now recovered enough to walk with a stick. Porn addict Anthony Gerrard yesterday denied any suggestion he was a paedophile and insisted: 'I hate that stuff. 'I don't download that kind of thing and I don't go to those vile sites - I want them closed down. Those children need protection. 'I don't talk to kids or touch them - I only get out once a fortnight.'","Anthony Gerrard escaped prosecution as the child images had probably been 'unwittingly' downloaded .

Drug addicts Kelly Barnes, 32, and Jodie Barnes, 31, were convicted of murdering retired bus conductor Barry Reeve. He was found murdered at his home in Norfolk, Norwich, after the couple punched, stamped and slashed him with a knife, leaving the hapless pensioner dying for up to 48 hours. Scroll down for video . Theft: CCTV footage shows drug addicts Kelly Barnes, 32, and Jodie Barnes, 31, trying to withdraw money from victim Barry Reeve's account . Guilty: Jodie Barnes (left) and Kelly Barnes (right) have been convicted of murder after torturing and killing a pensioner . CCTV footage shows the pair trying on several occasions to enter Mr Reeve's pin number. The . court heard how the couple even returned to his home after visiting the . bank machine, stealing valuables and emptying his freezer. The two women, both from Norwich, who were in a civil partnership, had both denied murder. But today a jury of eight women and four men found them guilty after five hours of deliberation. Barry Reeve is thought he lay dying for up to 48 hours after the attack . Members of Mr Reeve's family wept as the verdict was delivered at Norwich Crown Court. A statement released by Mr Reeve's children said they 'could not be happier with the verdict'. It added: 'As a family we were deeply shocked and distressed by what happened and . the consequences for both of us, his son and daughter and his . grandchildren. 'Our family could not be happier with the verdict, however, no amount of . time these women spend in prison will change what happened and bring . back our lovely little dad. 'The whole court process has been a very emotional time, however, we . look upon this as closure and now need to concentrate on our grieving . and learning to live our lives without Dad whilst trying to come to . terms with the awful circumstances in which he was taken from us.' Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, who . claimed during the trial that 'God had forgiven her', clutched a Bible . and looked stunned. Kelly Barnes shook her head and looked towards her partner. The pair whispered to each other before Jodie Barnes broke down in tears. As sentence was passed, Jodie Barnes shouted: 'I didn't lie, I swore on the Bible.' Jailing them for life, Judge Peter Jacobs said: 'The man who you killed was frail, old and vulnerable and lived on his own. 'His income was limited, he may or may not have had money. 'Both of you have previous convictions for violence and lived chaotic lifestyles. Kelly Barnes (left) and Jodie Barnes 'took away just about anything of value that Mr Reeve had' 'As a result of the attack, Mr Reeve . was kicked, stamped upon and punched, then put to the ground in a . semi-comatose state but he was sufficiently conscious to be able to give . you information. 'Some form of kitchen knife was used to cut this man. Serious, deep incised cuts were made to both cheeks and to his stomach. 'A . forensic pathologist said the obvious: those cuts were made to get . information, probably both his Pin number and any information about what . was in the property. Victim Barry Reeve told the pair he didn't have any money . 'It . was a grotesque situation that he was lying there slowly dying and you . were going around his property, stepping over and around his body and . stealing his property. 'Survival was impossible, death was inevitable. 'You took away just about anything of value that he had.' He said Mr Reeve's 'mental and . physical suffering' aggravated the crime and added: 'You were totally . indifferent as to whether he lived or died.' Mr Jacobs ordered each to serve a minimum term of 24 years. Jonathan Goodman, mitigating on behalf of Kelly Barnes, told the court it had not been a pre-meditated attack. Jodie Barnes's barrister, Graham . Arnold, said: 'There was no intention to kill. It is distressing that he . was left to die in the way that he was, but there was no attempt to . finish him off.' During the trial mother-of-four Kelly . admitted that they both visited Mr Reeve on February 9 last year after . Jodie suggested that he might lend them or give them cash. But . she told a jury that she had nothing to do with harming him and she . claimed she did not see Jodie assaulting him at his home in Norwich, . Norfolk. Kelly claimed that . Jodie only confessed to her what she had done to Mr Reeve when they met . up in the gym at a women’s prison in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Kelly . told the jury that Jodie had told her before they visited Mr Reeve that . she had got to know the pensioner through her sister and he had . previously given her money. Norfolk Police found a bag that contained Barry Reeve's wallet. The pair who killed him returned to the scene to collect food they had taken from his freezer . She . admitted she was ‘staggering and light-headed’ when they went to his . bungalow as she had taken drugs including heroin and had been drinking. When . the pensioner said he didn't have money to lend to the pair, Kelly . admitted searching the living room for objects to steal and then did the . same in Mr Reeve’s bedroom. But she insisted that she did not harm Mr Reeve and she was ‘positive’ that she didn’t see Jodie using any violence. Kelly said that she then saw Jodie looking through drawers in the pensioner’s kitchen and taking food from his freezer. Kelly said they took property away in five or six bags which they left in his garden by a tree. She . said they went to a Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried to use a bank . card in a cash machine. She claimed that she did not know at the time . that the card belonged to Mr Reeve. Police recovered retired bus conductor Barry Reeve's wallet, after the pensioner was found in his home . Evidence: Mr Reeve's blood was found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie . They then caught a taxi back to Mr Reeve’s home to collect the stolen property from his garden before returning to the Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried used the cash machine again. Kelly admitted using Mr Reeve’s mobile phone after it was taken from his home. She claimed she did not know how Mr Reeve’s blood got on to her Nike trainers, but she said her clothing sometimes got ‘mixed up’ with Jodie’s clothes when they undressed at night. The court has heard that Mr Reeve’s blood was also found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie. The pensioner's body was found in his blood splattered home two weeks later after he had died of serious head injuries. He had also developed pneumonia. Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but had been heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash. Det Chief Insp Andy Guy, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Major Investigation Team, said: 'Murder is thankfully a rare crime in Norfolk and Suffolk. 'Even more unusual is the fact that this crime was committed by two young women who clearly were prepared to inflict injuries on an elderly man in order to obtain his PIN number.

A father fatally shook his baby boy while his mother was buying Christening clothes, a court heard today. Lee Clark, 27, is accused of injuring five-month-old Charlee and causing brain damage while the baby's mother Natalie Holmes was shopping, a jury was told. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Charlee was 'smiling' and 'happy' when Natalie left the family home for Darlington, County Durham, on February 25, 2011 at around 10.45am. But when she returned to the home Gainford, County Durham, at 3pm, the baby, who was due to baptized two days later, was making a 'funny groaning sound', his 'eyes were rolling backwards' and he had bruises on each knee. Charlee was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital where it was obvious he was 'extremely ill', the court was told. He was given oxygen and a brain scan during which Clark asked a nurse if Charlee's injuries could have been caused by 'shaking a baby', the jury heard. The scan showed that Charlee was suffering from bleeding round the brain, a swollen brain, bleeding at the back of his eyes and in his eyes, prosecutor Andrew Roberts told the court. Attempts were made to treat Charlee in the intensive care unit but he died days later on March 1. His Christening had been due to take place on Sunday, February 27. Mr Roberts said: 'Charlee, happy and normal, was left in the sole care of this defendant. 'The Crown allege that it was while he was alone with Charlee in the home that this offence occurred. 'Something must have happened while he was alone with Charlee because all the evidence shows he gripped and shook him vigorously. 'The first indication that Miss Holmes had that something was not quite right was when she received a text from the defendant saying the baby was unsettled.' Clark's mother had arrived at the family's home at around 12.10pm that day so the defendant could meet Miss Holmes in Darlington. Mr Roberts added: 'By that stage Charlee was a very different baby than the one Miss Holmes had left. 'Charlee was in his swing whinging and grizzling. 'When the defendant's mother tried to lift Charlee out of the swing, Charlee let out a scream.' Clark denies manslaughter. The trial continues.

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 05:21 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:08 EST, 30 January 2013 . A 14-year race discrimination court battle has cost the taxpayer almost a million pounds. Equality campaigner Natasha Sivanandan won £420,000 in compensation after a council-funded anti-racism group turned her down for a job. Top employment judge Lord Justice Mummery said qualified barrister Ms Sivanandan's long legal fight with the London Borough of Hackney was 'a 21st Century version of a 19th Century Chancery saga'. Hackney Council now faces legal bills which may even exceed the amount of Natasha Sivanandan's payout . He compared the lengthy proceedings to a 'Dickensian narrative of allegations and counter-allegations, applications and cross-applications, misunderstandings, objections, complaints, hearings, adjournments, reviews, appeals and cross-appeals'. The row began in June 1999 when 58-year-old Ms Sivanandan, from Wood Green, north London, applied for a job as a training and development coordinator and race discrimination case worker with Hackney Action for Racial Equality (HARE). Lord Justice Mummery said the case was like a 19th century saga . She was turned down for the post with . the charitable advice service, partly funded by Hackney, following an . interview in July that year. Within months she had started proceedings against both HARE and the Council, alleging victimisation under sex and race discrimination legislation. She claimed that she had been treated unfairly in the interview because she had already brought a discrimination case against HARE after being turned down following a previous job interview. In April 2002 she was awarded £15,076 by an employment tribunal in relation to that original complaint. In June 2003 the tribunal found that HARE and the Council were liable to pay out for victimisation of Ms Sivanandan in relation to both interviews. In 2007 she was awarded £1,905.41 . against one of her interviewers in relation to 'injury to feelings . caused by race discrimination'. Then, in 2009, she was handed a £421,415 payout against the Council. The total sum included £262,026 for financial loss, £15,000 for injury to feelings, £25,000 for injury to health and £25,000 aggravated damages plus interest and costs. Hackney . appealed, with its barrister Robin Allen QC arguing that the payout's . impact on the council and public funds was 'disproportionate.' A judge said the ET had been entitled to find the Council liable for the full amount of Ms Sivanandan's compensation . Charles Dickens' Bleak House, written between 1852 and 1853, revolves around a long-running litigation in England's Court of Chancery. The plot centres on a complex and tangled court case which involves a large inheritance with many potential beneficiaries. The novel explains how the case has dragged on for so many generations that, when it is eventually resolved, the legal costs spent trying to award the right person the inheritance have devoured the entire estate. The writer used the novel as a scathing attack on the chancery court system, painting it as an almost worthless institution which drags out cases for incredibly long periods of time. He argued it was unfair for the Council . to be landed with such a huge bill - not to mention 12 years-worth of . lawyers' fees - when a 'very much smaller sum' was awarded against the . interviewer who Mr Allen described as 'the primary discriminator.' Lord Justice Mummery, giving his decision on the appeal, expressed surprise at the sums involved, saying: 'On the face of it £421,415 seems to be a great deal of money to compensate Ms Sivanandan for acts of discrimination in two unsuccessful job interviews.' However, dismissing Hackney's appeal, the judge said the tribunal had been entitled to find the Council liable for the full amount of Ms Sivanandan's compensation. The court defeat is a disaster for Hackney which now faces enormous legal costs bills which may even exceed the amount of Ms Sivanandran's payout. Lord Justice Mummery acknowledged that the case had cost 'a very large amount of public money' but refused to grant Hackney permission to appeal further to the Supreme Court. A spokesman for Hackney Council said: 'We are disappointed with the outcome and are studying the judgement to decide our next step.' The payout is merely the latest for Ms Sivanandan, who has successfully taken various bodies - mainly anti-racism groups - to court over more than 25 years. Her first grievance came when she was working as a race adviser at London's Brent Council. She accused a Rastafarian colleague of being 'macho and intimidating'. Many of her cases were taken against organisations - including Barnardo's - that turned her down for jobs. Others were against a housing association that failed to move her into a bigger home and even an employment tribunal judge. In 2002, she won a five-figure sum against a black law centre, forcing it to close amid acrimony and financial ruin. Her father Ambalavaner Sivanandan, director of the Institute of Race Relations think tank, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Her actions have been unconscionable. She has taken money from the organisations I have fought to help.'","Equality campaigner Natasha Sivanandan is awarded £420,000 after 14-year court battle with Hackney Council and Hackney Action for Racial Equality .

The brave teenage girl shot in the head by the Taliban for advocating girls' education in Pakistan is to have a titanium plate fitted to skull, surgeons revealed today. Malala Yousafzai, 15, will also have a cochlear implant fitted to help her recover hearing in her left ear. The Pakistani schoolgirl was gunned down at point blank range by the Taliban nearly four months ago for standing up for women's rights. Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai and a 3D image of her skull, which will have a titanium plate fitted . Dr Dave Rosser, medical director at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, where Malala is receiving treatment as an out-patient, said both procedures were routinely carried out at the city's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. At the start of January a frail-looking Malala hugged and waved goodbye to staff at the hospital, where she has undergone months of life-saving surgery following the failed assassination attempt that left her with a bullet in her brain. This is a 3D model taken from Malala's skull and shows the damage inflicted by the Taliban . She will continue her rehabilitation at the family's temporary West Midlands home before undergoing major reconstructive surgery in a few weeks. Dr Rosser said Malala was a 'remarkable young woman' who had made great progress in her recovery. He also said she was fully aware of . the threats the Taliban had made against her life, but has said she . would continue to champion her cause. 'She's not naive at all about what happened to her and the situation in terms of her high profile,' he said. 'She's incredibly determined to continue to speak for her cause.' Both surgical procedures will be carried out within the next 10 days and will take about 90 minutes each. Dr . Rosser said it could take 'between 15 and 18 months' for any hearing to . recover in her left ear but added that in time she would have almost . normal levels of hearing, thanks to the surgery. Stefan . Edmondson, Principal Maxillofacial Prosthetist at the trust, explained . how the plate would be fitted over a hole in Malala’s skull, which has . been left by the path of the bullet. These images demonstrate how the plate for Malala's skull is created by using wax and shaping it to fit the contours of her skull . The red line drawn diagonally down the skull shows the journey of the bullet through the schoolgirl's head, and the plate to cover her damaged skull . It was also revealed that the damaged . portion of missing skull had been implanted in Malala’s abdomen - where . it remains - in case it was needed to repair her skull at a later date. However, surgeons have now decided instead to fit the metal plate. Dr Rosser credited the surgeons who operated on Malala in Pakistan soon after she was shot for saving her life. Malala's . bravery has moved the world in the months since she was targeted by the . Taliban in Pakistan for heroically speaking out for women's rights and . freedom of access to education in the country. Dr Dave Rosser praised Malala's sense of humour and bravery . In October last year a Taliban hitman burst onto her school bus in Swat, northern Pakistan, and shot her at point-blank range. The bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her jaw, 'grazing' her brain. It was later removed by surgeons in Pakistan before she was flown to the UK for specialist treatment. The Trust had previously said Malala . would undergo cranial reconstruction surgery in late January or early . February as part of her long-term recovery. Dr . Rosser said Malala had already undergone surgery since her discharge . from the Birmingham Hospital at the start of the year, to repair a . facial nerve severed in the gun attack. 'The facial nerve was damaged by the course of the bullet,' he said. 'The facial nerve comes under the ear, but the surgeon was able to re-route and reconnect it. 'The surgeon has managed to do that without having to take a graft from another nerve. 'Malala . does have a weakness in her face so the left side of her face droops, . but there's a good chance she will completely recover within 18 months.' Dr Rosser said this could be 'her last . surgery' and once over, she could finally be able to concentrate fully . on her rehabilitation. Malala Yousufzai was attacked and shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan for campaigning for education for girls . Malala was flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital after escaping death when a bullet 'grazed' her brain . He said the fitting of the titanium plate - a titanium cranioplasty - was a relatively straightforward procedure which would help protect her brain. Meanwhile, he said the cochlear implant will correct 'complete deafness' Malala suffered after the bullet destroyed the eardrum and the tiny bones which allow sound to register. According to Dr Rosser she should be out of hospital within 'two to three days' of surgery. He praised Malala's 'great sense of humour' and the fortitude with which she has dealt with her life-changing injuries. Malala is now likely to secure permanent . residence in the UK after her father was granted a job with the . Pakistani consulate in Birmingham. The Taliban have vowed to target her again.","Schoolgirl will also have ear implant to help recover her hearing .

It's an achievement only the most talented musicians can hope to gain - the highest guitar grade. But for Ayla Gezmis it was a piece of cake - the 10-year-old is one of the youngest people in Britain to achieve a grade eight in the electric guitar.

Ayla Gezmis is set for a rock and roll future after becoming one of the youngest people in Britain to achieve a grade eight in the electric guitar . And the youngster is already becoming a household name after posting videos of herself performing in her bedroom on YouTube which have attracted hundreds of hits. Ayla, from Skellingthorpe, Lincolnshire, says her ambition is to become a lead guitarist and follow in the footsteps of her idols ACDC. She said: 'Not that many girls play the guitar, it's kind of a boy instrument so I hope I can join a band and show that girls can play too. 'I want to start a band and one day be as big as ACDC.' Ayla perfected her strumming skills after attending weekly lessons with Rockschool, which aims to help the nation's future musicians. Mini Hendrix Ayla rocks out . Ayla only took up the instrument when she started strumming her dad's guitar because she was bored at home two years ago . The youngster has been nicknamed Mini Hendrix and hopes to be as big as her favourite band, ACDC . The syllabus is designed for pupils to sit a grade examination annually, but Ayla has already reached the highest level of graded music exams for the guitar after just two years. Guitar tutor, Dan Clark said: 'When I first met Ayla she was a complete beginner, just about to turn eight-years-old but very quickly she was playing the tunes spot-on, straight away. A grade eight examination is a demanding test that requires musicians to perform a variety of tasks. These include showing their ability to complete scales, modes, arpeggios, chords and complete a stylistic study. They also have to perform a piece lasting three minutes 45 seconds, which has advanced stylistic techniques and use of stylistic sounds, with increasingly complex solo and improvisation opportunities included in it. A musician has to complete two listening tests where the student has to listen by ear for melodys and rhythms and then play it back. Finally, they are quizzed on their general knowledge of music and their instrument. 'That year she passed her Grade One with distinction which was pretty good progress already. 'I was thinking she's going to hit a brick wall trying to get the chords right, people are 18-years-old when they get to Grade eight but there was no stopping her. 'She's very talented, we call her Mini Hendrix.' Proud father Met Gezmis, 46, said: 'I love the sound of the guitar so suggested it as a good hobby for Ayla to do when she was bored at home one day. 'We started slow with short lessons and she picked it up very fast, practicing every day. 'I am very proud, I say if you start something you keep it up and she has worked very hard. 'We were all surprised she has progressed so fast, I'm pleased as it has cost me less, I should have been paying for lessons for eight years.' As a reward for her incredible achievement, Ayla's dad has bought her a brand new Gibson guitar and she hopes to start her new band later this year.","Ayla Gezmis' ambition is to become a lead guitarist and follow in the footsteps of her idols ACDC .

Incentives: Border Patrol officers are receiving special 'bonuses' for arresting suspected illegal immigrants, according to a new report (file picture of a Border Patrol officer) Getting paid on time each month is usually enough of an incentive for most people to do their jobs properly.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has been photographed with a smartphone beside him during a meeting – but who made it? The mystery of what make of smartphone the ruler of one of the world's most secretive countries favours has sparked international controversy not only among geeks but the average person in the Western street. Is it an Apple iPhone? An HTC from Taiwan? A Sony from Japan? Surely not a Samsung from South Korea, the enemy across the border? This picture of North Korea's Kim Jong-Un with a smartphone has triggered fevered speculation about which brand is favoured by the leader of one of the world's most repressive nations. The device is to his right, next to a pile of papers, but it is not clear what make it is . 'I regret to say that I don't think Kim would be seen dead with a Samsung,' said a technician in the South Korean capital, Seoul. The dark phone seen beside Kim's elbow as he presided over a meeting with top national security advisers last week is at such an angle that its make cannot be defined. But experts are agreed that it is definitely a smartphone, revealing that if it does actually belong to Kim he is keeping up with modern technology. 'It's believed that the smartphone seen in the picture belongs to Kim, given that the device was placed right next to the documents he was looking at,' said a Seoul government official. South's Korea's media has given the picture – issued by North Korea's state media – prominent coverage, along with a discussion about the possible manufacturer. Samsung was 99 per cent sure it wasn't one of theirs. 'It looks more like an HTC model,' said a spokesman for the company whose Galaxy SIII phone is now outselling the iPhone. Which one? Experts have speculated whether Kim Jong-Un was pictured with an Apple iPhone (left) or an HTC from Taiwan. Samsung was 99 per cent sure it wasn't one of their own models . The enemy: South Korean technology giant Samsung has said it is sure the smartphone is not one of their own . Secretive: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un applauds before giving s public speech during a massive celebration marking the 100th birthday of national founder Kim Il Sung . This picture from January 27 shows the North Korean leader attending a consultative meeting with officials in the fields of state security and foreign affairs at undisclosed location in North Korea . South Korea's intelligence agents have carefully inspected the photo and they have also concluded that the Taiwanese firm was the likely manufacturer. So what does HTC have to say about the phone? 'We aren't going to get into a discussion about the device but we do appreciate the support of all users,' the Taiwanese company said in a statement. It is highly unlikely Kim's smartphone of choice is an iPhone - apart from the fact that the device at his side appears chunkier than an iPhone it is doubtful he would be endorsing a product of the hated United States. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspasper suggested that politics was behind the brand choice. 'It must have been politically uncomfortable for Kim Jong-Un to use products made by the U.S. ... and he can't publicly endorse the fact that the South (Korea) is more technologically advanced,' it said, in a reference to Samsung phones. Apart from highly-placed officials, about one million people in North Korea own mobile phones, which were introduced into the country in 2008 through a joint venture with the Egyptian telecom Orascom. However, they can only phone each other and not make international calls. In addition phones available to the public cannot access the internet. But it is believed Kim and his close associates are able to get online to the outside world. 'Kim and his family members as well as the North's political elite appear to use smartphones or other mobile phones capable of accessing the internet,' said a Seoul government official. Foreign visitors entering North Korea are now allowed to bring their mobile phones into the country, but they have to purchase a local SIM card that allows them to make international calls but prevents them connecting to local people.","Phone beside Kim's elbow as he .

Taken towards the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th, these shocking black and white photographs tell a tragic story. Millions of American bison, also known as American buffalo, were reduced to mountainous piles of bleached white bones and drying hides following a slaughter on an unprecedented scale carried out by European settlers. At the time, of course, the perpetrators of the hunts that led to the buffalo's near extinction held a very different point of view to that of most people today. Decimated: Buffalo were nearly wiped out by white hunters as they moved into the American west. Pictured, the carcasses of dead buffalo lying in the snow following a hunt . Macabre: A pile of bison and antlered deer skulls sit bleaching in the sun in Albany County, Wyoming, 1870. Skulls were often kept as trophies or for decoration by hunters . Slaughtered: Men in the mid-1870s pose with a mountain of buffalo skulls soon to be ground into fertilizer, the sad remains of an animal that once ruled the American plains . At their peak the bison are believed to have been the biggest . population of large wild mammals anywhere on Earth, numbering an . estimated 50 million before the European settlers arrived. Yet within . the space of a few decades, their number would be reduced to a mere . 2,000, bringing to an end an era in American history. Far from inciting feelings of disgust or . horror, the slaughter of bison was seen by European settlers as a means . to wealth, a healthy pastime, and most chilling of all, as a way to end . the primary source of sustenance for the Plains Indians and so drive . them from their land. Perhaps the most shocking fact about the near extinction of the American bison is that it appears to have been wholly intentional, part of a high-level strategy. Many scholars believe the government and military actively promoted the slaughter of bison herds to remove the primary food source of the Native Americans. Proud: Two hunters inspect their kill, around 1903. Men on horseback like these had an easy time shooting bison, which could be slow to react to their approach . Wall of bones: A long pile of buffalo bones stretches into the distance while a boy poses in front - Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1890 . There is heated debate about the . existence of an actual government policy that enforced this aim. Without the buffalo, the American . Indians could not survive, and without the Indians, European settlers . were free to claim their lands for themselves. Witnesses . reported seeing a sea of black during their annual migrations and . feeling the ground trembling with the beat of millions of hooves. For the Plains Indians such as the . Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Sioux, Comanche and others, the American buffalo . played an important role not only in their culture and religion but also . in their very survival. To them, the bison provided an endless supply . of necessities, and every part of the animal served a purpose. The . blood, milk, meat, marrow, organs, testicles, nipples and everything . down to the nose gristle were eaten, and buffalo tongues and fetuses . were considered particular delicacies. Some tribes are described as being part of the 'Buffalo Culture' as the animals were their main source of flesh, hide and bones, and were used to make other items such as food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing. The tribes followed the seasonal grazing and migration of buffalo. To many Native Americans, the bison was also a symbol of sacred life and abundance. Skulls were often kept as trophies or . for decoration. In 1842, an observer of the bison migration, Philip . St. George Cooke, wrote: 'Suddenly a cloud of dust rose over its crest, . and I heard a rushing noise as of a mighty whirlwind, or the charging . tramp of ten thousand horses. 'I had not time to divine its cause, when a . herd of buffalo arose over the summit, and a dense mass, thousand upon . thousand, galloped, with headlong speed, directly upon the pot where I . stood. 'Still onward they came. Heaven protect me! It was a fearful . sight.' A fearful sight that was soon never to be seen again. How the modern bison came to dominate . the North American landscape is still being debated. There is some . evidence that prior to European colonisation, herds were small and . regulated by Native American hunters. It was humans, not bison, who . dominated the plains landscape, some sources say. Then the Europeans . arrived, bringing with them the disease epidemics that wiped out so many . Native Americans and left so much of their vast grasslands empty and . ready for bison to take over - which they did in huge numbers. The animals once roamed the . North American plains from Canada down to Mexico, and as far east as the . western boundary of the Appalachian Mountains. A major contributor to the . bison's decimation was the expanding railroad system. Not only did the . industry's leaders actively encourage the slaughter of bison, which were a . nuisance on their tracks, but thanks to them, buffalo products could now . be collected and distributed in larger numbers than ever before. As the railroads were laid down, they effectively split . the herds. This new transportation network also made it easy for . commercial hunters to reach herds further and further out in the plains. Market hunters like these could kill hundreds of bison in a . single encounter. In fact some, such as 'Buffalo Bill' Cody, became famous . for slaying thousands during their lifetime. Killing: A pile of buffalo bones waiting to be loaded onto a train in Canada. The expansion of the railway system across North America was another factor in the decimation of the animal's population . Sad: Wright's buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, 1878, with some 40,000 buffalo hides apparently in shot . Hides: Skins hung up to dry in 1926, The Hides were the most prized body parts of the hunted bison and quite often the only parts commercial hunters took . Hundreds of thousands of tons of . bison bones were used in various industries, including the refining of . sugar and for making bone china and fertilizer. The buffalo has become a key symbol in North American culture, and is used in official seals, flags, and logos in both the US and in Canada. There are currently around 500,000 bison in captive commercial populations on about 4,000 privately owned ranches. However, only 15,000 total individuals are considered wild bison in the natural range within North America.","Buffalo population fell from 50 million to just 2,000 following hunting .

At first glance it looks more like smoke-stained debris from a house fire than a component from a $200 million passenger jet. But this burnt out battery from a Japanese Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner which caught fire at Logan Airport in Boston earlier this month could hold the key to a technical problem which has grounded the entire multi-billion dollar fleet. Experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have disassembled the device in a bid to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted yesterday they are no closer to reaching a conclusion. Scroll down for video: . Damaged: The singed battery case from the Japan Airlines (JAL) Boeing 787 Dreamliner is displayed inside an investigation lab at the NTSB Headquarters in Washington, DC . Investigation: The state-of-the-art Dreamliners continues to be grounded as the investigation into the cause of the thermal damage continues . Burnt: The NTSB's Joseph Kolly, holds part of the badly fire-damaged battery casing. The battery has been taken apart by experts in a bid to work out what went wrong . The NTSB said yesterday night that its investigation into the incident on January 7 is still in its 'early stages.' Boeing’s fleet was grounded by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) just over a week after the fire in Boston, following a similar incident on board a 787 in Japan. Deborah Hersman, head of the NTSB, . described the incident in Boston as a 'very serious air safety concern', . and that the body does 'not expect to see fire events onboard . aircraft,' according to the Telegraph. Meanwhile, batteries expert George Blomgren, who worked for Eveready for 40 years told CBS news that from what he knows about the incidents on board the Boeing 787s he would 'not fly in a Dreamliner tomorrow.' 'I just wouldn't feel that it was appropriate or safe,' he said. Burnt out: The battery shows evidence of short-circuiting and a chemical reaction which can cause progressively hotter temperatures, federal accident investigators said . Probe: NTSB investigators and metallurgists examine parts of the disassembled battery which have been laid out on a table . Detailed: A member of the NTSB investigation team examines pieces of damaged electrode coils from the battery . The NTSB said that despite . establishing that the lithium-ion device suffered a short circuit it . still has to 'figure out why these events occurred.'The revelation is more bad news for Boeing as it means the worldwide fleet of Dreamliners remains grounded. The Japan Airlines plane caught fire while sitting on the tarmac at Logan Airport. In a separate incident on January 16, an All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing in western Japan after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin. An investigator in Japan at the time said the burned insides of the plane's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in excess of its design limits. Concern: NTSB chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman speaks during a press conference at the NTSB Headquarters in Washington, DC, yesterday . Incident: A 787 made a landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also . detected in its cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines . have grounded their entire Dreamliner fleets . Hopes: Visitors admired the first production model of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner when it was unveiled to an audience of several thousand at Boeing's assembly plant in Everett, Washington . Technology: Spectators reach out to touch the fuselage of the first production model of the Dreamliner when it was launched. The jet was plagued with manufacturing delays and cost overruns . Since then, all 50 787s that Boeing has delivered to airlines' fleets have been grounded, and the manufacturer has halted deliveries of new planes until it can address the electrical problems. European air safety bosses acted just . hours after America’s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued an . ‘Emergency Airworthiness Directive’ to halt flights of the planes - the . first time a fleet of aircraft was been grounded across the world in 34 . years. Boeing said lithium ion batteries 'best met the performance and design objectives of the 787' and that 'based on everything we know at this point, we have not changed our evaluation,' CBS news reports. Complex: Parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world . Out of service: One of United Airlines six 787s sits on the tarmac at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston . The Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries. The battery fire is just one of  a series of problems  - including  two fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late. Mike Sinnett, chief engineer on the . 787, said earlier this month that the plane's batteries have operated through a . combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault. He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'. Watch Video Here: .","Burnt out shell of battery from Japan Airlines Boeing 787 revealed .

Honeytrap: Prostitute-turned-nurse Zhao Hongxia (pictured) secretly film herself having sex with a Chinese Communist Party official after being hired by a construction company to blackmail him . A corruption scandal involving Chinese city officials being secretly videotaped having sex with women hired by property developers - has widened. Lei Zhengfu, a Communist Party district chief in the southwestern city of Chongqing was sacked last year after a video was leaked online showing him having sex with a young woman. The images became targets of public derision and disgust over government corruption in China and Lei was fired. Now state media has revealed that ten other district- and county-level officials in the city's government, party departments and state-owned enterprises who appeared in additional videos - have also been fired. The films are believed to have been shot by women who were hired by developers to extort construction deals. The news has further exposed the often shady ties between business interests and local officials in China. 'The incident in Chongqing is not accidental or exceptional,' said Liu Shanying, a politics researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.  'It should be said that it is rather common and that the problem is with corrupted lifestyles. 'The atmosphere of officialdom is far from the traditional morality of ordinary people. Many local officials have lower moral standards than ordinary people, and the power they enjoy makes it easier for them to do immoral things,' Mr Liu said. The expanding scandal comes as China's newly installed leadership has vowed to crack down on rampant official corruption that threatens the party's legitimacy. Even as China's new Communist Party chief Xi Jinping has repeatedly pledged to strike hard against corruption, authorities have been faced with a steady stream of bribery cases and other malfeasance. 'Extortion': Zhao Hongxia (left) , who was 18 at the time the video was filmed in 2007, wrote on a blog that she was paid £5,000 to sleep with Lei Zhengfu (right) which she used to pay for her father's medical bills . In recent weeks, Chinese audiences have been riveted by revelations that some officials have amassed multiple properties using duplicate or fake identities. Soaring real estate prices have pushed home ownership out of reach for many Chinese, so such scandals are especially infuriating to the public. Zhu Ruifeng, a former journalist who released the first sex tape in the scandal, said at the time that the woman, whose face is not visible in the video, was hired by a construction company to sleep with Lei in return for construction contracts. The company later tried to use the tape to extort more business from Lei. An official at the Chongqing city propaganda office referred questions about the scandal to reports by the local party newspaper, the Chongqing Daily, which carried a report by the state-run Xinhua News agency. Revealed: Screenshots from the video showed Mr Lei, the party boss of Chongqing's Beibei District, having sex. Ten more officials from the city have been sacked after similar videos of them were released . Disciplined: The Communist Party held internal investigations into the videos before sacking those involved . Citing the city's anti-corruption . committee, Xinhua described the developers behind the extortion as a . 'criminal ring' and said the company had 'hired women to seduce local . officials, covertly filmed their sexual acts and used the videos as . tools of extortion.' The girl filmed having sex . with Lei was revealed last month as Zhao Hongxia, who was 18 at the time . the video was filmed in 2007. She reportedly wrote on a blog that she was paid £5,000 . to sleep with Mr Lei which she used to pay for her father's medical . bills.

A Florida appeals court has overturned two of the four convictions that Casey Anthony faced for lying to detectives during the investigation into her daughter's disappearance in 2008. While Anthony was acquitted of murder in two-year-old Caylee's death in 2011, she was convicted of four misdemeanor counts of lying to law-enforcement and sentenced to probation. Judges on the 5th District Court of Appeals have now agreed with Anthony's attorneys that the charges constituted double jeopardy, or being convicted more than once for the same crime. Victory: A court has overthrown two out of four convictions Casey Anthony faced for lying to detectives during the investigation into her missing two-year-old daughter, Caylee (right), in 2011 . Jurors determined that Anthony lied when she told detectives that she . worked at Universal Studios, that she had left Caylee with a babysitter . who kidnapped the girl, that she had told two friends about her . daughter's disappearance and that she had received a phone call from . Caylee. The state said each of her four false statements to detectives was a separate offense, but her attorneys said all of her lies only constituted a single offense. The judge agreed the charges had constituted double jeopardy as the four lies had been made in the same interview. 'We cannot conclude that the Legislature . intended to authorize separate punishment for each false statement made . during a single interview,' they wrote. Police questioning: Anthony, pictured in a waiting room in Orange County Sheriff's jail where her attorneys said she learned of her daughter's murder, told police four lies during questioning . But a second charge stands as she lied to detectives again on a later occasion, judges ruled. The court said that she first made four false . statements during her interview with Orange County . Sheriff's Detective Yuri Melich at her home, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Two of these . lies were then repeated to Melich in a later interview at Universal Studios, . where Anthony said she worked. 'In light . of the significant temporal break between Appellant's two interviews . with Detective Melich, we determine that each interview in which false . information was given (or repeated) constituted a separate criminal . episode,' the court ruled. The judges also ruled that the trial court was correct in allowing Anthony's statements to detectives to be used during her murder trial. Loss: Among her lies, she said she had spoken to her daughter on the phone a day prior to the questioning . Ruling: Anthony, pictured with Caylee, then repeated the lies in a later police interview and enough time had passed for it to count as a second offense, a court has ruled . Her attorneys had argued that she was in police custody at the time and had not been read her rights. 'We conclude that a reasonable person in [Anthony]'s position would not believe ""that his or her freedom was curtailed to a degree associated with actual arrest"",' the panel ruled. In response to the ruling, Anthony's . attorney Cheney Mason said he was very happy that two convictions were . overturned, and he would review the opinion on Monday to determine . whether they need to seek clarification on the two other counts. The next step for Anthony and her attorneys would be to appeal the remaining two convictions to the Florida Supreme Court. Freed: Anthony is pictured reacting, right, as she hears she is not guilty of the charges in July 2011 . Scene: The two convictions were overthrown by judges on Florida's 5th District Court of Appeals . It also means that Casey's civil trial involving a woman with the same name as the fictional nanny, Zenaida Gonzalez, can move forward. It had originally been set to start on January 2. The civil trial is now tentatively scheduled for August, attorneys told Bay News 9. Gonzalez, a Kissimmee woman who had never met Casey Anthony, is suing her for defamation, claiming her life was ruined after Casey said Caylee was kidnapped by a nanny with the same name. Anthony was sentenced to a year of probation after her release from jail for an unrelated case. Her whereabouts have been kept secret since she was released from state supervision last year, but a blurry cell phone image reportedly showed her eating at a South Florida steak house last month .","Court ruled the charges constituted double jeopardy - but two stand as she lied to detectives on two separate occasions .

A new strain of stomach bug sweeping the globe is taking over in the U.S., health officials say. Since September, more than 140 outbreaks in the U.S. have been caused by the new Sydney strain of norovirus. It may not be unusually dangerous; some scientists don't think it is. But it is different, and many people might not be able to fight off its gut-wrenching effects. Since September, more than 140 outbreaks in the U.S. have been caused by the new Sydney strain of norovirus, which some call the 'Ferrari of viruses' Clearly, it's having an impact. The new strain is making people sick in Japan, Western Europe, and other parts of the world. It was first identified last year in Australia and called the Sydney strain. In the U.S., it is now accounting for about 60 percent of norovirus outbreaks, according to report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Norovirus — once known as Norwalk virus — is highly contagious and often spreads in places like schools, cruise ships and nursing homes, especially during the winter. Last month, 220 people on the Queen Mary II were stricken during a Caribbean cruise. Sometimes mistakenly called stomach flu, the virus causes bouts of vomiting and diarrhea for a few days. Every two or three years, a new strain evolves — the last was in 2009. More than 140 outbreaks in the U.S. since September . The Sydney strain's appearance has coincided with a spike in influenza, perhaps contributing to the perception that this is a particularly bad flu season in the U.S. Ian Goodfellow, a prominent researcher at England's University of Cambridge, calls norovirus 'the Ferrari of viruses' for the speed at which it passes through a large group of people. 'It can sweep through an environment very, very quickly. You can be feeling quite fine one minute and within several hours suffer continuous vomiting and diarrhea,' he said. Health officials have grown better at detecting new strains and figuring out which one is the culprit. They now know that norovirus is also the most common cause of food poisoning in the U.S. It's spread by infected food handlers who don't do a good job washing their hands after using the bathroom. 220 people fell ill from the Norovirus bug last month on Queen Mary II . But unlike salmonella and other foodborne illnesses, norovirus can also spread in the air, through droplets that fly when a sick person vomits. 'It's a headache' to try to control, said Dr. John Crane, a University of Buffalo infectious disease specialist who had to deal with a norovirus outbreak in a hospital ward a couple of years ago. Each year, noroviruses cause an estimated 21 million illnesses and 800 deaths, the CDC says . Each year, noroviruses cause an estimated 21 million illnesses and 800 deaths, the CDC says. For those infected, there's really no medicine. They just have to ride it out for the day or two of severe symptoms, and guard against dehydration, experts said.

Laptop fire: A mattress and clothing caught fire in the blaze in Corvallis, Oregon, on Wednesday morning. Firefighters said it was caused by a Macbook Pro battery that fell out onto the bedding igniting the blaze . The incident has prompted the local fire chief to warn against leaving laptops near combustible surfaces when not in use and get batteries which overheat or don't hold a charge checked out immediately. Thankfully a fire alarm was in place in the house shared by students at Oregon State University. When it went off they discovered the smoldering clothes and mattress and immediately called 911, because of their quick reaction damage to the property was said to be 'minimal'. Warning: Firefighters in Corvallis, Oregon, have warned residents to store laptops, like the 2008 Macbook Pro, pictured left, away from combustible surfaces following the Wednesday morning blaze at the shared home . Corvallis Fire Prevention Officer Jim Patton told the newspaper: 'Fire damage was minimal and limited to the small area of origin near the nightstand and bed.' The owner of the laptop had left the computer so it was partially hanging over a wooden nightstand, according to the report. It is believed the battery fell from there to the floor. The American Red Cross said they would be help residents find temporary accommodation while the damage was assessed. In March 2007 Apple offered to replace batteries on earlier Macbook models after defects were reported in their batteries including swelling and overheating. However the company told Macnewsworld.com that the issues weren't a safety risk and a software update had solved the problem. Apple were unable to comment today.","Firefighters warn people to store laptops away from combustible surfaces in the wake of the Corvallis fire .

Randall Moore's, Escape from Tomorrow, a dark movie set among the backdrop of the Disney theme parks in Florida and California is all the talk of this year's Sundance Film Festival. Scroll down for video . Legal action? Filmmakers behind a movie on show at the Sundance Film Festival could face a lawsuit from the Walt Disney Company blocking its release. The film was secretly filmed in Disney's parks without permission . Can't look: Disney are 'aware' of the film but not commenting on what they'll do. Backers of Escape From Tomorrow said they expected the company to try and block its release . However, if Walt Disney Company get in the way it may never be released. The black and white film, which follows a man suffering a breakdown while on vacation with his wife and two children, was recorded entirely in secret across the tourist hotspots. It is packed full of disturbing imagery as its protagonist slips into madness and is haunted by the park's ghoulish characters and vertigo inducing rides - a world away from the company's squeaky-clean corporate image. Disney told CNN they were 'aware' of the film and were 'not currently commenting'. Film experts at the festival seemed agreed that Disney would likely take out a lawsuit. If opposed and a block goes ahead audiences will miss out on film described by Hollywood Reporter as a ' bizarre, sophomoric, hallucinatory' and 'gutsy' film shot entirely undercover, which has attracted the critics with it's directional flair and eerie soundtrack. Surreal: The film follows a father's dark mental breakdown while on vacation with his family at a theme park. The crew secretly recorded it in Disney World and Disneyland over 24 days without getting caught . Tourists: The film's cast mixed among the many tourists, left, visiting Disney's theme parks to avoid detection. They also had their scripts and directions on iPhones and mixed with the crowds during parades, right . 'It took a lot of planning. We were careful and cautious and tried not to draw too much attention to ourselves. But planning was the main thing,"" the director told the festival after the film premiered last Friday. 'We almost got caught once. ... We were shooting in the entrance of the park and we had to do a few takes and basically they thought our team was just paparazzi and we were shooting a famous family (entering the park),' 'It was very scary that day.' The director hid the microphone in his sock and he, the crew and his actors pretended to be tourists visiting the famous theme parks. Buzz: Indie flick Escape from Tomorrow is the talk of this year's Sundance Film Festival . Spaced-out mountain: The film was described as a 'hallucinatory' by the Hollywood Reporter. It has been well-received by critics mostly impressed by the clandestine way it was shot . Unhappy holiday: The family in Escape from Tomorrow are thrown into an unusual vacation to the theme park when father, Jim, suffers a breakdown after finding out he has lost his job . They had scripts and directions on their iPhones so could appear they were casually glancing at their phones while preparing for each take and used SLR cameras to film the action . They managed to go undetected for ten days at Disney's theme parks in Orlando and two weeks Disneyland, California. If Moore wants the film to go ahead, he may not be going the right way in winning around the corporation when discussing his 'inspiration'. 'Heavily influenced by various strange outings I endured as a boy with my father -- who at the time lived in Orlando, Florida -- 'Escape From Tomorrow' is my personal attempt to make sense of what felt like a very artificial childhood, brought on by our cultural obsession with these fake, manufactured worlds of so-called fantasy,' he said . Secretive: The crew, some pictured, led by Director Randall Moore, 1st left, recorded Escape from Tomorrow across Disneyland and Disney World over 24 days. They were almost caught once when mistaken as paparazzi . 'I think the film is really about defining the word 'escape' and how so many American households seek it out in a yearly pilgrimage to a materialistic Mecca.' It may well be that the small world is too small for both of them but not everyone at the festival is agreed Disney would win a legal challenge. Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, told the L.A. Times: 'It's a film that falls . pretty squarely in the territory of fair use, which addresses . copyright. And to establish trademark infringement they'd have to prove that a . reasonable person would think Disney is endorsing the movie, and I think . they'd have a hard time doing that.'","Escape From Tomorrow is a surreal fictional drama shot secretly in Disney World and Disneyland currently being aired at the Sundance Festival, Utah .

This grumpy mum wasn't best pleased when the lion tried to try to tame her cubs - and pounced straight at the enormous beast.

The outraged mother comically misjudged her distance and ended up on the lions head . Wildlife park ranger Jacques Matthysen captured the comic moment on camera, as he patrolled the South African plains. Jacques said: 'We had gone out to try and photograph some lions, and were met by a very playful pride of seven Lions. 'The four year old male Lion was playing with three young cubs - or rather, they were tormenting him, since all he wanted to do was have a rest. 'The older male and a female were walking 20 metres from us, rubbing their heads every couple of seconds showing affection. 'While watching them the other female appeared from the thicket. As soon as the 4 year old male saw the female, which is the mother of the cubs he was knocking over every now and again, he jumped up and jogged towards her. 'It looked like she was just waiting for the right moment. She stood still until the last second. The lioness lost her grip eventually slipping from the head of the male . The male lion paid little attention to the incident and strolled on after the mother fell to the ground . 'As he was half a meter away, she pounced on him. She did loose her grip though and quickly fell to the other side of him. 'With the female at his paws on the ground he just glanced down, as though to say: 'Was that it?'. 'He just kept on walking past her and us sitting in the Cruiser, and lay down to rest close to a thicket behind us. 'The cubs quickly saw the opportunity of mum laying on her side, ran towards her and started suckling.'","Grumpy mum wasn't best pleased when the lion tried to try to tame her cubs - and pounced straight at the enormous beast .

A bride who feared she would never walk down the aisle after being diagnosed with a brain tumour has finally married her fiance. Stephanie Parr was forced to cancel her wedding to fiance Neil after she suffered a fit last April. She was later diagnosed with a tumour the size of a tennis ball. Doctors told her she had been living with the tumour for years - and she could either leave it be, and hope it didn't keep growing, or undergo risky surgery to have it removed. She bravely decided to go under the knife just weeks before she was supposed to get married. Stephanie Parr, with husband Neil, had feared she wouldn't live to see her wedding day after doctors discovered she had a brain tumour the size of a tennis ball . The couple were forced to cancel their wedding after Stephanie suffered a fit and was diagnosed with the tumour last April . As Stephanie, 32, lay in intensive care on what should have been her wedding day, she feared she would never live to see the day she would finally marry Neil. But this Saturday, the couple, from Littleover, Derbyshire, finally tied the knot. Stephanie said: 'In December 2011, I was really fit and healthy. I met Neil through my brother, David, and we got on straight away. 'We have the same sense of humour and we just knew we were right for each other. Within three months, we'd moved in together and, within eight, Neil had proposed.' But their joy was cut short when Neil, 31, woke one night and heard Stephanie making an unusual sound. Doctors told Stephanie she had been living with the tumour for years - and was told she could either leave it be, and hope it didn't keep growing, or undergo risky surgery to have it removed. She chose the latter . She said: 'He tried to wake me up but . he couldn't. So he called an ambulance and I was taken to the Royal . Derby Hospital. The doctors there said it looked like I'd suffered a . seizure.' Stephanie was taken in for tests and, in February last year, was told she needed a brain scan in April. She went to fetch the results with her mother Alison. Stephanie said: 'I thought it might be epilepsy, that was all. I genuinely wasn't that bothered. I was in no pain. 'But, when I got in there, they asked who was with me. I said 'Mum' and I suddenly knew something was up.' She was told she had a brain tumour 2.75 inches (7cm) across and had had it for years. Stephanie chose to go under the knife just weeks before she was due to marry. She was in intensive care on her original wedding day . She said: 'Until you hear something like that, you'll never quite know how it feels. I thought that was it. 'I saw the fact that I just found the person I really loved, I saw the fact that we were set to be married and have children and, in one second, I knew it was all gone, finished. I was devastated.' But doctors told her  the tumour was not an immediate threat. They classed it as level two out of a possible four - not benign, but not yet fatal. Despite having the tumour removed, there is a chance another tumour could grow in the future. Stephanie said: 'I'm waiting until we get back from our honeymoon in Mexico to get the latest update. 'It's not like it's gone forever now - and I do think about it. 'But, Neil and I have been lucky enough to get married and be together. I've learned so much over the past year, not the least of which is that every second of this life is precious. This wedding is even more special because of what has happened.'","Stephanie Parr forced to cancel her .

"By . Sebastian O'kelly . PUBLISHED: . 20:14 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:58 EST, 6 February 2013 . There were two pivotal events in 1974 in the life of Reg Presley, legendary lead singer of The Troggs, who died of lung cancer this week at the age of 71. The first, which I witnessed, took place at Farnborough College of Technology in Hampshire, where I was studying. The Troggs, having had a series of hits in the Sixties, were then at their career nadir, playing a college gig for a fee that would have amounted to no more than £100. 'Obsession': Reg Presley (third from left), seen with his Troggs bandmates in Germany in 1965, was fascinated by unexplained phenomena . A group of what newspapers of the era would have described as ‘members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club’ were tormenting the band, jeering insults and aiming spurts of fizzy drinks at the lead singer. Wild Thing, the band’s huge hit of 1966, had gone down a storm, but the bikers had turned truculent as soon as the band started playing Love Is All Around — the song that would later spark The Troggs’ renaissance. All of a sudden, Presley hurled himself off the stage - disappearing in a tangled, thrashing heap along with his tormentors. The concert was at an end. In the subsequent melee, two of the band were stabbed. Richard Moore, the guitarist, nearly died; another was bottled and Presley emerged with a broken nose. It was a miracle that none of them was killed, but their narrow escape was nowhere near as miraculous as Reg’s experience several weeks later. Mysterious: The singer was convinced aliens were behind a spate of elaborate crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire fields in the 1990s . Still nursing his bruises at the Andover home he shared with his wife Brenda, he was dozing in front of the TV in the middle of the afternoon when he heard a news bulletin about a huge fire at Flixborough, Lincolnshire in which 28 people died. Few of the regulars at Reg’s local, the Barge in Pewsey Vale, are unfamiliar with what happened next, the singer having related the story countless times in his soft Hampshire burr. ‘I tell my wife about the fire,’ he would say. ‘Six o’clock, I turn on the news again and it says the explosion only happened at eight minutes to five. ‘How did I see a report about a disaster four hours before it happened? Could the broadcast signal have been affected by gravity?’ Theories: Reg Presley, seen with his wife Brenda, died this week following a battle with lung cancer . Even if gravity did have an effect on television signals - an effect hitherto unknown to physics - it remains unclear why this would allow Reg to pick up and decode a signal before it was broadcast. But Reg was never overly-concerned by the details of the unexplained phenomena with which he subsequently became obsessed. UFOs; aliens; the true origins of ancient stone circles. Reg was happy to theorise on all of them with scant regard to conventional science or history. However, it was one particular aspect of the paranormal with which Reg became most closely associated: crop circles. When there was a spate of mysterious and increasingly elaborate patterns in Hampshire and Wiltshire fields in the early 1990s, Reg was fascinated - and quick to offer an explanation. The cereal fields of south-western England were, he said, a stopping point for extraterrestrial craft, and the mysterious giant symbols were clearly messages - perhaps even warnings - from an alien intelligence to a doomed humanity. With a fellow scholar of the unexplained, retired Andover driving instructor Busty Taylor, Reg spent the next few years hastening to each new circle as it appeared, and offering his interpretation of the symbol’s hidden meaning. ‘We met first on July 17, 1990, at the giant crop circle at Alton Barnes near Devizes, and we became firm friends,’ Busty recalls. ‘We explored many circles together. He was of the older generation who would not hesitate to help people and talk through their possible meaning.’ Reg ascribed great significance to the fact that many circles appeared in a triangle between Warminster, Wantage and Winchester. ‘Look at the first few letters of each place,’ he told an interviewer in 1994. ‘War, Want, Win. Is that a message, or what?’ Such was worldwide enthusiasm for the crop circles that Reg and Busty were soon giving talks around the country, and going on lecture tours in the U.S. and Germany. Often, the talks would be accompanied by a Troggs gig. When the huge success of the film Four Weddings And A Funeral brought Reg an unexpected windfall - Wet Wet Wet’s cover of Love Is All Around was used in the 1994 movie and topped the charts for 15 weeks - he used the money to fund his interest. He even wrote a book, Wild Things They Don’t Tell Us, which explored alien abductions, crop circles, and what he saw as the close relationship between UFOs and ancient monuments. When crop circles were eventually proved to have been created by pranksters, Reg and Busty refused to concede defeat. Although they accepted that 75 per cent of shapes were man-made, they maintained that the rest defied explanation. Renaissance: The band struggled during the 1970s and '80s, but experienced a career renaissance after Love Is All Around featured in Four Weddings And A Funeral . ‘Reg was about the most grounded, sensible person I’ve encountered in the music business,’ says his life-long friend, music publicist Keith Altham. ‘But he had a tendency to watch an episode of The X Files and believe it was true. ‘It was a terrible setback when crop circles were debunked, but he clung to the hope that at least a few of them were genuine.’ It was Keith who gave Reg Presley his surname (after Elvis) in 1966, two years after The Troggs were formed. ‘Reginald Ball’ was just insufficiently ‘rock ’n’ roll’. ‘When he read the new name in New Musical Express, he rang me to ask (with his wonderful country boy accent) whether he’d been dropped from the band,’ Keith recalls. Reg, a bricklayer by trade, also used to tell the story of how he was working on a building when he heard the first Troggs single on the radio. ‘Share my tools out, lads - I’m off,’ he announced. The 1970s and Eighties were hard decades for the band, but then the film Four Weddings allowed Presley to emerge from obscurity and find success on the rock ’n’ roll nostalgia circuit, even playing at Sting’s wedding a decade ago. ‘He never lost his enthusiasm for little green men and UFOs,’ says Keith. ‘Shortly before he died, he contacted me to say that there was a large aircraft hanger underneath the Sphinx in Egypt - and he was sure there was a UFO parked there. Would Sting put up a bit of money, he asked, to help find it? ‘But despite that, he could be teased about his views and never seemed offended. He was a very sweet country boy.’ Reg’s musical legacy is uncertain. It is difficult to tell how history will remember a lyricist capable of penning lines such as ‘A boy’s not a boy and a man’s not a man till he’s been with a girl like my Joanne’ and ‘My lady owns an oil well. Just one look, and you can tell.’ Appropriately, news of his death was made public by the Andover Advertiser after an American phoned from California having read an item on the Twitter account of former BBC sports commentator and outer-world obsessive David Icke.How David Icke - who knew Reg well - came by the news is a mystery. Perhaps Reg would have preferred to have been abducted by aliens and borne away in a celestial hearse. But his many friends and fans are grateful he died peacefully at home with his family nearby.","Legendary lead singer of The Troggs was fascinated by crop circles .

Toxic hip implants used in thousands of operations in Britain were sold by a company which knew for at least three years that they could be dangerous, it was claimed today. Johnson & Johnson subsidiary DePuy advertised ‘metal-on-metal’ hip implants despite a top surgeon allegedly telling one of the manufacturer’s executives in an email that they were causing problems. Tests found the hips failed after two and a half years far more regularly than other models - but they were continually marketed to British patients, despite them being suspected of poisoning the blood. Dangerous: An online warning by a U.S. law firm investigating the early failure of the hip implant. More than 10,000 patients in Britain were fitted with the implants, which are thought to wear down and cause issues . Hundreds of patients are now having replacements for the hips, which are intended to last for life, despite DePuy allegedly being continually warned about their impact, reported the Daily Telegraph. More than 10,000 patients in Britain were fitted with the implants, which are thought to wear down and cause potentially toxic metal to get into the bloodstream. They were taken out of use in 2010. Revelations over the warnings appeared in a court case in Los Angeles, looking at the compensation of patients, in which Loren Kransky, 65, is suing DePuy  for failing to warm him the hip could be faulty. In metal-on-metal implants, the ball and socket of the hip are replaced with metal instead of one or both being another material, like plastic or ceramic. It is deemed a failure if it has to be taken out. Pain: Company figures showed in June 2007 that the implants had a 90 per cent survival rate after two and a half years - which was relatively low in relation to other models (file picture) The faulty implant, known as an ASR device, was introduced to the UK in July 2003. It was one of a new generation of hip implants made from metal alone, rather than metal and plastic. The hip was supposed to last longer and prevent patients from losing too much tissue and bone when it was inserted. It was thought surgeons began reporting problems with the implant in 2007. But new documents alleged that Belfast orthopaedic surgeon David Beverland had been reporting problems earlier, and wrote to DePuy engineer Graham Isaac in May 2006 to discuss the problems. The next year Dr Beverland chose to discontinue use of the implants, reported the Daily Telegraph. Company logo: Johnson & Johnson subsidiary DePuy advertised 'metal on metal' hip implants despite a top surgeon allegedly telling one of the manufacturer's executives in an email that patients were suffering . Company figures showed in June 2007 that the implants had a 90 per cent survival rate after two and a half years - which was relatively low in relation to other models. But the firm looked at a new method for marketing the product with different data in March 2008 that gave a 99 per cent rate of success. One marketing manager called it a ‘game changer’. Patients had started returning to hospitals in pain in 2007. A research team in Newcastle found that the metal surfaces wore away, releasing tiny particles of chromium and cobalt into the body. These were absorbed into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues, causing inflammation, bone and tissue damage around the pelvis and, in severe cases, blood poisoning and benign tumours. A DePuy spokesman told Mail Online: 'Let me first emphasize that DePuy acted in the best interests of patients in deciding to voluntarily recall the ASR Hip System and in creating a program to address patient medical costs directly associated with the recall. 'DePuy believes the evidence will show the company acted appropriately and responsibly. At all times the company was looking out for patient interests by analyzing data on the ASR Hip System.' In February 2012 year the Medicines and Healthcare Products . Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  issued an alert to the NHS on a . wide range of 'metal on metal' implants, saying there was a ‘small risk’ they could cause . complications in patients. Hip replacements involve a ball, . socket and stem. The alert related to those whose replacements have a . ball with a diameter of 36mm or more. Around . 65,000 people in the UK have received metal on metal hip implants since . 2003, of whom 49,000 were given the ‘large-head’ implants. They were told they should have . annual tests on blood ion levels while those with symptoms will also . need annual MRI scans. Today, the MHRA told Mail Online: 'The majority of patients who receive metal on metal hip implants have well functioning hips and are at a low risk of developing any serious problems. 'We acted quickly in 2010 to alert healthcare professionals that patients with ASR implants need to be closely monitored following the recall of all ASR products in the UK by the manufacturer DePuy in August 2010. 'The MHRA is continuing to monitor the performance of all hip implants through the National Joint Registry and we work closely with our expert orthopaedic advisory group to ensure that patients are protected from unsafe hips. If patients have any concerns, they should speak to their orthopaedic surgeon.'","DePuy marketed metal-on-metal implants 'despite surgeon's warnings'

It has been revealed the Japanese firm which makes the lithium ion batteries for the troubled Boeing 787 Dreamliner also has a contract to supply batteries to the International Space Station. GS Yuasa Corp, which has its headquarters in Kyoto is the focus of an investigation by authorities in Japan and the U.S. into the cause of a fire on a Japan Airlines plane at Logan Airport in Boston earlier this month and an emergency landing by an All Nippon Airways jet last week. These issues caused the FAA to issue a rare emergency airworthiness directive, which led to the worldwide grounding of all 50 active Dreamliners that Boeing has delivered so far. Photo taken from a Kyodo News helicopter shows the headquarters building of GS Yuasa Corp. in Kyoto's Minami Ward yesterday on the day investigators arrived for their second visit . However, the lithium batteries that GS Yuasa supplies for the International Space Station are not the same as the one it makes for the Dreamliner, NASA spokesperson Josh Byerly said to Bloomberg. Byerly also said that NASA will not reconsider its contract with the Japanese firm until after the FAA investigation is complete. This comes as the Japanese transport ministry said that it will conduct a second probe into GS Yuasa Corp and also add Meggitt Plc, a British supplier to their investigation into the faults which have grounded the fleet. Officials spent the day at Yuasa's offices on Tuesday and said that a team is also being dispatched to the UK to speak to the maker of a valve actuator for the 787. The lithium batteries that GS Yuasa supplies for the International Space Station are not the same as the one it makes for the Dreamliner, NASA spokesperson Josh Byerly said to Bloomberg. A spokesman (center) for GS Yuasa Corp. meets the press outside the company's headquarters in Kyoto's Minami Ward yesterday . Because of the ongoing investigation, Boeing said last week that it will deliver no more of their multi-billion dollar Dreamliner aircraft until the lithium-ion batteries are deemed safe. GS Yuasa Corp is fully cooperating with the authorities, Yuasa spokesman Tsutomu Nishijima said. 'We’re checking parts and the manufacturing process to ensure work was carried out appropriately,' said Takano. A spokesman for GS Yuasa Corp, which makes batteries for the 787, said the company was fully cooperating with the investigation, and its engineers were working with the officials from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau (CAB) at the company's compound in Kyoto, where it makes airplane batteries. CAB official Tatsuyuki Shimazu told reporters the investigating team had been briefed by GS Yuasa and had toured the plant, looking at battery design, production and quality. The Japanese investigation at the plant will continue on Tuesday on a more detailed level, including tracking battery batch numbers and production dates, he said. Authorities around the world last week grounded the new lightweight Dreamliner, and Boeing halted deliveries after a problem with a lithium-ion battery prompted an All Nippon Airways 787 into the emergency landing at Takamatsu airport during a domestic flight. Culprit: The Boeing 787's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes, which may have caused this battery fire on a Dreamliner at Logan Airport, Boston on January 7 . Earlier this month, a similar battery caught fire in a Japan Airlines' 787 parked at Boston Logan International Airport. U.S. safety investigators on Sunday ruled out excess voltage as the cause of the Boston battery fire on January 7, and said they were expanding their probe to look at the battery's charger and the jet's auxiliary power unit. The battery is one part of the 787's complex electrical system, built by French company Thales SA. 'Results have shown the battery was abnormal in both the Boston and Takamatsu (incidents). They were the most damaged,' Shigeru Takano, a senior safety official at the CAB, told reporters ahead of the on-site visit to GS Yuasa. 'We will look into if the work that took place, from design to manufacturing, was appropriate.' Shares in GS Yuasa, valued at close to $1.5 billion, rose 1 percent on Monday, having dropped nearly 10 percent since the Boston fire. Both Japan and the United States have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns . The burned insides of the ANA battery showed it received voltage in excess of its design limits. However, a battery that caught fire in a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 in Boston earlier this month was found not to have been overcharged. U.S. government investigators said there could still be problems with wiring or other charging components. In Washington, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the 787, which has a list price of $207 million, would not fly until regulators were ""1,000 percent sure"" it was safe. Japan is the biggest market so far for the 787, with ANA and JAL operating 24 of the 290-seat wide-bodied planes. Out of service: One of United Airlines six 787s sits on the tarmac at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston . Touchdown: A Qatar Airways Dreamliner is seen coming in to land at the Farnborough International Airshow in July last year. The aircraft has been plagued with safety issues since entering commercial service in 2011 . Boeing has orders for almost 850 of the planes, which have the most complex electrical systems of any planes on the market. It remains unclear if the investigations will cause other airlines -- and military aircraft builder -- to rethink their plans to use lithium-ion batteries, which are lighter and more powerful than conventional batteries. Airbus plans to use similar batteries on its rival to the 787, the A350, which is due to make its maiden test flight in the middle of this year.","Japanese firm GS Yuasa Corp. provides the lithium batteries for the troubled Dreamliner aircraft .

"By . Patrick Strudwick . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:16 EST, 8 December 2012 . Long-jumper Greg Rutherford’s Olympic triumph, on ‘Super Saturday’, alongside his team-mates Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis, will come to define one of the greatest years in British sporting history. ‘This is what I’ve dreamt of my entire life,’ he told the BBC afterwards, voice cracking, as the sound of 80,000 cheers echoed around the stadium. The 25-year-old, dubbed the ‘ginger ninja’, perhaps had more reason than most to feel emotional. Britain’s first long-jump gold medallist since 1964 suffered years of agony as a result of repeated hamstring tears, which came close to ending his career. His recovery and remarkable return to form is thanks to a controversial treatment – first developed in the Thirties to combat decompression sickness suffered by deep-sea divers. In winning condition: Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford is on the track thanks to the oxygen treatment . Called Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT), the principle behind it is simple: deliver higher levels of oxygen to the body at double the normal atmospheric pressure and injuries heal faster. The effects can be felt within days and, as Greg discovered, are transformative – yet, astonishingly, while it is often offered to elite athletes, the NHS refuses to offer it as a treatment for everyday injuries. Greg was 16 when he first tore his hamstring – the three muscles that run up the back of the leg from the knee, enabling it to bend and straighten. About 6,000 Britons suffer similar damage to the soft tissues of the legs each year, but not all are sporting figures. Causes can range from obesity to car accidents. ‘It was at the European Athletics Junior Championships in Lithuania,’ Greg recalls. ‘I’d just launched into my jump and it popped. The pain is instant, really sharp and acute. As soon as I landed I knew it was bad and I wouldn’t be able to walk properly. I got up and had to be helped off the track, hobbling. From then on it spiralled into a never-ending cycle of tears and recovery.’ A hamstring strain occurs when one of the three muscles is stretched too far. It often happens in sports involving a lot of sudden stopping and starting, such as tennis and football. Hamstring injuries can range from a minor tear – muscles are made up of bunches of fibres, some of which can rupture if overstretched – to, more rarely, a complete break. Golden oxygen: Long-jumper Greg suffers from repeated hamstring tears and would not have had a career in athletics - let alone an Olympic gold - without HBOT . Injury is usually treated with rest, ice to reduce swelling, painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication along with leg elevation and stretching exercises. It can take up to ten weeks to recover fully, with severe cases that need surgery taking longer. Although one tear doesn’t necessarily leave you vulnerable to another, those playing sport regularly will always be more prone to them. By 2007, Greg was averaging five tears a year, needing up to eight weeks of recovery. The following year, in despair at the constant pain, he nearly quit athletics altogether, despite being in full-time training. ‘I’d be training, then have a tear, then recover for a while, then still be affected for another four weeks when I got back into training and then I’d tear it again. It got to a stage where I thought, “If this doesn’t change, I’m never going to  have a chance of winning at  the Olympics.” ’ He started looking for a job. ‘I was very frustrated. I thought I’d have to quit and do something else. I was looking  at any kind of sales work that would pay relatively well because I’d taken on  a mortgage.’ HBOT: Patient being taken into Hyperbaric chamber . WHAT IS IT?  Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment involves breathing pure oxygen while sitting in a sealed steel-and-concrete chamber. The atmospheric pressure inside is increased. Oxygen is usually delivered via a mask. Each session can take five hours and costs between £180 and £1,000. WHAT CAN IT TREAT? Although initially used only  on divers, by the Fifties the therapy was being used to treat carbon monoxide, cyanide and hydrogen sulfide poisoning. It  is now advocated for an array  of illnesses from strokes to multiple sclerosis (MS). HOW DOES IT WORK? Pressurised oxygen is dissolved into the blood and body cells, tissues and fluids at up to ten times the normal concentration, stimulating blood flow and healing tissue. WHO GETS IT ON THE NHS? Thousands of Britons with a variety of illness claim HBOT works where established drugs don’t, but the treatment is rarely offered on the NHS. Only patients with decompression illness get automatic funding. ARE THEY THE ONLY ONES? Conditions where funding  may be considered by the NHS included acute carbon-monoxide poisoning and diabetic foot ulcers.  For everything else, funding is denied. But his family and then girlfriend of eight years, Liz Rose, 24 – from whom he parted a fortnight ago – persuaded him to persevere. Determined not to let them down, he began looking for alternative treatments. United Kingdom Athletics (UKA) doctors were already aware of HBOT, and his new American coach, Dan Pfaff, had seen the effect on sportspeople in the US. It couldn’t have come too soon. Just a month before the World Championships in 2009 – and 12 days before the qualifying rounds – Greg pulled the tendon again. He started getting up at 5am every day to travel from his home town of Milton Keynes to the London Diving Centre, where his nearest HBOT chamber was housed. For Greg, the positive effects were almost instant. ‘You sit in a big metal tube, about 6ft wide and 5ft tall. It’s quite hot, but not unpleasant, as I’m OK in confined spaces. You breathe oxygen through a face mask. I would go in on my own but you can have others in there.’ After three days, he started to notice a difference in the way his knee felt. ‘The movement was better than it normally would be and after that it kept getting better. I couldn’t believe that something so simple as oxygen and pressure could be having this effect.’ Historic leap: The jump which got him his Super Saturday gold at the Olympic stadium this summer during the 2012 Games . Twelve days later, Greg sailed through the qualifying rounds for the World Championships and went on to break the British record for long-jump. ‘I was ecstatic,’ he says. ‘The relief was incredible. Finally, there was a solution to my problems and for the first time hope that maybe I could win gold at the Olympics.’ Although HBOT therapy means recovery time from such an injury is shortened to sometimes only ten days, it does not prevent further injury – and Greg has suffered four similar tears since. ‘It cuts down the recovery time by about 30 per cent for me. It’s still painful but for a shorter period. So now I can stay upbeat when it happens. I had my last tear in January and it was a relatively nasty one, but I remained positive, knowing I had a good chance at the Olympics.’ But evidence for HBOT is patchy, with studies showing its efficacy only in certain conditions and a randomised, double-blind controlled trial into its use in repairing adverse effects of radiotherapy by London’s Royal Marsden Hospital still ongoing. ‘It’s difficult to produce hard scientific data to back it up,’ says Dr Oliver Firth, a GP specialising in HBOT. ‘Because oxygen is so cheap, there aren’t the drug companies willing to sponsor trials into it.’ Around the world, HBOT is administered for an array of conditions including insomnia, burns, Lyme disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and liver disease. In this country, access may soon become much harder. ‘In the past it was a real postcode lottery,’ explains Dr Pieter Bothma, an NHS consultant in anaesthesia and medical director at the London Hyperbaric Chamber. ‘But currently there are discussions taking place within specialist commissioning groups for a nationwide system that will make access more uniform but will almost certainly limit availability to very few conditions. We know it helps heal damage caused by radiotherapy, for instance. But funding is so difficult to get that we have ended up offering some very burned patients treatment for free.’ Greg believes the treatment should be offered to more NHS patients, so they can benefit as he did. Thanks to speedier recovery and a change in his jumping technique, putting less strain on the hamstrings, his optimism was realised. After nine years battling against injury, he won Britain’s 13th gold medal, with a jump of 8m 31cm. ‘I always believed it was possible but finally, finally it came true,’ he says. ‘If only everyone had the same access to the treatment that I did. I was lucky.’","Olympic medallist Greg Rutherford credits success to oxygen treatment which helps him heal torn hamstrings at half the normal recovery time .

A taxi driver who picked up three murder suspects less than ten minutes after a 16-year-old was stabbed to death in central London could hold information key to the killing, detectives say. Police want to speak to the motorist who picked up the trio of youths in Hudson Place, Victoria, at 6.59pm on Sunday January 27. Nine minutes earlier, 16-year old Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir was chased and stabbed to death by a gang in nearby Lupus Street, Pimlico. Lead: Scotland Yard want to speak to the driver of this silver cab, who picked up three people nine minutes after the murder of teenager Hani Abou El Kheir in Pimlico, central London . Death: Hani Abou El Kheir, was stabbed shortly before 7pm on Sunday January 27 and despite the efforts of emergency workers and doctors he died in a south London hospital . The cab was a silver London taxi, which turned left onto Wilton Place after picking up the men. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Attewell of the Homicide and SeriousCrime Command [HSCC], appealed for the cabbie to come forward. He said: 'Just over a week on from the murder of HaniHicham Abou El Kheir the investigation team is working tirelessly to identify not only those we believe to be responsible for Hani’s deathbut any potential witnesses who will be able to assist us with our investigation. 'We are exploring numerous lines of enquires, with this latest development being one of them. I am appealing to the driver of the silver taxi seen in Hudson Place at 18:59 on that Sunday to comeforward. Horrific: The 16-year-old died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico, one of London's most affluent neighbourhoods, a week last Sunday evening . Grieving: Family members including Hani's mother Pauline Hickey, pictured with her hood up, lay flowers next to the scene where he was stabbed . 'Are you that taxi driver? Where did you drop the passengers off and did they discuss anything of significance whilst in the taxi? Hunt: Police believe the taxi driver being searched for could have vital information related to the death of Hani Abou El Kheir . 'I am also seeking the assistance of the wider taxi community. With a taxi rank close by there would have been other drivers who may have witnessed the suspects getting into the silver taxi. 'Did you see one of your colleagues pick up three people around this time or do you recognise the taxi? 'Despite it being a Sunday evening the area around Victoria Station was fairly busy and a number of people would have seen the three people getting into the taxi before it made its way towards Wilton Road. If you saw anything please do come forward and help us with our enquiries.' The taxi is possibly a T2 or T4 model with colour coded bumpers and black trim around the door and bumper. Nine people have been arrested in connection with the murder. One man, arrested on suspicion of murder last week, has been bailed until March. Four other men were arrested on Saturday on suspicion of murder. A man and three women have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. The scene of the murder has become a shrine to Hani's short life. A note from the victim's mother, Pauline Hickey, was left with flowers where he died. It read: 'My baby. My heart is broken. I love you so much, the pain is unbearable. Your loving mother.' Another tribute attached to a nearby bus stop was a copy of a touching note written by Hani to his mother, alongside a picture of him as a child. Investigation: A police forensics tent is pictured at the scene of the fatal stabbing in central London . It said: 'Thank you for being the best mum. Love to mummy, thank you for everything. Love from Hani.' The tribute was signed by relatives including the teenager's grandparents, and cousins in Ireland. The inquest, officially opened and adjourned by Coroner Jean Harkin officially, will resume at a later date once the police investigation has concluded. Any witnesses or anyone with any information should contact the incident room on 0208 345 3715 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Google’s chief executive has admitted his surprise that Apple has not sued the search giant. ‘It's extremely curious that Apple has chosen to sue Google's partners and not Google itself,' said Google CEO Eric Schmidt. He claimed he was trying to deal with the enmity between the two tech giants in an ‘adult’ way but that things were still strained. He also acknowledged that the public think they are like two angry teenagers taunting each other with the words: ‘I have a gun, you have a gun, who shoots first?' Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, has admitted the firm's relationship with Apple has soured to point the firms are 'throwing bombs at each other' One of the biggest current rows between the firms is over mapping software, after Apple decided to dump Google and create its own maps. However, the firm has struggled, and was forced to issue a humiliating apology to customers. Google is developing its own map app for Apple's gadgets, but has not revealed when it will be released. Relations between Google and Apple have been arctic long before the death of Apple founder Steve Jobs, who made it his personal mission to take down his rival. In his biography of Jobs, who died in October last year, Walter Isaacson revealed that once raged he would ‘go to thermonuclear war’ to get revenge for stealing Apple designs. Jobs supposedly said: ‘Our lawsuit is saying, 'Google you f****** ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us off. ‘I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40bn (£25bn) the bank, to right this wrong. 'I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product.’ More recently Apple stopped using Google Maps on the iPhone 5 and the new iPad and removed Google’s YouTube as an icon from the home screen too in an escalation of hostilities. Speaking to the Wall St Journal, Schmidt, who is Google’s executive chairman, said that over the past year things had been ‘on and off’ with Apple. He said: ‘Obviously, we would have preferred them to use our maps. ‘They threw YouTube off the home screen (of iPhones and iPads). I'm not quite sure why they did that. ‘The press would like to write the sort of teenage model of competition, which is, 'I have a gun, you have a gun, who shoots first?' ‘The adult way to run a business is to run it more like a country. ‘They have disputes, yet they've actually been able to have huge trade with each other. According to his biography, Steve Jobs vowed to 'spend my last dying breath' defeating Android, Google's mobile phone and tablet software. ‘They're not sending bombs at each other. ‘I think both Tim (Cook, Apple's chief executive) and Larry (Page, Google's chief executive) the sort of successors to Steve (Jobs) and me if you will, have an understanding of this state model. ‘When they and their teams meet, they have just a long list of things to talk about.’ Another twist to the Apple and Google row is the patent lawsuit that Apple brought against Samsung over its Galaxy 3S smartphone. Earlier this year a California jury awarded Apple $1bn (£622m) because they thought that Samsung had ripped off its designs. Lawyers for both companies used ripe language to accuse the other of theft with Apple alleging that Samsung ‘flagrantly copied’ its products. Observers have however suggested that the lawsuit was a ‘proxy war’ and that Apple may yet sue Google directly. Asked about the ongoing legal action, Schmidt said: ‘Apple and Google are well aware of the legal strategies of each other. ‘Part of the conversations that are going on all the time is to talk about them. ‘It's extremely curious that Apple has chosen to sue Google's partners and not Google itself.’","CEO Eric Schmidt admits firms are seen as squabbling teenagers .

It’s an impressive list of items - an original Harry Potter wand, breast implants, a bucket of live crabs, a pet python, a £10,000 Tiffany engagement ring and a set of four Power Rangers costumes. And all of them were left behind in Travelodge hotels last year, along with a winning EuroMillions ticket, a £50,000 Rolex watch, an 8ft pop-up spray tanning booth - and even a pantomime horse. More than 20,000 books were left behind in the budget chain’s 38,000 rooms - a third of which were Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James - and 200 Queen Elizabeth masks were found at a Windsor hotel. Forgotten: Four Power Rangers outfits (left) were left behind, as well as a £50,000 Rolex watch (file pictures) Dangerous: A guest left a bowl of live crabs (left) - and a pet python called Monty was forgotten (file pictures) The most common items left behind in Travelodge’s 527 hotels included phone or laptop chargers, clothes, teddy bears, toiletry bags, books, laptops or tablets, satnavs, mobile phones and suitcases. In the past year the hotel’s staff have reunited 76,500 forgotten cuddly bears with their owners, while other people left behind Bugatti keys, a stamp album worth £250,000 and London 2012 tickets. Also left behind were a trunk of Cadbury chocolate, a diamond-encrusted wedding ring, a Persian Chinchilla kitten, a suitcase of vinyl records, a pilot’s training manual and Joseph’s Dreamcoat. Other items were a pilot’s training manual, food processors, a spare car wheel, a box of old Liverpool FC match programmes, a script for a well-known TV soap and even a Wonder Woman outfit. Valuable: A wand used in the Harry Potter films (left, Daniel Radcliffe) and a £10,000 Tiffany ring (file pictures) Well-read: Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James (left) and a pantomime horse were also forgotten (file pictures) ‘Our lost and found departments provide plenty of revelations,’ a Travelodge spokesman said. ‘Our customers’ left-behinds demonstrate what a cross section of people stay in our 527 hotels. ‘What is becoming evident after speaking to customers is that the pace of life has become so fast and we are so eager to get from A to B that priceless processions are easily being forgotten.’ The next most popular books left behind after Fifty Shades Of Grey were The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, along with the same author’s hit The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets’ Nest. Fifty Shades Freed by Ms James was in fourth, ahead of Fifty Shades Darker in seventh. Fifth and sixth were The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and Mr Larsson’s The Girl Who Played With Fire. Some of the stories behind the lost items have been retold by staff - such as the Chinese tourist who left behind the trunk of chocolate in a Birmingham hotel after a trip to Cadbury World. The live crabs were left in a Brighton hotel by a guest staying over the night before a fish festival, and the python was left in Bristol by an owner who had given it the apt name of Monty. The pantomime horse was left in Leeds by a Cinderella actor, and a diamond-incrusted iPhone 5 was left in London by a customer who had bought the phone on the day it launched. On finding the device, she had 228 missed calls.

Capita is using text messages to tell people to leave the UK, but hundreds of people who received them have done nothing wrong . A bungling private contractor hired by the government to kick out illegal immigrants is using text messages to tell people to leave. Capita’s £30million contract is to be investigated by the data watchdog after bombarding hundreds of people with messages who are in the UK perfectly legally. Among those wrongly warned they must leave are nurses, British passport holders and several people who are not even in Britain. Critics warn that people receiving the text messages assume they are spam and delete them. The standard text message from Capita states: ‘Message from the UK Border Agency: You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain.’ They were sent out over the Christmas holidays. The company also uses phone, email or letter to warn people that UKBA records suggest they need to leave the country. Today the Information Commissioner launched an investigation into the bizarre tactic, amid complaints that UKBA is holding inaccurate and outdated data, in breach of the Data Protection Act. Alison Harvey, head of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, said: ‘In theory, this is a group of people who UKBA records show have no right to be in the UK and should leave. ‘In practice, I have seen British citizens getting these messages, I have seen people who have invested £1 million in the UK getting these messages, I have seen nurses getting these messages. ‘I have even seen people who left a couple of years ago getting these messages. I have spoken to people who have got in touch (with Capita) and then the texts and phone calls have carried on,’ she told the Today programme. The people being pursued are on a list of 174,000 who the authorities have lost track of - mostly overseas workers and students whose visas are believed to have expired. Home Secretary Theresa May has promised the Home Office will examine the case. The UK Border Agency said people wrongly told to leave the UK should ask Capita to update their contact lists . The number of people wrongly contacted could run into hundreds, some of whom were receiving several calls or messages a day. The Information Commissioner's Office is now investigating ‘what steps UKBA has taken to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act’. Home Secretary Theresa May has faced calls to investigate the problems . A spokesman said: ‘It's important that organisations make sure they are taking reasonable steps to ensure they comply with the Data Protection Act, including ensuring the personal information they hold is adequate, accurate, and where necessary, kept up to date.’ Julian Hupper, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, challenged Mrs May to investigate the problems. 'Capita has a contract with the UK Border Agency to clear the migration refusal pool and make sure that people leave the country when they are supposed to,' he told the Commons this week. 'However, as the Home Secretary will be aware, people who are allowed to stay have also been contacted and told to leave, including British citizens. 'Is this a problem with Capita or with the UK Border Agency’s continuing problems with its record keeping? What action will she take on the agency?' Mrs May said ministers would 'look at the processes that have been followed'. The UK Borders Agency said it was up to people who were wrongly contacted to get Capita to update their records. A UKBA spokesman said: ‘Out of thousands of people contacted by Capita, a small number have been found to have the right to be in the UK or an outstanding application. Anyone contacted in error has been asked to get in touch with Capita to update their records. ‘We are mindful of the importance of data protection and are in touch with the Information Commissioner's Office.’ A man for Capita later said the company had not been contacted by the ICO.","Data watchdog investigates use of out-of-date contact lists used by Capita .

A young girl who was diagnosed with kidney cancer after she fell off her bike on holiday, has celebrated overcoming the illness by flying like Peter Pan. Five year old Nikkita Mills, was enjoying a family holiday in France in August 2011 when she took a tumble. She was rushed to hospital after she developed internal bleeding. But . the accident turned out to be a blessing in disguise, when doctors treating her discovered she had a Wilms' tumour. Nikkita (pictured before treatment left), underwent a year of gruelling treatment for kidney cancer. She enjoyed a day at the pantomime (pictured right) where she met the cast and had a go at flying on a wire . Nikkita with Jennifer Ellison. Her father thanked all the cast at the Churchill Theatre for making the day special . Her father Adrian, 44, from Canterbury, said: 'That accident quite probably saved her life. 'Who knows how long it . would have been before we started noticing any signs she was unwell with . the tumour if it wasn't for that accident?' As soon as she arrived back in the . UK she started chemotherapy treatment at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London to shrink the tumour before having . surgery to remove it, along with her right kidney. She then started a . four week course of radiotherapy and a 36 week course of chemotherapy. During Nikkita's treatment she needed blood transfusions and platelet . therapy. She struggled with numerous infections and contracted E. Coli, which . resulted in her being hospitalised for a month. Nikkita enjoys a magical flying trip above the stage with Jennifer Ellison as Peter Pan (right) and Joanna Forest as Wendy (left) A form of kidney cancer that affects around 70 children in the UK each year. It most often develops in youngsters below the age of five. Wilms' tumours, also known as nephroblastomas, begins to develop when a baby is still growing inside their mother. However, it may not cause any symptoms until a few years after the child is born. Wilms' tumours usually only affect one kidney (unilateral) but in about seven out of every 100 children it can affect both (bilateral). Most Wilms' tumours are quite large when they are found - very often much bigger than the kidney itself. Fortunately, most of them have not spread to  other parts of the body. The most common symptom is a swelling in the abdomen, which is usually painless. Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can cause irritation in the area of the kidney, which may be painful. Children with the condition may have blood in their urine, or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a fever, upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite. However, the brave girl finished . treatment in September 2012 and last month her family received the fantastic news that she was in remission. She will continue to have regular check-ups but for now the gruelling rounds of treatment are over. Nikkita was able to celebrate the good news by flying like Peter Pan, thanks to a wish-granting charity. Last week she met the cast at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley led by actress Jennifer Ellison, before having a go on a practice swing. She then met Tinkerbell, played by CBBC presenter Gemma Hunt, who gave Nikkita her very own costume to fly in. Nikkita then took to the skies with Wendy and Peter Pan whilst the rest of the cast from the pantomime production of Peter Pan filled the stage to sing. She rounded off her fabulous day by watching the matinee performance of the show along with her mother Caterina, father Adrian and seven-year-old brother Minali. Mr Mills said the cast 'were all wonderfully attentive and made Nikkita feel very special. Thank you for giving Nikkita a memory that will shine above the memories of her long treatment.' Nikkita's day out was organised by the Make-A-Wish foundation.","Nikkita diagnosed with cancer as doctors find tumour after tumble off bike .

An aid package worth $50.5 billion has been approved for victims Superstorm Sandy after weeks of political wrangling. The House of Representatives approved the disaster relief for those devastated by the storm in a 241-180 vote. The Senate is expected to accept the measure early next week and send it to President Barack Obama, despite some Democratic concerns that the package does not do enough. Aid: The House of Representatives approved the $50.5 billion disaster relief package for those devastated by the storm in a 241-180 vote . Recovery: The Senate is expected to accept the measure but there have been concerns that the package does not do enough . Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: 'While the House bill is not quite as good as the Senate bill, it is certainly close enough.' The aid package was supported by House democrats in large numbers in the vote, but substantial Republican backing was needed before its passage in the Republican-controlled House. The victory has been tarnished by some who have complained that Congress approved tens of billions of dollars in aid within days of Hurricane Katrina but stalled for more than two months on Sandy aid. Sandy pounded several states in late October and has been blamed for 140 deaths and billions of dollars in residential and business property damage. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were hardest hit, with power outages and interruptions to public transportation causing the clamor for federal relief to begin almost immediately. Republican Rep. Peter King called the package an 'outstanding victory for the people of New York, New Jersey and Long Island'. Immediate: Obama previously called for House Republicans to vote on the Sandy aid 'without delay for our fellow Americans' But he added that 'it is unfortunate that we had to fight so hard to be treated the same as every other state has been treated'. House Democrats resisted most attempts by southern conservatives to reduce the measure or offset part of its cost through spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. Critics said the proposed cuts would crimp Pentagon spending as well as domestic accounts. Conservatives did succeed in stripping $150 million for Regional Ocean Partnership Grants and $9.8 million for rebuilding seawalls and buildings on uninhabited islands in the Steward McKinney National Wildlife refuge in Connecticut. The House measure includes about $16 billion to repair transit systems in New York and New Jersey and a similar amount for housing and other needs in the affected area. Boarded up: The package includes a number of measures, including $16 billion to repair transit systems in New York and New Jersey . Bare bones: The supports for the boardwalk that was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy can still be seen on the beach in the Rockaways . An additional $5.4 billion will go to the Federal Emergency and Management Agency for disaster relief, and $2 billion is ticketed for restoration of highways damaged or destroyed in the storm. The Senate approved a $60.4 billion measure in the final days of the Congress that expired on January 3 and a House vote had been expected quickly. But House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner unexpectedly postponed the vote in the final hours of the expiring Congress as he struggled to calm politicians unhappy that the House had just approved a separate measure raising tax rates on the wealthy. Boehner's delay sparked a public uproar, much of it from other Republicans like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who has lobbied Congress for aid. Delay: House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner unexpectedly postponed the vote . 'There's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims, the House majority and their speaker, John Boehner,' Mr Christie said on the day after the delay was announced. The Republican leadership brought legislation to the floor two weeks later under ground rules designed to satisfy as many Republicans as possible, while retaining support from Democrats eager to approve as much in disaster aid as possible. Congress has already approved a $9.7 billion increase in a fund to pay federal flood insurance claims, much of it expected to benefit victims of Sandy. Firsthand: Gov. Chris Christie comforting a woman whose home was damaged by Superstorm Sandy . The House-passed Sandy aid package does not include some projects that were in the Senate version and drew sharp fire from conservatives as unrelated to the storm. Not included in the House bill were a provision for $150 million for fisheries disasters that states such as Alaska and Mississippi could have shared and $188 million for an Amtrak expansion project that included new, long-planned tunnels from New Jersey to Penn Station in Manhattan. The House version has $1.1 billion more than the Senate bill to help repair storm-damaged highways.","Original vote was delayed outraging lawmakers who wanted relief money .

The scientist is shown telling a packed lecture theatre that he has discovered how to generate a super massive black hole, before being asked what he will do with the knowledge. The scene then cuts to Go Compare's opera singer - played by Wynne Evans - haranguing a couple in the street, before a black hole forms behind him and sucks him in.

A judge has criticised police for not prosecuting four thugs involved in a ‘vicious’ assault – allegedly because none of them speaks English. The French teenagers who descended on a man ‘like a pack of wolves’ were instead given fixed penalties and released. By contrast, a local man who was less heavily involved in the altercation was hauled to court and jailed. Jailed: Anthony Hilton has been sentenced to a sixteen week prison term while Frenchmen were given on the spot fines . The decision was criticised by the judge who accused the police of . ‘clearing their books with the minimum of effort’. District Judge John . Foster said: ‘It is extraordinary that the police decided to deal with . the others whose behaviour was more serious by issuing fixed penalty . tickets because, apparently, four of them did not speak English. ‘I cannot begin to understand how the police reached their conclusion.’ The allegation – denied by police – was made as Anthony Hilton, 22, . appeared in court over the incident in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. His . solicitor told the hearing he was ‘concerned as a council taxpayer’ over . the disparity in how those involved had been treated. District Judge John Foster who has slammed police for not prosecuting four French youths . District Judge Foster spoke out yesterday after being shown CCTV of the . incident showing the Frenchmen he described as ‘vicious cowards’ joining . in the attack. However, while Hilton was charged, the Frenchmen were given £80 fixed . penalty notices, along with a local woman. John Jones, representing . Hilton, said his client had retaliated after the unnamed victim hit him. ‘At no time did Mr Hilton expect the incident to develop in the way that it did,’ Mr Jones told Barnsley magistrates. ‘The others acted more seriously than Mr Hilton.’ Rose Carr, prosecuting, had described how Hilton, of Barnsley, had . punched the victim on the head and spun him on to the floor during the . incident in May. Hilton admitted threatening behaviour and failing to . surrender to bail and was jailed for 16 weeks. Tough punishment: Hilton, pictured with his girlfriend Gemm Kier, was the only one involved who was bought to court . After the case his mother, Gale, said: ‘He was not expecting to go to . prison. If the others have got off then it is harsh. Does the crime fit . the punishment?’ His girlfriend Gemma Keer, 23, claimed they had been leaving a nightclub . together when someone punched him for no reason. She said: ‘He knocked . him down and these French lads, who we didn’t know, came up.’ She claims that the Frenchmen said in broken English, ‘we saw what . happened before’, then waded in. She added: ‘Tony only threw one punch . but the French lads were really giving the guy on the ground a kicking.’ A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police denied language had been a factor . in the decision and said Crown Prosecution Service guidelines had been . followed. The Frenchmen, two aged 18, one 17 and one 16, had no previous convictions and were therefore fined, he insisted. The same applied to a 23-year-old woman arrested over the attack, . whereas Hilton had ‘extensive’ previous offences and was ‘heavily . involved’. The spokesman added: ‘Fixed penalty notices were not issued because of nationality or their ability to speak English.’ Hilton plans to appeal against his sentence.","'Vicious' French men walk away with on-the-spot fines while Englishman is sent to prison .

A hospital has admitted it was to blame for the death of a baby after a horrified mother was forced to point out to midwives that her baby wasn't breathing because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck. Gemma Peters, 26, was left in agony following a horrific labour at Russells Hall hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, where midwives failed to act despite her baby's head being stuck in the birth canal for 90 minutes. And when baby Brook was finally delivered, nurses placed her straight onto her mother's chest - where terrified Miss Peters had to beg nurses to help when she noticed her newborn wasn't breathing as the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck. Horrific experience: Gemma Peters, pictured with her partner Liam Greenfield, started experiencing problems during labour with her first child when the baby's head became stuck in the birth canal for 90 minutes . Tragic: Gemma Peters' daughter Brook's umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck and she wasn't breathing when she was finally born. Brook suffered severe brain damage and her life support machine was switched off three days after her birth on July 14, 2011 . Admitting fault: The Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust which runs Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, has admitted full liability for the errors that led to baby Brook's death . Medics then whisked her first born away to be resuscitated - but her daughter suffered huge brain damage. Her parents Miss Peters and Liam Greenfield, 30, from Dudley, West Midlands, were advised that nothing more could be done and the devastating decision was taken to switch off life support three days after she was born, on July 14, 2011. This week, the hospital has admitted full liability for the errors and delays which lead to Brook's death. Miss Peters said: 'I had a healthy . pregnancy and for everything to go so badly wrong at the end has been . very difficult to cope with. Expecting: Gemma Peters' pregnancy, pictured on a 20 week scan, had been perfectly healthy up until the birth . Stunned: New mother Miss Peters was forced to point out to nurses that her daughter wasn't breathing when they handed her over after the birth . Worst nightmare: Doctors managed to resuscitate Brook before telling heartbroken parents Miss Peters and her partner Liam Greenfield there was nothing more they could do to help their daughter . 'I went through a long, painful . labour and was totally exhausted.  i was terrified but the midwife was totally disinterested in me. 'The midwives told me my baby's head . was crowning and to keep pushing, but I did and nothing was happening. 'I had never had a baby before but I . pushed for more than an hour and a half and I instinctively knew . something wasn't right - I was really scared. 'This was my first labour and, like most first time mums, I put my . complete trust in the midwives who I thought knew best. 'When . we found out the extent of Brook's injuries, we were devastated. 'Agreeing to have her life support switched off was the hardest thing I have ever done.'  Mother Gemma Peters . 'At one point the midwife admitted . that she couldn't find the baby's heartbeat any more but just passed it . off, saying it was probably because my pelvic bone was blocking the . sound of the heartbeat. 'I had to trust her so I tried not to worry. I had been in labour for hours and was exhausted. 'She . didn't try to reassure me, or tell me what to do - my mum, Debbie, who . is a care support worker at the same hospital, and Liam, helped me get . comfortable. 'They were the ones reminding me to breathe and telling me it would be ok, while the midwife just stood there. 'When I finally gave birth, I was so relieved I had finally managed to deliver my baby. 'I . was so excited when they handed her over to me straight away, but when I . looked at her I could tell straight away that she wasn't breathing. I . felt sick, my emotions were all over the place. 'I could see the cord knotted around her neck - it looked like it had been strangling her. I started screaming: ""She's not breathing"", and suddenly someone came and took her off me. Tough decision: Three days after Brook was born, her parents made the heartbreaking decision to turn her life support machine off . 'All the midwives went with Brook, and I was left alone, terrified of what was happening. 'Liam . went to try and find out what was going on, and my mum looked after me . and helped clean me up, because there was no-one else there to do it. 'When . we found out the extent of Brook's injuries, we were devastated. She . was our first child, and we were so excited about becoming parents. 'Agreeing to have her life support switched off was the hardest thing I have ever done. Saying goodbye: Gemma Peters holds her baby daughter Brook one last time before doctors switched off life support . 'After . it was clear that Brook had substantial brain damage, the midwives all . avoided us. No-one came to see if we were alright, or look after us.' Miss Peters, who now . has an eight-month-old daughter with partner Liam, an engineer, says . she hopes that maternity services have since been improved so no other . mother has the same experience. She added: 'I am so angry about what happened. This was my first labour and, like most first time mums, I put my . complete trust in the midwives who I thought knew best. 'Their mistakes led to us being . robbed of our beautiful baby girl and although the hospital has . apologised, nothing can turn back the clock. 'If I could give advice to . any other expectant mum, it would be to make sure the midwife regularly . checks your baby's heartbeat during labour and insist on a second . opinion if necessary because things can go wrong at the last minute. 'I wish I'd had someone there to tell . me this. 'My daughter Millie is now eight months old, and it breaks my heart she will never know her big sister. 'I just want to make sure this doesn't happen ever again - no-one deserves to go through what I did. 'I can only hope that the Trust has improved maternity services . so that no other family has to go through the heartache that we have.' Medical law experts have criticised the midwives' 'wait and see' attitude that lead to Brook's death. Lawyers from Irwin Mitchell law firm instructed by the couple found that midwives at Russells Hall Hospital failed to correctly monitor Brook's heart rate or call a doctor for help when no heart beat could be found. Following legal action, the Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has admitted full liability for the errors which led to Brook's death. Family: Gemma Peters and her partner Liam Greenfield now have a baby daughter called Millie. Miss Peters says it breaks her heart she will never be able to meet her big sister Brook . Jenna Harris from Irwin Mitchell's . Birmingham office, who specialises in birth claims, said: 'This is a . tragic case and Gemma and Liam understandably remain completely . devastated by the death of their first child. 'The trust has admitted that the care . Gemma received from their midwives fell well short of acceptable . standards. They agreed with our medical expert's view that, as the birth . was taking longer than expected and attempts to listen to the baby's . heart were unsuccessful, the midwives should have called for urgent . medical help. 'Had they . done so it would have become apparent that Brook was in distress, . earlier delivery would have resulted and on balance Brook would have . survived. 'Although the . trust has now admitted liability they need to now reassure patients . that the problems identified have been acted upon and that the midwives . concerned have been retrained so that no other parents suffer such . unnecessary tragedy.'

He said: 'I feel very happy but also worried about their health and how we’re going to cope financially. 'We thought Salud was going to give birth to five children so the sixth caught us by surprise.

A woman who demanded help with carving a turkey and another who suffered cuts after climbing on to a photocopier, are just two of the ludicrous cases that staff have faced at Christmas, according to the NHS. The bizarre anecdotes were revealed as part of a campaign to encourage revellers to use A&E wisely over the festive period. They have released a series of videos that have actors showing some of the reasons why some people attend hospitals at this time of year. What a turkey: One of the NHS videos reveal how one woman went to A&E at Christmas to try and get help carving her bird . In one video, two men play a drinking game in an A&E cafe after bringing in their friend to see if staff can remove the word 'd***' from his forehead, which has been written in permanent ink. Another shows a woman bringing in a huge frozen turkey in the hope staff can perform the 'public service' of using a powerful medical saw to cut it up. There is also a shot of a woman being wheeled past on all fours after sitting on a photocopier at the office party, causing the glass to break and embed itself in her bottom. One of the video’s stars is Noorul Choudhury, a former contender on BBC1’s The Apprentice. Around 40 per cent of all A&E attendances are for alcohol-related injuries and illnesses, according to experts, with the figures rising dramatically over the Christmas and New Year period. Festive parties make the last Friday night before Christmas notorious as the busiest shift of the year for 999 teams. But experts are expecting two 'mad Fridays' this year - December 16 and 23 - because Christmas Day falls on a Sunday. Regret: Drunken pranks can lead to long queues in A&E . The videos have been commissioned and co-ordinated by NHS North West. Dr Mike Cheshire, medical director at NHS North West, said: 'These comedy films support Choose Well, a national campaign which encourages people to think carefully about their condition before they go to A&E. 'As many as one in four people who go to A&E units could use alternative facilities like pharmacies or GP surgeries, or don’t need any kind of treatment at all. 'These unsuitable attendances cost the NHS around £100 million every year. 'At Christmas, paramedics and A&E staff are under their most severe pressure. 'Patients continue to call on them unnecessarily, while those with avoidable injuries caused by excessive drinking make the waiting rooms very busy. 'At the same time, NHS staff are working hard to treat those with serious respiratory problems caused by the cold weather, as well as victims of accidents on icy roads and pavements.' He said he hoped the videos would encourage people to drink sensibly at their Christmas and New Year parties. 'We all like to let our hair down at Christmas, but no-one wants to end up in pain from a drink-related injury when they should be enjoying their time off with friends and families.' Derek Cartwright, director of emergency services for North West Ambulance Service, added: 'We are asking party-goers to drink responsibly and stay safe whilst out enjoying themselves during the festive period. 'The Friday before Christmas is always the busiest night of the year for the ambulance service, and this year we have two. 'We often see an increase in alcohol-related calls at this time of year, many of which can be avoided. 'In genuine life-threatening emergencies, time matters. 'If people stop and think about drink this Christmas and take a sensible approach, they can play their part in ensuring ambulance crews are free to attend to vulnerable and very poorly people.'","Around one in four people who go to A&E units could use alternative facilities, say doctors .

Ageism in the NHS is stopping some older cancer patients getting the best treatments, a charity has warned . Ageism in the NHS is stopping some older cancer patients getting the best treatments, a charity has warned. Nearly half of specialist cancer medics believe that age discrimination by health professionals is resulting in older cancer patients not getting the best treatment, a poll by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests. And 45 per cent of 155 GPs, oncologists and specialist cancer nurses surveyed said they have dealt with a cancer patient who has been refused treatment on the grounds that they were too old. Macmillan said the UK has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe for older people. To ensure treatment decisions are not based on age alone, patients overall physical and mental wellbeing should be assessed when considering cancer treatment, the charity said. Ciaran Devane, chief executive at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'Health professionals' concerns about the prevalence of age discrimination in cancer care mustn't be ignored. 'Unless staff are given the time and training to carry out a proper assessment of a patient's overall physical and mental wellbeing, some patients will be unfairly written-off as ""too old"" for treatment. 'The right practical support, whether it's transport or help with caring responsibilities must also be put in place so older people needing treatment can actually take it up. To ensure treatment decisions are not based on age alone, patients overall physical and mental wellbeing should be assessed . 'The number of older people (aged 65 and over) living with cancer in the UK is set to rocket in the next 20 years from 1.3 million to 4.1 million. 'Unless the barriers to timely treatment are tackled now, many older people could die unnecessarily from cancer and services will become unaffordable.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'It is shocking and wrong to deny people treatment just because of their age, which is why we have made it illegal. 'However, we agree that more still needs to be done to improve treatment for cancer patients over 70 - which is why we worked with Macmillan on this report to understand how to address this. 'Our ambition is to be the best in Europe for cancer care and we are committed to improving survival rates. To achieve this, we are investing more than £750 million over four years to improve cancer services and outcomes.'","Half of cancer doctors believe ageism in the NHS means older patients do not get the best treatment .

The family of Muhammad Ali is embroiled in a bitter feud over the former heavyweight boxing champion as his life slips away, his brother claimed yesterday. Rahman Ali said his sister-in-law Lonnie has cut off the sporting legend from his family and is  ‘draining’ him as his mental and physical faculties are eroded by Parkinson’s disease. The boxer’s brother lives in poverty in a small flat in his family’s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, where Muhammad Ali owns one of his three mansion homes. He said he and his family had been barred from visiting the three-time heavyweight world champion and could only speak to him on the phone. ‘We’ve all been pushed out. The only time I get to see him is at public events,’ said Mr Ali, himself an ex-boxer.  ‘She and her family are draining him. It’s so sad. There’s nothing I can do, they’ve blocked us all off.’ He said his 71-year-old brother was so crippled by Parkinson’s, the degenerative brain condition that has afflicted many ex-boxers, he might not survive until the summer. ‘My brother can’t speak – he doesn’t recognise me. He’s in a bad way.  He’s very sick,’ he told a Sunday newspaper. ‘It could be months, it could be days.’ Mr Ali, 69, who retired from boxing after suffering several strokes, said he last saw his famous brother in July last year at the Sports for Peace Gala in London.

Don’t . cry for me, I’m in no pain.’ He also claims that his brother, . estimated to be worth more than £50million, told him he had set up a . trust fund for him. But his sister-in-law had ‘put a stop to it’. Rahman Ali added that Ali’s nine children were also having trouble getting hold of their father. He said the closest they get is when Lonnie puts him on the phone, although he is only able to breathe down the line.

Rudolph Clay – were the only two children of poor parents, who worked as . a billboard painter and a household domestic.

Hundreds of gun owners are exchanging their firearms for gift cards to buy groceries in Los Angeles in a buyback program aiming to get weapons off the streets. Lines of cars and people stretched around the block in the first hours of the exchange on Wednesday morning to take advantage of a guns-for-groceries exchange program that was moved up in the wake of the Connecticut school shooting. Police officers filled bins with a variety of rifles and handguns outside the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Van Nuys Masonic Temple. Scroll down for video . Firearm exchange: Hundreds of motorists waited inside their cars to drop off their firearms at a buyback program in Los Angeles that offered grocery store gift cards in exchange . Enthusiastic turnout: A police officer watches over a long line of cars waiting to turn in their weapons at the gun buyback held by the Los Angeles Police Department . In the first hours they reported netting nearly 500 fire arms and 31 assault weapons between both LA locations. 'No ID checks, we're not taking down license plates, people drive up, they have a gun in their trunk, we have one of our gun experts take that gun out, make sure it's safe, they walk over, get a gift card, and away they go. It's very quick and painless,' Police Cmdr Andrew Smith told CBS Los Angeles. Handguns, rifles and shotguns could be exchanged for $100 Ralphs grocery store gift cards. Assault weapons earned a $200 card. Officials were mindful of both the massacre of students and teachers in Newtown, Connecticut, as well as a gunman's ambush that killed two firefighters in Webster, N.Y. on Christmas Eve. Well received: A police officer walks away with three rifles received by the program that had already pulled in hundreds of firearms in the first hours . Tragic inspiration: Police officers load bins containing guns onto a truck during the gun buyback whose date was moved up after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School earlier this month . Positive effect: Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired . 'All of us are still mourning the . tragedy at Newtown, Connecticut,' said Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 'So . many young innocent children were mass-murdered in the way that they . were, and now the assassination of two firefighters ... just breaks the . heart of so many of us, particularly in this holiday season.' The program was originally scheduled for May but in wake of the December 14th shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary, Mr Villaraigosa decided to do it now. The last buyback program netted about 1,700 guns. Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired according to police. Process: When drivers pulled up the unloaded weapons would be removed from their trunks by gun inspectors before they were taken away and a gift card presented in exchange . Worth: A police officer inspects one of the guns where automatic weapons would receive a $200 grocery store gift card and shotguns, handguns and rifles $100 gift cards . Argument: A report by the National Academy of Sciences in 2004 argued that exchanges like this one typically collect weapons least likely to be used in criminal activities . Commorah Fisher, a participant in the . program earlier in the day, was asked what inspired her to stop by with . her weapons. She had this to say to CBS: . 'To . turn in some ammunition, and guns that may be stolen from our house and . you know someone may do something really bad with them. And that's why . I'm turning them in.' In 2004 a report by the National Academy of Sciences, however, argued the exchange's positive effect on gun violence. It found: 'the theory underlying gun buyback programs is badly flawed and the empirical evidence demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these programs' They argued that the majority of guns received are those least likely to be used in criminal activities.

The ex-wife of NBA star Lorenzen Wright, who was murdered in mysterious circumstances in 2010, has spent almost all of the $1 million life insurance policy he took out on himself six months before his death. Court documents revealed this week in Shelby County, Tennessee, show how Sherra Wright, 41, lavishly spent $973,000 of the settlement within 10 months of receiving it - even though the money was designated to support the couple's six children. The fast and furious spree included $11,750 for a trip to New York, $69,000 on furniture and a $7,100 deposit on a swimming pool - causing a legal battle to be set off this week between Wright and her father-in-law over what's left in the estate of the Memphis basketball legend - who earned more than $55 million during his career. Scroll Down for Video . Sherra Wright, the ex-wife of slain NBA basketball player Lorenzen Wright, grieves at the casket of Wright during a memorial service at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee, in August 2010 . NBA star Lorenzen Wright was found murdered at . the age of 34 in Memphis, Tennessee and his wife Sherra Wright, 41, is . now involved in a legal battle with his father over his sons estate . As part of Permanent Parenting Plan filed in January 2010 as part of her divorce against Lorenzen Wright, Sherra demanded that he take out a $1 million life insurance policy for the benefit of his sons and daughters in the event of his death. The divorce was finalized in February . 2010 and in July, Wright, who was 34 at the time of his death was found . in a deserted area of southeast Memphis riddled with gunshots - the . murder remains unsolved almost three years later. Records . show that Sherra spent $32,000 on a Cadillac Escalade, $339,000 to buy . and improve a new house, $5,000 for lawn equipment, $180,000 in property . expenses, $2,273 on 'spring outfits for girls' and almost $2,000 on . birthday party and gifts for 'Lorenzen Jr.' The . spending report has triggered Lorenzen's father, Herb Wright, to launch . a legal battle for control of his grandchildren's inheritance. 'She . had no authority to spend that money like that,' said Ruby Wharton, . Herb Wright's attorney to the Memphis Commercial Appeal. However, . records show that Sherra Wright has spent the majority of the money on . her children - a 5,300 square-foot-home, purchased in June is titled in a . trust for her four sons and two daughters. $339,000 on new property which she placed in her children's name . $32,000 for a Cadillac Escalade: . $26,000 on a Lexus . $11,750 for a lavish trip to New York City . $7,500 for a new swimming pool as a deposit . $69,000 for new furniture in her home . $5,000 for a motorized lawnmower . The spending report, filed in September but only just now released publicly, caused Shelby County Probate Judge Robert S. Benham to begin investigation into the living circumstances of Wright's children. The judge has also re-directed the $184,000 in death benefits the NBA pays out to the children and placed it under the control of Herb Wright for the benefit of the six kids - but froze the assets for the duration of the legal fight. Countering the freezing of the NBA money, Sherra Wright has argued in legal filings that Herb wright has a history of mismanagement of his son's finances and recounted testimony in which he reportedly said last fall that he had 'no particular experience' in financial management and his involvement 'had been limited to writing checks and paying bills, at his son's direction.' 'He denied ever writing any checks from the account to himself or for his benefit, and he denied ever misappropriating any of his son's funds,' said Sherra Wright's attorney Aubrey L. Brown in the released court filings. Herb Wright and Sherra Wright's multi-million dollar legal fight has become public after a court revealed new details about the NBA widow's extravagant spending . 'He admitted that his son had discharged him and he had therefore ceased handling any of his son's financial matters before his son's death.' However, despite the extravagant spending, the legal documents reveal that Sherra Wright and her children remain financially solvent, listing nearly $1.4 million in 'assets on hand' including significant investment properties in Arkansas. At the time of his death, Wright was operating under a child support order requiring him to pay $16,650 a month in child support and another $10,000 a month in alimony, for a total of $319,000 a year. The concerns over the spending stem back to the Permanent Parenting Plan that was filed in January 2010 along with Sherra Wright's divorce suit against Lorenzen Wright. The divorce came through in February 2010 and on July 28th, Wright's decomposed body was discovered in southeast Memphis showing evidence of being shot multiple times. Lorenzo Wright (42) was found dead on July 28th in Memphis after going missing nine days previous. At the beginning of the investigation Sherra Wright was a person of interest for the police - his murder is still unsolved . All State Insurance honored the policy 14-months ago in September 2011 and records reveal that her spending rocketed just one month after that. While the death of Wright is still shrouded in mystery, at the time of the August 2010 of Lorenzen Wright, neighbors reported that Sherra Wright was seeemingly obsessed with money. 'She wouldn't talk in the house,' said neighbor Patricia Coleman. 'She would walk up and down the street and scream and holler. Neighbors would call and ask what's going on? She was always saying she needed money.' In the aftermath of the case, Sherra became a person of interest for the police. Homicide detective in Memphis searched her home over the summer of 2010 and focused on a fire pit in her backyard that was lit on July 19th - the night that Lorenzen Wright disappeared. Patricia Coleman remembers seeing Sherra Wright in the back 'with another man'. Coleman told the New York Daily News, 'I thought it was strange because it was like one of the hottest days of the year.'","Sherra Wright spent $973,000 in the ten months since receiving her murdered husband's life insurance settlement .

Sarah was told by hospital staff that the 34-year-old had suffered ‘serious head injuries’ and she was encouraged to get to the hospital as soon she could. According to The Sun Sarah then had to travel three hours from Surrey to the hospital in Derby, with no clue what state the father of her two daughters would be in. Upset: Sarah Burge, who is the mother of Dean's twins had to wait three hours to find out how he was . A source told the newspaper: ‘She had no idea what she would find when she finally arrived.’ On Friday evening Dean was reported as being ‘stable’ and had regained consciousness, however he was still on a drip and receiving morphine for his pain. His state meant he was unable to talk to Sarah or his parents, who have remained by his bed since the injury occurred. The Sun reports that the couple’s 16-year-old twins Chloe and Charlotte are being looking after at home by Sarah’s parents.

The 34-year-old, best known for playing hapless street cleaner Robbie Jackson in EastEnders for a decade, was driving home after performing in the Agatha Christie thriller A Murder Is Announced at Derby Theatre. Father-of-two Gaffney crashed into the central reservation while driving along the A38, and was rushed to hospital in a  critical condition before being stabilised.

Former policewoman Nicola Coe, . eight months pregnant with her fifth child, falsely claimed nearly £9,000 in housing and council tax benefits while she was on long term paid sick leave . A policewoman fiddled nearly £9,000 in housing and council tax benefits while she was on long term paid sick leave. Nicola Coe, 39, admitted dishonestly claiming the cash when she was signed off work from Suffolk Police and had her wages slashed. The disgraced officer, who is eight months pregnant with her fifth child, quit the force after it launched a disciplinary hearing into her conduct. Coe, of Ipswich, was given a 12-month community order yesterday after she admitted three charges relating to falsely claiming housing and council tax concessions. Two other similar charges were not pursued as the benefits cheat appeared at South East Suffolk magistrates court, Ipswich. Mandy Ford, prosecuting for Ipswich Borough Council, said Coe first claimed benefits on July 9, 2009. She was living in a rented home in the town at the time under her maiden name, along with three dependent children. Coe was given cash support because she was a long-term sick absentee from Suffolk Police and her income had been cut, magistrates heard. But the crook failed to declare on her application form that she was being paid through a police officers' insurance scheme. As a result the mother-of-four was not entitled to concessions for housing or council tax. If the council had known Coe was receiving insurance money it would not have given her the benefits, the court heard. She then also dishonestly completed another claim form, on February 2, 2010, despite still receiving insurance payments. Coe also made a claim backdated to November 19, 2009. Coe (picture left and right outside court) was given benefits because her income had been cut on long-term sick leave, but she failed to declare she was being paid through a police officers' insurance scheme . Her scam was only finally exposed when council staff contacted police to check her payment records. The shamed officer  - who pocketed about £8,800 altogether - has just started paying her ill-gotten gains back at £15-£20 a week. John Hughes, defending, said the police cuts salaries by half when an officer has been off ill for six months, and the force stops payments entirely after a year. Mr Hughes said: 'She had significant ill-heath and admissions to Addenbrooke's Hospital. 'In 2009 Mrs Coe had serious problems and was in and out of Addenbrooke's five times in the preceding year. 'She was in a lot of difficulties with ill health and three dependent children.' He said Coe, who had been based at Martlesham police headquarters, thought she had told the council of her insurance payments when she made her claims. As well as her 12-month supervised community order, she was ordered to pay £150 costs. Police spokesman Richard Jones said: 'Suffolk Police can confirm that the Professional Standards Department was contacted by Ipswich Borough Council in October 2011 in relation to a serving police officer who had allegedly committed offences under the Fraud Act.'","Nicola Coe admitted dishonestly claiming cash while signed off work from Suffolk Police .

"By . James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 06:41 EST, 15 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:10 EST, 16 January 2013 . Radical changes to pay and conditions for police have been announced in a bid to cut costs . Police reacted with anger yesterday after their starting salary was slashed to below that of a trainee manager at McDonald's. Theresa May backed a package of controversial reforms which will see new recruits earn a minimum of £19,000-a-year – a cut of £4,000. The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said the cut was 'ill-conceived and fails to reflect the dangers and demands inherent in the job'. There was also widespread anger on social media sites used by officers. One wrote on Twitter: 'McDonalds starting salary £21.5k…' The Home Secretary's decision is based on an overhaul of police pay and conditions proposed by the ex-rail regulator Tom Winsor. The ideas were then considered by the Police Arbitration Tribunal last year. Mrs May said she accepted the tribunal's recommendation that the salary for recruits with no experience, such as school-leavers, should be cut by 17 per cent, to £19,000. Older recruits with relevant experience, such as a period as a special constable, will earn £22,000 a year. New recruits in London will earn a minimum of £21,000, which could rise to £25,500, if they live in an expensive part of the capital. Controversially, if officers work for the Met, but travel in from counties such as Hertfordshire or Cambridgeshire, they may not receive the full entitlement of 'London weighting' for the first time. The final decision, which could mean two PCs doing the same job earning different sums, will rest with the Met. Mrs May also accepted plans to introduce a national on-call allowance of £15 for each daily session that rank-and-file officers are on-call on days off from April 2013. The cuts will mean new recruits will start on a salary of £19,000 - a drop of £4,000 . But . competence-related threshold payments – a bonus available to those who . are at the top of the pay scale and can demonstrate they are strong . performers – will be phased out over the next three years. These . 'grab-a-grand' payments were worth up to £1,200-a-year. Home Secretary Theresa May insisted the government's police and crime reforms were 'working' Plans . to allow police forces to sack under-performing officers remain on . hold. A decision will be taken later this year, after further . negotiations. Recruits will earn less than newly . qualified teachers, who are paid £21,588 outside London, and nurses, who . get £21,176 outside the capital – although most of these have a degree. In London, comparisons were drawn . between the maximum of £25,500 paid to a newly-qualified officer, and . the £45,000 paid to a driver starting work on the London Underground. Several officers pointed to the . difference between the police service and McDonald's, which pays a . trainee manager between £18,500 and £21,500. In a statement, Mrs May said the . reforms were part of a programme to 'modernise police pay and . conditions, so that they are fair to both officers and the taxpayer'. She added: 'The Government's reform programme is working – crime is . falling and public confidence is high.' Steve Williams, national chairman of . the Police Federation, said it was 'disappointed' by some of the . recommendations of the Police Arbitration Tribunal, but accepted that . Mrs May's decision was binding on the federation. But Ian Hanson, chairman of the . federation's Greater Manchester branch, said: 'We are now in the . ridiculous situation whereby police community support officers are paid . more than police officers starting in the job.'","Theresa May backs radical reform of pay and conditions .

Scam: Children are unwittingly downloading fake versions of popular apps like Angry Birds that charge £15 each time they are used . Children who downloaded a rogue version of the hugely popular Angry Birds game to their smartphones and tablets were hit by a £15 charge every time they opened it. Details have been revealed by industry regulators amid evidence tech firms are targeting children who are unwittingly running up massive bills. Some youngsters are generating bills of more than £500, which are charged to their mobile phone accounts or their parents’ credit cards. PhonepayPlus, which regulates paid for mobile phone content, has seen a 300per cent increase in complaints related to children and app downloads in the past year. Computer game apps such as Angry Birds and Minecraft, are proving enormously popular with youngsters – often replacing traditional toys. Legitimate tech companies offer free game downloads to youngsters, which fire up their interest and get them hooked. However, they then try and cash in by selling coins or other types of currency, through so-called in-app purchases, to be used in the game. These charges are automatically applied to a credit card that a parent has linked to a particular account with Apple’s iTunes store, which offers thousands of apps, or similar web services. Some rogues have tried to cash in on popular games by creating their own unauthorised versions that plant so-called malware on to smartphones and tablets. A spokesman for PhonepayPlus said: ‘In one case, children as young as 11 years old downloaded free versions of popular games from the Android app store such as Angry Birds, Assassin’s Creed and Cut the Rope. ‘These fake apps charged £15 to the user’s phone bill every time the app was opened without the user’s knowledge.’ Opportunist: The firms are exploiting the popularity of Angry Birds, a wildly successful downloadable game . The watchdog has also found that companies are using social media sites, such as Facebook, which are accessed via smartphones and tablets, to con children and their parents out of money. It said: ‘In one case a 14 year old girl was tricked into paying for virtual credits in a game when a social media ‘friend’ said she had no credits to phone her dying grandmother.’ In another case, children between 12-14 year olds were tricked into ‘sharing’ and ‘liking’ a promotion for supermarket vouchers from Tesco and Asda on Facebook. The promotion spread to thousands of youngsters and misled them into taking part in a premium rate competition. More than 89,000 youngsters were taken in by the scam, which meant they were charged £5 every time a trivia question was sent to their phone. Fraud: In one case 89,000 children were charged £5 a text message as part of a fake promotion . The use of the famous name supermarkets helped convince the children that the promotion was legitimate, however the stores had nothing to do with the scam. In that case, the two companies responsible for the promotion were fined a total of £450,000 and ordered to make refunds to victims of the con. Apple operates a password system on its iPhone and iPads, which should allow parents to block in-app purchases. Parents can also block any payments by changing the settings, however many are unaware of this. These same protections do not exist with other devices and app download sites. Last year, six-year-old Jake Sadler, spent £1,000 playing Zombie Takeover, which was free to download - on his mother's iPad. His parents only discovered the problem after receiving a call for their bank's fraud team who had concerns with 'unusual activity' on their account. Jake's mother Gemma, 31, a nursing support assistant, from Portsmouth, said: 'We had no idea the money was even going out of our account until the fraud squad at the bank rang us. 'And when we looked at our bank account and found such a large amount of money missing I felt absolutely sick.' The chief executive of PhonepayPlus, Paul Whiteing(correct), said: ‘Connected devices will define the age in which today’s children live and we are determined to ensure that they can receive the benefits while being protected from the risks. ‘Smartphones in children’s pockets can burn holes in parent’s wallets, so we are working with partners across industry and other agencies to prevent this.’ It advises parents to ask their mobile network what controls are available to block risky services.

A choirmaster groomed a pupil at a leading private school and raped her while his wife watched, a court heard yesterday. The teenager was allegedly tied to a bed with a belt before Michael Brewer was told by his wife Hilary to ‘show her what he’d done to her’ during their two-year teacher-pupil affair. The pair, both 68, are on trial over sex offences dating back more than 30 years. Trial: Today Michael Brewer appeared at Manchester Crown Square Crown Court charged with rape and six counts of indecent assault following a police investigation along with his wife Hilary Brewer . Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, told . the court Brewer was a brilliant and charismatic teacher whose only . problem was he ‘could not keep his hands off’ the girls at Chetham’s . School in Manchester. He allegedly used his office there to initiate sex acts with the pupil, beginning in 1978 when she was 14. He also indecently assaulted her in a . camper van he kept parked at school and at his home when she helped . babysit his daughters, Manchester Crown Court was told. The alleged abuse culminated when she . visited the couple at home aged 18 and was told Mrs Brewer knew of the . affair. Mrs Brewer is said to have told the teenager ‘she had always . wanted a sexual relationship with a woman’ and that the girl ‘owed her’ because of what had happened with her husband. The girl was taken upstairs and forced . to take part in a sex act by Mrs Brewer, who displayed a ‘great . thrill’, said Mr Cadwallader. She was loosely tied to a bed using a . belt, the jury was told, before Mrs Brewer told her husband to ‘show her . what he’d done’ to her, and the pair had sex. Brewer went on to target at least two more girls, the court was told, one of which resulted in a sexual affair. Prestigious: Brewer was director of music at the renowned Chetham's School in Manchester until 1994 . Court hearing: The charges relate to the alleged abuse and rape of a teenage girl . The first, a boarder at Chetham’s at . the same time as the alleged victim, was said to have been propositioned . during a school trip when she was 17. Brewer pinned her up against the wall . in a dark corridor and told her ‘You want it really, don’t you?’, Mr . Cadwallader said. But she told him to ‘**** off’, ducked out of the way . and ran back to her dormitory, he said. Around 15 years later, in the . mid-1990s, Brewer allegedly groomed a 16-year-old, first giving her . ‘platonic’ hugs in his office before moving on to kisses. Eventually he began helping to take . off her top and suggesting she perform a sex act on him, the court . heard. But one evening principal Peter Hullah knocked on Brewer’s door . and heard ‘scuffling’.Brewer called out ‘Wait a minute’ and, when Mr . Hullah was allowed in, the girl could be seen exiting by a second door. Following an inquiry that year, 1994, Brewer resigned. The trial was told the original . alleged victim later told several people of her affair with Brewer but . never directly complained to police. However three decades on she told a . doctor who did inform detectives, resulting in the now divorced . couple’s arrest. The court heard the former pupil – now 48 – had been a hugely gifted musician. But she was also a disruptive, . badly-behaved teenager who used alcohol from a young age and had been . sexually abused by a relative. Court: The pair have both pleaded not guilty at their trial at Manchester Crown Court, pictured . Brewer groomed her and the later pupil . through flattery, Mr Cadwallader said, ‘commenting on their figure, . their dress’ and also ‘their musical talent’. He would encourage the first girl to . take part in sex acts in his office, telling her to use a side door . rather than the main entrance so his secretary didn’t become suspicious, . the jury was told. Her bad behaviour eventually led to her being suspended, and she was sent to live with the Brewers. By the time she was 15 he was treating . her as his girlfriend, taking her to pubs and allegedly indecently . assaulting her beside a canal. She went to study music abroad when . she was 16, but on her return to Britain went to visit the Brewers where . the alleged rape took place. At the time, she didn’t regard what happened as abuse and saw it as ‘a small price to pay for the affection’ he showed her. ‘The prosecution case is very much . that he abused that position using his power, influence and personality . to seduce her,’ Mr Cadwallader added. The alleged victim began her evidence yesterday by describing how her home life was ‘hell’. She said she thought Brewer was ‘the bee’s knees’, ‘a special teacher’ who needed to be ‘worshipped’ by his pupils. Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault. His ex-wife, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape. The trial continues.

A talented footballer who was once . tipped to play for England has revealed how mental health problems . triggered his fall from the peak of the sport. Michael . Johnson was snapped up by Manchester City when he was just 18 as . experts compared him to some of the best players the club had ever . produced. However, . despite making his debut in 2006 and appearances for the under-21 . England team, it has emerged the midfielder's career has been cut short as he battles mental health problems. Scroll down for video . A photograph of Michael Johnson, left, emerged yesterday showing him looking larger and more unfit than he did during his promising playing day with Manchester City, right . Mr Johnson, 24, told the Manchester Evening News he has spent time in the Priory as part of his ongoing treatment. He said: 'I am more disappointed than anyone but that's the way it goes. 'I have been attending the Priory . Clinic for a number of years now with regard to my mental health and . would be grateful if I could now be left alone to live the rest of my . life.' Fellow footballers . have suggested that pressure and the huge sums of money paid to the . young footballer may have contributed to his decline. The midfielder is now without a club after it emerged this week that Mr . Johnson was released by Manchester City before Christmas as the club . conceded defeat in keeping him from alcohol and gambling. City has paid up the remaining six months of his £25,000-a-week contract. Mr Johnson was convicted of two drink-driving offences in September after crashing his car in Manchester in May last year. His fall from grace was confirmed . after a picture of him at a take-away was posted on Twitter on Monday showing him looking larger and . less fit than during his playing days. Former . City team-mate Joey Barton, who has also courted controversy during his career, wrote on Twitter: 'Just read about young Michael Johnson at Man . City. So sad. Had the world at his feet. 'That's what too much pressure/£, can do to young lads.' Outcast: Johnson was released from his £25,000-a-week Manchester City contract shortly before Christmas . City legend Colin Bell, who Mr Johnson was once compared to, told the Manchester Evening News: 'It’s a terrible shame. It’s hard to accept when your career ends early and for his to end at his age will be really difficult to take.' Mr Johnson was heralded as a rising star by former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson, who once said he would not swap the youngster even for the likes of Steven Gerrard. After being signed by the Manchester club from Everton's youth team, Mr Johnson took just two years to make the senior team. He made his debut in the 2006-07 season and featured 10 times under manager Stuart Pearce. The following season he scored two brilliant goals but his career took a downward slide after being out of the game for four months while he had a double-hernia operation. After signing a five-year contract following his recovery, the then City manager Mark Hughes described him as an 'outstanding young player with a great talent and a great future ahead of him and we want that future to be at City, so we are working to that end. The guy has everything in front of him.' However, following a recurrence of his abdominal injury, Mr Johnson appeared just twice for the club in 2009-10 and not at all the following season. He failed to reignite his career during a loan spell at Leicester City.","Michael Johnson said he spent time in The Priory as part of his treatment .

Gyms face a crackdown on rip-off rules that allow them to impose punishing charges on users who try to cancel their contracts. Thousands sign up each January because of New Year resolutions to lose weight and get fit. However, many contracts carry small-print clauses that lock customers into long-term deals – up to 24 months – and make it difficult to quit. Fine print: Gyms face a crackdown on rip-off rules after many contracts were found to carry small-print clauses that lock customers into long-term deals - up to 24 months - and make it difficult to quit . The Office of Fair Trading has taken one company responsible for 700 gyms to court over unfair contract terms and put others on notice to clean up their act. Currently, a customer who loses their job a few months after joining a gym and tries to get out of their contract can be hit with penalty charges equivalent to the remaining length of the deal, which could be more than £700. The OFT is expected to announce that it will outlaw contracts that last longer than 12 months or do not contain a get-out clause for members who lose their job or sustain an injury. Virgin Active has already responded by changing its contracts to give customers better rights to cancel. The OFT has also been looking at the small-print rules of major chains such as LA Fitness, Fitness First and Bannatyne’s. Crackdown: The Office of Fair Trading has taken one company responsible for 700 gyms to court over unfair contract terms and put others on notice to clean up their act . OFT spokesman Cavendish Elithorn said: ‘We are investigating a number of companies that operate fitness club chains or provide management services to gyms over concerns about unfair terms or business practices. ‘These include tying consumers into lengthy terms with  limited rights to cancel should their circumstances change, and using misleading debt collection practices.’ The OFT’s investigation stems from a court case involving Ashbourne Management Services, which draws up agreements and collects payments for 700 gyms. The judge ruled that a gym contract was unfair if it ran for longer than 12 months and did not allow the consumer to cancel with 30 days’ notice and a moderate penalty. Virgin Active is extending the period during which members who are made redundant may give notice to end their membership from one month after their redundancy to two. It is also extending the ability to cancel membership following loss of employment to those who lose their job in circumstances other than redundancy. Several gyms have already cut their contracts to a maximum of 12 months, while some, such as Fitness First, offer one-month and four-month deals. Bannatyne’s said it did not offer contracts longer than 12 months.","Thousands sign up each January because of New Year resolutions .

A British man has been shot dead by muggers who stole his camera in one of central America's most violent cities. The man, named locally as Omer Kaya, 33, collapsed after being shot in the neck during the violent robbery in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. Police were last night hunting a woman and two men said to have pursued him when he left a taxi, before attacking Mr Kaya while he was reportedly taking photographs. Murdered: Omer Kaya, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was shot during a confrontation with thieves in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula . Travelling: Mr Kaya is thought to have been travelling across Central America and South America having left at the beginning of January . The businessman, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was due to leave the country on Friday, before celebrating his birthday on Sunday. Mr Kaya’s was a director of a property management company based in Leigh-on-Sea. His business partner Fatma Oksuzer said did not know he had traveled to Honduras, adding: 'Omer was a very friendly guy, soft and well-mannered. This is awful.' He is thought to have handed over his camera but refused to give the gang a rucksack containing his valuables. A bag found nearby contained a mobile phone, two more cameras, cash and credit cards, an iPad and a pair of swimming goggles. Pictures in local newspapers showed him lying barefoot on the ground next to a bloodied blanket by a police tape in a pair of white trousers, T-shirt and sunglasses. Detectives also found an air ticket among his personal belongings, while a pair of flipflops was also found nearby. My Kaya, whose family are from Turkey, is understood to have been travelling through South and Central America for a month, having left at the beginning of January. The fatal attack happened around 11am local time on Tuesday in San Pedro Sula's residential Trejo neighbourhood. San Pedro Sula, in the north of the country, is often cited as the country's most dangerous city. Violent: the city is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Honduras, a country with the world's highest murder rate with 87 killings per 100,000 people, according to the United Nations . Honduras, with a a murder rate around 20 times that of the United States, is among the most dangerous countries on earth. Witnesses have told police Mr Kaya, . who is thought to have been alone, was attacked by a woman and two men . spotted following him on foot after getting out of a taxi. A post-mortem showed he died from a bullet wound to his neck. A 32mm spent cartridge found at the scene was being examined by police last night along with CCTV footage taken from a house near to the spot where Mr Kaya was murdered. Police chief Leonel Sauceda said: 'It appears Mr Kaya was shot while putting up a fight.' Violent gangs such as the Mara Salvatrucha, created in the 1980s among central American-born inmates in Californian prisons, operate with impunity. Dangerous: The fatal attack happened around 11am local time on Tuesday in San Pedro Sula's residential Trejo neighbourhood . Home: Omer Kaya's semi-detached house in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex . Drug trafficking is the main source of its violence and local authorities have admitted they lack the infrastructure and resources to cope. Mexican and Colombian drug cartels have expanded their operations the country, which now has the world's highest murder rate with 87 killings per 100,000 people according to the United Nations. Police believe Mr Omer may have been on a day trip to the city because they have found no listing for him at any of the local hotels. Travel guide Lonely Planet says: 'Travellers tend to see San Pedro as a necessary evil. 'Most international flights land here because the city lies right Honduras' top destinations, Copan Ruinas and the Bay Islands. 'You wouldn't be alone in trying to get in and out of San Pedro as quickly as possible.' A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it had been made aware of the death. The spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Honduras and stand ready to provide consular assistance.' Good friend Mahmut Guler, 32, from Leigh-on-Sea, said: 'Omer was a great friend and a true gentleman. He was the nicest guy you could ever meet and would never argue with anyone. 'I am still in shock and can't believe this has happened. He only contacted me on Friday to say happy birthday and he was telling me how beautiful Honduras is. 'He had just finished a sightseeing tour of Britain with friends and headed out to Honduras to visit another friend working out there. I think he was also planning to travel across South America while he was out there.' Mr Guler, who is manager of Celly's hairdressers in Southend, Essex, is now calling for better awareness of the potential dangers of travelling abroad. He added: 'People need to be warned about the dangers of travelling across South America. I have lost a good friend and I don't want anyone else to have to suffer like he did. 'I only wish Omer had known that before he went out there.'","British man named locally as Omer Kaya shot dead while taking pictures .

Arleta Vakane, 38, spotted the seven-week-old cross-breed which has fallen into the Oxford Canal during last week’s cold snap, and did not hesitate to go in after it. Ms Vakane was crossing a bridge near Banbury, Oxon when she heard loud whimpers and saw the helpless dog with only its nose above the water. After trying to get hold of the terrier from shore, she jumped into the canal to come to its rescue. Puppy love: Arleta Vakane jumped into a freezing canal to save drowning puppy Chilly . Print operator Arleta rushed the dog to a nearby veterinary clinic where staff have now named the puppy Chilly, after its cold ordeal. Ms Vakane said: ‘I heard this screaming, crying noise and when I looked I saw something moving in the middle of the canal. ‘As I got nearer I saw it was a puppy paddling in the water and trying to keep her nose out of the water - everything else, including her ears, had gone under. ‘The noise she was making was so loud - she was fighting for her life. ‘I laid in the snow and tried to grab her but the gap between us was too big, so I got into the water to reach her.’ Two days after last week's rescue, Arleta and Chilly were reunited and she says plans to keep the puppy, unless the owners come forward to claim her. She said: ‘When I saw her again I . couldn't believe it was the same dog. Her eyes are so bright but when I . last saw them they looked half dead. ‘If I keep her I'll rename her Hope - because we all hoped she would survive.'

Saving grace: Arleta was crossing the Oxford Canal near Banbury when she heard the helpless whimpers of the puppy and came to her rescue . Veterinary surgeon Will Oldham, from Hawthorne Lodge Veterinary Practice, added: ‘When the puppy arrived she was shivering and barely conscious. ‘She was so cold it took an hour-and-a-half to read her temperature. ‘Given how cold it was she would not have survived another few minutes in that water. ‘She is a very, very lucky puppy - Arleta undoubtedly saved her life. ‘The area of the canal she went into is not very nice at all but her brave actions mean this story had a very happy ending.’","Arleta Vakane jumped into the Oxford Canal to save seven-week-old Chilly .

It was love at first sight for a baby chipmunk who stumbled upon a teddy bear during a garden outing. The young golden-mantled ground chipmunk planted a smacker on the pink stuffed toy after a few minutes of courtship in a garden in Colorado, U.S. At first the chipmunk was suspicious of his new friend and approached the teddy bear with caution, but after a quick check, there was no denying the connection.

He gradually gained more confidence, . plucking up the courage to examine the teddy more closely, and appeared . to plant a kiss on the toy's mouth.

The chipmunk is a frequent visitor at Betsy's house and she has even nicknamed him Jasper. She said that watching Jasper examine the teddy bear was like watching a toddler meet a new friend.
