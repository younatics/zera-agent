"The vast proportion of the world's fossil fuels must remain buried in the ground if global warming targets are to be met, according to a new study. More than 80 per cent of the known coal deposits, a third of the world's oil reserves and half of the gas must not be burned before 2050 if temperature increases are to be kept to within two degrees C of pre-industrial levels. Even then world leaders will face just a fifty per cent chance of meeting their goal of capping warming to these levels. A third of the world's crude oil, like above, will have to remain untapped underground to limit climate change . Last year the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world was on course to experience 'dangerous' levels of global warming unless greenhouse gas emissions could be capped. If fossil fuels continue to be burned at the current rate, it warned, then the world was on track to warm by more than 5 degrees C by the end of the century. The latest study, published in the journal Nature, experts at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Resources, assessed how much fossil fuel could be extracted to meet the two degree limit. It found that 223 billion fewer barrels of oil and 290 billion fewer tonnes of coal should be burned to meet this goal. The researchers also examined the implications for different regions of the world should it attempt to reach this goal. They said that China, Russia and the United States would suffer most as they are forced to leave the majority of their huge coal reserves untapped, having a major impact on industry and the economies in these regions. More than 260 billion barrels of oil will have to remain unused in the Middle East - equivalent to the entire oil reserves in Saudi Arabia. The Middle East should also leave more than 60 per cent of its gas reserves in the ground. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, chaired by Rajendra Pachauri (above), has warned that global warming needs to be limited to within two degrees Celsius if it wants to avoid dangerous climate change . The US, which transports large amounts of coal via barge on the Ohio River (above) will have to leave the majority of its coal reserves untapped, something that could have a huge impact on its industry and economy . The researchers also urged against development of the hard to reach resources in the Arctic as the oil there and said it should be classified as unburnable. Countries like Canada and Russia are thought to be keen to tap into the estimated 100 billion barrels of oil and 35 trillion cubic metres of gas in the Arctic circle. However, the researchers said that shale oil and gas resources, which are currently being explored as a new source of energy in the UK, could safely be developed in Europe, but would have to be balanced by other fossil fuels remaining unburned elsewhere. The study also found that new technology that is aimed at reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels - known as carbon capture storage - will not have any impact until after 2050. While the US is a major producer of oil from wells like those above, the Middle East is most likely to suffer as a result of attempts to leave oil reserves untapped as it will need to leave 260 million barrels in the ground . Carbon capture storage technology, that aims to strip carbon dioxide out of emissions from coal fired power stations like above, is too expensive and immature to have much of an impact before 2050, the study warns . They might be fluffy faced, buck-toothed little creatures, but two species of rodent have been identified the latest culprits to be contributing to climate change . Researchers have found that the arctic ground squirrel and the beaver may be playing a far greater role in global warming than had previously been realised. It means that scientists will in the future have to alter their theories around anthropogenic climate change to take account of 'rodentopogenic' influences. Researchers studying permafrost in the Arctic found that ground squirrels there are hastening the release of greenhouse gases from the frozen soil where they build their burrows. A separate study found that beavers were now causing the release of 200 times more methane from the pond they create than was being released in 1900 due to rising numbers of the creatures. This, they say, would mean strict limits will still have to be imposed on how much fossil fuels can be burned before that time. Dr Christophe McGlade, a researcher at the UCL Institute of Sustainable Resources who was amoung the study's authors, said: 'Policy makers must realise that their instincts to completely use the fossil fuels within their countries are wholly incompatible with their commitments to the 2C goal. 'If they go ahead with developing their own resource, they must be asked which reserves elsewhere should remain unburnt in order for the carbon budget not to be exceeded.' Professor Paul Ekins, an economist and director of the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, questioned whether energy companies should have spent £430 billion in 2013 searching for fossil fuels that cannot be burned. He added that it may not be worth investing large sums of money in extracting 'the last drops' of North Sea oil rather than importing cheaper resources from elsewhere. He said: 'They will need to rethink such substantial budgets if policies are implemented to support the 2 degree C limit, especially as new discoveries cannot lead to increased aggregate production.' Dr Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said that rather than slowing down, fossil fuel consumption was likely to accelerate over the coming decades. He said the recent deal between China and the United States would see China continue to increase its emissions to a peak level in 2030. He said: 'It is unrealistic to expect governments to implement policies that will come even close to these goals of leaving fossil fuels in the ground.' The researchers claim that it will make no commercial sense trying to seek out and extract the last remaining reserves in places like the North Sea (above) and companies should concentrate on cheaper resources .","Researchers at University College London assessed how much fossil fuels can be burned before 2050 to limit global warming to two degrees celcius .

"Republicans in the House of Representatives are falling over each other in the race to file legislation that would stop President Barack Obama from implementing his far-reaching immigration plan. No fewer than five separate GOP-sponsored bills are already pending in the House just 24 hours after the 114th Congress launched on Tuesday. They all seek to do largely the same thing: prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from spending a single dime in 2015 on any part of Obama's plan, which he announced in December. The president's aim is to mainstream 5 million or more people living in the U.S. illegally, giving them residency and work permits and guaranteeing them that they won't be deported back to their home countries. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . IMMIGRATION WARRIORS: Reps. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania and Ted Poe of Texas (right) introduced competing proposals to forbid the Obama administration from spending any money to implement what they have labeled an 'amnesty' for 5 million or more illegal immigrants . GEARING UP: President Barack Obama, shown in the Oval Office on Wednesday with Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, expects a showdown with the GOP over his immigration plans . Republicans, particularly those regarded as ultra-conservative, labeled the scheme an 'amnesty' for lawbreakers and have vowed to block it. Alabama Reps. Martha Roby and Robert Aderholt have two competing bills. Pennsylvania Rep Tom Marino, Texas Rep. Ted Poe and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho have measures of their own pending. A confrontation with the White House is expected soon. 'The president’s executive actions with regard to immigration are outside of the Constitution and outside of his powers,' House Speaker John Boehner told reporters during a press briefing on Wednesday. 'We can deal with that issue in the Department of Homeland Security bill without jeopardizing the security of our country.' Republicans still have to deal with Homeland Security funding because they separated it from the federal budget in December as a condition of funding the rest of the government through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year. America's immigration enforcement agencies are part of DHS. Conservatives had pledged to scuttle the larger budget last month unless they were guaranteed another chance in February to hold the money over Obama's head. They hope the leverage will force the president to back off from his strategy to give safe harbor to millions of illegal immigrants. The battle will be joined in a matter of days. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers of Kentucky told Bloomberg on Wednesday that 'the hope is that we could file a bill Friday, in time for it to come to the floor Tuesday or so next week.' Which bill that will be is anyone's guess. 'We're in the process of determining the best option on this right now,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told DailyMail.com on Wednesday. Roby's spokesman believes her version could easily be incorporated into the looming Homeland Security budget bill. It would prohibit the expenditure of any money to put Obama's policy changes into action. 'It's very straightforward,' Roby told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday. 'It lays out specifically that no funds will be used for these things.' She added that Republicans knew what they were doing when they teed up a Homeland Security showdown. 'We did that so that we could have this fight on the president's [immigration] overreach,' she said. 'I think that this prohibition language is the best way to do that.' Rep. Poe's bill has the most momentum, however, with 21 co-sponsors signed on in just one day. (Roby's has none.) The House Judiciary Committee is expected to take up the measure, nicknamed 'The Separation of Powers Act,' in the coming days. WHICH?: House Speaker John Boehner will ultimately have to choose one of several legislative 'defund' proposals before the DHS budget expires on Feb. 28 . It strips funding from effors 'to grant parole or deferred action to any alien other than for reasons permitted under current law' and 'to provide work permits or green cards to aliens who are currently unlawfully in the U.S.,' according to a press release. 'In his latest effort to completely rewrite our laws, the president has decided to grant amnesty and work permits to millions of foreign nationals,' Poe said. 'What this legislation would do, [it] would allow Congress to exercise its intended role, and ""check"" the out-of-control White House that has decided to simply pick and choose parts of the Constitution that they like.' Tennessee Rep. Diane Black, the bill's leading co-sponsor, called Obama's immigration plan an 'end-run around Congress.' 'By cutting off funding for the President’s lawless overreach,' she said, 'we can send a clear message that – despite his illusions – the president cannot simply make up his own laws.' Rep. Aderholt's bill would go further than the others, both telling DHS what it can't do and what it must do. In addition to defunding the White House's unilateral plan, it would restore the Secure Communities immigration enforcement plan – a system that Obama killed in November. Under Secure Communities, local law enforcement agencies shared fingerprints and other information on arrestees with federal immigration authorities, giving them a chance to start federal cases, often including deportation proceedings, against illegal immigrants. Cities and counties, predominantly those dominated by Democratic politicians, revolted against the plan. Several declared themselves 'sanctuaries' and refused to honor so-called 'detainers' from Immigration and Customs Enforcement – orders to keep people locked up on immigration grounds past the time they would otherwise be released. Aderholt's bill would also force state and local governments to begin complying. DUELING ALABAMIANS: Republican Reps. Martha Roby (left) and Robert Aderholt (right) have separate measures pending in the House to push back against President Obama's planned immigration law changes . It 'not only defunds the president’s actions towards amnesty but also removes the president’s discretion in the ability to grant work permits, Social Security, and other federal benefits that go along with his order,' the Alabama lawmaker said in a statement. 'My legislation will also put limits on the president’s future ability to enact such wide-reaching actions that circumvent the Constitution’s separation of powers. It returns the legislative authority of our government back to the legislative branch.' 'I hope that Mr. Obama understands that the American people spoke very loudly during the election in November,' Aderholt jabbed, 'and want a new direction away from his liberal policies.' Rep. Marino's bill is the weakest of the five, limiting its impact to DHS funds that Congress has appropriated for the agency. The White House has said it can implement the president's immigration executive actions without new funds, however, relying on fees charged to people who apply for green cards and work permits. Rep Yoho's bill is the least likely to get a hearing: He was among the 25 conservative GOP lawmakers who revolted against House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday, refusing to vote for his re-election to House leadership. The speaker's office has already begun retaliating against the cabal of right-wingers, dropping two of them from the influential House Rules Committee, which Boehner controls.","Legislation aims to forbid the Dept. of Homeland Security from spending money to implement the White House's immigration executive orders .
There could be a floor vote on at least one of the bills as soon as next week .
Congress put DHS on a short leash in December, leaving it out of the federal budget and approving its funding only through February .
The president would almost certainly veto any law that ties his hands as he aims to guarantee 5 million illegal immigrants that they won't be deported ."
"She's a poster girl for curvy women and even launched a clothing collection catering for fuller-figured women last year, but Kelly Brook is embarking on a New Year's diet. The model and TV star has announced that she is following the New Atkins Nutritional Approach to help her 'get fit and feel great' after a hectic 2014. The 35-year-old, who is the new ambassador for the diet, is apparently starting the low-carb programme to curb her sweet tooth and lose a few pounds. Scroll down for video . Kelly Brook has been unveiled as the ambassador for the New Atkins Nutritional Approach to help her get fit . Speaking about her decision, Kelly, who is reportedly house-hunting in North England to be closer to on-again beau David McIntosh, said: '2014 was a crazy year; I don’t feel like I’ve been able to focus on me or maintain a healthy diet. 'On the set of my new TV show, it was really easy to reach for the naughty treats, so I’ve noticed the changes in my body. 'I’m guilty of having at least five cups of tea a day with two sugars in, that’s 10 spoons of sugar every day, just in my tea. I’ve also had a brilliant Christmas but I have over-indulged a little, which I’m sure many people can relate to.' Kelly, who has been soaking up the New Year sun in Australia over the last week with David, continued: 'In the new year I'm determined to carry on with my training at the gym and will be following New Atkins to boost my energy levels while helping me slim down. 'I’m looking to lose a few pounds, but a more important goal for me is staying fit and healthy without having to deprive myself.' Kelly says she is following this approach because she believes it is really about cutting down on the bad things, like sugar and starchy carbs, while still enjoying tasty foods like chicken, fish, fibrous vegetables and red fruits. Kelly tweeted the news today and spoke of her excitement at starting the plan after overindulging . The size 10 star created a plus-size range for Simply Be, include figure-flattering dresses and neat tummy-controlling skirts available in sizes 10-32, in September . Kelly, pictured modelling her lingerie range in 2013, says 2014 was a crazy year and she didn't have time to focus on her body and noticed changes . Despite her new approach to her health, the size 10 star who recently created a plus-size range for of figure-flattering dresses and neat tummy-controlling skirts  available in sizes 10-32 for Simply Be, maintains that she is still proud of her figure. 'I’m confident I will achieve fantastic results with Atkins, but don't worry, I’m proud of my curves and they aren't going anywhere!' she added. Speaking about the collaboration, a spokesperson for Atkins said: 'Kelly is a champion of confidence, she is a relatable person who is a role model for women everywhere, so is the perfect ambassador for New Atkins in 2015. 'Kelly is not into fad or crash diets and the food options mean she can be confident of what she is eating and not have to worry about making huge changes to her lifestyle.' Kelly Brook, seen with a friend on Instagram, and her on-again boyfriend were spotted partying in Sydney, Australia, together over the weekend . Speaking about the collaboration, a spokesperson for Atkins said that Kelly is a 'champion of confidence' and a 'relatable person who is a role model for women everywhere' Kelly landed in London on Tuesday after a week in sunny Australia with David. On Sunday, a friend of the couple took to her Instagram account to share a snapshot of them putting on their best poses for the camera as they relaxed together at a pool party in Sydney. Kelly got engaged to the 29-year-old former Gladiator last March before ending it six months later - but is believed to have started dating him again after he dated Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace. The model is getting set to launch her SS15 collection with Simply Be in March. Kelly will also star on new TV comedy on US channel NBC, One Big Happy, and apparently strips off in it.","Kelly, 35, says she has overindulged over Christmas .

"Elizabeth Truss said the UK should take steps to speed up the development of GM crops in the UK . Genetically modified food should be grown in Britain because it is more ‘eco-friendly’, the Environment Secretary claimed yesterday. Publicly backing the controversial technology for the first time since she was appointed six months ago, Elizabeth Truss said the UK should take steps to speed up its development. Her claims were furiously rejected by campaigners, who are concerned that so-called Frankenfoods can alter ecosystems and create ultra-invasive superweeds. Speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference yesterday, Miss Truss also backed plans to weaken EU laws that have so far kept commercial GM crops out of Britain. ‘I think GM crops have a role to play here,’ she said. ‘If you look at what has happened in the US, crops are being grown in a more environmentally friendly way with less water usage and less pesticide usage. I would like us to have that opportunity. Our farmers need access to technology that will help them work in world markets.’ In voicing her support, Miss Truss is following in the footsteps of her predecessor Owen Paterson, who was a staunch backer of GM crops. However Peter Melchett of the Soil Association described her facts as ‘extremely outdated’, adding that overall pesticide use on GM crops such as maize and soya in the US has actually increased. Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch UK, said: ‘Half of US farms have superweeds due to blanket spraying of [herbicide resistant] GM crops with weedkiller.’ And Liz O’Neill, of GM Freeze, added that it was ‘sad but hardly surprising’ to hear the ‘same old rhetoric’ from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. ‘We need to learn lessons from the US experience,’ she said. ‘UK farmers don’t want to repeat those mistakes and UK consumers don’t want to eat GM.’ If passed next week, the new EU law will repatriate decisions for GM technology to member states, meaning Britain could decide to grow the crops commercially. Miss Truss' claims were furiously rejected by campaigners, who are concerned that so-called Frankenfoods can alter ecosystems and create ultra-invasive superweeds.

"A baby girl born three days after Christmas arrived with an extra gift for her parents: two perfectly-formed bottom front teeth. Jaklina Bailey said doctors and nurses at the hospital in Branson, Missouri were stunned when baby Alyssa showed off her set of chompers. 'Right when she first arrived, everybody was just shocked,' she told ABC7. 'Just like, ""She has two front teeth? No kidding? Really?"" It was just a big talk about it in the delivery room.' Word of the rare sight spread down the hallways and soon other doctors and nurses were popping by her room to see the baby's pearly whites, she said. Scroll down for video . Beyond her years: Alyssa Bailey was born with two perfectly-formed bottom teeth in December . 'They were kind of like ""what's going on? Can I just see? Let me see"",' Mrs Bailey told Fox6, adding that her own doctor was just as shocked as the others. 'She said in her 25-year career this is the second time she's ever seen it,' she said. Although it is not common for babies to be born with teeth, around one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies does have them, according to the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Laura Corio, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, added to ABC that the teeth will often be on the bottom but occasionally a baby is born with more than just two. 'Teeth can be present in oral cavities at birth and may be related to certain other health problems but not always,' she explained. Doctors often file down the teeth so the baby avoids injuring themselves or their mother as they learn to breastfeed, Corio said. Proud mom Jaklina Bailey, pictured, said that doctors were coming into her room to see her daughter's teeth . Natal teeth have little root structure, meaning they are often wobbly and can present a choking hazard to youngsters if they fall out. Mrs Bailey said doctors will keep an eye on Alyssa's teeth in case they start coming lose. When they do fall out, she will  grow her teeth normally. Most babies start teething at around six months old. Teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth. They occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies. They usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure meaning they are often wobbly. They are not usually well formed but can injure the baby's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain. Natal teeth are often removed shortly after a baby is born because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them. There is no known explanation for them other than that a child is more dentally developed. Very rarely they are related to other medical issues, such as Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, a condition that affects bone growth and can lead to breathing difficulties and heart failure. After the natal teeth are removed or fall out, the baby will grow teeth as normal. Most children have a full set of 20 milk teeth by the time they're three years old. These teeth will start to fall out around the five year mark, making way for larger adult teeth.

"Reporters didn't want to hear about changes to Obamacare or the Keystone XL pipeline on Wednesday, opting instead to kick off House Republicans' first press conference of 2015 with questions about the white supremacy scandal that threatens to swallow Majority Whip Steve Scalise whole. House Speaker John Boehner introduced a parade of GOP luminaries to push his legislative agenda but the event quickly devolved into his worst nightmare before he offered his own defense of his third-in-command. 'I know what's in his heart,' the speaker said. 'He's a decent, honest person who made a mistake. We've all made mistakes.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'WE'VE ALL MADE MISTAKES': House Speaker John Boehner defended Rep. Steve Scalise on Wednesday in a press conference that was more like a reporters' scrum . 'I REJECT BIGOTRY': Scalise is standing his ground and aims to remain Majority Whip, the third-highest ranking GOP position in the lower chamber of Congress . The press briefing started nearly 90 minutes late, and Boehner cut off questions after less than 15 minutes. It was his first confrontation with reporters over the damaging revelations since Scalise apologized in a statement for the speech, which he characterized as an unintentional lapse in a frayed and inconsistent vetting process. Scalise said after the story broke that when he was a more lowly state legislator he didn't have adequate staff to screen groups that asked him to deliver remarks. And besides, he added, his practice was to speak to any group of constituents who would hear his message against an unpopular tax proposal that was made law and later repealed. Boehner himself said Wednesday that when he was in the Ohio legislature, 'I had a half of a staffer. You get asked to speak to a lot of groups.' Scalise spoke for himself. 'I reject any form of bigotry, bigotry of all kinds,' he said in response to a question about the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a group with strong ties to the infamous Louisiana Ku Klux Klan founder David Duke. Scalise referred reporters to his statement last month, in which he said the speech he gave was 'a mistake I regret.' 'I think that's where the story ends,' he insisted. House Republican leaders have yet to address a story line that emerged shortly after Scalise confirmed that he had delivered the tax speech in 2002. Kenny Knight, the former Duke aide who reserved the hotel hospitality suite where he spoke, said the meeting was for a civic association, not EURO. The two meetings were held in the same room, he said, hours apart. Scalise's speech, Knight recalled in an interview with The Daily Beast, was sandwiched in between a Red Cross presentation about CPR and a sheriff's department talk about local crime watch programs. FEEDING FRENZY: The first three questions – half of those Boehner's team took – were about the allegations of racism lodged against Scalise . But the White House has seized on the event to cast doubt on Republicans' ability to run both houses of Congress with Scalise as part of the leadership structure. 'Who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday. Earnest made special mention of a 20-year-old comment attributed to Scalise, who reportedly told a constituent that he was 'David Duke without the baggage.' Scalise did not directly deny making that claim, but emphasized that 'I reject bigotry of all kinds.'","Newly re-elected Speaker John Boehner cut off questions after reporters focused on the scandal instead of his policy announcements .

"A weight loss expert has been slammed by plus-size campaigners for his new project: Warn A Friend They're Fat Day. TV star Steve Miller, presenter of the TV show Fat Families, had designated today as the day for Britons to tell close friends or family members that they are overweight. But the move has been widely criticised, with members of the plus-size community saying the scheme amounts to fat-shaming and bullying. Weight loss expert Steve Miller designated today Warn A Friend They're Fat Day. He wants people to tell friends and family if they are fat (Pictures posed by models) Steve floated the idea of Warn A Friend They're Fat Day late last year and even wrote a letter to the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt about the issue. The idea is for people to bring up the issue of obesity with a close friend or family member who is overweight. The person would then offer to become an exercise buddy if their friend does decide to try and shift some pounds as a result of the conversation. Steve claims that the initiative could save thousands of lives. Steve Miller (left) is hoping his Warn A Friend They're Fat Day will encourage people to lose weight. But Rivkie Baum, the editor Slink (right), believes it will have the opposite effect . He told FEMAIL: 'This day is about saving lives, it is absolutely not about humiliating people. 'I am proposing to people that they do all of this in a very sensitive manner and only with friends or family that they are extremely close to. 'It should also only be said to people that you think can handle the information - if you think it will send them the other way, don't do it. 'Then after you have told them, offer to go to the gym together or take up walking together. 'I know that the word fat sounds harsh but when you use that word, people take notice - if you wrap the issue up in cotton wool, it doesn't work.' Would you tell a friend they are fat? But Rivkie Baum, the editor of plus-size fashion magazine Slink, disagrees - she thinks Steve's campaign is going to have the reverse effect. She said: 'Recent studies have shown that telling a friend they're fat, whether you are concerned or otherwise can actually lead to further weight gain. 'Not to mention the way it might change your friendship. 'I find it amazing that people seem to believe that someone who is fat is unaware of it.' She continued: 'We live in a media culture that constantly points out what are perceived to be physical flaws on a daily basis. 'The issue of our bodies and our relationship with them is incredibly complicated and Steve's initiative doesn't seem to take any of this into account. 'If the issue of weight, body image and obesity was this simple, surely we wouldn't even be having this conversation.' Rivkie Baum believes the only way people will reach their goal, is if they want it . Rivkie  is so disgusted with Warn A Friend They're Fat Day  that she and a group of fellow plus-size campaigners have launched a counter movement called Tell A Friend They're Fab. Rivkie told FEMAIL: '#youarefab is the antidote for people fed up with the long list of detox and diets that are forced upon us in January and a welcome break to the body image negativity that campaigns like Steve's can throw up. 'If someone does want to lose weight, the only way they will reach their goal, is if they want it. 'If your friend or family member wants your help losing weight, they will ask for it - then is your time to step up. 'But if that doesn't happen, appreciate that their body is their business and use #youarefab to remind each other of the reason you're friends in the first place.' While Rivkie thinks Steve's campaign is harmful, he believes #youarefab is equally dangerous and has been tweeting his opposition this afternoon . But while Rivkie thinks Steve's campaign is harmful, he believes  #youarefab is equally dangerous. He said: 'The fat acceptance brigade are in my opinion dangerous, because what they are saying is you are OK to be fat and fabulous. 'That is completely wrong in my opinion. 'You are basically saying to someone, stay fat and you might die early and that is fine. That is wrong.'","TV star Steve Miller designated today Warn A Friend They're Fat Day .

"A video showing a mother from Trinidad and Tobago whipping her 12-year-old daughter with a belt for sharing sexually explicit photos of herself on Facebook has gone viral, sparking a national conversation in the island nation about corporal punishment. Last Sunday, a video was posted on Facebook showing Helen Bartlett, a mother of four from Point Fortin, beating her sobbing daughter while hurling profanities at her. The six-minute clip, which depicts Ms Bartlett raining blows on the 12-year-old girl, who whimpers in pain and cowers from the belt, has been shared more than 43,000 online. Scroll down for video . Public shaming: Helen Bartlett (right), a mother of four from Trinidad and Tobago, shared a video online showing her beating her 12-year-old daughter for inappropriate behavior . Unsettling: The six-minute clip shows the mother whipping the girl with a belt as she whimpers in pain . Discipline or abuse: The clip has gone viral on social media and sparked a public debate about corporal punishment . The unsettling clip has left viewers divided, with some people justifying the mother's actions, while others calling it child abuse. On Wednesday, Bartlett’s daughter and her older sister uploaded another video in response to the controversy, expressing support for their mother. Looking into the camera, the two girls said Bartlett was a good mother who wanted to protect her child from teenage pregnancy, or worse. When Helen Bartlett was interviewed by a local radio station earlier this week, the woman declared she was 'prepared to go to jail' to set her wayward young daughter on the right path, Trinidad Express reported. Asked if she regretted her actions, Ms Bartlett, who has three girls and a boy, said she stood by her mode of discipline, but she was sorry that the video intended to shame her 12-year-old has gained such notoriety. Ms Bartlett explained that since the girl's father, a police officer, left them, the child has been unmanageable. The single mother added that she has exhausted all avenues trying to keep her daughter on the straight and narrow, including seeking counselling for her. And according to Ms Bartlett, the 12-year-old's father has been of no help, telling the girl that he wanted nothing to do with her. No alternative: Ms Bartlett later explained that her daughter has been acting acting since pre-school, and that she has exhausted all avenues trying to set her on the right path . Defiant: The single mother said she is prepared to go to jail for meting out corporal punishment to her wayward daughter . What sparked the brutal beating last Sunday in the Bartletts’ apartment was a salacious text message exchange between the 12-year-old girl and a boy her age, who was trying to convince her to have sex with him. After the mother read the messages, she accessed her underage daughter's Facebook profile and discovered photos of the girl posing 'seductively' in her underwear. Helen Bartlett explained that while her child is pretty and intelligent, she has a low self-esteem and is susceptible to peer pressure. Her worst fear is that if the 12-year-old continues down this road, one day she is either going to come home pregnant, or will end up dead on the streets. On mom's side: The 12-year-old came out in defense of her mother, saying in a counter video that she knows Bartlett loves he dearly . ‘I stand firmly by my decision. I will go to jail for it,’ the woman said. ‘I know people are saying the authorities should charge me for abuse.’ Asked about her daughter's state of mind following the release of the controversial video, Ms Bartlett said the girl was coping 'unexpectedly well.' In her response video, the daughter said she knew her mother loves her dearly, and she reassured the viewers that has no intention of killing herself because she loves herself 'too much.' The girl has not been to school since the video went viral, and her mother said she has been preparing her for potential bullying and mockery from her classmates. Defending Helen Bartlett's old-school brand of discipline, her older daughter explained in her counter video that with their father not around anymore, there is no male figure in the family to set her out-of-control sibling straight. ‘The road my sister was heading down was teenaged pregnancy,’ she said. ‘She saw this as a way she could stop it. My sister has learnt her lesson.’ Speaking out for the first time since the incident, the 12-year-old at the center of the firestorm said: ‘I am very sorry for bringing shame on you and the family. I know you love me dearly. And I love you dearly, too.’ The girl then appealed to other children her age, urging them to watch the video of her beating and learn from it. Extreme measures: The mother stated that she decided to teach her daughter a lesson so that one day she wouldn't come home pregnant or end up dead . ‘You are a special piece of God’s puzzle,’ the girl said. ‘And don’t let what happen to me happen to you also.’ The incident sparked a heated public debate in Trinidad and Tobago over the issue of corporal punishment, and whether Helen Bartlett’s actions displayed in the video crossed the line. According to Jamaica Observer, Trinidad and Tobago's Ministry of Gender, Youth and Child Development has weighed in on the issue, calling on parents to use 'non-physical forms of discipline.'","Facebook video shows Helen Bartlett, a single mother of four from Trinidad and Tobago, disciplining her daughter with a belt for six minutes .

"Hanging by contorted fingers crammed into a nook of razor-sharp granite, the two climbers have little time to enjoy the breathtaking views from their dramatic vantage point 1,200ft up a sheer cliff face. With almost balletic grace and poise, they coil and swing to scale the next few feet to grasp a chink in the mammoth rock, as their feet cling to the slightest of footholds before planning their next vertical move. Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are attempting to become the first men to free-climb - using only hands and feet - the Dawn Wall of towering El Capitan rock formation in California’s Yosemite National Park. Scroll down for video . Kevin Jorgeson relaxes in his portaledge tent, which is attached to the rock face and hangs above the Yosemite Valley floor far below . Don't look down: Jorgeson calculates his next move up the mountain in this photo posted on Instagram on Sunday . Mountaineers: The first climber reached El Capitan's summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up the steep rock faces to the top . After 13 days, the pair are halfway up the imposing 3,000ft cliff on a perilous route many say is too technically demanding to be completed without the aid of ropes. And while the Americans have completed some of the most arduous sections already, the world record-beating attempt has hit alarming problems. Jorgeson, 30, is struggling to recover from splitting open the skin on the fingertips of his index and middle fingers of his right hand. This has severely hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner, and led to the pair taking three ‘rest days’ in the hope the skin will heal. Speaking from the foot of the Dawn Wall at 6am local time, Tom Evans, a fellow climber and photographer in contact with the pair, told me their spirits are still high. ‘They remain determined to complete the climb,’ he says. ‘They are definitely going for the top. They say they are not coming down until they’ve got there. The human body is not designed to take the kind of abuse they are enduring up there. Up they go: Kevin Jorgeson, 30 (left), and Tommy Caldwell, 36 (right), have reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb Yosemite's El Capitan . Rock face life: On the left, Caldwell is seen on Day 9 of the climb, attempting to remove damaged skin on his hands. On the right, one of the meals the climbers have eaten on El Capitan . ‘The granite flakes when you grip it, creating tiny razor-sharp edges which cut the skin deep. Kevin has taped up his fingers to protect them, but underneath, the skin is dry like toast.’ While many people have climbed the Dawn Wall — renowned for its smooth surface — using ropes and metal pins, no one has ever free-climbed it in a single attempt. Although the pair are clipped to ropes, they must not use them to help in the ascent. Instead, the ropes are to stop them falling if they misjudge a move or lose a grip with their fingers or feet. The men, who started the expedition on December 27, begin their climbing day shortly after 3pm, just two hours before sunset. December and January were picked for the climb in the hope it would be cold — sunlight and warmth cause fingers to sweat and so lose grip. Climbing shoes are also nowhere near as effective at clinging to the rock if the rubber gets warm because it becomes softer. But Yosemite National Park has been unusually warm this winter, so they are forced to do most of their climbing during the chill of night, using head torches. Daring: Free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent. Above, Caldwell makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on El Capitan using a headlamp on Sunday night . Record breakers: If they are successful, Jorgeson and Caldwell will be the first team to free-climb El Capitan's imposing Dawn Wall . At the dead of night, temperatures can plummet to well below freezing, as ice-cold winds sweep across the face of the rock. At midnight, after nine hours of climbing, they clamber into their ‘portaledges’ — 4ft by 6ft tents that hang from ropes fixed to the cliff face. Each has a stove to cook dried pasta, chilli and vegetables, brought by a six-strong support network of porters who haul food along with 12 gallons of water in huge sacks up the ropes to their precarious camp. On occasion, the pair have even celebrated the completion of a particularly demanding section with a swig or two of whisky — ‘to take off the edge’, Caldwell says. Before bed, they treat their cuts, grazes and bruises. Writing from his tent via social media, Caldwell says: ‘It’s the most chapping environment in the world up here. Windy. Cold. Super dry. [It feels like] we’re grabbing razor blades. I wake up twice a night and reapply lotion to my hands.’ Progress: If all goes well, the pair could reach the summit of El Capitan as early as Friday or Saturday. Above, Caldwell makes his way up the rock face on Sunday . Bizarrely, they are not alone — a photographic team and film crew, charting their ascent, camps alongside them. ‘We have three double “portaledges” set up. It’s like a five-star hotel up here!’ Caldwell says. In truth, few hotel guests face the prospect of falling rocks and ice hitting them as they sleep. They wake at 10am and have breakfast. By then the sun is out and they use solar-powered devices to charge their smart phones, and report back via social media to base camp, as well as family, friends and supporters. Tom Evans believes Jorgeson and Caldwell — who have trained for six years — could complete the challenge by early next week. The greatest threat would be a turn for the worse in the weather, or an acute injury to the hands. But even that might not stop this remarkable pair from conquering what is surely one of nature’s greatest challenges.","Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell climbing El Capitan in bid to become first to free-climb notorious Dawn Wall .

It would have been so much harder if not for my mum.' 19-year-old Bobby, from Worcester, has found romance with mother-of-three Donna Price, since the pair first kissed after a chance meeting in November . His mother Tracey Wood has been 'his rock' throughout his transgender journey and now she has given her blessing to the couple . Bobby, who has 10 brothers and sisters, said at high school he was allowed to take part in school games with the boys but some children called him 'a lesbian, a transvestite and a freak'.

"An eerie blackened ‘tomb’ belonging to Osiris – the ancient Egyptian god of gods – has been unearthed. It is thought that the symbolic burial site was used in rituals to connect the god of the afterlife’s vast powers with the pharaohs. The unusual structure was built during the 25th Dynasty between 760 and 525BC and was uncovered at the Al-Gorna necropolis on the west bank of the River Nile near Luxor, Egypt. A blackened ‘tomb’ of Osiris – the ancient Egyptian god of gods – has been unearthed (pictured). It is thought that the symbolic burial site was used in rituals to connect the god of the afterlife and reincarnation’s vast powers with those of thepharaohs . Announced by Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-DamAcaty, the ‘Tomb of Min’ is based on the mythical tomb of Osiris, complete with shafts, chapel, a large hallway, burial chamber, carvings and even a statue of the god, The Luxor Times reported. A staircase leading down from a pillared hallway cuts through the bedrock to a chapel with a vaulted ceiling, which holds a statue of Osiris. Osiris is traditionally depicted as a green-skinned, bearded man whose legs are mummified. He is often seeing wearing a pointed crown with ostrich feathers and holding a crook and flail. Pharaohs and other rich ancient Egyptians were associated with Osiris in death if they paid for assimilation rituals, which meant they could rise from the dead with Osiris and inherit eternal life. The statue is surrounded by a corridor to isolate and protect what is thought to be the most important part of the tomb. Announced by Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-DamAcaty, the ‘Tomb of Min’ is based on the mythical tomb of Osiris, complete with shafts, chapel, a large hallway, burial chamber, carvings (seen here) and even a statue of the god . Osiris is traditionally depicted as a bearded man whose legs are mummified. He is often seeing wearing a pointed crown with ostrich feathers and holding a crook and flail. The crook is thought to represent Osiris as a shepherd god, but the symbolism of the flail is more uncertain. He is commonly depicted as a pharaoh with a complexion of either green - the color of rebirth - or black, alluding to the fertility of the Nile floodplain. Osiris (illustrated) is traditionally depicted as a green-skinned, bearded man whose legs are mummified . Considered the oldest son of the Earth god Geb, he is ruler of the dead and granter of life in the form of sprouting crops and fertile flooding of the Nile. Through hope of new life after death, Osiris is associated with cycles observed in nature, but he was worshiped as Lord of the Dead until the suppression of the Egyptian religion during the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire . He has also been decribed as: 'he who is permanetly benign and youthful' and the 'lord of science'. Pharaohs and other rich ancient Egyptians were associated with Osiris in death if they paid for assimilation rituals, which meant they could rise from the dead with Osiris and inherit eternal life. One version of the myth of Osiris says that his brother, Set, along with the Queen of Ethiopia, conspired with 72 accomplices to plot his assassination. Set fooled Osiris into getting into a box, which was sealed and thrown into the Nile. But Osiris' wife, Isis, searched for his remains until she found him embedded in a tamarind tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace. She managed to remove the coffin and open it, but Osiris was already dead. She used a spell to bring him back to life so she could become pregnant, but afterwards he died again and she hid his body in the desert. Months later, she gave birth to Horus, the patron deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt who is often depicted as a falcon, as with a falcon's head. Later, hunting in the desert, Set came across the body of Osiris and tore it into 14 pieces, scattering them across the land. Isis gathered up all the parts of the body - except for his phallus, which was eaten by a catfish - and bandaged them together for a proper burial. The gods were impressed by her devotion and resurrected Osiris as god of the underworld. On the west side of the corridor, a funerary chamber is decorated with reliefs of demons and deities holding knives, which are thought to be armed guardians standing guard over the tomb’s occupant. Archaeologists of the Spanish and Italian-led excavation note that the symbolism of Osiris is present throughout the building, including a staircase leading to the underworld, the statue on its ‘island’ and an empty corridor symbolising a river. A burial chamber lies below the statue, linking the dead with Osiris. On the west side of the corridor of the Osiris statue, another room contains a shaft 22ft (seven metres) deep, leading to two empty rooms and two more debris-filled rooms that are yet to be explored. The unusual structure was built during the 25th Dynasty between 760 and 525BC and was uncovered at the Al-Gorna necropolis on the west bank of the River Nile near the Valley of the Kings (marked on the map and the city of Luxor, Egypt . The architecture of this tomb is unusual because it represents a model of the mythical tomb of Osiris, of which the most obvious replica known so far is called the Osireion at Abydos (a plan is shown) The two chambers may have escaped the attention of archaeologist Philippe Virey who discovered the tomb in the 1880s, the Egyptian Department of Antiquities said. While he made some attempts to plot it on a map, the significance of the site has been ignored until now. Deep inside the ancient structure, another staircase in front of the statue of Osiris goes down 29ft (nine metres) leading to a room with another shaft, which is thought to be the deepest part of the funerary complex. It is not known when excavtions will continue. The tomb of a previously unknown queen has been discovered, Egyptian officials have revealed. Unearthed by Czech archaeologists in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo, the tomb is thought to belong to the wife or mother of Pharaoh Neferefre who ruled 4,500 years ago. Abu-Sir was an Old Kingdom necropolis used by the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis. Forgotten queen: The discovery was made in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo,  and is thought to be 4,500 years old. The location of the grave has made archaeologists believe she was probably the wife of the pharoah . Here pyramids dedicated to Fifth Dynasty pharaohs, including Neferefre, can also be found. The location of the queen's grave, in Pharaoh Neferefre's funeral complex hints that she was probably the wife of the pharaoh, however. Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said that her name, Khentakawess, had been found inscribed on a wall in the necropolis. Mr Damaty added that this would make her Khentakawess III as two previous queens by this name were already known of. Archaeologists also found 30 utensils - with 24 made of limestone. Mr Damaty explained that the discovery would help them shed light on unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, saw the construction of the first pyramids. Hidden treasures: Czech archaeologists also found about 30 utensils (pictured)  - with 24 made from limestone and four of copper, an official statement added .","Burial was modelled on the mythical tomb of the god of the afterlife .

"A young groom's family are demanding that his bride gives them back their $500,000 'dowry' after she reportedly left him for always siding with his mother. Shakiba Banifatemi, an exchange student from Iran, and Reza Abdollahpour, a Canadian from an Iranian family, met in calculus class at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and married a year later, on April Fool's Day in 2012. Banifatemi moved in with her new husband's parents - but 18 months later, she could no longer bear to live with her mother-in-law, her lawyer told the Toronto Star. She left him in December 2013 and he filed for divorce in January 2014. Split: Shakiba Banifatemi, left, and Reza Abdollahpour, right, divorced last year and his family is now demanding that she gives back a share of property they gave her as a dowry before the wedding . Before their wedding, the groom's family had given his bride half ownership of a $1 million home in Ottawa. Such dowries are in keeping with Iranian tradition, the paper reported. The Abdollahpour family, which owns a jewelry business in Ottawa, demanded that Banifatemi give the dowry back in light of the failed marriage. But last week a judge dismissed the Abdollahpours' claims for the courts to order that she hand over her share of property, as well as the cost of the wedding - around $50,000 - and wedding gifts. The family claims that the young bride 'acted fraudulently by tricking' them into handing over part of the property and getting Abdollahpour to sponsor her for her residency. Hurt: A lawyer for Banifatemi said she left her husband because she couldn't live with his parents . They also claimed that Banifatemi's father had promised to hand back wedding gifts if she left the marriage 'or acted inappropriately' towards her new husband, the Star reported. But the judge, Justice Robert Smith, disputed the claims. 'The gift was made without any expectation of remuneration but with the expectation that Shakiba would marry Ahmad, which occurred,' Smith said. 'The parties entered into a valid marriage, which was consummated, and they lived together as man and wife for approximately one year and a half.' He added that Banifatemi's older brother also lives in Ottawa so could have sponsored her for residency, rather than her needing to turn to her boyfriend. Banifatemi's lawyer, Kevin Kavanagh, added: 'She married him in good faith and that's what the court found. Sometimes things don't work out, unfortunately, but you can't go back a year and half or two years later and allege that there was fraudulent intent.' Banifatemi, who still lives in Canada, told the Star she is 'pleased' with the decision. Her lawyer said that Banifatemi didn't want to leave the marriage and still loved her husband but could no longer live with her mother-in-law. But Abdollahpour and his mother, Sima, denied the claims and Sima said that she had a 'beautiful relationship' with her daughter-in-law. Happier days: The pair met in a calculus class at Carleton University, pictured, and married a year later . Of his ex-wife, Reza Abdollahpour added: 'I prefer to think that she's non-existent.' He added that in Iranian culture, the dowry is supposed to be returned if a wife leaves her husband. The family does not yet know if they'll appeal the judge's decision.","Shakiba Banifatemi, 23, and Reza Abdollahpour, 26, married on April Fool's Day 2012 and Banifatemi moved in with her husband's family .

"He has been dubbed Britain's vainest man and in his desperate pursuit to look like The Only Way is Essex Star Joey Essex has already gone under the knife. Celebrity wannabe Sam Barton is to see the consequences of spending thousands of champagne-fuelled nights out and £1,000 on accessories for his cat by declaring himself bankrupt. The 22-year-old, who lives in Four Oaks in Sutton Coldfield, said he has spent £100,000 in just four years on nights out, dozens of bottles of champagne and plastic surgery. Sam Barton, 22,  (right) has spent thousands on clothes, plastic surgery and treatments to look like Joey Essex (left) and live a celebrity lifestyle and is now £35,000 in debt and set to declare himself bankrupt . But despite being £35,000 in the red Barton said debt 'doesn't really worry' him and he has 'no regrets' because he has enjoyed himself trying to mirror the lives of celebrities like Joey Essex. The former barman  said: 'I've been absolutely crazy with money since I was 18 but especially in the last two years when I've just simply had the time of my life. I never thought of how much anything cost - if I wanted something, I bought it. 'I've spent around £55,000 trying to improve my looks and get the perfect image. The rest I've spent on designer clothes, jewellery, holidays, spa treatment and champagne. In total, I have spent around £100,000.' Barton managed to rack up some of the debts by his spending on plastic surgery - splashing out £20,000 on his teeth, £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing, £2,500 on tanning treatments and £10,400 on a nose job. He also confesses to loving the celebrity lifestyle, spending £2,000 a night on bottles of champagne worth £300. At one point Barton, son of European Cup-winning Aston Villa manager Tony Barton, owned 15 credit cards and store cards and had a large overdraft. He said he would frequently get friends to spend on his cards so they could give him the cash. Barton dreams of living a celebrity lifestyle and said if they spend money on cosmetic treatments he will do the same, he is pictured with  Only Way is Essex's Amy Childs (left) and Geordie Shore's Vicky Pattison (right) Barton spent thousands on plastic surgery to look like Joey Essex and had a nose job paid for by the NHS . He added:  'I would always ensure I had hard cash in my wallet, even if it meant taking another store card to the limit.' Barton first hit the headlines after revealing he had a free nose job on the NHS and said he wanted it to look like a real man. At the time he claimed he secured funding for the treatment because he cried and told doctors it was ruining his life.

Mr Barton has managed to maintain his income by working two part-time jobs, as a barman and at a supermarket, as well as from handouts from generous family and friends. 'When I was a child my parents had lots of money, lost it all and made it again,' he said. 'That meant I experienced being spoiled and then having it taken away from me. 'I was always pretty good with money as a kid, though. I would save my pocket money and then make my brother spend his. 'But when I got to 18, I just wanted the glam life and to live like a celebrity. I saw Joey Essex on TV and thought I would love to be like him. He was having the time of his life and so my pursuit of the celebrity life started. 'As well as racking up lots of debt, I have been able to live the celebrity lifestyle thanks to the generosity of my family and friends who have supported me financially.' The aspiring presenter, who dreams of appearing on Celebrity Big Brother, will present Office Girls, a reality TV show which will search for a new supergroup. Filming starts on Friday. 'It is my ultimate dream to look, feel and act like a celebrity,' he said. 'I'm chasing a lifestyle and I feel that if I mirror celebrities, like Joey, I will look good and feel good.

"Does your boss roll their eyes when you need time off last minute or get annoyed with you at the drop of a hat? Then you're not alone. A study has claimed that most bosses lack the ability to empathise with co-workers. It found that most people who rise to a position of power are emotionally inept compared to their lower employees. Travis Bradberry, president of California's TalentSmart, carried out a study on emotional intelligence. In an article for Forbes he said more senior people lack empathy (stock image shown). He found that CEOs had the lowest emotional intelligence (EQ) of anyone in the workplace . Ironically those who are most successful in their positions tend to be the ones who can emotionally connect with others. Writing for Forbes, the president of California-based company TalentSmart - Travis Bradberry - laid out his findings. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability by a person to express and control their own emotions. It is also the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others. Those with a high EI are able to emphasise more with other people and have a greater emotional maturity. Those with a lower EI are not always conscious about what others may be feeling and also find it more difficult to control their own emotions. He analysed the emotional intelligence of more than a million profiles in their database across a range of professions. He found that, the higher up in a company you go, the lower your emotional intelligence becomes. Middle managers were found to have the highest levels, around 77 per cent. But it was a steady decline with promotions from here, dropping to just over 70 per cent for CEOs - the lowest in the workplace. However, he also found that the top performers in each category were those with the highest EQ scores. Mr Bradberry suggests, therefore, that getting promoted into a position of power doesn't necessarily mean you need to have a low EQ. Middle managers were the most empathetic with co-workers (stock image shown) in the study. The top performers for any level were always the people with highest EQ . ‘Whether you’re a leader now or may become one in the future, you don’t have to succumb to this trend,’ Mr Bradberry wrote. ‘Your emotional intelligence is completely under your control. ‘Work on your EQ and it will boost your performance now and ensure that you don’t experience declines as you climb the corporate ladder.'","Travis Bradberry, president of California's TalentSmart, carried out study .

"Justin Bieber was announced today the new underwear model for Calvin Klein. The 20-year-old pop star's new role had many teenagers swooning, but most women were  underwhelmed by the news, with one commenting on Twitter, 'that's an anti-marketing strategy'. But from Mark Wahlberg to Jamie Dornan, the Baby singer is just the latest in a long line of muscle-bound hunks to pull on Calvin's clinging briefs - we examine how he matches up. Scroll down for video . Justin Bieber joins  an elite group of actors, models and sportsmen who've modelled Calvin Klein underwear . Certainly the teen sensation has divided opinion, with one woman on Twitter writing, 'I just lost all respect for Calvin Klein when you put that idiot on their ads. Ughh so annoying'. Justin looked predictably smug in the black and white images, staring into the camera with what has become his trademark furrowed brow. And who can blame him? By signing up to the campaign, Justin has joined the ranks of an elite group of male actors, models and sportsmen who have filled Calvin Klein's white cotton smalls. From Mark Wahlberg, who took the campaign global in 1992 to Twilight's Kellan Lutz, there has always been a stir around the designer's underwear campaigns. While before finding fame in The Fall and Fifty Shades Of Grey, Jamie Dornan also tried his hand at posing in the buff while looking moodily into the distance. So does Justin Bieber really live up to his predecessors' legacy? Or did Mr Klein drop the ball (no pun intended) on this one? FEMAIL has dug out the finest male Calvin Klein underwear ads of all time. We'll let you decide whether Justin's posing is perfect or a bit pants... Mark Wahlberg posed in a series of underwear ads for Calvin Klein in 1992 that were shot by Herb Ritts . Mark got intimate with a little-known British model called Kate Moss, who appeared topless, for the pictures . Although the adverts have done wonders for the careers of several men, there are mixed emotions from the stars about their involvement in the campaigns. Mark Wahlberg once said of his shoot with Kate Moss: 'The underwear modelling I did for Calvin Klein with Kate Moss was not good in retrospect, but at the time it got me a lot of attention from the ladies. 'Explaining that – along with the rap career – to my kids is going to be embarrassing when they are old enough to ask.' Meanwhile, Jamie Dornan, who is soon to become a global film star when Fifty Shades Of Grey is released, says underwear modelling was a sound financial decision. He said: 'I got lucky with that gig because quite early on I could be picky about what I did, where I did it. 'And because I was on contracts, I was working maybe 10 days a year and getting paid really well for it.' Before the buzz around Fifty Shades Of Grey, in 2009 Jamie Dornan was an underwear model for Calvin Klein . American model Garrett Neff is best known for his Calvin Klein ad campaigns, including this 2010 snap . American model Brandon Stoughton also appeared in the Britney Spears' Womanizer music video . Vladimir Ivanov has done several high profile campaigns, like this 2010 swimwear ad shot by Sebastian Kim . Djimon Hounsou is an actor and model who famously starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond . Australian actor and former model Travis Fimmel became the first man to be given a six-figure deal to model exclusively for Calvin Klein for a year and fronted CK's Crave fragrance campaign . US actor Antonio Sabato Jr began his career posing with his Calvin Klein adverts.

Swedish footballer Fredrik Ljungberg played for Arsenal and regularly modelled for Calvin Klein until 2007 .

"Petrol should already be down to around £1 a litre following the dramatic collapse in the price of oil, campaigners claimed last night. Prices on forecourts across Britain have fallen by around 15 per cent since the summer with petrol now costing an average of £1.11 a litre and diesel £1.18. But critics insist that because the oil has fallen in value by more than 50 per cent since June, prices should be around 10p lower – which would mean a litre of petrol costing just over £1. Prices on forecourts across Britain have fallen by around 15 per cent since the summer with petrol now costing an average of £1.11 a litre and diesel £1.18. Above, file image . Although the price of petrol and other essentials are falling, it is feared that households are not getting the savings they should from the slump in oil. Crude oil, which affects the cost of everything from diesel to food, sank below 50 dollars a barrel yesterday for the first time in nearly six years – having traded at 115 dollars as recently as June. George Osborne this week urged firms to slash their prices as politicians battled to show they are on the side of consumers. The Chancellor said it was ‘vital’ that the fall in the price of oil ‘is passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares’. Backbench Labour MP Rob Flello last night told the Mail that he is planning to table a so-called ‘early day motion’ in Parliament – possibly as soon as today – calling for an investigation into fuel prices in the UK. He said that ‘prices at the pumps should be decreasing in line’ with the fall in the oil price but added ‘this is not the case’. George Osborne, pictured, this week urged firms to slash their prices as politicians battled to show they are on the side of consumers . The MP for Stoke-on-Trent South said: ‘Why is it that petrol prices can rise very quickly when the oil price goes up but do not fall equally quickly when the price goes down?’ Campaigners also questioned why diesel costs more than petrol and is not falling as fast. Motoring journalist Quentin Willson, part of the FairFuelUK campaign, said drivers are ‘incandescent with rage that these historic oil price falls are not accurately reflected at the pump’ and insisted the cost of a litre should be 10p lower. ‘Someone is profiteering by fleecing 32million UK motorists,’ he added. The price of filling up a family car with a 70-litre tank with unleaded petrol has fallen from around £92 to £78 since the summer. Cutting the price of fuel by another 10p a litre would save motorists a further £7. Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said: ‘Someone is ripping off the tax paying road user. It’s not just the Government who takes 70 per cent in tax every time we fill up, unknown commercial operators are holding back on cutting pump prices for personal gain.’ The AA said that with petrol at £1.11 a litre, the Government takes 76p in duty and VAT, while forecourt owners make between 4p and 6p in profit. The cost of the product itself is just 25p. Britain’s major supermarkets are waging a brutal petrol price war in a desperate attempt to win over customers, with Asda announcing a 2p cut in its petrol price this week, meaning a new maximum charge of £1.07 a litre. The RAC has said there is ‘every reason to think petrol at under £1 in early 2015 is a very real prospect’. But Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent garages, said: ‘Petrol retailers are passing on the lower oil cost to their customers.’ Families are being robbed of £140 a year by the ‘big six’ energy giants because they have failed to pass on falls in the cost of gas and electricity, it is claimed. The wholesale price of gas is down by some 30 per cent in the past year, while electricity is down by 15 per cent. However, the companies have refused to pass on this reduction, and have pocketed some £2billion that should have been handed over to millions of struggling customers. Around 60 per cent of households, or 14.4million, are on standard variable tariffs which industry analysts and consumer groups say should have meant their bills fell over the past year. Industry regulator Ofgem has asked the Competition & Markets Authority to launch a full inquiry into the market. But this will take more than a year and Ofgem has no powers to force the ‘big six’ suppliers – British Gas, SSE, EDF, Eon, Npower and Scottish Power – to pass on a fair cut in bills. Calculations by industry experts TheEnergyShop.com suggest consumers should have seen a fall of £140 in the average annual bill of £1,225 if the drop in wholesale prices had been passed on. Energy analysts ICIS Heren said there is currently a glut of gas and wholesale prices will continue to fall through 2015. Energy firms argue they buy energy far advance so it takes time for lower prices to feed through.","Petrol prices in Britain have fallen by around 15 per cent since the summer .

"Scientists have been searching for the key to anti-ageing for years, but one woman from Hull reckons she has found the answer -dating younger men. Laila Gledhill, 61, doesn't look a day over 40 and she claims it is all down to the age of the men that she dates. Since turning 40 more than two decades ago, Laila has married a 22-year-old army officer, been engaged to a 27-year-old, and is currently dating a university postgraduate student. Laila Gledhill, 61, from Hull, doesn't look a day over 35 and says it's down to dating toyboys. In last 20 years, she was married to a soldier, 22, engaged to a 27 year old and she now dates a university student . Laila claims to have dated over thirty toyboys in her life, who she meets either through online dating website ToyBoyWarehouse.com or on a night out. The administrative officer from Hull, Yorkshire said: 'No man over 40 has ever approached me. 'Dating toyboys has kept me looking young and given me a zest for life. 'I feel like my appearance has stood still in time because of the way younger men treat me. 'From my experience, younger men treat older women with respect, find them infinitely more attractive and genuinely enjoy their company. And the sex is so much better. 'Older men often have baggage and a bigger belly. Why should I be with a sixty-year-old man when I can be one who is twenty-four? Laila claims to have dated over thirty toyboys in her life, who she meets either through online dating website ToyBoyWarehouse.com or on a night out. (pictured on holiday in Egypt last August) While her contemporaries collect their free bus passes, Laila can be found in nightclubs being approached by young professionals or holidaying with mates who are decades younger. In fact, she has often found herself to be the object of envy of younger women (pictured on holiday in Egypt last August) While her contemporaries collect their free bus passes, Laila can be found in nightclubs being approached by young professionals or holidaying with mates who are decades younger. In fact, she has often found herself to be the object of envy of younger women. Laila said: 'A group of twenty-something women became jealous of me when their boyfriends remarked that I was attractive. 'The girls made some nasty comments regarding my body, saying that it must be wrinkly under my clothes. 'So to show them, I took some racy photos of me in my swimwear and posted them to Facebook!' Laila wasn't always a cougar though. In fact, her adult life started very conventionally, when she married her childhood sweetheart, Marcus aged 27. Laila wasn't always a cougar,  her adult life started very conventionally, when she married her childhood sweetheart, Marcus aged 27 (pictured) After fourteen years of marriage, Laila's first husband Marcus declared that he was leaving her for a younger woman . 'We met when I was seventeen and we married each other a decade later. 'Although even Marcus was two years younger than me - I like to consider him my first toyboy!' But after fourteen years of marriage, Marcus declared that he was leaving Laila for a younger woman. She said: 'He was my first love. We had known each other since we were teenagers. 'But now Marcus was telling me he wanted to leave me for a woman in her early thirties who was thinner, taller and prettier than me. 'Marcus walking out on me made me really think about what I deserved in life and from men. 'He had met me as a young woman and now he said I was too old for him. I knew there had to be younger men out there who truly appreciated me and for my age too. And a few weeks later, the now 41-year-old divorcee met a handsome 21-year-old army officer called David. Laila aged 42, with her 21-year-old army officer husband David on the day of their wedding . Laila adds: 'It was so funny because a few months after walking out, Marcus called and begged me to take him back. 'I responded with ""Sorry Marcus but I've met someone who's younger  and fitter than you"". 'Divorcing Marcus and meeting David was a huge turning point for me. I realised I didn't have to settle for someone just because he was my own age. 'There were men decades younger than myself who fancied me.' David fell head-over-heels in love with Laila and popped the question after a year of dating. Laila Gledhill, 61, doesn't look a day over 35 and she claims it is all down to the age of the men that she dates . When he was posted to Germany, they moved together and the pair were happily married for five years. But David's parents disliked the fact that Laila was much older than him. She said: 'His family were unhappy about the age gap between David and I. That finally came between us and we split up. 'But today, we are still friends and what happened during our marriage is water under the bridge. 'David still rings me on a daily basis and he hasn't met anyone else since. 'He is 40-years-old now and ironically, I still date under that age. Life is strange.' Laila admits that prejudice towards older women dating toyboys has been something that she has encountered all of her life. She said: 'It's very sad that people can be so critical about age-gap relationships. Some don't understand why a young man would go out with an older woman. 'But several twenty-something men have told me that they just don't like dating young women because they're needy, moody, materialistic and want to be treated like princesses. 'Older women are independent, confident, sexy and have all of the material things they could wish for.' Laila was 55 at the end of her second marriage, but she regained her confidence by dating a man called Peter who was just 28 years old. Two years later, he proposed. They were happily engaged for two more years after that until Laila had suspicions that Peter was cheating on her. She said: 'I was on Peter's emails and I noticed some messages from a online dating website called 'ToyBoy Warehouse' in his Inbox, so I did some research. 'I joined that dating website to see what he was up to and discovered that he was messaging other older women, so I broke up with him immediately.'

However, there was a silver lining to the revelation that Peter was cheating. Laila explains: 'When I joined ToyBoyWarehouse.com, I was bombarded by hundreds of messages and compliments from young professional men. 'I couldn't even respond to all of them - there were so many that it was like being in a sweet shop full of good looking toyboys. 'So I decided to stay on the website.' Laila hasn't looked back since Peter and now she uses toyboywarehouse.com as her primary way of meeting toyboys - she is currently dating a few young men from the site. Apart from her dates with young men, Laila enjoys a sensible diet and does regular, moderate exercise to maintain her youthful appearance. She said: 'I eat sensibly - lots of chicken, lemon and fruits and I take long walks and do belly dancing at home.

They have great jobs and great friends. We don't have to settle anymore. 'We can pick and choose the men that we want to date. In my mother's generation for example, it was a different situation. 'My mother had to rely on my father for everything and she didn't have the freedom in middle-age that I have now. 'If a woman wants to date toyboys, they should. There's no problem with it.

'They were in the area doing manoeuvres as part of the training process,' Texas Department of Public Safety Corporal Nick Hill told NBC. 'They started to experience engine issues at the particular point, began to elevate the plane, continued to experience engine issues and then began to land the plane on FM 455.'

"Florida State University's star quarterback Jameis Winston is leaving college to enter the 2015 NFL draft, he revealed today. On the same day that Winston announced he's going pro, the woman who accused him of raping her filed a lawsuit against FSU - alleging that the university failed to investigate her claims and did nothing to stop her being bullied and threatened until she was forced to drop out. 'FSU became a sexually hostile environment where her rapist roamed free and could turn up at any moment, where she became the target of death threats and vilification campaigns,' the lawsuit says, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Winston, a 21-year-old junior, says the 2012 sexual encounter with the woman was consensual and has denied that he raped her. The prosecuting attorney's office said there was not enough evidence to charge him. And last month a Florida State University ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoing. Jameis Winston is expected to be picked early in the first round of the 2015 NFL draft - despite the specter of rape allegations hanging over him . Winston has said that the sex with his rape accuser was consensual. He was never charged with a crime and last month he was cleared of wrongdoing by an investigative panel at FSU . The rape allegations - along with off-the-field antics, including a shoplifting citation - are likely to keep Winston from being the no. 1 prospect in the NFL draft. But, with numerous teams desperate for a talented quarterback, he's still expected to be drafted early in the first round. 'After weighing this decision with my family and friends, I have decided to declare for the 2015 NFL draft and forgo my remaining eligibility at Florida State. I reached this very difficult decision after careful consideration and long thought, realizing how difficult it would be to say goodbye to my family at Florida State,' Winston said in a statement on Wednesday. November 25, 2012 - Winston and a teammate are stopped by police after calls 911 because they were shooting squirrels with a pellet gun . November 25, 2012 - Hours later, police are again called over a BB gun battle between Winston and teammates. Damage to their off-campus apartment is estimated at $4,000. December 7, 2012 - Winston is accused of raping an FSU student at his off-campus apartment. July 21, 2013 - Winston is accused of filling his cup from a Burger King soda fountain without paying for it. April 29, 2014 - Winston is stopped by police and cited for stealing $33 worth of crab legs from grocery store. He claims he 'forgot' to pay for them. May 20, 2014 - Winston refuses to show up to a student code of conduct hearing meant to investigate the sexual assault allegations. September 16, 2014 - Winston reportedly jumps on a table in an FSU cafeteria and shouts 'f*** her right in the p***y!' He is suspended for half a game and apologizes. October 13, 2014 - Winston is accused of selling autographed memorabilia, a violation of NCAA rules. He denied the allegations and said 1,000 items with his signature were forgeries. Winston - a 6-foot-4, 230lb quarterback - won the Heisman Trophy in 2013 and led Florida State to a 14-0 season and a national championship. FSU went undefeated again in 2014 - but lost to Oregon last week in the college football playoffs. The Orlando Sentinel reports that on Wednesday, as news was breaking that Winston is headed to the NFL, the woman who accused him of sexually assault filed a federal lawsuit against FSU. The woman, who is identified as 'Jane Doe,' alleges that Florida State violated federal Title IX laws with a 'clearly unreasonable response' to her rape allegations and allowed a 'hostile education environment.' The US Department of Education has launched its own Title IX investigation . The lawsuit details how after she reported that she was raped by Winston on December 7, 2012, FSU athletics officials repeatedly contacted the Tallahassee police detective on the case. When a reported contacted the Tallahassee police to inquire about the rape allegation - nearly a year later, a records clerk forwarded the request to the Florida State University police chief David Perry - who then sent it to athletic director Monk Bonasorte. Despite knowing about the rape allegations, the officials allowed Winston to suit up for the Seminoles for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. When the allegations against Winston were revealed, the accuser says, her name was leaked several places online. She began receiving death threats and someone slashed the tires on a car that was parked at her sorority house. She was forced to drop out just days later. The lawsuit does not name either the Tallahassee Police Department or Winston. It instead focuses on the conduct of Florida State. The university has not responded to the allegations.","Winston is leaving Florida State University and is expected to be picked early in the first round of the NFL draft .

"A retired scientist was killed on a cruise ship when he was struck on the head by a window frame that was broken by a freak wave in the English Channel, an inquest has heard. James Swinstead, 85, died 'almost instantly' on board the British vessel Marco Polo as it was battered by waves during severe storms on Valentine's Day last year. His wife of 58 years, Helen, was dining with her husband when water crashed through a window, injuring him and a number of the 735 passengers on board the 22,000-tonne vessel. Tragedy: James Swinstead, 85, and his wife of 58 years, Helen, were dining on board the British vessel Marco Polo, when a freak wave hit the cruise ship, breaking a window which hit Mr Swinstead . The ship, operated by Cruise and Maritime Voyages, was heading for its home port of Tilbury in Essex at the end of a 42-night voyage when the storm hit. The Marco Polo was carrying 735 passengers, most of them British, at the time of the incident. Mr Akhurst told the hearing that 16 passengers and crew members were injured. A female passenger in her 70s was airlifted off the ship. Many of the injured suffered cuts from flying glass. Essex Coroner's Court heard that the grandfather-of-three and his wife Helen were sitting at a restaurant table next to a window when the wave hit. Questions unanswered: Helen Swinstead said the inquest did not provide full closure . Two windows were smashed and two others were dislodged but did not shatter. Forensic pathologist Dr David Rouse told the inquest that Mr Swinstead suffered a fractured skull and extensive brain damage. His report found that the death was 'consistent with an impact by or against a heavy object such as a window frame'. He said Mr Swinstead, of Colchester, suffered injuries usually seen in victims of car accidents, and that he was 'effectively dead' after the blow to the head. John Akhurst, deputy director for the Bahamas Maritime Authority, which carried out an investigation following the incident, said: 'There was a great deal of violence and force involved in what happened as the windows were smashed and dislodged.' He went on: 'We could not say with any confidence that there was anything to be alarmed with about the condition of those windows.' He said the ship was hit by a 'significantly large wave' amid 'phenomenal' sea conditions caused by a storm which had come across from the west sooner than expected. Mr Akhurst said the ship's assessment of weather forecasts was 'competent'. But, following his recommendation, the vessel now uses a more accurate bespoke weather forecasting service. He also found that the Marco Polo's safety management structure should be reviewed. But speaking after the hearing, Mrs Swinstead said she had noticed the window was rusting. When asked if the inquest had given her the answers she was looking for, she replied: 'No, not really, because why were we shown to the table by the window? 'There were rusty puddles on the windowsill. That's with hindsight. We sat there because it was a lovely view of a rough sea.' Mrs Swinstead claims the windows on Marco Polo were rusting and that there were rusty puddles on the windowsill by the table where her husband was hit . Her solicitor, Martyn Carr, said: 'I don't think there is any doubt when you look at the photographs those windows look, quite frankly, a bit dodgy. 'Perhaps the strength of the waves was extremely unusual, but you don't expect to be sitting in a restaurant and have the window come in on you. 'There are questions still to be answered about the strength of the windows.' Caroline Beasley-Murray, Senior Coroner for Essex, said: 'In light of all the evidence that has been heard before this court I shall record a conclusion on the record of inquest - that is answering how he died - that James Malcolm Swinstead died as a result of an accident, a tragic accident. 'He clearly was a much-loved gentleman.' Addressing Mrs Swinstead directly, she added: 'You have had the ordeal of sitting through this inquest this afternoon and you have done that with the utmost dignity.'","James Swinstead, 85, died after water crashed through cruise ship window .

"Support: Award-winning author Salman Rushdie, pictured, yesterday spoke out to condemn the attacks on the office of newspaper Charlie Hebdo . Author Salman Rushdie, whose book 'The Satanic Verses' prompted Iranian clergy to issue a death fatwa on him, has condemned the attack on the Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Speaking in support of the publication, which had its old offices burned down after printing cartoons that mocked the Prophet Muhammad, Mr Rushdie said 'religion deserves our fearless disrespect'. He added that the strike by suspected Al Qaeda militants, which left 12 dead, was a sign of the 'deadly mutation in the heart of Islam.' Mr Rushdie was named alongside Staphane Charbonnier, the newspaper's editor, on Al Qaeda's 'most wanted' list last year. This morning 12 people - including four of France's most revered cartoonists - were executed by masked attackers brandishing Kalashnikovs, who burst into the Charlie Hebdo headquarters. The militants opened fire on staff after seeking out journalists by name. Witnesses said the suspected Al Qaeda gunmen were heard to shout 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' – Arabic for 'God is great' – as they stalked the building. They headed straight for the paper's editor and cartoonist, Stephane Charbonnier, killing him and his police bodyguard. The security had been recruited to protect him after extremists firebombed the offices in 2011 over a satirical cartoon about the Prophet Mohammed. A year later, Mr Charbonnier famously dismissed threats against his life, declaring: 'I would rather die standing than live kneeling.' The militants also killed three other renowned cartoonists – men who had regularly satirised Islam – and the newspaper's deputy chief editor. They shot two policemen as they left the building. In a statement yesterday, Mr Rushdie said: 'Religion, a mediaeval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. 'This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today. 'I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. Scroll down for video . Stephane Charbonnier (centre right) and Salman Rushdie (bottom right) were named as two of nine men Al Qaeda were targeting. Their photos were printed alongside the caption 'a bullet a day keeps the infidel away' Massacre: This morning 12 people - including four of France's most revered cartoonists - were executed by masked attackers brandishing Kalashnikovs, who burst into the Charlie Hebdo headquarters . Target: The militants, pictured after the attack yesterday, killed four renowned cartoonists – men who had regularly satirised Islam – and the newspaper's deputy chief editor, as well as its editor-in-chief . ‘""Respect for religion"" has become a code phrase meaning ""fear of religion."" Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect.' Last February, Iranian clergy revived Salman Rushdie's death fatwa, 25 years after it was issued over his 'blasphemous' Satanic Verses. On February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on all Muslims to murder the award-winning author and anyone involved in the publication of his work. The religious ruling forced the award-winning writer into hiding, and Britain's ties with the Islamic republic were severely damaged. Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator, was stabbed to death in the face at work, a Norwegian publisher shot and an Italian publisher knifed. Editor Stephane Charbonnier, pictured, was also pictured in Al-Qaeda magazine Inspire on a list of nine men Al Qaeda was targetting, along with the caption 'a bullet a day keeps the infidel away' The award-winning author, pictured with his book The Satanic Verses, was forced into hiding after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini vowed to kill him, anyone involved in the book's publication, and anyone close to him . Thousands took to the streets to burn copies of the book and thirty-seven people were massacred in Sivas, Turkey, in a 1993 attack intended to target Aziz Nesin, the book's Turkish translator. More than two decades later, Rushdie emerged from hiding and is regularly seen at public events. The Satanic Verses, Rushdie's fourth novel, propelled the Indian-born writer into a storm of controversy that forced him into hiding for the best part of a decade. 'Religion, a mediaeval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. 'This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today. 'I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. '""Respect for religion’ has become a code phrase meaning ‘fear of religion."" 'Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect.' The title refers to the so-called 'satanic verses', a group of alleged Qur'anic verses that allow intercessory prayers to be made to three Pagan Meccan goddesses. The book's publication in 1988 sparked a wave of protest and condemnation from Muslims who accused it of blasphemy and mocking their faith. The following year, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Supreme Leader of Iran, issued a fatwā, or religious ruling, calling for Rushdie's death. The British government gave the writer round-the-clock police protection. Rushdie has received notices every year since the publication reminding him of the religious ruling. In 2012, Hassan Sanei, the head of the state-funded 15 Khordad, raised the bounty on Rushdie's head by $500,000 to $3.3million ($2million). He said Islamaphobic literature and films would not have been made if it weren't for the Satanic Verses. 'Surely if the sentence of the Imam had been carried out, the later insults in the form of caricatures, articles and the making of movies would not have occurred,' he said in a statement last February. 'I am adding another $500,000 to the reward for killing Salman Rushdie and anyone who carries out this sentence will receive the whole amount immediately.' Also in 2012, Rushdie became the subject of a computer game in Iran called The Stressful Life Of Salman Rushdie And Implementation Of His Verdict. The programme is intended to teach the younger generation about the 'highly important' fatwa. Crisis: The outrage and widespread chaos has lasted 25 years.

"The moment the sun dips below the horizon - a sunset - is a phenomena known to all on Earth, accompanied by fantastic colours and a transition from day to night. But a lesser known phenomenon has been captured by astronauts on the ISS, showing the moment of a moonset - when our largest natural satellite dips below the horizon. And remarkable ‘squashing’ effect, not always easily visible to observers on Earth, are also made apparent in the images. Scroll down for videos . Astronauts on the ISS have captured a 'squashed' moon from space (shown). A video from Nasa's Terry Virts from Maryland shows the effect in action. It occurs when the moon begins to dip below the horizon and the light must travel through the atmosphere and is refracted . The latest pictures were taken by Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts on the ISS. In a Vine showing the moon setting, Mr Virts said: ‘Moonset behind Earth’s atmosphere appears to land on a soft pillow of clouds.’ The moon’s appearance as a squashed orb is actually caused by refracting light, similar to the apparent bending of a pencil placed into a glass of water. Light passing from the vacuum of space through the air of Earth's atmosphere can get a bit bent, causing the effect. Depending on how much of the atmosphere has to go through - or how low the moon is through the horizon - the more squashed it will appear. This is because light from different parts of the moon reach the observer's eye at different speeds, so it doesn't look normal. The amazing video shows the moon slowly passing down through Earth’s atmosphere as the ISS makes its way around our planet. In the images  an odd ‘squashing’ effect can be seen as the moon makes its way down. When the ISS passed this moonrise, the light from the top part of the moon was moving through less air than that at the bottom - which is being viewed through Earth's atmosphere - causing the lower light to bend. According to astronomer Nick Howes, who works with the Kielder Observatory in the UK, this is due to an effect known as atmospherics. ‘Light passing through our atmosphere as seen from a vantage point on the ISS will be refracted; the amount of refraction is dependent on the airmass it passes through,’ he told MailOnline. ‘The moon being a relatively (as seen by the eye) large object across, the amount of refraction varies from top to bottom, causing the squashed effect.' The moon also turns slightly red (seen here) because the amount of refraction causes only particular wavelengths of light to be visible, in this case red, a similar effect to sunrise and sunset . He said you could ‘very tentatively’ liken the effect to a star appearing bent if you look at it in a glass of water. Astronomer Ninian Boyle also said the effect can actually be noticed from Earth in particular instances. ‘If you photograph moonrise and moonset, as I have done on many occasions, you’ll see the same effect - the moon looking like a slightly flattened orange,’ he said. From the moon looking at Earth (picture from Apollo 8 in December 1978 shown), no such 'squashing' effect is visible because the moon has no atmosphere .","Astronauts on the ISS have captured the illusion of our moon being 'squashed' in space .

"'It absolutely must be defended': Tine Fey responded to the shooting at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo today, saying it's a reminder of the importance of defending free speech . Funny woman Tina Fey turned serious this morning when she was asked to weigh in on the tragic shooting at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The attack, which has left a dozen dead so far, is believed to have been carried out by Muslim radicals furious with the publication's parody of the prophet Mohammed. 'Obviously, that news is terrible and tragic and upsetting,' Fey said Wednesday morning, at a television press event in Pasadena, California. 'You look at that and you look at the controversy surrounding The Interview, it makes you think about how important free speech is and how it absolutely must be defended. '[We] cannot back down on free speech in any way. We all have to stand firm on the issue of free speech,' she said. Both Charlie Hebdo's cartoons and The Interview have been criticized for their base humor, which some have argued is not worth the controversy they sparked. But Fey says it doesn't matter the quality or type of humor, all speech should be defended no matter what. 'We’re Americans,and even if it’s dumb jokes in The Interview, we have the right to make them,' Fey said. A reporter went on to ask Fey if she had ever felt pressure to censor herself when dealing with controversial topics. She responded that she often dealt with such topics anchoring Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live. 'But even that was a different era, because in a social media era where you make a joke on American TV and it can go worldwide, it’s a different environment,' Fey detailed. During her time writing and starring on long-running comedy 30 Rock, Fey also parodied the North Korean regime by casting actress Margaret Cho to play Kim Jong-il, current DPRK leader Kim Jong-un's father and ppredecessor . Fey spoke on the first day of the Television Critics Association winter tour in order to promote her new series on Netflix, Unbreakable Kimmie Schmidt.

"Keen golfers can have their very own putting paradise if they snap up this luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods. The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was one of the homes shared by the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, before their six-year marriage fell apart in 2010. The 62-acre island features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge, its very own landing strip for propeller planes as well as, of course, six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole. Very private: The 62-acre island previously home to Tiger Woods and his ex-wife Elin Nordegren . Riches: The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was just one of the homes shared by golfer and his ex-wife . Secluded: The island's villa, built from wood cut from the island itself, according to the estate agents . Serene: The residence on the island is apparently the only home for many miles around . Rustic: Yet the wooden construction also includes modern conveniences like a hot tub and gas barbecue . Kitted out: The kitchen, including breakfast bar, wood-burning stove and a disguised extractor fan . Welcoming: The bedroom. Tiger Woods and his wife split after his infidelity became public . Room to live: The kitchen and living room share an open plan space with the wood ceiling rising high above . It also includes a protected quay, a private ferry boat, a historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnpälsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres. But potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building comes unfurnished. Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands, who are listing the island, told Mercury Press Agency: 'This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more. 'This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. 'It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion. 'Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice. 'The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn.

Neigh: These are the stables on the island which, along with the private pasture, would be great for horses . Well lit: As darkness falls, you can see the house is tastefully illuminated by a number of external lights . Is that an outside swimming pool? If so, it's an ambitious choice for Sweden, with its long, chilly winters... A luxury yacht on the island: The protected quay catches the evening sun and it's only an hour's boat ride from the island to the Stockholm archipelago and the sights and sounds of the Swedish capital . Happy times: Tiger bought the place when married to Swede Elin . 'Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing.

Warren says she's not competing for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, but that hasn't deterred her fans, who are holding her up as a left-wing alternative to Hillary Clinton.

Elizabeth Warren took a subtle jab at the Clintons today during the AFL-CIO National Summit at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. She mentioned neither the former first lady nor President Bill Clinton by name but took shots at his oversight of the financial sector and ridiculed Democrats as well as Republicans for weakening regulations on the banking industry . According to Politico, Clinton has already approached former aide Robby Mook, her likely campaign manager, and Joel Benenson, President Barack Obama's pollster, to join her team. 'She has said that she is seriously considering running for president. She’s casting a wide net, meeting with a variety of experts to discuss the economy and a range of challenges facing American families. And she’s using this time to look at what components are necessary to build an inclusive, thoughtful and technically advanced campaign, so that if she decides to run, she’ll be ready,' a source familiar with her plans told the news publication. Clinton is known to have been meeting with potential campaign managers throughout the last two months. Guy Cecil, a veteran of Clinton's 2008 campaign for president presumed to be on the short list for the job, revealed in late December that he'd met with Clinton but wouldn't be running point if she gets into the race, as widely expected. 'I have spent time with Secretary Clinton encouraging her to run because I believe our country needs her vision and leadership,' the former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director told Politico. 'I have offered her my full support and will be her most vocal volunteer, but after 10 years of some of the toughest campaigns around, I am eager to try my hand at something new and to serve my country in a different way.' Mook has also been named as a top contender to serve as Clinton's chief strategist and his close friend and fellow Clinton '08 alum Marlon Marshall is anticipated to serve as his right hand man if he's tapped for the job. Marshall served as a special assistant to the president until last Friday when he left the administration to return to the grassroots consulting firm he helped found after the 2012 presidential election, 270 Strategies. Clinton has stayed mum over the last few weeks about which way she is leaning, but her talks with top Democratic strategists suggest she's in the process of building a campaign apparatus and could formally enter the race in late March after she's made her last paid appearance. The former secretary of state has confirmed engagements through March 19 and is unlikely to launch her campaign until she's off the speaking circuit, which helped her add more than $5 million in the last two years to her personal wealth. The nest egg could come in handy if Clinton needs to dip into her personal funds again to help buoy her presidential campaign. The money she earned for the paid speeches could prove as much trouble as it's worth, though, as she could find herself spending million in the primary fending off attacks from her own party over payments she has receive from financial services executives to address various industry gatherings. Progressives worry she wouldn't take a heavy enough hand to Wall Street, which also served as a source of funding for her 2006 Senate campaign. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton depart the former Governor of New York Mario Cuomo's funeral in Manhattan, New York on Tuesday. Hillary is expected to announce her candidacy for president sometime this spring . Clinton has publicly wailed against the 'shadow banking system that operated without accountability' in a speech before the New America Foundation in March, yet she is also said to have privately assured banking executives, whom she charges roughly $200,000 a pop to have her come speak, that she finds attacks on the industry discomforting. An account of a speech she made to Goldman Sachs published in Politico in December of 2013 described her as more or less telling investors: 'We all got into this mess together, and we’re all going to have to work together to get out of it' and that 'beating up the finance industry isn’t going to improve the economy—it needs to stop.' Warren indirectly tapped into progressives' concerns that Clinton is talking out of both sides of her mouth today at an AFL-CIO National Summit on Raising Wages. 'Pretty much the whole Republican Party, and, if we’re going to be honest, too many Dems, have talked about the evils of Big Government and called for deregulation,' Warren said in remarks taped by Republican opposition research firm America Rising. 'It all sounded good but what it was really about was tying the hands of regulators and turning loose big banks and giant international corporations to do whatever they wanted to do; turning them loose to rig the market and reduce competition; turning them loose to outsource more jobs; turning them loose to load up on more risks and then hide behind taxpayer guarantees; turning them loose to sell more mortgages and credit cards that cheated American families,' she continued. Warren later said, 'For more than 30 years Washington has far too often advanced policies that hammer America’s middle class even harder. 'Look at the choices that Washington has made, the choices that have left America’s working families in a deep hole, the choice to leash up the financial cops, the choice in a recession to bail out the biggest banks with no strings attached while families suffered,' she added. Included in the last 30 years of presidents is, of course, Bill Clinton, who served two terms from 1993 to 2000. Under Clinton's watch the banking industry saw a serious cut back in regulations after Congress repealed the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. In a 2008 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek Clinton contended that the changes he signed into law almost a decade before weren't as steep as his detractors made them out to be. 'It wasn't a complete deregulation at all. We still have heavy regulations and insurance on bank deposits, requirements on banks for capital and for disclosure,' he said at the time. 'But I have really thought about this a lot. I don't see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis.' Clinton took responsibility for his role in the trim down and said he couldn't 'blame' Republicans in Congress who led the charge against the deregulating the banking industry. 'This wasn't something they forced me into. I really believed that given the level of oversight of banks and their ability to have more patient capital, if you made it possible for [commercial banks] to go into the investment banking business as Continental European investment banks could always do, that it might give us a more stable source of long-term investment,' he said. The former president also backed the federal government's bailout of banking industry giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and argued that it was 'necessary' to dig Bear Sterns out of the hole it had gotten itself into. 'And it worked. It just didn't stem the tide because of the underlying massive amount of unsustainable debt in the real estate market, both residential and commercial,' he said. In fact, Clinton said he would have went further and offered the now defunct Lehman Brothers a line of credit similar to what the government offered AIG. Progressives were quick to applaud Warren's remarks today after they made their way into news reports. 'This morning, Senator Elizabeth Warren clearly articulated the kind of far-reaching progressive vision Americans want to hear in the next Presidential campaign,' Charles Chamberlain, Executive Director, Democracy for America said in a statement . 'Ultimately, that's why more than 189,891 people across the country have already signed on to the Run Warren Run campaign urging her to jump into the 2016 race.' In his prepared speech AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Warren in 'an inspiration' and 'her vision of a Raising Wages America embodies our highest ideals. 'Senator Warren is that rare political leader: she shares out values, she really connects with us, she is a genius when it comes to policy, and she is tough as nails when it comes to politics,' Trumka said, according to CNN. Asked later about Hillary Clinton, Trumka didn't offer as glowing a profile. 'I think that Hillary did an excellent job as secretary of state. I think she is very, very qualified to be president,' he told reporters at a breakfast Washington. 'Would I say she is the favorite now? Yes. But I think anytime anybody believes there is going to be a coronation, that is dangerous for the candidate.","She mentioned neither the former first lady nor President Bill Clinton by name but took shots at his oversight of the financial sector .

"A young schoolgirl was horrified to discover six metal nails in her chicken and chips from the family's favourite local takeaway. Mollie Howe, 11, had been just about to tuck in to her tea when she spotted the inch-long nails in the £1.30 meal. Her furious mother, Sharon Howe, 39, has now blasted the Red Rooster fast food outlet, in Dagenham, Essex, which served her daughter the dangerous meal. Mollie Howe (left) and her mother Sharon Howe (right) were horrified to discover six nails in her takeaway from Red Rooster in Dagenham, Essex . Ms Howe said: 'I'm just so glad Mollie didn't eat it - who knows what might have happened? She came home, opened it up and there were these six nails - just like the ones you hammer into the wall. 'It's even more worrying because my dad could have eaten it as he often goes there too. He's 81 and lives on his own.' Ms Howe, of Dagenham, Essex, added that her family had been regular customers at the Red Rooster takeaway for years - but none of them will be going back. 'It's almost an everyday thing because it's cheap and cheerful. But I definitely won't be going there again - it just isn't worth the risk,' said the mother-of-two. The lethal inch-long metal nails were discovered nestled amongst the 11-year-old's chicken and chips . Maumand Khan, who works at Red Rooster (pictured) apologised and said he was baffled as to how the nails had got into the schoolgirl's food . 'None of my family and friends will be using it either. 'I just want people to be aware of what happened because it could have been a lot worse if poor Mollie had started eating and swallowed those nails.' Ms Howe said she was so outraged that she immediately went to confront staff at Red Rooster with her son Reece Hare, 21. 'I was so angry that my son wouldn't even let me go in there to see them,' she admitted. 'He went in instead and told them about it and they just wanted to offer him more food - it's not good enough.' Maumand Khan, who works at the takeaway, said he was baffled as to how the nails had got into Mollie's food. Mr Khan said: 'We are terribly sorry, but we can't understand how this has happened. 'We don't have that kind of nail anywhere in the shop.' He said they had not had any other complaints of this nature since the Red Rooster opened back in 2000. Furious Ms Howe, 39, has now said the family will never return to their local takeaway, which they used to visit on an almost daily basis .","Mollie Howe was about to tuck into her tea from Red Rooster, in Essex .

"Two men who fell in love are getting married but will be walking down the aisle as brides after both underwent a full sex change operation to become women. Parma Bertoli, 59, and partner Stephanie Nickles, 43, started a relationship back in 2004 when they were still men. Stephanie underwent a full sex change in 2006 after having the procedure funded by the NHS while Parma went under the knife to become a woman in 2008. Scroll down for video... Wedding plans: Parma Bertoli, pictured left, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour, with partner Stephanie Nickles, met when they were both men and hope to tie the knot next month . They couple, who live in Warndon, Worcester, had their birth certificates changed to reflect their new female identities. Next month the couple are preparing to don white dresses for their wedding. However, the couple have been forced to bring the big day forward after Parma was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour last October and was given less than 12 months to live. Parma, a former meat hygiene inspector, said: 'Steph and I got together when we were both men in 2004 and lived together as men. 'Steph was in pre-op so was living as a woman and I made the change soon after. 'Today we are still in love as women. Happy couple: Stephanie, pictured right, said tying the knot would 'make our lives whole' The 43-year-old said she was forced to give up her modelling career to care for Parma . 'To us, gender is not an issue in our relationship. We are just two people who met and tried to help each other along. 'I know I have a very limited amount of time left but it would mean the world to both of us to get married - it would be absolutely brilliant.' The couple got engaged while looking for jewellery in 2009 when Parma suddenly got down on one knee. Stephanie, who has two grown-up children from a previous marriage with whom she has no contact, added: 'We were out browsing commitment rings in a jewellers and when I turned round from a display cabinet I saw Parma down on one knee. 'She just said to me ""will you marry me?"" and of course I said yes. We bought our engagement rings there and then. The staff in the shop clapped, it was a wonderful moment.' But their life together was struck with tragedy when Parma started suffering severe headaches at the beginning of last year. Doctors diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive malignant brain tumour - but despite undergoing surgery she was told it was untreatable. Parma, left, was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive malignant brain tumour - in October last year and was given 12 months to live. The couple have now brought their wedding plans forward . Stephanie said it was a wonderful moment when Parma went down on one knee to propose while shopping . Last October medics at the Gloucestershire Oncology Centre broke the devastating news that she had between 12 and 18 months to live. Stephanie, who gave up her modelling career to care for Parma, said it was a 'struggle every day, not knowing if she is going to wake up'. She added: 'To get married would be such a huge thing for us and would make our lives whole in a way. 'We want to get married because we love each other and we are not sure if Parma will be here next year. 'Be we have not got the funds and we don't even have the money to buy rings.' They couple, who are hoping to get hitched at Worcester registry office next month, are now appealing for help and donations to make their dream wedding come true. Parma added: 'My fiancée has always wanted a special occasion and we are really having to bring it forward because my situation is quite bad. 'I am very lucky to have got this far through the support of my partner.' Parma, who has never been married and has no children, was born Paul Sandford while Stephanie was born John Hart. Appeal:Stephanie, right, has asked for donations from the public to make their 'dream wedding come true' Stephanie said: 'I had previously been married and we had two children. It was a very different life and I have no ties to them now. 'My family would probably want me six-feet under. I started living as a woman because it just felt right. 'I was going through the pre-op procedure when I met Parma but was still a man physically. Parma was also a man but was not pre-op. 'We met via a friend and hit it off immediately. We both loved military history, Parma loves old wartime motorbikes and I love anything to do with the military.' Despite dating for several months in 2004 they couple split up but got back together two years later after they became women. Stephanie added: 'We split up after a third party got involved and went our separate ways. 'I didn't even see Parma again for a couple of years until we bumped into each by chance. 'Strangely, I had gone through the sex change operation and was in London for counselling when I saw Parma waiting in the clinic. 'Our eyes met and I just said to her ""what on earth are you doing here?"" It turned out she was in pre-op and living as a full-time woman. 'It's strange to say it but we technically got together as men but found love as women. 'She took me for a coffee in London and we talked until midnight. We realised then that it was love and we moved in with each other very soon after that. 'We have been inseparable ever since. We know our time together now is short because of Parma's health but we want our wedding to be very special.'","Parma Bertoli and Stephanie Nickles met before they had operation in 2004 .

"Michael Salmon pictured leaving Reading Crown Court where he faces more than a dozen charges, including 11 counts of indecent assault and three counts of rape . A doctor who worked at a hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal assaulted a young girl after offering to check her breasts for cancer, a court has heard. Today the woman, now aged 48, told a jury at Reading Crown Court she was taken to see Michael Salmon by her boarding school matron after suffering from migraines. However, consultant Salmon asked the matron to leave the  room and offered to check the then-15-year-old's breasts for cancer before assaulting her, the court was told. Salmon, 79, was working as a consultant pediatrician at Buckingham Hospital, Buckinghamshire, in 1981, when teenager was taken to him for treatment. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the jury: 'I remember being taken into the room and I remember meeting Dr Salmon. 'I think there was a nurse from the hospital. I can't remember if it was a nurse or a matron from the school. Dr Salmon said she did not need to be in there and she left. 'I remember him talking to me about migraines and then he offered to check my breasts for breast cancer. 'He asked me to take off my top and bra and he checked my breasts. I remember seeing his hands and just looking. I remember being stunned and not understanding what was going on.' The alleged offence occurred when she was a pupil at Charmandean Boarding School in Buckinghamshire. She added:  'I remember being completely surprised and stunned. I didn't say anything.' Prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, Miranda Moore QC read a letter written to the woman's mother from Salmon, in which he described her as her 'charming daughter.' Cross-examining, Sarah Jones quizzed the woman on whether she remembered seeing Salmon for a second appointment and if she felt nervous. She replied: 'I do not recall. I imagine so but I do not know.' When questioned about whether she wanted the nurse to leave because she felt shy about removing her clothes, the witness replied: 'I was not expecting to remove my clothes, I want to be really clear about that.' She told the jury of five women and seven men: 'I am speaking here today because I did not speak when I was 15. I know what happened.' Smartly-dressed Salmon, wearing a blue and white checked shirt and suit, listened to proceedings using a hearing loop. The 79-year-old is on trial at Reading Crown Court where a judge previously heard how he abused his position as consultant paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire – where disgraced DJ Savile is said to have abused scores of patients while carrying out charity work. Jurors were told that although Salmon did not abuse victims ‘in concert’ with Savile, the sex attacks between 1973 and 1988 occurred at the same time as other offences. The court heard that the woman went to the police in December 2013 after her mother read about Salmon in the newspapers and asked her which doctor she had seen as a child. In a telephone call to her mother, she said: Don't talk to me about him because he is a perv.' The court heard she had undergone counselling since the alleged assault. Miss Jones said: 'If you knew it was wrong from as far ago as then, would it not have cropped up in at least one of your counselling sessions?' The witness said: 'No, there was other stuff to deal with.' When quizzed on why she did not object to the assault, the victim replied: 'It all happened so quickly. He was a doctor so I thought it must be okay. My mind was just going mad. I did not know if it was right or wrong but my head was just screaming. He was a doctor and I was a child.' The court heard that Salmon - while working as a consultant pediatrician at Buckingham Hospital (pictured) in 1981 - asked the girl to undress so he could give her a 'breast cancer check' Salmon is also facing charges for alleged offending at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where serial paedophile Jimmy Savile (pictured left and right) is said to have preyed on children . Miss Jones said: 'I would suggest that all Mr Salmon ever did to you was examine you appropriately at the start of your dealings with him and that was it.' She replied: 'That is not correct.' The witness' mother told the jury she was 'absolutely appalled' when her daughter told her what had happened. She said: 'It is an abuse of a position of trust. I said to her: ""it is up to you, but you could report it"".' Salmon, of Salisbury, Wiltshire, denies 11 counts of indecent assault, three counts of rape and two counts of procuring an instrument for abortion, which relate to eight victims aged between 11 and 18 years. The offences were alleged to have taken place between 1973 and 1988. The trial continues.

"One of two young Australians on death row in Bali has lost his final bid for clemency and is now likely to face death by a firing squad. Myuran Sukumaran, 33, was informed his plea for clemency had been rejected after a letter was hand-delivered to Bali's Kerobokan prison by an Indonesian government official on Wednesday, News Corp reports. A prisoner in Indonesia typically only learns of their impending execution 72 hours in advance, according to a report submitted to the United Nations Human Rights committee. Scroll down for video . Myuran Sukumaran, 33, was informed his plea for clemency had been rejected after a letter was hand-delivered to Bali's Kerobokan prison by an Indonesian government official on Wednesday . The letter, which was dated December 30, 2014 and has Indonesian president Joko Widodo's name printed underneath, claimed there was not enough reason for Sukumaran's clemency bid to be granted. The rejection letter eliminates almost all legal options to stop convicted the Bali Nine heroin smuggler's execution. Sukumaran and fellow Australian Andrew Chan have been on death row since they were convicted for their involvement in a plan to smuggle 8.2 kg of heroin from Bali to Sydney in 2002. Chan has yet to receive a decision on his clemency plea. 'My mum's on the floor, tears, crying and can't talk. My sister is in tears and can't talk. My brother's so shocked he didn't even know what to say. I've been walking around feeling like someone's punched me in the stomach,' Sukumaran told Fairfax Media via an intermediary. 'What use will executing us be? We don't deserve to be executed. Our families shouldn't have to suffer like this,' he said. 'Is there no such thing as rehabilitation??? Can't someone change????' The two men have lost all their appeals against the death sentence and were relying on the presidential clemency to protect them from facing the firing squad. It comes as President Widodo made it clear he wanted all 64 drug smugglers on death row to be executed and has ordered a number of them to take place this year. Firing squad: After a series of court appeals, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan are the sole remaining members of the Bali Nine who still face death by an Indonesian firing squad . Sukumaran and Chan based their clemency bids on the strong rehabilitation efforts they have made since they jailed at Kerobokan prison in 2005 . Both Sukumaran and Chan based their clemency bids on the strong rehabilitation efforts they have made since they were jailed at Kerobokan in 2005. Inmates on death row in Indonesia are executed by firing squad. A prisoner has the choice of standing or sitting. They also can decide whether to have their eyes covered. Firing squads are made up of 12 people: three have rifles loaded with live ammunition, while the other nine are loaded with blanks. The squad shoots from a distance  between five and 10 meters. A prisoner only learns of his impending execution 72 hours in advance. Sukumaran launched an art workshop so they could auction prisoner art behind bars to raise money for the prison. He also entered a self-portrait in the Archibald Prize last year. The 33-year-old was instrumental in setting up graphic art, English and computer courses at the prison. It is not clear how Sukumaran's recent clemency rejection will affect plans to lodge an application for judicial review. This appeal can be lodged when there is new evidence, but according to Fairfax Media lawyers are unsure if this can go ahead after a clemency bid has been rejected. Sukumaran’s Melbourne-based lawyer Julian McMahon has not ruled out going back to court saying the merits of his case needed proper consideration. Sukumaran Andrew Chan have been on death row since they were convicted for their involvement in a plan to smuggle 8.2 kg of heroin from Bali to Australia . He said the Indonesian Constitutional Court stated during Sukumaran's case on October 30, 2007 that a rehabilitated prisoner should be re-sentenced rather than be executed. 'Successive prison governors have said that Myuran and Andrew have done such good work in prison, so much rehabilitation work of themselves and others, that they should not be executed,' Mr McMahon told News Corp. 'What does it say about a system of clemency where the most rehabilitated prisoners who do the most good in prison face execution? Does anyone seriously think that Indonesia’s serious criminals are on death row?' Sukumaran himself questioned the Indonesian justice system, arguing that serious drug dealers are able to walk free through bribery. 'All the big drug dealers are free and clear to do what they want cause they pay people off big time! That is the only thing me and Andrew can't do, is to pay big money,' he told Fairfax Media. The Indonesian Government is currently debating a law that will determine how many times prisoners can apply for judicial reviews. Andrew Chan smiles in a holding cell at Denpasar Court after he was sentenced to death for heroin trafficking . Chan, who has also appealed for clemency, is studying to be a pastor and runs the jail's church. Daily Mail Australia revealed last month Chan had masterminded another international heroin smuggling attempt out of Hong Kong, which was to run at the same time as the Bali Nine drug operation. Chan enlisted Sydney teenager Rachel Diaz, 17, and Chris Vo, 15, as drug couriers to smuggle $1 million worth of heroin in condoms, which they were to swallow in Hong Kong and bring back to Australia. After his own arrest in Bali, Chan wrote a letter to Diaz in Hong Kong ordering her to keep her mouth shut. Diaz, Vo and their minder Hutchinson Tran, 22, were arrested in a low budget Hong Kong hotel room on April 12, 2005. Drug mule: Rachel Diaz was hired by Bali Nine mastermind Andrew Chan who, following her arrest and incarceration in a Hong Kong prison, wrote her a letter ordering her to keep her mouth shut . The hotel room in a seedy Hong Kong district where Rachel Diaz, 17, and Chris Vo, 15, were preparing to swallow 114 heroin-filled condoms and make the eight-hour flight back to Sydney . They were found with 114 condoms filled with up to 1kg of heroin - but Diaz had had second thoughts about taking part in the operation, for which they were to be paid $200 for each 5cm-long condom they injested. Diaz's father Ferdinand failed to get his daughter released on bail and 12 months after her arrest, she was sentenced to 10 years and eight months. Vo, by then 16, received nine years, and Tran got 13 years and four months. All have since been released, with Diaz serving out the majority of her sentence in a NSW women's prison after being transferred in February 2009 under the International Transfer of Prisoners' Act. Five days after her arrest, Bali police arrested Chan, Sukumaran and their mules Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens, Scott Rush, Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman, Michael Czugaj and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen. The seven couriers recruited by Chan and Sukumaran received sentences ranging from 18 years to life.","Myuran Sukumaran's bid for clemency rejected by President Joko Widodo .

"Al-Qaeda have released a video teaching their fighters how to make 'invisibility cloaks' to avoid detection from U.S. drones. In the 16-minute instruction video, called 'Combatting Spy Airplanes', the terrorist group in the Arabian Peninsula explains that the shield can be easily assembled using aluminium foil and twigs.

Al-Qaeda have released a video teaching their fighters how to make 'invisibility cloaks' to avoid detection from U.S. drones; above a militant armed with a gun, prepares to hide himself . The cloak works by stopping a U.S Predator drone's infrared camera from detecting human heat and is made by gluing aluminium foil to the outside of a tarpaulin . Scroll down for video . To make a shield, fighters are told to smear a body-sized tarpaulin with glue, before covering it in standard supermarket bought aluminum foil. More glue is then added, and the shield if covered with an additional tarpaulin. The shield can be further enhanced to offer protection during the day, the video explains, by painting it with camouflage colours, or by adding tree branches. It can also be easily folded up and carried. According to Rt.com it is not known if the shield works or not, but the premise is simple enough: if the drone can't detect fighters, it can't kill them. The website quotes analysis from the Middle East Research Institute as saying: 'The aluminum is supposed to act like a heat barrier, keeping the fighter's body heat from being detected by the drone camera system.' A video showing fighters how to make the cloak, called 'Combatting Spy Airplanes', was put out by the terrorist group in the Arabian Peninsula and is 16 minutes long . The instruction video was largely complied from U.S. military public relations videos; drone attacks have been ongoing in Yemen for 13 years and have stepped-up by U.S. President Barack Obama . A spokesman for US Central Command, which runs military operations on the Arabian Peninsula, has reportedly refused to comment on the 'effectiveness or ineffectiveness of specific enemy [tactics].'

"Prince Andrew’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein intimidated a pregnant journalist by asking where she was due to give birth, it was claimed yesterday . British-born writer Vicky Ward was so afraid of the American financier that she had security put on the intensive care ward where her premature twins were being treated. The Cambridge-educated journalist also described how Epstein, 61, showed off his intimacy with the 54-year-old prince by introducing him to friends as ‘Andy’. Scroll down for video . Prince Andrew’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein (right, with the Prince) intimidated a pregnant journalist by asking where she was due to give birth, it was claimed yesterday . Miss Ward, 45, said the billionaire paedophile tried both to charm her and to ‘control’ her when he learned she was writing an in-depth article about him in 2002. He got a female assistant to ring her up and tell her that he thought she looked ‘so pretty’ after their first meeting. But his attentions quickly turned more sinister as she delved deeper into the mystery of where he made his money and his taste for young women. Epstein rang her regularly, asking her about the ‘nature’ of the story she was going to write for Vanity Fair magazine. Miss Ward said he seemed ‘almost unconcerned’ about alleged financial irregularities she had uncovered, but repeatedly demanded to know: ‘What do you have on the girls?’ No comment: Zara Phillips fends off question about her uncle, the Duke of York .

She was asked about the scandal engulfing Prince Andrew during a question-and-answer session with media on Queensland’s Gold Coast. An unidentified male journalist asked Princess Anne’s daughter: ‘How is your uncle faring in the wake of all these allegations?’ Zara, who clearly didn’t expect the question, swiftly replied: ‘I’m not going to answer that.’ Zara, who has had extensive media training in her role as a professional sportswoman, took the question in her stride – but it was a sign of the growing pressure the Royal Family is under over the claims, which are fiercely denied, that Prince Andrew slept with an under-age ‘sex slave’ at parties held by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Event organisers looked horrified as Zara was asked the question. She is reportedly being paid a ‘small fortune’ to be an ambassador for the Magic Million event. Earlier this week the Duchess of York, who was on holiday with Andrew when the US court papers were lodged, spoke out in his defence. ‘He is the greatest man there is,’ she said. By Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent for the Daily Mail . The journalist tracked down two sisters from Phoenix, Arizona, who told her that the wealthy sex offender had tried to seduce them. Epstein allegedly molested the younger girl, who was then only 16, after promising to pay for her to travel abroad to get work experience that would help her get a place at a top US university. The girls’ mother told Miss Ward that she had feared that her daughters would be harmed after their ordeal. ‘The thing that frightened me was that he would know where they lived and could possibly just send somebody when they walk the dog at night or something around the corner, and we’d never hear from them again,’ the mother said. British-born writer Vicky Ward was so afraid of the American financier (pictured) that she had security put on the intensive care ward where her premature twins were being treated . When Epstein found out what the journalist had been told, he called her and Vanity Fair’s editor Graydon Carter and tried to get the girls’ claims removed from the article. Miss Ward reported that the financier told her: ‘Just the mention of a 16-year-old girl … carries the wrong impression. I don’t see what it adds to the piece. And that makes me unhappy.’ Mr Carter also received letters which claimed to be written by the sisters and their mother, but which the women insisted were fakes. Describing how Epstein ‘spooked’ her, the writer recalled how he got past security to enter her offices. When her twins were born dangerously prematurely, she was worried for their safety because the financier had asked at which hospital she was giving birth. Writing for the Daily Beast online news website, Miss Ward said: ‘I was so afraid that somehow, with all his connections to the academic and medical community, that he was coming for my little ones that I put security on them in the NICU [neonatal intensive care unit]. ‘When they’d been released home some months later, I went out to my first party. There was Jeffrey Epstein, sucking a lollipop. “Vicky,” he said, “you look so pretty”.’ In the end Vanity Fair’s editor decided not to include the girls’ claims that Epstein tried to seduce them because he had denied the allegations and they were ‘unsubstantiated’. Miss Ward wrote: ‘It has often struck me that if my piece had named the women, the FBI might have come after Epstein sooner and perhaps some of his victims, now, in the latest spate of allegations, allegedly either paid off or too fearful of retribution to speak up, would have been saved.’ Her original article, published in March 2003, referred to a cocktail party attended by Epstein and Prince Andrew that was filled with ‘young Russian models’.

"The drones are coming. Armies of flying robots are set to fill our skies, doing everything from delivering medical supplies to spraying crops and inspecting high-voltage cables. But for drones to make it to the big time, they will need to learn to get around in towns and cities - without falling on car hoods or crashing into pedestrians. Armies of flying robots are set to fill our skies, doing everything from delivering medical supplies to spraying crops and inspecting high-voltage cables. Pictured is a Deutsche Post DHL drone carrying a small parcel . In less than a decade, as many as 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide, according to aerospace consultancy Teal Group . Today, technology has advanced to the point where hobbyists can fly the unmanned aircraft with their iPhones. However, nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees, streetlights, buildings and even other drones. 'Most of these drones have very limited safety features,' says Maryanna Saenko, an analyst with science and technology consultancy Lux Research. If one crashes, 'it's a four- or five-pound brick coming out of the sky.' The ability to be fully autonomous will be critical before legions of drones can buzz over our neighbourhoods. Drones could help firefighters battling forest blazes by watching where flames are appearing without risking lives. In this photo, the Yamaha RMax unmanned helicopter sprays water over grapevines during a demonstration of its aerial application capabilities at the University of California . Some of the greatest dangers are close to airports, where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones. In December, a drone flying near Heathrow almost crashed into a passenger jet . Similar technology does exist. Commercial jets, for instance, are able to detect other planes in the sky and warn pilots of mountains in their path. In less than a decade, as many as 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide. However, nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees, streetlights, buildings and even other drones. This means if a drone falls out of the sky, it could feel like 5lb (2.2kg) brick dropping off a tall building. Some of the greatest dangers are close to airports, where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones. The FAA has reports of nearly 200 cases in the past 10 months where drones got too close for comfort to manned airplanes. Even the military, with its expert pilots, crashes drones. The Air Force has lost 116 unmanned aircraft in the last decade and now has a rate of about five destroyed for every 100,000 hours of flying time . The problem is how to make the detection system small, light and cheap enough to work on drones. Recent announcements at CES in Las Vegas suggest drones will be used for everything from food delivery to firefighting. For now, this all largely remains theoretical. Except for a few locations, U.S. airspace is closed to commercial drones with the dangers too great, according to regulators. If safety concerns can be overcome, one of the biggest industries ripe for drone use is farming. With the help of GPS mapping, drones can survey an entire farm, find bugs or soil that is too dry or too low in nutrients. They could then send the exact coordinates back to a tractor that will apply pesticide, water or fertiliser only to areas in need. There are 2,500 unmanned miniature helicopters currently used by farmers in Japan to spray pesticides in hilly areas where tractors might roll over. Similar drones are operating in South Korean and Australia. In the U.S., the $150,000 (£99,000) helicopters are being considered for the steep slopes of California vineyards. Meanwhile Amazon says its drone delivery service could someday get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less. Through its Prime Air service, Amazon aims to have drones flying 50 mph (80 kph) and capable of carrying up to 5lb (2.25kg). A security guard watches a demonstration of a DJI Technology Co. Inspire 1 drone in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong province. n less than a decade, 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide . 'They will become as normal as seeing delivery trucks driving down the street,' says Paul Misner, Amazon's global vice president of public policy. German delivery company Deutsche Post DHL is already testing a drone, but only to a remote tourist island in the North Sea and just for urgent deliveries of medicine. While companies wait, more and more hobbyists are putting drones in the skies. Many can be operated with an iPhone or Android smartphone, and some cost just $300 (£200). Some of the greatest danger of these small drones is close to airports, where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones. The FAA has reports of nearly 200 cases in the past 10 months where drones got too close for comfort to manned airplanes. Concerns over the lack of intelligence of these drones is attempted to be addressed by researchers worldwide. Pictured is a drone from DJI Technology . Even the military, with its expert pilots, crashes drones. The Air Force has lost 116 unmanned aircraft in the last decade and now has a rate of about five destroyed for every 100,000 hours of flying time . Concerns over the lack of intelligence of these drones is attempted to be addressed by researchers worldwide. Military drone-maker Aurora Flight Sciences, of Manassas, Virginia, for instance, is trying to tackle the challenge using echolocation. This sends out sound waves and detects the echo reflected by obstacles. It's similar to sonar on a submarine or the way bats fly around in the dark. Other companies are using optical sensors to search for obstacles. But those systems have challenges, including not working well in darkness or fog. TU Delft student Alec Momont shows his design of an ambulance drone with a built in defibrillator . The first uses are likely to be in remote, sparsely populated areas. Some of the proposed commercial applications for drones include: . Tackling dangerous jobs . Drones could be search places that aren't safe for humans, such as looking for survivors in collapsed buildings after an earthquake or inspecting nuclear power plants following a meltdown. They could also help firefighters battling forest blazes by watching where flames are appearing without risking lives. Helicopters often can't be used because their powerful rotors threaten to spread the fire. Scientists are also hoping drones will help conduct research inside volcanic ash clouds, hurricanes, tornadoes or other spots that are not safe for humans. Surveying large industry . According to industry experts, drones could be used to inspect miles of remote power lines quickly and at less cost. They may also have applications in surveying farmers' land, finding bugs or soil that is too dry or lacking nutrients, and then sending the exact GPS coordinates back to a tractor which will apply pesticide, water or fertiliser only to areas in need. Offering better vantage points . Drones could create that perfect shot for film directors.They may also allow media to find new ways to cover news and sports. Drones provided aerial television coverage of snowboard and ski jump competitions at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Other uses include photographing weddings, mapping coastal erosion and showing off homes and the surrounding neighborhoods for real estate agents looking to set their listings apart. Solving unique challenges . In the future, drones could help protect endangered animals by sending real-time video and thermal images of animals and poachers to wildlife rangers. They may also temporarily expanding cell phone reception at special events like the Super Bowl. Delivering packages might be years away but DHL is currently testing limited, urgent deliveries of medicine on a remote island in the North Sea. An image showing the path of  Phantom 2 Vision+ drone using long exposure photography. The FAA estimates that 7,500 drones – a third of all drones worldwide - will be flying in the U.S. within five years . In the United States, much of the work is being done at six government-approved drone test sites, all of which are connected with universities. They are among the few spots in the country where unmanned aircraft can be legally flown to test what works and what doesn't. 'This is a large sandbox right now,' says Ahmed Mahdy, a mechanical engineering professor at Texas A&M University's Corpus Christi campus, one of the test site operators. The FAA estimates that 7,500 drones – a third of all drones worldwide - will be flying in the U.S. within five years. The industry puts the number in the hundreds of thousands. Compare that to the four largest U.S. airlines, with their combined fleet of 4,728 planes. One of the most promising areas of application for drones is in farming. There are 2,500 unmanned miniature helicopters currently used by farmers in Japan to spray pesticides in hilly areas where tractors might roll over . 'The FAA is just scared to death,' says David Bridges, a mechanical engineering professor testing drones at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi. 'U.S. airspace is one of the safest in the world. It's their job to keep it that way.' FAA Administrator Michael Huerta says drone technology is promising but needs to be phased in responsibly. The Federal Aviation Administration plans to release guidelines soon about who can fly drones weighing less than 55lbs (25kg) and under what conditions. They might include the extremely stringent - and costly - requirement that operators have a pilot's license. That means some of the most ambitious drone ideas, like Amazon's package-delivery system, may have to wait. Today, technology has advanced to the point where hobbyists can fly the unmanned aircraft with their iPhones. However, nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees, streetlights, buildings and even other drones .","In less 10 years, 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide .

"The six-month-old girl with a rare genetic disorder and a ‘bucket list’ blog created by her parents died of complications from the disease yesterday, her father wrote today. Avery Lynn Canahuati was born in November with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA) and was given only months to live. Her father Mike had chronicled his daughter’s life in a blog, writing in her voice about all the things she wanted to do before she died, including wearing a big bow and going to a tea party.

On the blog, Mr Canahuati wrote that . their daughter passed away on Monday after one of her lungs collapsed. The infant then went into cardiac arrest. He wrote: ‘Avery’s passing this . quickly came as a complete shock to all of us, as she had just been . given a thumbs up at her last doctor’s appointment only three days ago.’ He then shared a note ‘written by’ Avery, that was heartbreakingly hopeful. The note thanks everyone for . their prayers and support, and reads: ‘When people think of me, I they . will not waste time sitting there feeling sorry for me, rather I hope . they will STAND UP in honour of me and all my friends. ‘They can do so by spreading awareness and helping to fund a cure for my friends.’ Mr Canahuati said on his blog that he . could now scratch off of Avery’s bucket list. One, ‘Not let SMA take my . smile away,’ and two, ‘Take one last breath, then take one more before I . go to live with my Uncle Bryant, Nana Carolyn, Papa George, and all my . great-grandparents.’ The last photo of Avery, he wrote, was . taken 15-20 minutes before she stopped breathing.

Fun with mom: Another reader suggested sliding down a slide; in another, Avery is pictured with a plush giraffe stuffed toy . Mike and Laura Canahuati received the heart-wrenching news only weeks ago that their daughter Avery had less than 18 months to live. Avery’s blog has become something of . an internet sensation – the website alone has garnered more than half a . million page views, and her Facebook page has more than 12,000 ‘likes.’ Avery . ‘wrote’ on her blog: ‘I have a lot of living to do in just a little bit . of time and I’m going to need all of the help I can get from my parents . and anyone else who wants to help. ‘Keep . in mind in everything I do, the two most important things are that I’m . spending time with my mommy & daddy, while at the same time . spreading awareness for SMA.’ The initial bucket list included several childhood milestones, such as going swimming, going on a road trip, sit on daddy’s shoulders, have a birthday party, and stay up past my bedtime watching TV with mommy and daddy. One of goals on the list was a little more salacious: Get a tattoo. Bucket list: Little Avery Canahuati was diagnosed with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy on Good Friday and given only 18 months to live . The cheery blog has struck a chord with parents across the world. Mrs Canahuati told Good Morning America that’s when the couple knew they had a powerful platform on which to speak. The mother said: ‘When we saw how many people it was reaching in a few days, that’s when we realised we could really get the word out on SMA and spread the word as much as we could.’ The disease is the number one killer of U.S. children under two, she said, though the disease is largely unknown. She urged possible parents to get tested for the genetic disease before conceiving. ‘Our goal for Avery is to be the face of SMA,’ she said.

"A plastic surgery patient dubbed the 'Botox Bandit' got $6,000 worth of procedures at a San Francisco clinic before walking out without paying. The man, who gave his name as Paul Halford and said he was 43, was given botox, fillers and laser treatment by Dr Larry Fan at his 77 Plastic Surgery clinic. After he finished with the treatment yesterday the man simply got up and walked out, and has not come back since to settle up. Police are hunting for this man, who gave his name as Paul Hanford and said he was 43, after he walked out of a San Fransisco plastic surgery clinic without paying for $6,000 of treatment . Dr Fan told NBC Bay Area that the man gave his address as 1140 Folsom Street, but that has since turned out to be an office building. He then recalled an email a colleague had sent him in April last year warning that a 'Botox Bandit' had struck in the area. The description in the email matched his patient. The bizarre theft began with a consultation, during which Mr Fan met with the customer in his surgery and discussed procedures with him. In hindsight, the surgeon says he should have known something was wrong, as the patient seemed to be acting suspiciously. He said: 'He was a little bit secretive and a little bit private about coming into the office. He also seemed to know quite a bit about what he wanted done. Looking back there was some red flags.' Dr Larry Fan said after the theft he remembered a colleague had sent him an email warning of a 'Botox Bandit' in the area matching the description of his patient . When it came to payment, Dr Fan said he usually asks for a credit card, but in this case the patient showed him a wadge of cash instead. Despite his reservations Dr Fan went ahead with the three procedures which are all designed to combat the signs of ageing. However, after the treatments were done, and with his face still puffed up and red from the surgery, the man strolled out while pretending to be talking on the phone. Dr Fan said that he wants his story to act as a cautionary tale for other surgeons in the area. He added: 'Hopefully this kind of thing won't happen to many people, and hopefully this particular person won't be able to continue to get away with this.'","Man asked for botox, filler injections and laser treatment worth $6,000 .

"Incredible footage has been captured of the 14 skydivers losing control and crashing into the ocean after being stuck in the middle of an unexpected severe hail storm. The petrified divers were ripped out of the sky by wild winds at St Kilda beach on Monday with two victims rushed to hospital and 12 others treated by paramedics after the terrifying crash landings. The frightening footage, which looks to be have been taken from a balcony overlooking Port Phillip Bay, shows the divers uncontrollably falling out of the sky as thunder clashes and lightning bolts strike. Scroll down for videos . The first of 14 skydrivers who fell out of the sky at St Kilda beach after an unexpected storm hit . The diver plummeted at an almighty speed while a man captures the footage from a balcony in the distance . Within seconds the diver crashed into the water with huge force . After a 38-degree sunny day, a fierce storm quickly took hold with the skydivers suddenly facing an intense hail storm and violent winds. The extreme strength of the wind can be heard on the video with the cameraman struggling to hold the camera still while filming as one by one each diver dropped out of the dark sky and hit the rough waters at an almighty force. Horrified members of the public looked to the sky as the divers plummeted at a rapid pace before being battered across an expansive area of the beach and pier. Senior Paramedic Team Manager, Jo Wilton, said that it was a chaotic scene when they arrived. Lightning struck as the divers dramaticaly fell one by one into the water before two victims rushed to hospital and 12 others treated by paramedics . Many onlookers ran into the sea to rescue one of the victims who slammed into the water, pictured here bringing the man and his equipment to land . Gail force winds forced the skydivers to tumble through the air, crashing into the ground or water . During the free fall many were blown across the sky like rag dolls, lucky to escape with only minor injuries. The first two survivors were found on the pier just after 3pm and were treated by Metropolitan Fire Brigade marine firefighters. ‘They were all incredibly lucky. Witnesses say they hit the water or the ground really hard so it could have been a lot worse than what it was,’ Senior Paramedic Team Manager Jo Wilton said. It’s understood that two people were sent to Albert Hospital, while others were treated at the scene, administered with pain relief and treated for welts and soreness, primarily caused by the hail storm. ‘It would have been very frightening for those involved, but they were well cared for at the scene and kept calm.’ Two survivors were taken to hospital with injuries sustained from their fall and also from the hail that battered them during their descent . ‘They were all incredibly lucky. Witnesses say they hit the water or the ground really hard so it could have been a lot worse than what it was,’ Senior Paramedic Team Manager Jo Wilton said .

"A woman has failed in a legal bid to stop her two-year-old son being adopted by Christians because they are not a 'religious match'. The woman - believed to be Muslim - had tried to overturn a Newcastle judge's order that the little boy should be placed for adoption. She argued that a relative should be allowed to care for him. But  following a family court hearing in Newcastle-upon-Tyne Judge Simon Wood blocked her attempts. A woman has failed in a legal bid to prevent her two-year-old son being adopted by Christians because they are not a 'religious match', in a hearing at Newcastle Family Court (pictured) Details of the case have been published in a written ruling by the judge on a legal website. The judge did not say what religion the woman or her ex-husband were - although indications in his ruling suggested that the family was Muslim. He said he had made an order placing the little boy for adoption 13 months ago, and that social workers had matched the little boy with a Christian couple - who had been Muslims before converting. The woman had applied to revoke the adoption placement order - and the judge said the 'lack of religious match' issue had been raised. But he dismissed the woman's application, saying that it might not be possible to find a 'perfect' adoptive family for the youngster. And he said 'religion' would not 'trump' other 'positive' factors. The little boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons -  had been exposed to 'volatile and violent behaviour' and had been 'emotionally abused' by his parents. He said he had made an order placing the little boy for adoption 13 months ago, and that Newcastle social workers had matched the little boy with a Christian couple - who had been Muslims before converting. Pictured is Newcastle civic council . He said the child had been provided with 'seriously sub-standard parenting'. Assessments by social services staff had ruled out either parent as a carer, said the judge, and social workers had also assessed more than a dozen other family members as possible carers - but ruled all of them out. Neither the woman, the little boy or the local authority which had begun care proceedings were identified. But he said family members in Bristol, Leicester, Luton, Bedfordshire and the North East had been assessed. He said one relative lived in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. One family member had not attended court because he was 'at Mecca', said the judge. '(The little boy) has ... been formally matched with a couple who are said to be practising Christians, having converted from Islam,' said Judge Wood. 'That lack of religious match is something that is raised before me.' He said a 'perfect match may be unachievable' and added: 'Culture in its widest sense, but also including religion, was but one factor that would not trump other factors if they were all positive.'","The woman - believed to be Muslim - tried to stop adoption of her child .

"These images show the disturbing moment that a murdered police officer pleaded for his life before being executed by masked gunmen who launched a deadly terrorist attack on an anti-Islamist newspaper in France. A video from the scene of yesterday's massacre shows officer Ahmed Merabet - believed to be a Muslim - lying wounded on the pavement and begging for mercy before being shot at point-blank range by the terrorists. As they approach, the 42-year-old is seen raising his hand in appeal for mercy, before the gunman asks: 'Do you want to kill us?' The policeman then answers: 'No, it's OK chief.' They then shoot him through the head with the assault rifle. Target: After halting their car, the terrorists fire assault rifles at a policeman who tried to stop them, following the massacre at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris . Helpless: The gunmen move in on the officer as Ahmed Merabet - who is believed to have been a Muslim - lies wounded on the pavement . Pleading: Mr Merabet, 42, who was married, raises his hand in an appeal for mercy as the terrorists approach him with their weapons . Callous: One of the terrorists fires at the officer at point-blank range. The attack took place yesterday and killed 12 people . Killing: Leaving the 42-year-old married officer to die, they run off, sparking a massive manhunt which was continuing last night . The gunmen then return to the car driven by an accomplice, sparking a massive manhunt which was continuing last night. The shocking images were broadcast all over the world, depicting the sheer brutality of the horror that unfolded in the attack at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, in which 12 innocent people were killed. Among the victims, the Al Qaeda assassins – identified as two brothers and an 18-year-old accomplice, all with Algerian links – shot dead two policemen. The massacre was condemned around the world as an assault on freedom of speech. The magazine, which mocks politicians and religions alike, was firebombed in 2011 after carrying a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed. These shocking images were broadcast all over the world yesterday. We appreciate they may distress some readers, but believe they must be published so the sheer brutality and horror of what happened may be fully understood. Out of respect for the murdered officer and his family, his face has been obscured. Nine of its staff were killed in yesterday’s atrocity, including the editor and three cartoonists. It was France’s worst terror attack since 1961. Opposition MP Jacques Myard said: ‘We are at war, the Western nations – like Britain, France and Germany.’ The hooded, heavily armed gunmen – described by police as operating like a commando unit – told witnesses they were from Al Qaeda and trained in Yemen. Last night the Paris outrage was being seen as the ‘spectacular’ that Al Qaeda had been threatening since the dramatic rise of Islamic State replaced it as the most feared jihadi organisation. The suspects were named as Said Kouachi, 34, his brother Cherif, 32, and Hamyd Mourad, 18. A police operation took place late lat night the north-eastern city of Reims, where Said lived. Early this morning, a source close to the case said Mourad surrendered to police 'after seeing his name on social media' and was arrested at an undisclosed location. Suspects: The three men were named as Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, his brother Said Kouachi (right), 34, and Hamyd Mourad, 18, of Gennevilliers . A raid by France’s elite anti-terrorist unit took place late yesterday in Reims as part of the hunt for the gunmen who attacked the newspaper . Either the suspects will be able to escape, or ‘there will be a showdown’, said a member of the unit, urging reporters at the scene to be ‘vigilant' Dozens of members of the elite anti-terror unit were surrounding an apartment building. The Kouachi brothers hailed from the Paris suburb of Pantin, where Cherif still lived. He was convicted in 2008 and jailed for three years for his association with a group sending jihadist fighters to Iraq. Hamyd is believed to have been living recently in Charleville-Mezieres, in the French Ardennes. All three men had Algerian origins. The massacre at the second-floor offices of the magazine in the heart of the French capital appeared well planned with gunmen calling out names of journalists and cartoonists before shooting them. Police union official Rocco Contento warned: ‘There is a possibility of other attacks and other sites are being secured.’ Faces of the victims: Among the journalists killed were (l to r) Charlie Hebdo's deputy chief editor  Bernard Maris and cartoonists Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut, aka Cabu, Stephane Charbonnier, who is also editor-in-chief, and Bernard Verlhac, also known as Tignous . Emergency: Police officers and firefighters gathered in front of the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris after gunmen stormed the building .

Brandishing Kalashnikovs and a rocket propelled grenade launcher two gunmen burst in to the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo in Bastille just hours after it had tweeted a satirical cartoon of Islamic State’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The gunmen appeared to know that an editorial conference of the magazine’s key staff was taking place and chose their targets by name, seemingly selecting them from among colleagues. Four of France’s most revered cartoonists – Stephane Charbonnier, 47, Georges Wolinski, 80, Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac, 57, and Jean Cabut, 76, died as the gunmen ran amok shouting out ‘Allahu Akbar’ (God is great) between rounds of automatic gunfire. David Cameron and Angela Merkel were given an extremely rare joint briefing by British intelligence chiefs on the terror threat last night. MI5 chief Andrew Parker and MI6 boss Alex Younger told the two leaders the Paris attacks appeared to be of a ‘professional’ type not seen in Britain in recent years. The two leaders then made a call to Francois Hollande during which Mr Cameron offered the French president use of British spies to help track down the fanatics. In a joint press conference in London, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor said terrorists must never be allowed to stop free speech. Mr Cameron said: ‘We should never give up the values we believe in and defend as part of our democracy and civilisation – believing in a free Press, in freedom of expression, in the right of people to write and say what they believe. ‘These are the things we are defending.’ Known by his pen name Charb, Mr Charbonnier, edited Charlie Hebdo, and had been the target of death threats. He was included in a 2013 Wanted Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam article published by Inspire, the terrorist propaganda magazine published by Al Qaeda. A police bodyguard assigned to him after the magazine’s offices were attacked in 2011 was among the first to die yesterday, at around 11.30am local time. Others killed were named as Michel Renaud, a guest editor, and 73-year-old cartoonist Philippe Honoré. Minutes earlier, cartoonist Corinne Rey had been forced to let the gunmen into the office block in the 11th arrondissement of Paris after returning from collecting her young daughter from a nursery. Vigil: People gathered around candles and pens at the Place de la Republique in Paris in support of the victims after the terrorist attack . People gather in Toulouse last night to show their solidarity for the victims of the attack by gunmen on the offices of the satirical publication . Elsewhere: People gather at the Place Royale in Nantes to show their solidarity for the victims of the attack  on the offices of the satirical weekly . ‘I had gone to pick up my daughter at day care, arriving in front of the magazine building, where two masked and armed men brutally threatened us,’ said Miss Rey, who draws under the name Coco. ‘They said they wanted to go up to the offices, so I tapped in the code,’ said Miss Rey, referring to the security system on the interphone. Miss Rey and her daughter hid under a desk, from where they saw two cartoonists murdered. ‘They shot Wolinski and Cabu,’ she said. ‘It lasted five minutes.’ Miss Rey said the men ‘spoke French perfectly’ and ‘claimed they were ‘Al Qaeda terrorists’. Calmly leaving behind a scene resembling a war zone with bullet-riddled windows, blood-stained floors and walls and the cries of the dying and wounded, the men ran on to the street outside – their exit and horrific murder that followed captured on a video taken from a nearby rooftop. Witnesses said they heard the gunmen shouting ‘We have avenged the Prophet Mohammed’, ‘God is Great’ in Arabic and boasting ‘We have killed Charlie Hebdo’. The gunmen made their escape stopping to kill Mr Merabet and then to hijack a car after their vehicle was damaged in a crash. Appealing for national unity, President Hollande said: ‘We are threatened because we are a country of liberty.’ Charlie Hebdo’s website, which went offline during the attack, is showing the single image of ‘Je suis Charlie’ (I am Charlie) on a black banner, referring to a hashtag that is trending on Twitter in solidarity with the victims.","Horrific footage shows officer Ahmed Merabet - believed to be Muslim - being shot in the head at point-blank range .

"The eerie howls that pierced the dense forest were not the usual wildlife sounds that the residents of Turner, Maine, were used to. Then, in footage captured by a 12-year-old boy, a large, dark, mysterious figure loped through the trees and across the path ahead. Could it be, finally, compelling evidence? Scroll down for video . Bill Brock launched his investigation after he received footage of a creature believed to be Bigfoot . Renowned 'monster hunter' and Bigfoot expert Bill Brock certainly thought so. After viewing the two-minute video he decided to travel up to visit the boy who captured the footage - and even declared the clip the most convincing evidence of the mythical creature since the 1967 Patterson-Gimlin video. He told Bangor Daily News: 'I’m not telling you that this is Sasquatch. I’m telling you we either have a bunch of things that are lining up to be the most convincing evidence since the Patterson-Gimlin video or this is a really amazing hoax.' Mr Brock believed that his 12-year-old informant was telling the truth. He said: 'This really terrified this kid. He was shaking. I’ve done enough interviews with people who say they’ve seen Sasquatch to know … he was scared. It was almost frightening to watch him deal with it.' The Bigfoot was supposedly using a track through the woods in Turner, Maine, pictured . Monster hunter Bill Brock, closely examined several footprints, even measuring the length of the stride . The video featured a tall gangly creature striding purposefully through a woodland clearing about 100 yards from the camera. Before the action, there are a number of piercing cries from the woodland. Mr Brock said that the area of Maine was believed to be a particular hotspot for Bigfoots. He said: 'We think these things migrate through this area, and we are on the edge of what could be a migration pattern. It’s just getting cold, so these creatures are gonna be moving from way up from north where it gets snowy, down to the coast to go get some food.' During his visit to the area, Mr Brock tried to recreate the movie, playing the part of Bigfoot himself in a pair of brown dungarees, so he could measure the size of the mystery creature against himself from the same distance. But as he began to apply his years of monster-hunting experience - via the TV show Monsters Underground - to probe deeper into the evidence, a few things did not add up. Mr Brock believes the footage is the most compelling since 1967 Patterson-Gimlin video, pictured . Bill Brock, right, went to Turner and interviewed the 12-year-old boy, left and his father, centre . When Mr Brock, left, was shown some 'Bigfoot' tracks outside the property he became more suspicious . In a second section of video posted by Mr Brock (above), the youngster - whose name is not given - leads Mr Brock to a location close to where the sighting was made and, unsurprisingly given the covering of snow on the ground, the mysterious Bigfoot has left several large footprints in the snow. The doubts begin and in a third video on the sighting posted by Mr Brock (below), he analyses the evidence with a colleague, and suggests that the footprints he had been shown were perhaps a little too perfect. He tells his viewers: 'We basically took our time. Our job as researchers is to research and that’s what we did. We took our time and didn’t jump to any conclusions. 'I am always going to be transparent.' Mr Brock then tried to recreate the footage by walking along the same track, left, as the monster, right . After examining the footprints, Mr Brock is not entirely convinced that they belonged to a Bigfoot . Then he drops a bombshell that the boy had told school mates he faked the whole thing. 'I received a really strange phone call from a friend of the boy who filmed it,' he tells his viewers. 'This friend told his mom that his friend has faked this Bigfoot footage and how he has faked all of us out. That upset me when I heard that. But he still appears to want to believe that the footage is genuine, saying: 'I still trust these people - I still believe they are being honest with me. I know the father is being honest with me at least. 'We were told that his teachers and his peers from school were giving him such a hard time of being a witness to sasquatch that he felt threatened. He felt he was being picked on and being bullied.' Despite the chance that the entire video was a hoax, Mr Brock hopes that it may be genuine and said in future such bullying may prevent other Bigfoot sightings from being made public. He added: ‘This young man was bullied into saying what he videoed was faked. 'A lot of people will not come forward and talk about what they have experienced because they fear that they will be ridiculed.'","'Monster hunter' Bill Brock is impressed by footage of Bigfoot in Maine .

"Brandi Glanville burst into tears on the Bravo chat show Watch What Happens Live on Tuesday after throwing wine at fellow  guest Jeff Lewis. The chat show hosted by Andy Cohen aired following the latest episode of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills in which Brandi also tossed wine on new housewife Eileen Davidson. Jeff, 44, who stars in Bravo's Flipping Out home renovation series, made a joke about getting a sexually transmitted disease from Brandi, 42, touching his hair and it struck a raw nerve. Scroll down for video . Her signature move:  Brandi Glanville tossed wine at guest Jeff Lewis on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live . Moment of impact: The Flipping Out star was left covered in alcohol . Gobsmacked: Jeff was genuinely taken back by the move . As the show returned from commercial break Brandi tossed a glass of wine at Jeff and then turned away from the camera as she burst into tears. 'I'm taking five,' Brandi said clearly overcome with emotion. Brandi in her 2014 book Drinking And Dating: P.S. Social Media Is Ruining Romance claimed that she caught a sexually transmitted disease - human papillomavirus - from her ex-husband Eddie Cibrian. Jeff tried to reach over and apologise but was initially rebuffed by Brandi as she tried to gather herself. 'I'm not going to touch her, I'm just saying sorry,' Jeff said. Too far: Brandi burst into tears on the chat show after Jeff brought up a touchy subject . Taking a break: Brandi turned away from the cameras after having her feelings hurt . That was awkward: Talk show host Andy Cohen tried to get the show back on track after Brandi started crying . Andy tried to salvage the show, but it was clearly awkward for everyone. Tossing wine appeared to be one of Brandi's favourite sports as she flung a full glass of wine in Eileen's face for no reason at all in the latest episode of Real Housewives. Brandi had already taken a girls' night out into an unexpectedly awkward direction when she confronted Eileen about how she and her husband, Vincent Van Patten, were married to other people when they met. Calm before the storm: The reality TV star arriving at the Bravo studios . In the mood for crazy: Brandi was in high spirits as she posed for fans . But she then made it even worse when she drunkenly started insisting Eileen act like her character on the TV soap opera Days Of Our Lives, even giving her $40 to do it and leaving Eileen clearly annoyed as she asked: 'What am I, a circus seal?' Then out of nowhere Brandi flung her wine in Eileen's face - leaving the actress in tears and the other housewives stunned. Admitting she was 'confused and angry and humiliated', Eileen said: 'It's just shocking and bizarre.' Dishing it out: Brandi tossed a glass of wine on Eileen Davidson on Tuesday night's episode of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills . Surprise shower: Eileen was unexpectedly doused by Brandi . And fellow dinner guest Lisa Rinna insisted she would 'probably be in a cop car' if Brandi had done the same to her, calling it 'absolutely inappropriate - and f***ing weird'. The next day, telling husband Vince that she hadn't slept all night because of it, Eileen admitted she was concerned at how much of a 'creepy fan' Brandi appears to be of her TV show. 'I'm going to be very cautious around Brandi,' Eileen admitted. 'I think she's capable of almost anything.' Jaw-dropping: Lisa Rinna was shocked by Brandi's behaviour . Not nice: Eileen was soaked by wine tossed onto her by Brandi . The wild wine attack was the talk of a dinner thrown the next evening by Yolanda Foster, even after Brandi instantly apologized to Eileen, blaming drink and wanting 'a soap opera moment'. But the other housewives may be less forgiving. 'I want to take care of her - but I also want to f***ing spank her at the same time,' said Lisa Rinna who insisting Brandi was 'a wounded little girl' who needs attention. And Lisa Vanderpump - who Brand had only just started to make peace with after their earlier falling out - was also clearly outraged. 'This is a beautiful elegant woman - Eileen, not Brandi - and to throw a glass of wine in her face? I've heard and seen some things from Brandi but this is a whole new low,' Lisa insisted. New low: Lisa Vanderpump said that Brandi had reached a new low by throwing wine at Eileen . While Eileen insisted she accepted Brandi's apology, she admitted later: 'Still don't trust her.' Brandi then sparked further offense at Yolanda's party, telling singer Babyface that his wife's rings 'could be bigger' - and then telling Yolanda's husband David Foster that he looked like he was 'finger banging' as he excitedly gesticulated with Babyface as they tried to write an impromptu song. 'If that's not some white trash I don't know what is,' Lisa Rinna said of Brandi's behavior. Gulp it down: Brandi was the talk of dinner after throwing wine on Eileen . Her latest acting out came just hours after she appeared to be getting somewhere with Lisa Vanderpump, taking her to lunch for a heart-to-heart after weeks of trying to patch-up their friendship. But while they made some progress, Lisa made it evident things will never be as they were before, warning Brandi: 'I can't be the friend that you want.' And when Brandi later told friends that they were 'moving forward but just taking it slow', Lisa stressed: 'Really slow. I'm serious.'",The reality star was on the show to discuss her alcohol-throwing incident on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills .
"People who are obese top the list of the five types of passengers Britons would least like to find themselves sitting next to on a flight. Unsurprisingly the second most hated neighbour is a screaming baby, while those with poor hygiene come in at third, a new survey shows. Flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk conducted the research as part of an ongoing study into airline passenger experiences during a flight, questioning 2,548 adults about their likes and dislikes while flying. Scroll down for video . Although the least-favoured neighbour on a plane is someone obese, a crying baby reliably comes second . 1 Someone overweight or obese: 32% . 2 A screaming baby: 29% . 3 Someone with poor hygiene: 21% . 4 Someone scared of flying: 17% . 5 Someone who doesn't stop talking: 16% . According to the poll, 32 per cent of Britons said they didn't want to sit next to obese people because they didn't want them 'encroaching into the seat space'. In order to determine if this was purely a UK feeling or something that was becoming more common throughout Europe, 1,000 people from European countries outside of the UK were also polled. Respondents from Spain (26 per cent) and France (23 per cent) also listed ‘someone considered obese’ as the person they would most like to sit next to. The biggest response in supposedly child-loving country Italy listed ‘a screaming child’ (18 per cent) as their least favourite seat fellow. German respondents voted ‘someone who doesn’t stop talking’ as their biggest bugbear (16 per cent). Most of those who stated they'd least like to sit next to someone overweight said it was because they wanted their seat space to themselves without having someone encroach into their space (73 per cent). 'It's saddening to hear that people wouldn't want to sit next to someone on a flight because of their weight, but it's completely understandable that they want to find some comfort on the flight they've paid for,' said Jetcost.co.uk co-founder Antoine Michelat. 'We've always thought that screaming babies on a flight were the most annoying, but people are getting much better at coping with this situation as they understand that babies are babies and there's nothing that can be done to soothe them on a flight when their ears pop, or the air conditioning gets too much for them. 'Some companies are already looking into introducing a section on their planes for people over a certain weight, and whilst this is a good thing for those who don't want to find someone using their own seat and half of theirs too, it does run the risk of fat-shaming those who can't necessarily control their weight.'","Almost a third of Brits voted an overweight person as the worst passenger .

"The maximum prison sentence allowed has been handed down to a 22-year-old man found guilty of suffocating his teen girlfriend to death after she told him she was pregnant and wouldn't have an abortion. Christian Ferdinand was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder of Shaniesha Forbes, 14, whose charred body was found stuffed in a suitcase that washed up on a Brooklyn, New York, beach in January 2013. An autopsy revealed she wasn't actually carrying a baby. Ferdinand had met Forbes through Facebook, and was arrested four months after her death in Maine. He confessed to the crime and was even bold enough to ask for a light sentence of community service. Despite the earlier confession, he denied murder when in court on Wednesday for his sentencing. 'I never put a hand on a female in an inappropriate manner,' he told Supreme Court Justice Neil Firetog. 'I would never kill someone over an abortion,' Ferdinand added. 'There's no reason to take someone's life just because they said they was pregnant. These are all false things.' 'My condolences to the family, but I didn't kill Shaniesha.' Guilty: Christian Ferdinand, 22 (left), was sentenced on Wednesday for the January 2013 murder of his 14-year-old girlfriend Shaniesha Forbes (right). He smothered her with a pillow and burned her body. Forbes' cousin Kerri-Ann Thomas read a statement on behalf of her grieving family, referring to Shaniesha as 'Mimi' she lamented that they would not see her grow up. She said: 'He [Ferdinand] was 20 years old, the age most people consider to be a man but it's obvious he is no such thing.' 'What was he doing with a little girl, a baby, a child?' 'He talked about his eyes and how he had a hard time keeping girls off him. I hope that works well for him in prison,' she added. At the trial in December 2014, Assistant District Attorney Robert Walsh said: 'He intentionally smothered a 14-year-old girl to death and burned her body to get rid of the evidence. He had a problem that needed solving, he didn't want to pay child support, and Shaniesha got in the way.' It took a jury just an hour  to convict Ferdinand with murder. Walsh said the crime demanded the maximum penalty because Ferdinand showed a lack of remorse and because of his inhuman treatment of the girl's body after killing her. Admission: Ferdinand confessed to killing Forbes four months after her body washed up on a Brooklyn, New York beach (pictured above). He told investigators he killed her because she told him he was pregnant . Forbes, who was a freshman at the Academy for Young Writers in Williamsburg, allegedly first infuriated her boyfriend when she told him she was pregnant via text message in January 2013. Ferdinand responded to the announcement by texting back: 'My n****, are you serious? Kill that s***' But Forbes made it clear that she would not get an abortion, saying it would hurt her religious mother. The couple later met at Ferdinand's cousin's house where Forbes continued to talk about the pregnancy while they were both sitting on the couch. That's when Ferdinand snapped and grabbed a leather pillow to suffocate his girlfriend to death. Investigators asked Ferdinand if Forbes fought back as he was killing her, and he replied: 'She tried, wasn't much of a struggle, she was little.' After she died, Ferdinand proceeded to douse her body in Axe body spray which he used to set the corpse on fire with a Bic lighter. He later stuffed her body in a suitcase which he tossed into Gerriston Bay, believing the saltwater would destroy any evidence left on Forbes' body after the burning.  The body was later found when the suitcase washed up on Gerriston Beach. Promising future: Forbes was a freshman at the Academy of Young Writers in Williamsburg at the time of her death . It was also revealed in the course of the trial, that Ferdinand spoke casually about Forbes' killing to a friend. 'It didn't deserve to live' Ferdinand told a friend, according to testimony. He also booked into a hotel with an ex-girlfriend the day after the murder. The unnamed ex allegedly wanted to have sex with Ferdinand but he told her he was too tired. When the jury gave the guilty verdict in December, Forbes' 22-year-old sister Shaquana told the Daily News: 'He deserves much worse.'","Maximum penalty of 25 years to life handed down to Christian Ferdinand, 22, who met his victim on Facebook .

"The 2011 killing of an unarmed black man by a small-town police chief in South Carolina was a senseless act of violence and the officer must be convicted of murder because everyone should be treated the same under the law, a prosecutor said Wednesday. But a defense lawyer said former Eutawville Police Chief Richard Combs was trying to serve a lawfully obtained arrest warrant and the legal system would not work if people could just leave instead of being taken into custody. Opening arguments started Wednesday in Combs' murder trial. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted. 'Senseless': Solicitor David Pascoe said in opening statements Tuesday that Bernard Bailey was 'gunned down in an absolutely senseless act of violence' by Eutawville police chief David Pascoe in 2011 . Unarmed: Bernard Bailey was shot and killed by new police chief Richard Combs outside the Eutawville town hall in May 2011 . Combs was indicted shortly after grand juries produced no indictments against white officers in the deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and in New York. He was the third white officer indicted in 2014 in a shooting of an unarmed black man in South Carolina. Both sides agree Combs shot Bernard Bailey outside Eutawville Town Hall in May 2011 after an argument over a ticket for a broken taillight the chief gave to Bailey's daughter a few days earlier. Combs' lawyer, John O'Leary, said the chief had a warrant to arrest Bailey on an obstruction of justice charge after the argument over the ticket and people can't just leave when they are being arrested. As a small-town police chief, he didn't have a stun gun or pepper spray, so he had no choice but to fire his gun as Bailey tried to back away with Combs in the truck. Solicitor David Pascoe said Bailey was 'gunned down in an absolutely senseless act of violence,' shot three times as he simply backed out to escape an escalating situation. Pascoe told jurors Combs must follow the law, even if he is a police officer. 'Whether he wears a badge or not, the law must treat everyone equal,' Pascoe said. A jury of seven blacks and five whites was seated Tuesday evening. Combs' attorneys had asked to move the trial to another county, but later withdrew their request. The shooting happened in May 2011. Bailey's daughter received a traffic ticket from the chief for a broken taillight and called her father to the scene. Bailey and Combs argued, but eventually went their separate ways. The police chief got an arrest warrant for Bailey for obstruction. A few days later, Bailey went to Town Hall to argue about his daughter's ticket. When he showed up, the chief tried to arrest Bailey, a 6-foot-6 former prison guard. Prosecutors said Bailey marched back to his truck, and Combs tried to get inside to turn off the ignition. The two briefly fought, and Combs shot Bailey, 54, twice in the chest. Counterpoint: Combs' lawyer, John O'Leary, said the chief had a warrant to arrest Bailey on an obstruction of justice charge after the argument over the ticket and people can't just leave when they are being arrested . Combs said he was tangled in Bailey's steering wheel and feared for his life if Bailey drove away. Last month, a judge threw out his self-defense claim and ruled Combs should have let Bailey leave. In March 2013, the Justice Department cleared Combs. Pascoe announced he would begin his own investigation and in August of that year, a grand jury indicted Combs on the misconduct charge. David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said that was an unusual way to handle the case. Pascoe wouldn't talk about the grand jury proceedings. Combs' bail was set at $150,000. He is unemployed. He was placed on leave after the shooting, and the town let him go six months later. In August 2014, Bailey's family reached a $400,000 wrongful death settlement with Eutawville, which is 50 miles southeast of Columbia. They said they don't think this case should be compared with Ferguson and New York because everyone in Eutawville knows everyone. 'That is comparing oranges and apples,' said Bailey's widow, Doris Bailey. Eutawville has about 300 residents, one-third of them black. Its Main Street has a hardware store, a pharmacy and medical supply store, and a number of empty storefronts. One of Bailey's cousins remembered him as a kind person. 'He wasn't the type of person to harm anybody. I don't know why someone would shoot him or take his life from his family. He was good people,' said Betty Williams, 57. How it began: The shooting happened in May 2011 after Bailey's daughter received a traffic ticket from the chief for a broken taillight and called her father to the scene. Bailey and Combs argued, but eventually went their separate ways . Shot dead: Days later, Bailey went to Town Hall to argue about his daughter's ticket. The chief tried to arrest Bailey, a 6-foot-6 former prison guard. Bailey marched back to his truck, and Combs tried to get inside to turn off the ignition. The two briefly fought, and Combs shot Bailey, 54, twice in the chest . Detrick Jenkins Sr., a neighbor of Bailey's who worked with him at a state prison, said he didn't fear riots like in Missouri or the massive protests that happened nationwide after grand juries declined to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson and New York officer Daniel Pantaleo. That could change if Combs is found not guilty, Jenkins said. 'People probably won't like it and will have a more aggressive attitude,' said Jenkins, who is black. Combs worked as a deputy for the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office for six years before being fired in 2007 for 'unsatisfactory performance,' according to documents from the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy obtained by The Post and Courier of Charleston for a 2011 story. Combs completed police chief's training in Eutawville just four days before the fatal shooting, the newspaper reported. Thomas Bilton, a white Eutawville resident who was friends with Bailey, said the police chief should have let him leave Town Hall that day. 'The whole thing has been kind of crazy,' he said. 'It's taken a long time and I think some of the recent events across the country might have contributed to a final verdict to charge him with murder.' 'Oranges and apples': In August 2014, Bailey's family reached a $400,000 wrongful death settlement with Eutawville. They said they don't think this case should be compared with Ferguson and New York because everyone in Eutawville knows everyone . Everyone knows everyone: Eutawville is a town of just 300 residents outside Columbia, one-third of them black. Its Main Street has a hardware store, a pharmacy and medical supply store, and a number of empty storefronts .","Solicitor David Pascoe said in opening statements in his case against fired Eutawville chief Richard Combs .

"Pippa Middleton turned travel expert to write her latest column for glossy magazine Vanity Fair, listing 'what she deems to be' the very best of the world's top ski resorts. Inviting her readers to 'boot up, clip in, and make fresh tracks', the 31-year-old contributing editor proceeds to recommend a series of luxury locations in the mountains, from Deer Valley in Utah to Verbier in Switzerland, a favorite with the British Royal Family - who are, of course, Ms Middleton's in-laws. 'Come wearing either a party hat or powder skis; there's never a dull moment at this resort,' she writes about the Swiss resort. Scroll down for video . Ski bunny: Pippa Middleton, 31, details what she believes to be the world's best ski resorts in her latest column for Vanity Fair . Skilled competitor: Ms Middleton has a great amount of expertise when it comes to skiing and has competed in a variety of cross country races alongside her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson (pictured together in Lech) 'Verbier is for serious skiers  who love off-piste and moguls,' she adds. 'On-piste skiing here isn't too challenging.' Zermatt, Switzerland . Courchevel, France . Aspen and Snowmass, Colorado . Deer Valley, Utah . Whistler Blackcomb, British Columbia . Lech Am Arlberg, Austria . Cortina, Italy . Megeve, France . Verbier, Switzerland . Saint-Moritz, Switzerland . Jackson Hole, Wyoming . Indeed, only last week Prince Andrew, his daughter Prince Eugenie and Prince Harry's former girlfriend Cressida Bonas were pictured enjoying a weekend getaway at the Swiss resort, staying in a luxury £22,000-per-week chalet. Ms Middleton, who began writing for Vanity Fair in June 2013, is widely known to be a skilled and enthusiastic skier. She has even competed in a number of cross country races at some of the very resorts featured in her recent column. In March 2013, the socialite and her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson took part in the 26-mile Engadin Ski Marathon in Saint-Moritz, Switzerland, alongside Ms Middleton's younger brother James. The following year the couple slowed things down a bit in order to enjoy a more relaxed getaway in Lech Am Alberg, Austria. Both resorts are included in her Vanity Fair piece. Royal favorite: Verbier in Switzerland is favored by many members of the British Royal family, including Prince Andrew (L) and his daughter Princess Eugenie (R), who were both there last week . Luxury living quarters: The Prince and his daughter stayed in this luxury £22,000-per-week chalet . In total Ms Middleton recommends eleven resorts in the US, Canada and Europe, highlighting their various positive attributes of each one and in some cases suggesting which ability levels would be best suited to different resorts. But while the author, who published her own party-planning book Celebrate in 2012, details her own personal trips to several of the resorts - praising the traffic-free roads in Zermatt, Switzerland and the pristine powder in Lech Am Alberg, Austria - she doesn't actually make clear whether or not she has visited all of the locations included in the column. Unsurprisingly however, given her fondness for the speedy snow sport, she still writes with authority when it comes to describing the pros and cons of each resort - even sharing her own unique observations about her preferred places. 'Jackson Hole] has a decidedly Rockies feel, with lots of people wearing cowboy boots,' she says of the Wyoming-based resort, before recommending that visitors try out the National Elk Refuge sleigh rides. Rising star: Ms Middleton is reported to have signed on as a correspondent for the Today show . She adds that visitors to the Swiss resort of Saint-Moritz should try and ski across the area's beautiful frozen lakes, saying: '[The frozen lakes] go on for miles, and a big highlight of the year is the Engadin marathon, which happens in March. Cover star: The new column features in the latest issue of Vanity Fair . 'The Cresta toboggan run, which I attempted five years ago on ladies' day, is not for the fainthearted but is fun to watch.' She also praises the 'ambiance' of Deer Valley in Utah, the 'long runs' of Colorado's Aspen resort and the 'good shops and restaurants' that can be found in Whistler, Canada. Interestingly, although she is one of Vanity Fair's star contributing authors, alongside the likes of Monica Lewinsky and Diane Von Furstenberg, Ms Middleton's column failed to be featured on the cover of this month's issue. Instead, the Royal in-law has been relegated to the 76th page of the publication - perhaps an indication that her column, once revered as one of the highlights of the magazine, has fallen out of the highest favor with her editors. But that may not bother Ms Middleton particularly as it has been widely reported that she has been signed up as a correspondent for NBC's Today show. In November last year, the Brit paid a visit to New York, reportedly to meet with executives from the show and discuss her provisional contract, believed to be worth an estimated $500,000. Following her meeting, Ms Middleton jetted off to Jackson Hole, Wyoming - another location which is featured in her latest Vanity Fair column - where she was spotted at a hoedown dance with locals surrounded by cameras. It is believed that she was filming a test piece for the Today show.","The 31-year-old recommends resorts in the US, France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy .

"A mother who allegedly helped two thugs beat a man to death with a baseball bat had her three children in the house as the attack took place, police say. Candie Dominguez, 35, is accused of helping to batter 35-year-old Jose Menchaca to death along with Daniel Lopez, 28, and Gabriel Moreno, 32, at her home in San Antonio. A witness, who was in the house at the time, said Dominguez ordered him to take her three children into another room where they listened to Mr Menchaca's screams as he died. Candie Dominguez, 35, is accused of battering Jose Menchaca, 35, to death along with Daniel Lopez, 28 (right), while her three children sat in an adjacent room listening to the screams . Dominguez, Lopez and Moreno then dismembered the corpse, put in into trash bags, and hid it in the garage, concealing parts of the body on top of a grill, investigators say. The attack took place at the end of September last year, and Dominguez and Lopez were arrested on October 3. Blood was found in Dominguez' bedroom, where officers think the attack took place. Moreno was taken into custody three weeks later, and today officers raided another house in the northwest of San Antonio, saying they have recovered new evidence linked to the killing. Gabriel Moreno, 32, was arrested along with Dominguez and Lopez last year. Police have today raided another house in search of more evidence . This morning officers raided a home on 9100 block of Canter Horse Drive, located in Northwest Bexar County, though they have refused to say what was discovered. According to an affidavit filed back in October, officers spoke to a friend of Dominguez who was inside the house at the time of the murder. He told police that Dominguez and Lopez had been arguing with the victim shortly before the attack took place on September 30 last year. At one point, Dominguez told him to take her three children into another room where they heard the attack take place. The youngsters reported hearing screams and a man shouting for help, and said they later saw a large amount of blood in their mother's bedroom. The witness added that he saw Dominguez and Lopez putting Mr Menchaca's body into the trunk of a Chevrolet Suburban. The man, who has not been named, later told a relative of Mr Menchaca about the attack, at which point the police were called. Officer searched the house, discovered blood and signs of a struggle, and then discovered the dismembered corpse in the garage. Half a pound of methamphetamine was also discovered. Dominguez, Lopez and Moreno all remain in custody charged with murder. Officer Doug Greene told Fox San Antonio: 'The investigation is not over. We will continue to investigate. We want to make sure we have all evidence that we can present a good strong case to the district attorney.'","Candie Dominguez, 35, accused of beating Jose Menchaca, 35, to death .

"Singer Tulisa Contostavlos appeared to have had a Nigella-style makeover before she arrived at court in central London this morning to face a drugs charge. The 25-year-old singer strode into Westminster Magistrates' Court in sky-high heels, coiffed blonde ringlets and full war-paint before denying one charge of supplying Class A drugs. The N-Dubz star, of Friern Barnet, north London, is accused of setting up an £860 deal to sell 13.9g of cocaine to an undercover reporter. She appeared alongside rapper Mike GLC, . real name Michael Coombs, 35, of Enfield, north London. He too denied a . charge of supplying the drug. Scroll down for video . Tulisa Contostavlos, 25, appeared to have had a Nigella-style makeover before she strode into Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning.  Celebrity chef Lawson looked strikingly elegant when she arrived at Isleworth Crown Court earlier this month for the trial of her assistants, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo . Contostavlos, who wore tight black trousers, a black top and black jacket, was forced to disclose her address to the court after her solicitor applied for it to be withheld to prevent 'unwanted visitors'. But chief magistrate Howard Riddle ruled 'the address must be given' after considering the application with representations from prosecutor Emma Scheer and members of the Press. The singer told the court: 'Just to let you know, after it being read out, in the next month or so I might have to move to a new address.' The court heard how the charge relates to 13.9g of cocaine - dubbed 'white sweets' by Tulisa as a codename for the powder when talking to Mr Mahmood. Emma Scheer, prosecuting, said: 'This was an investigation carried out by an investigative journalist at the Sun newspaper. 'On the March 28, Mazher Mahmood met Tulisa under the pretense of her playing a role in a forthcoming film. 'There was no reference to drugs in that meeting. He again met her later on May 10 at a hotel in London. Holding her head up: Just like Lawson did two weeks ago, Contostavlos made sure she looked her best . Defiant: The singer appeared outside court with her solicitor Ross Dixon after denying the drugs supply charge . Fellow defendant: Rapper Michael Coombs, 35, aka Mike GLC, arrived at court to deny one drugs charge . Court sketch of Coombs, aka Mike GLC, and Contostavlos in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court . 'During the course of the conversation, Tulisa offered to supply cannabis and then cocaine to Mr Mahmood. 'She said she would use a code over the telephone, referring to cocaine as white sweets. 'There was a series of recorded phonecalls. 'On May 21, Mr Mahmood called Tulisa and said he would be in London and . could she get him white sweets and she confirmed she could. 'On May 22, she arranged a table at a club called Whites. 'She then said she would text Mr Mahmood a number of a good friend of hers who would provide her with the sweets. 'That . was the last contact he had with Tulisa. He then telephoned the number . provided and spoke to a gentleman called Mr Coombs.' [caption . Going, going... With large strides and an almost military swing of the arms, Tulisa tried to look in command of the situation as she ran the gauntlet of photographers . The . court heard that Coombs arranged to meet the journalist to supply the . cocaine at the Dorchester hotel, where the meeting was covertly . recorded. Committing the . case to trial at Southwark Crown Court, District Judge Howard Riddle . said: 'This matter is not suitable for a summary trial and is too . serious to be dealt with at the magistrates' court and will be sent to . the Crown court.' 'This matter is too serious to be dealt with at the magistrates' court and will be sent to the Crown court.' - District Judge Howard Riddle . Coombs, who wore a blue jumper and black jeans to attend court, is accused of supplying the drug on May 23. Contostavlos, . who was initially arrested in connection with the incident with Coombs . on June 4, was officially dropped as a judge on X Factor days before her . arrest, with Sharon Osbourne returning to the show in her place. The . pair, who were given unconditional bail by Mr Riddle, will next appear . at Southwark Crown Court in central London on January 14. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced last week that it had authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge the former X Factor judge with 'being concerned in' the supply of Class A drugs. CPS London chief Crown prosecutor Baljit Ubhey said: 'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.' Contostavlos denied the charge and will now appear at Southwark Crown Court on January 14 next year . Different styles: Michael Coombs arrived for his court appearance in trainers, jeans and a blue cardigan, while Tulisa clearly decided the occasion called for a more glamorous look . Low-cut top: Tulisa chose an outfit with a plunging neckline. Even though Nigella's curves are more famous, she chose to cover up for her day in court . Last week Contostavlos' lawyer, Ben Rose, said that his client had joined a line of celebrities who had been used as 'fodder by greedy newspapers'. He said: 'This was a deliberate attempt to target a young woman, who is all the more vulnerable because of her celebrity status.' Contostavlos was initially arrested in connection with the incident with Coombs on June 4. She was officially dropped as a judge on X Factor days before her arrest, with Sharon Osbourne returning to the show in her place. A Sun spokesman defended the article, adding: 'The Sun on Sunday's investigation into Tulisa Contostavlos was entirely justified in the public interest. 'Ms Contostavlos is a self-described role model for young people and therefore has certain responsibilities. 'Throughout our investigation, our team followed the Press Complaints Commission Code and then handed over our dossier of evidence to the police.' Tulisa might have taken some style tips from Nigella’s courtroom makeover, including wearing head-to-toe black, applying heavy make-up and tilting her chin just so, but the singer seems to have missed a few key points from the power dressing memo. While Nigella buttoned up in a high-necked shirt and smart coat, Tulisa is showing off more cleavage than she ever did as an X-Factor judge. She has carefully chosen an all-black outfit and ditched any attention-grabbing accessories but her choice of low-cut top is more distracting than any jewellery she could have worn. Odd fashion choice: The ensemble looked suitably sombre for the occasion - except for Tulisa's hot pink nail varnish and £500 Christian Louboutin stiletto's, which made it look like she was rushing off to a nightclub . Yes, there is a 28-year age gap between the two women, and Tulisa is a young women with a very different style than the 53-year-old chef. But Nigella‘s curves are far more famous than 25-year-old Tulisa’s and she still managed to restrain them for the sake of a court appearance. In fact Nigella was very careful not to show any skin at all, choosing boots and thick tights for her legs, while Tulisa has decided to flash some ankle (a brave choice in December) and couldn’t resist wearing a pair of high-end, highly expensive stilettos. No doubt Tulisa thinks her £500 Christian Louboutins make her look steely and serious, but in reality they make her look like she’s ready to bundle into a cab and head to G.A.Y. the minute the proceedings are over. Her perfectly curled hair extensions and bright pink nails also jar with the sombre style she is trying to channel by wearing a smart black blazer and tailored trousers. But Tulisa does win style points for her make-up, copying her unlikely fashion inspiration Nigella with a strong brow and nude palette.

"Gone are the days when we were simply meat-eaters or vegetarians. Over the past few years, soaring numbers of people have opted to become vegans, pescetarians and fruitarians. Now, there is the rise of the reducetarian - someone who cuts back on meat, but doesn't give it up entirely. Advocates say the move not only boosts health, but benefits the environment - and is easier to achieve than the more radical options. Rising numbers of people are becoming 'reducetarians'. They are committing to eating less meat, seafood and dairy for health and environmental reasons. But they are not giving up these products altogether . Brian Kateman, the founder of the Reducetarian blog, who coined the phrase, is now urging people to take the 30 day 'less meat' pledge. He is asking people to commit to eating less, higher quality meat and reducing their dairy and seafood consumption over a month, and hopefully continue this lifestyle afterwards. He hopes to bring together a community of other groups, known as semi-vegetarians and flexitarians, who also eat mainly a plant-based diet but also eat environmentally-sustainable levels of meat, dairy and seafood. Eating less meat is easy, healthy and good for the environment, he says. Previous studies have shown vegans and vegetarians live for longer than meat-eaters, and in November, a landmark U.S. study claimed switching to a plant-based diet could help reverse diabetes. Mr Kateman argues there are also strong environmental reasons for giving up animal produce. 'We know our planet is in trouble, and we know that meat production from the clearing of lands and trees to the transportation of these products, accounts for nearly 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,' he said in a TedxTalk that aired in November. Mr Kateman has the following tips for putting reducetarianism into practice: . If you eat meat for lunch, skip it for dinner. Participate in Meatless Monday, or choose your own day. Eat grass-fed meat instead of conventionally produced factory farmed livestock. Reduce your portion (i.e. 8 oz instead of 16 oz steak). 'That is why a vegetarian's footprint is nearly half that of a meat lover's. And for a vegan, it's even lower.' Meat production also requires a lot of water; producing one pound of meat protein requires 10 times the amount of water as producing grain protein, he said. Becoming a reducetarian and pledging to eat less, but better quality meat, is the perfect solution, he said. 'By choosing to eat meat sometimes, as opposed to never eating meat, you alter your moral standards for primal urges and convenience,' Mr Kateman said. 'These perceptions matter. These seemingly innocuous labels used to describe our eating choices matter a great deal. 'They determine how seriously we are taken, how our messages are understood, and our feeling of belonging.' Becoming a reducetarian is appealing because it means people don't have to completely give up meat, and can still eat dairy products like eggs, cheese and milk. Mr Kateman believes his theory will be successful as people are much likely to take up a reducetarian diet, whereas for many, becoming vegetarian or vegan is too drastic and unfeasible. In fact, research from the Humane Research Council published in December found 84 per cent of vegetarians and vegans eventually gave up the lifestyle choice. Mr Kateman saysreducing meat, seafood and dairy consumption and eating more fruit and vegetables means reducetarians will lead 'longer, healthier, happier lives' as well as reducing the impact on the environment . More than half (53 per cent) started eating meat again within a year, and almost a third (30 per cent) relapsing within just three months. Mr Kateman said reducing meat consumption, rather than completely giving it up, would see more people sticking to their pledge long-term. He added: 'We need a word that describes a community of individuals who are committed to reducing their consumption of meat.. this is so they can encourage others to reduce their consumption of cows, chickens, pigs, lambs, and seafood.' 'Reducetarianism is the practice of reducing one's personal consumption of meat: red meat, seafood, and poultry. 'With more consumption of fruit and veggies, reducetarians will live longer, healthier, happier lives.'

"A Maryland politician who threatened to sue his local newspaper if they used his name without authorisation has been mercilessly lampooned on Twitter. Kirby Delauter of Frederick County, Maryland, threatened to sue the Frederick News-Post after he was named in a story. Among those attacking Kirby Delauter is North Korean despot Kim Jong-un's official news agency, who tweeted: 'U.S. Senator Kirby Delauter of Maryland condemned for restricting press freedom, as DPRK press freedom is lauded by international reporters.' Kirby Delauter, pictured, Republican council member for Frederick County, Maryland threatened to sue his local newspaper if they printed the name Kirby Delauter without seeking prior authorisation . Kim Jong-un's official news service condemned Kirby Delauter for trying to restrict press freedom . Soon after Councilman Kirby Delauter issued his threat of legal proceedings, Twitter responded immediately . One wag suggested Kirby Delauter should contact Walter White's lawyer Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad . However, the newspaper struck back almost immediately, publishing an editorial which name checked Kirby Delauter 30 times as well as mentioning the hashtag #kirbydelauter, which is being used to mock him on the internet. Also within the editorial, which runs to almost 1,000 words, the newspaper ponders whether they should 'use hyphens as in the case of expletives' or possibly refer to him as Councilman [unauthorized]. However, the editorial is also an acrostic puzzle, with the first letter of each of the 13 paragraphs spelling out Kirby Delauter's name. Many of the online commentators have questioned how the Republican politician will be able to sue a newspaper for using his name without permission, given that free speech is guaranteed under the first amendment of the U.S. constitution. Delauter was elected to the council in Frederick County which is approximately 50 miles away from both Washington DC and Baltimore in rural Maryland. As well as being attacked on Twitter, dozens of people have commented on his Facebook page where Councilman Delauter pledges to 'govern like a taxpayer'. One commenter, Dan Sheckler asked: 'Will you grant permission for the butterknife to be renamed the Kirby Delauter? You know, since it's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.' Kirby Delauter pledged to the people Frederick County that he would 'govern like a taxpayer' Kirby Delauter attacked journalist Bethany Rodgers on Facebook over her coverage of the controversy . But on social media it appeared that Councilman Kirby Delauter was receiving very little support . Some Twitter commentators highlighted the fact that Kirby Delauter seemed to be opposed to the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution by seeking to infringe on freedom of speech . Kirby Delauter told the newspaper: 'Use my name again unauthorized and you'll be paying for an attorney.' However, managing editor of the Frederick News-Post Terry Headlee said: 'I just don't know how to respond to a request that stupid.' Mr Headlee said it's the newspaper's job to hold elected officials accountable by name for their words and deeds. Knowing Councilman Kirby Delauter as we do, we weren't surprised that he threatened The Frederick News-Post with a lawsuit because we had, he says — and we're not making this up — been putting Kirby Delauter's name in the paper without Kirby Delauter’s authorization. Attorneys would be called, Kirby Delauter said. In fact, we spent quite some time laughing about it. Kirby Delauter, an elected official; Kirby Delauter, a public figure? Surely, Kirby Delauter can't be serious? Kirby Delauter’s making a joke, right? Reasonable men (and women) are required to move Frederick County forward. All Kirby Delauter is doing yet again is displaying his inability to control his temper, embarrassing himself, his district, the county and those who voted him into office. If he wants to govern like a taxpayer, he needs to respect the taxpayers whose money provides his paycheck, stop this silly, inflammatory nonsense, and get to work. * The full editorial can be viewed on the Frederick News-Post's website . He added: 'If he doesn't want to be held accountable, he needs to seriously consider whether he's cut out to serve the public.' The Frederick News-Post has a daily circulation of 33,000, although as a result of Kirby Delauter's reaction to the original story, the scandal has now been seen by a global audience, far outside Frederick County. The newspaper headlined its Sunday editorial, which it published online in advance, 'Kirby Delauter, Kirby Delauter, Kirby Delauter'. Entering the name 'Kirby Delauter' into the search engine Google returns 128,000 results in 0.24 seconds. When approached by the Associated Press for comment, Kirby Delauter declined to respond to telephone and email messages. Also, during last night's meeting of Frederick Council Council, the politician did not address his current notoriety. Councilman Delauter had objected to a recent story by Rodgers that said Delauter shared another councilman's concern about a shortage of reserved parking spaces for council members at the county office building. Delauter wrote in his Facebook post that he had refused to be interviewed for the story because Ms Rodgers had misrepresented his comments in the past. This isn't the first time Delauter's quick temper and belligerent style have brought him unflattering attention during his four years as a county official. He stormed out of a board meeting in 2012 after telling a county staff member, 'I'm not going to sit here and be talked to like some punk because I'm asking questions.' Ms Rodgers reported last year that Councilman Delauter called another board member a 'moron' for disagreeing with him on an issue. Washington Post blogger Eugene Volokh, who teaches free speech law at the University of California in Los Angeles, wrote online Tuesday: 'In our country, newspapers are actually allowed to write about elected officials (and others) without their permission.'","Kirby Delauter threatened to sue his local newspaper for using his name .

"She only unveiled her new lingerie range  last week but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, one of the UK's hardest working models, is back - this time modelling M&S' new Spring collection. Sporting soft pale pink knits, a chic polka dot shirt and a racy leather pencil skirt, the 27-year-old looks every inch the stylish star in the new photos. The pieces, which are taken from the brand's Autograph range, launched in stores nationwide this week. Rosie Huntington Whiteley is starring in the Spring campaign for M&S's Autograph range . In the striking shots, the star still has her signature long locks, although she recently went for the chop and now has a fashionable long bob (or 'lob') hairdo. The model enlisted the help of London-based hairdresser George Northwood to create the style and his sister Sally to colour her hair in time for the New Year. Writing on Twitter, Rosie said: 'Ready for 2015 equipped with a fresh new do! Thank you @georgenorthwood @sallynorthwood #BeThereOrHaveBadHair.' The 27-year-old looks chic modelling the store's new Autograph range, including floral bodycon dresses . Rosie is pretty in the store's lightweight beige trench coats, casual boyfriend jeans and pared-back shirts . This all-pink look is one of the highlights and includes a chic pair of fashionable silver flats . But while Rosie might have new hair, unlike the rest of us, she has no plans to go on a traditional New Year diet. The 27-year-old, who also fronted Coca Cola Life's new campaign, says that while she does swear by all things clean and lean, she allows herself sweet treats too. 'I'm travelling all the time so it's hard to find a balance and eat healthily,' she explained. 'I really love my food - I'm always being tempted by room service and I eat out a lot - but I try and eat organic with natural ingredients. 'At home I cook as clean and healthy as possible, so when I'm out I can enjoy a pudding or a glass of wine and actually enjoy myself.' Slim Rosie doesn't deny herself the odd treat and burns off extra calories at dance classes with her friends . Last week, she showed off her enviable body as she modelled her new Valentine's lingerie range . Rosie  has gone for the chop and had her locks cut into a fashionable long bob hairdo for the New Year . She also revealed her favourite way to stay fit - dance classes during which she channels her inner Beyonce. The Devon-born model said: 'I love dance classes! I love Body by Simone - I go with my girlfriends, we all go and sweat our faces off and then have a healthy breakfast. 'You have to make it fun. I like to go to dance classes and feel like Beyoncé.' Rosie has long been a part of the team at M&S and her lingerie range for Autograph is one of the store's best-selling collections. Despite her busy schedule, the actress and model, who recently spoke of her desire to build a brand from her name, was unveiled as the face of hair brand Moroccanoil earlier this year. Rosie is the haircare brand's first ever famous face and shows off her glossy, flowing hair in the new campaign imagery. The model and actress is also gearing up to star in Mad Max: Fury Road alongside Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz and Tom Hardy and is rumoured to have a beauty range in the works.

"Manchester United player Marcos Rojo has sparked widespread anger after posting a picture of notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on a social media site. The Premier League defender posted a photo of Escobar on his Instagram page on January 3 along with a quote attributed to the drug baron, who was linked to thousands of deaths during the bloody drug wars of the 1980s and 90s. Instagram users have now lashed out at the 24-year-old, branding him 'ignorant' and suggesting supporting Escobar was like supporting violence. Rojo's Instagram post (pictured) featured Pablo Escobar and a quote which translated to: 'The only people I will let eat at my table are those who go through hunger with me and never bend at the bad times in life' Rojo (pictured) transferred to Manchester United for a £16million fee last summer . Despite the uproar, the picture remains on Rojo's (pictured) Instagram page and attracted 700 comments . The quote below the picture of Escobar reads: 'The only people I will let eat at my table are those who go through hunger with me and never bend at the bad times in life.' While the quote on its own could be interpreted as harmless, attributing it to Escobar prompted fury. One Instagram user stated it was 'incredible' the Argentinian - who earns £200,000 a week - had posted the picture, saying it was disrespectful to all Colombians who still suffered from the bloody drugs wars Escobar triggered. At the height of his criminal enterprise, Escobar was believed to be worth a staggering $3billion. His wealth was almost entirely generated through large scale drug smuggling, primarily to the U.S., where his Medellin cartel was responsible for 80 per cent of the cocaine distributed throughout the country. Jaime Ortega said: 'S***** Argentines. They dignify Escobar because they didn't suffer the decades of pain our country experienced,' The Sun reported. Andres Gonzalez added: 'Simply seeing Escobar's picture is enough to generate disagreements because of the deaths he caused.' Despite the uproar, the picture remains on Rojo's Instagram page and continues to generate fierce debate. The 24-year-old transferred to Manchester United in the summer for a fee of £16million from Portuguese team Sporting Lisbon. One Instagram user said the picture posted by Rojo (pictured) was disrespectful to all Argentinians . Pablo Escobar (pictured) became one of the wealthiest criminals in history after forming a enormous cocaine smuggling empire . Born in 1949, Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria started his criminal career on the streets of Medellin in Colombia as a teenager, selling contraband cigarettes and stealing cars. When he was gunned down by Colombian National Police on December 2 1993 he was one of the wealthiest criminals in history, worth a staggering $30billion. After working for a short time as a bodyguard in the early 1970s Escobar moved on to cocaine trafficking. His operation became so successful that he was able to buy 15 planes and six helicopters to help smuggle the drugs, mainly to the United States. Escobar amassed so much cash that he had to spend around $2500 a month on rubber bands to keep the piles of notes neatly stacked.

He either bribed them or had them assassinated, which is where the likes of John Jairo Velasquez came in. Escobar was eventually gunned down in 1993 by Colombian police, who found him in a middle-class home in Medellin, with the help of U.S special forces, after a 15-month-long investigation.

"Voters in just a handful of constituencies could determine whether David Cameron or Ed Miliband is prime minister after the most unpredictable general election in decades, polls of marginal seats suggest. A new analysis of 114 seats surveyed individually by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft suggests there is ‘no consistent pattern’ that will allow pollsters to predict the outcome in May with any confidence. ‘It is possible that a handful of seats could decide whether Her Majesty gives the first shot at forming a government to David Cameron or Ed Miliband. The results in the marginals will matter more than ever,’ the peer said. David Cameron's chances of staying in Number 10 after the next election rests on just a handful of constituencies . Former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft said the result of the next election would could down to how a number of marginals 'more than ever' before . His findings, based on constituency polls conducted over the last eight months, have turned up a series of surprising results. Some northern Tory MPs appear to have a better prospect of holding on than some of their southern colleagues, despite the assumption that their party is doing worse in the North. A number of Liberal Democrats are so far defying the national tide with swings in their favour, while others are headed for defeat. Some Labour and Conservative seats are vulnerable to Ukip, even though its vote share was only in single figures in them five years ago. Labour’s chances in May’s election, meanwhile, could be fatally undermined by the surge of the SNP in Scotland, now the subject of more detailed polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft. ‘The coalition Government, the collapse in national support for the third party, the rise of a fourth, and shifting allegiances in Scotland – combined with the accelerating erosion of tribal loyalties that has continued for three decades or more – have made election predictions a more than usually hazardous business,’ he said. ‘Each survey shows the state of play in a given seat at a given point in time: voters who are so inclined will be able to use the snapshot of their constituency to help them decide where to place their cross. ‘Tactical voters can be better informed than ever before. Voters in Sheffield Hallam, for example, will note that Labour look best placed to unseat Nick Clegg in a constituency that the Lib Dems have traditionally – if not, recently, very closely – contested with the Conservatives. ‘Conservatives in both Dudley North and Great Grimsby will see that although their party came second by less than a thousand votes last time round, Ukip now appear to offer the best chance of unseating Labour. ‘Lib Dems considering Labour in North Cornwall will know their seat is on a knife edge, and that their switch would make a Tory gain more likely. ‘Labour voters in Thanet South who do not wish Nigel Farage to represent them in Parliament will observe, however reluctantly, that to keep him out they will have to vote Conservative.’ David Cameron and Ed Miliband need 326 MPs to form a Commons majority. The Conservatives are currently 23 short. Labour need another 69 MPs to form an overall majority. The two parties key target seats are listed above . The latest national poll by YouGov put Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck, on 33 per cent each. Ukip is on 13 per cent, the Greens on eight and the Lib Dems in a miserable fifth position, with seven per cent. Ukip’s performance is its worst with YouGov for three months, despite the pollster prompting respondents by naming the party in its options for the first time. The Eurosceptic party’s standing has been slipping steadily since the summer, according to averages of the main pollsters.","Tory peer Lord Ashcroft releases new analysis of 114 constituencies .

"Rating: . Everyone thinks Best Western is a chain. It is not. All hotels within the group are individually owned and managed - but they operate under the marketing umbrella of Best Western. 'Hotels with personality' is the group's current motto. But my experience is that they differ enormously. The George: A chain hotel - but one with a bit of a story, and a decent dose of character . There are smart ones and not-so-smart ones - and the George in Swaffham, Norfolk, belongs firmly in the second category. It is quite posh from the outside: a former 16th-century coaching inn in a town that comes as something of an elegant, Georgian surprise. Lady Hamilton, Nelson's mistress, lived here. As did Howard Carter, who discovered Tutankhamun's tomb. Our visit coincides with a coach party from Wolverhampton staying overnight. We are all paying around £50 for bed-and-breakfast. Throw in dinner and it works out at no more than £70 for two people. Our room (brown carpet and a whiff of cooking) is normally sold in conjunction with one opposite to create a family annexe. So, rather than having an en-suite bathroom, we wander down the passage, and quite like the stroll. But something odd is going on with the taps. The water comes out of the shower only above the bath. There is no lever to direct it directly into the tub. And don't expect a bottle of designer water or much in the way of soaps and potions. Instead, there is a plastic cup wrapped in cellophane. The restaurant is chokka, so we eat by the window next to the bar. On ordering drinks, they are handed to us over the counter. Lazy or relaxed? We're not sure. No-frills service, for sure. But portions are generous, the atmosphere jovial and, if your visit coincides with a Saturday, the market in Swaffham is a joy. In fact, in 2015, the market will be celebrating 800 years of trading - and the George will be looking on with pride. Best Western George . Station Street . Swaffham . Norfolk .

"Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed ex-girlfriend has made her first porn film. Taylor Chandler, who detailed her relationship and sexual exploits with the swimmer as he was in rehab last November following his DUI arrest, shot the film for Vivid Entertainment. The hard core film is called Going for the Gold and features a male porn star playing a swimmer alongside Chandler. Scroll down for video . Film star: Taylor Chandler (left), the self-proclaimed ex-girlfriend of swimmer Michael Phelps (right) has filmed a hardcore porn for Vivid Entertainment based on their relationship . Making money: Chandler, who is intersex, is being paid six figures for her work in the film . Two stills from the upcoming porn video Going for the Gold . Vivid founder Steve Hirsch told TMZ; 'This is the most unique footage Vivid has ever released. The sky is the limit on this movie.' He also seems to think the video will sell well, paying Chandler in the mid-to-high six figures for her work. Vivid is the same company responsible for numerous celebrity sex tapes, including the famous Kim Kardashian and Ray J video. Chandler, 41, was actually born a boy, and named David Roy Fitch at birth. As a teenager however Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then, in her early twenties, underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia. Chandler was born a male however in name only, and is actually intersex, meaning she had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries. She claims that she and Phelps clicked after meeting on Tinder. 'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair,' she says. 'I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.' Chatty Cathy: Chandler has detailed her relationship with Phelps in numerous interviews . She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer. 'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview. 'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Chandler also claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland. The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program last November.","Taylor Chandler, the self-proclaimed ex-girlfriend of swimmer Michael Phelps, has filmed a hardcore porn film .

"He may have been the ruler of an empire that covered most of Asia, but the final resting place of Genghis Khan remains a mystery. After dying of a sudden illness in 1227 at the age of 72, the Mongol leader was buried at a secret location that has yet to be uncovered. Legend says that as his body was carried to its final resting place, anyone encountered along the route was put to the sword before those escorting the body also killed themselves. More than 10,000 volunteers tagged stuctures, roads and rivers on satellite images as part of the project . But now scientists, aided by a team of amateur archaeologists, believe they are close to finding the final resting place of the first Mongolian emperor. By scouring more than 84,000 satellite images of the area where he suspected of being buried, more than 10,000 volunteers identified sites that looked like they might be of archaeological signficance. Genghis Khan has 16 million male descendants living today, according to DNA research. Scientists have traced a cluster of extremely similar Y-chromosomes back to a single ancestor living in Mongolia around 800 years ago. They believe the only man with the opportunity to father enough children would have been the Mongolian warlord. Within 80 years he built an empire that covered much of China, Iran, Pakistan, Korea and South Russia. The findings confirmed earlier studies that Khan's DNA fingerprint was widespread over the Asican subcontinent. The highest concentration of 'Khan chromosome' carriers was in a group of ethnic Kazakhs. Tom Robinson, an accountancy professor whose ancestors came from the Lake District, was the first man outside Asia to be identified as carrying the Khan chromosome. It was found that Professor Robinson's paternal forebears came from the Caucasus near the Black Sea. The crowdsourcing project  allowed the researchers to survey an area of 6,000 sq km (2,316 square miles), an area twice the size of Yosemite National Park. In a paper published in the journal Public Library of Science One, they claim to have identified 55 potential archaeological sites that could be home to the remains of Genghis Khan. The team were then able to visit some of the sites in Northern Mongolia to carry out ground surveys and use drone aircraft to take pictures from above. Dr Albert Yu-Min Lin, the researcher who led the project at the Calfiornia Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, in San Diego, and a self-confessed Genghis Khan obsessive, said the work has brought them closer to finally answering the question of where Genghis Khan is buried. Dr Yu-Min Lin said that using the help of the public through crowdsourcing helped his team plough through enormous quanities of information that would would have taken years for a single archaeologist to survey all the satellite photos. He added: 'Looking at the data size challenge, we have surveyed a historically significant area of roughly 6,000km2. 'A ground survey of this detail for the entire range would have been prohibitive. 'A single archaeologist would have had to scroll through nearly 20,000 screens before covering the whole area.' Legendary: The Mongol leader built one of the largest empires ever seen in just 80 years but the location of his final resting place after he died  remains a mystery (actor playing Ghengis Khan pictured) While the tomb has still to be found, monuments and statues like the one above exist all over  Mongolia . The satellite images helped the archaeologists find 55 sites that were archaeologically interesting like a circular khirigsuur burial mound (labelled A and B), and stone megaliths known as 'deer stones' (labelled C) Most experts believe Khan was buried somewhere in a valley near the sacred Mongolian mountain of Burkhan Khaldun, near his birthplace in Khentii Aimag, northeastern Mongolia. Despite building up an empire that stretched from the Kaspian Sea to the Yellow Sea, little more is known about where his remains were buried. Recent research has shown that one in every 200 men on the planet is genetically related to Genghis Khan, yet his tomb remains a secret. His direct descendants who followed him as Khan are also thought to have been buried alongside him. Accounts by traders such as Marco Polo who served with the Khublia Khaan in the 13 Century describe how the great Mongol Lords were buried. He described how they were taken to a great mountain called Altai and anyone encountered on the route was killed. It is said that when Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, died more than 20,000 men were put to the death after encountering his body. Popular legend also says that the area around the tomb where Genghis Khan was buried was also trampled by horses for month to obliterate signs of the grave. Genghis Khan was initially called Temüjin when he was born in 1155 or 1162 near Burkhan Khaldun mountain . The Mausoleum of Genghis Khan (above), built in Xinjie Town in Inner Mongolia in 1954, attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year, but the location of the actual tomb that contains his remains has been lost . In an attempt to find this legendary Valley of the Khans, and the tomb of their first great leader, volunteers were asked to tag modern and historic features and structures on satellite images. Within six months 10,000 people had spent a total of 30,000 hours, or 3.4 years, tagging more than 2.3 million sites as part of the project, that was conducted with National Geographic. From these the research team were able to narrow down the list to 100 accessible locations, of which 55 appeared to have archaeological significance. These included circular 'khirigsuur' burial mounds and rectangular burial mounds ranging from the Bronze Age to the Mongol period. The search also found stone megaliths and ancient city fortifications. Genghis Khan is thought to be buried in the legendary Valley of the Khans near to Burkhan Khaldun mountain . The researchers visited some of the 55 sites and surveyed them from the air using drone aircraft . Although the researchers visited the sites identified, digging at these locations is highly controversial and previous attempts to excavate potential tombs in Mongolia have been deeply unpopular with the public. Instead the researchers may have to use ground penetrating radar and other equipment in an attempt to narrow down their search further. Dr Yu-Min Lin said: 'In total, a wide variety of archaeological material was identified from the crowd based analytics, ranging from 10 meter diameter rock piles to 200 meter wall structures.' He added that their project had also shown the power of using crowdsourcing to help scientific and archaeological studies. He said the recent attempt to locate the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, where 8 million participants surveyed satellite images for signs of the plane showed the power of such techniques. He said: 'The shear mass of participation in this example provides a glimpse of the potneital of our networked society. 'These crowdsourcing activities help us dive into the unknown and extract the unexpected.'","Final resting place of Mongol leader has remained a secret for 800 years .

"Paula Wilson, who has been jailed for 32 months, after she filmed an unconscious woman having her head shaved at a flat in Ballymena . A scalping gang has been jailed after they shaved an unconscious victim's head and filmed it on a mobile phone in what has been described as an 'appalling act of degradation'. The female victim had her head dry-shaved by three men, who then tried to burn the remainder of her hair at a flat in Ballymena, County Antrim, in May 2013. The trio - Paul Joshua Balmer, William Hamilton and Nathan Telford - then slapped the woman, who has not been named, while the entire attack was filmed on a mobile phone by Paula Wilson. The video, which lasts around ten minutes, shows the victim having her eyebrows shaved before her hair is then dry-shaved by the three men. Using disposable razors, at one stage the footage shows three pairs of hands shaving her head at the same time. In the footage, one of the men can be heard joking: 'No point on going easy on her, we can't send her away with a poor haircut,' and then asked other, 'Will we just shave the whole head... I am a democratic sort of person, if you want to baldy her, baldy her.' An attempt is then made to set part of the woman's hair on fire, with jokes being made by her attackers about setting off the fire alarm. The footage only came to police attention when Wilson, 22, was arrested for a separate offence by police investigating an attack on 'body-in-the-bin' victim Adam Robinson, who was found naked and bound inside a taped-up wheelie bin. She will be sentenced later in the year for her part in that attack. The bin had been hidden in dense undergrowth in the Sentry Hill area of Ballymena and the discovery was made by someone out walking their dog in September 2013. When Wilson was arrested for the attack on Mr Robinson, detectives seized her mobile phone, and on examination uncovered the shocking head-shaving footage. As well as the film, there were also multiple images of the injured party and the four defendants on Wilson's phone. The attack had gone unreported because the vulnerable victim - who had no recollection whatsoever about the incident - was left traumatised and had fled Ballymena. Wilson, arriving at Antrim Crown Court sitting in Belfast today with her mother. The court heard how she gave conflicting accounts of the head-shaving incidents to two different doctors . Wilson - who the court heard was expelled from school and who was also sacked from two jobs - gave varying accounts of the head-shaving incident. While she told one doctor she was so drunk she couldn't remember the event, she told another that she had a clear memory as she hadn't drunk that much alcohol. Nathan Telford, who was handed a 40-month sentence for his part in shaving the unconscious victim's head . At Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast today, she was handed a 32-month sentence, half of which will be spent in custody with the remaining 16 months spent on supervised licence. It comes after she admitted two counts of aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting common assault. Three of her co-accused were also jailed for their involvement in the incident on the victim, who Judge Donna McColgan described as 'comatose' and 'extremely vulnerable.' Hamilton, 23 and Telford, also 23, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault. Telford was handed a 40 month sentence, half of which will be served in custody with the remaining 20 months on licence and Hamilton was sentenced to 36 months. Balmer, 42, had denied involvement and contested the matter but was found unanimously guilty by a jury at Antrim Crown Court on three charges last September. Balmer - who committed the offences two days after he was released from HMP Magilligan - was found guilty of two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault. The heroin addict, who has 261 previous convictions, was handed a five year sentence - half of which will be spent in prison with the remaining half of the sentence served on licence when he is released from custody. After passing sentence, Judge McColgan said: 'Should this case come before the Court of Appeal, then that court should be shown the recorded footage of the entire episode.'","Unconscious victim had her head shaved by gang at a flat in Ballymena .

"A British charity supported by Dame Judi Dench and Ricky Gervais is helping save the lives of hundreds of dreadfully injured and abandoned greyhounds in Spain. Some of the dogs have been tortured – burned with cigarettes and acid – some dumped to die in tunnels, hung in trees or released on busy motorways. Others have been left with broken bones to starve to death. In at least one case, a rope had become so deeply encrusted in the neck of a greyhound it had to be surgically removed by a vet while dozens of others have had gaping, open wounds – the results of abuse - by the time they are found by volunteers across Spain. Scroll down for video . Cruelty: Shocking pictures taken by vets and volunteers are held in the files of the Middlesex-based charity Greyhounds in Need (GIN), which is helping to save the lives of the injured and abandoned hounds .

There is supreme neglect and cruelty on a large scale.' Care: This  injured canine is pictured being cared for by GIN. Many of the rescued greyhounds have been found homes with families in Britain and across Europe . Hope: The charity has helped save and treat between 6,000 and 7,000 greyhounds since 1998 . Tortured: Ropes tied around the necks of the greyhounds caused horrific injuries. Others had gaping, open wounds . Shocking pictures taken by vets and volunteers held in the files of the Middlesex-based charity Greyhounds in Need (GIN) show the scale of the problem that has seen the group help save and treat between 6,000-7,000 greyhounds since it was formed in 1998. Many have been found homes with families in Britain and across Europe - all treated by vets in Spain at shelters supported by the group. Disturbing new video recently obtained by GIN and filmed undercover in the Spanish countryside shows locally-bred hunting greyhounds, known as galgos in Spain, being held from the back of a pick-up on leashes and made to keep up with the vehicle as part of their training for blood-sport competition during the four-month long hare coursing season. When the video of the five greyhounds being ‘dragged’ from behind the truck was shown by GIN at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, there was outrage. ‘They are awful pictures,’ said Martin Humphery, of GIN, ‘It is very clear that they are suffering greatly. ‘We hope that it will finally help open eyes to the kind of abuse that is going on. It is very disturbing but sadly typical of the kind of things that is going on with these poor galgos. ‘There is supreme neglect and cruelty on a large scale. 'We have had cases of dogs being tied to rocks and left to starve to death, others with cigarette burns and some just thrown over fences and abandoned with broken legs.’ GIN works with a network of shelters across Spain where the primary rescue and treatments are carried out. Dragged: New video filmed in the Spanish countryside shows greyhounds being held from the back of a pick-up on leashes and made to keep up with the vehicle . Abandonded: When the hunting season is over, the Spanish hunters often discard their greyhounds like ‘cigarette butts', rescue workers say, buying new ones for the next season . Neglect: Some of greyhounds are tied to rocks and left to starve to death, others  are burned with cigarettes and some are thrown over fences and abandoned with broken legs . It funds vets, treatment, shelters and care – and assists in finding homes with families of greyhound lovers in Britain, Italy, Belgium and France. Among those supporting the organisation, which spends around £250,000 a year on saving the dogs – funding comes mainly from donations and two shops on the South Coast run by the charity - is comedian Ricky Gervais, who has highlighted the plight and mistreatment of greyhounds around the world on Twitter. Oscar winning actress Dame Judi Dench, author Jilly Cooper and actor Peter Egan, a star of Downton Abbey – the owner of six rescue dogs - are among GIN’s heavy-weight patrons. Last month a shipment of eight dogs arrived at GIN’s kennels at Wraysbury, near Windsor, while they await adoption with their details posted on the organisation’s website. In Spain, they had been treated at shelters, sterilised, micro chipped and have been tested and found clear of Mediterranean diseases before they come to the UK. Not all are abandoned to die, some are left outside shelters because they are no longer of use and some merely dumped over the shelter fence – several broke bones in this way. Others are rescued injured and terrified from dog pounds, known to rescue groups locally as ‘killing stations'. One dog was found  hanging from a tree while many are found with badly damaged legs caught in snare traps. ‘We hear some dreadful stories of how the galgos are treated,’ Mr Humphery said, ‘The standard of care is very low, the hunting season takes place in very hot ghastly conditions and once that is over there is often little need for the galgos. 'We are not just talking neglect but cruelty. Some have been tied up to rocks and left to starve to death. Brighter future: Some greyhounds have been found and treated with the help of GIN but many, they say, have died fending for themselves . New homes: Eight greyhounds rescued by the charity are pictured here with kennel maid Dorie Laver. They are waiting to be rehomed . Justice: Prosecution for the mistreatment of animals in Spain is extremely rare and most people don't seem to 'care or worry' about it . ‘We are thankful for the goodwill of some very dedicated Spanish people, who are often derided by the local community they live among because of their attitudes and work in trying to help the galgos. ‘Yes, Spain is in Europe but these are often very macho rural communities and the welfare of the dogs is not a priority. 'It is a problem that national and local governments choose not to address. ‘While some laws do exist concerning the mistreatment of animals, prosecution are extremely rare. It is just not something most people seem to care or worry about.’ One of the many cases highlighted by GIN, is that of is that of Fuga, ‘a lovely white galga’, (a female) that was found with a terrible slash in her neck from an incrusted rope in the Huelva area of Spain popular with tourists. A volunteer found her and she was treated – the cost picked-up by GIN. She made a full recovery and has been adopted by a family. ‘It was a disgraceful case,’ said Mr Humphery. When the hunting season is over, the Spanish hunters often abandon their greyhounds like ‘cigarette butts,’ rescue workers say, buying new ones for the next season. The Spanish Galgo is said to be the only breed of dog that is capable of maintaining a constant and fast pace in a run or race that can last up to an enduring five minutes. Competitions are held nationally and locally with thousands hunting each year. Help: GIN works with a network of shelters across Spain where the primary rescue and treatments are carried out. It funds vets, treatment, shelters and care – and assists in finding homes with families of greyhound lovers in Britain, Italy, Belgium and France . Celebrity endorsement: Oscar-winning actress Dame Judi Dench, author Jilly Cooper and actor Peter Egan, a star of Downton Abbey  are among GIN’s heavy-weight patrons . In one competition, the dogs are held at pace by a man known as a ‘soltador’ riding a horse. He then releases them simultaneously to chase the hare – although the galgo that kills it is not necessarily the winner. Dogs are awarded points for speed, overtaking, resistance, the tracking of the hare and the killing. The races, to be valid, must last a minimum of 55 seconds but can be as long as five minutes. The dogs can be disqualified if they behave in an irregular manner during the race. A galgo that does not follow the exact path of the hare and runs a shorter distance will receive penalty points and will not win. When this happens the Spanish say that the dog is ‘dirty’. Animal charities believe that at the end of the coursing season many dogs, even those chipped by owners and breeders, are abandoned and simply reported as ‘missing’. Some have been found and treated with the help of GIN but many, they say, have died fending for themselves.

These pictures show Oklahoma City Zoo's as yet unnamed infant elephant getting her first wash since she was born just over three weeks ago. It proved a rather more joyous occasion than attempting to wash a limp, helpless, screaming human baby. As Tara Henson, with the Oklahoma City Zoo, told KFOR.com: 'If I could start my morning out every morning just watching a baby elephant getting a bath or just romping around I would do it. 'If you aren’t smiling when you see that baby elephant then I don’t know you’re just not human.' Scroll down for video . Bathtime fun: A yet to be named baby Asian elephant sticks her trunk out of her enclosure during her first shower at the Oklahoma City Zoo. She was born just over three weeks ago, weighing a whopping 332lbs . It's all relative: Despite her being born weighing more than most fully grown men, Oklahoma City Zoo's elephant calf is dwarfed by her mother Asha, who also has another daughter at the zoo called Malee . The unnamed calf was born at Oklahoma City Zoo on December 22 at 1.35pm, weighing 332lbs. Her mother Asha and father Rex already have another daughter, called Malee, who has reportedly already taken her baby sister under her trunk. Laura Bottaro, the zoo's animal curator, said: 'The baby is doing great she really enjoys being with her sister. Malee is over the moon with her.' With an estimated 30,000 Asian elephants left in the wild, where they range from across South East Asia from India to Borneo, the species is officially classified as endangered. The population has fallen by half in just three generations. Bashful: The baby hides beneath her mother's legs. The zoo is holding a public vote to choose her name . Oklahoma City Zoo is holding a public vote to name what they describe as their 'new pachyderm princess'. Keepers have narrowed the selection down to four choices: . Achara (A-ka-ra): Of Thai origin, meaning 'pretty angel' and the zoo keepers’ favorite. Biju (Bee-joo): Of Indian origin, meaning 'awesome'. Divya (Div-ya): Of Indian origin, meaning 'divine'. Sage: Of English origin, meaning 'wise one'. You can cast your vote on the zoo's website. The results will be announced on Friday.","The as-yet-unnamed elephant calf was born just over three weeks ago .

"Benedict Cumberbatch and his fiancée Sophie Hunter have confirmed they are expecting their first child. Just two months after announcing their engagement, the 38-year-old actor and his 36-year-old theatre director partner are looking forward to becoming parents for the first time. A spokesperson for Benedict confirmed to MailOnline: 'I am delighted to confirm that Benedict Cumberbatch and Sophie Hunter are expecting their first child. They are both over the moon.' Scroll down for video . Baby news: Benedict Cumberbatch’s fiancée Sophie Hunter, seen here on Saturday at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, is pregnant with their first child . The New York Post's Page Six were the first to report that the Imitation Game star was 'delighted and excited about becoming a dad'. A source told the site: 'Sophie is a few months along, and both she and Benedict are very excited about it. They are also quietly planning to marry in early spring.' Sources told the column that the couple - who got engaged in early November - are now planning wed in the next few months, sooner than previously expected. Keeping covered up: The actress wore a long and flowing silk Just Cavalli dress and kept her clutch in front of her stomach as the pair were photographed . Sophie was last seen publicly on Saturday with her husband-to-be at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Walking hand-in-hand with Benedict, the actress wore a long and flowing silk Just Cavalli dress and kept her clutch in front of her stomach as they posed for photographs. At the film festival the English actor was asked about his marriage plans by the press but said he was too busy. Change of plan: Sources told the column that the couple are now planning wed in the next few months, sooner than previously expected - they announced their engagement in November . He told Popsugar when asked about heading down the aisle: 'One thing at a time. I'm playing Sherlock now - just about to start - so my main focus is going to be on that.' Marriage is clearly very important to the heart throb and last year he told Elle Japan: . 'It's a wonderful thing to get married young and become a father. I used to think that I'd get married by my mid-thirties and have children. Traditional courtship: The actor announced rather modesty in the forthcoming marriages section of the Times of London that he was engaged . 'But now I think I can wait. I'm no longer in a hurry to get married.' He once said that talking about his life away from work  ‘always came back to haunt me in strange ways. I have been judged for my relationships or for not being a father in the weirdest ways.’ He told Event magazine in 2013: 'I was happy as an only child, but I’ve always wanted to be part of a bigger family. I would love to have children. ‘Everyone wants to know when I’m going to settle down and who is going to be Mrs Cumberbatch. I can’t wait to do an interview like this and just talk about my child. Working hard: On Tuesday, Benedict was pictured arriving at the Colston Hall, Bristol to film the latest instalment of the massively popular Sherlock TV programme . 'My stepsister – my mother’s daughter from her first marriage – had a kid when I was about 11. I thought, “Wow, this is incredible, they come in much smaller sizes!”... I was always the one at parties who looked after the younger children. I really enjoyed it.' In 2010, he told the Telegraph: 'I am very broody. I have been broody for the last five years because I have two godchildren. 'I know you pick up an amazing amount of stamina the minute you become a dad, but I would like to be a young dad. I would love to have the ability to juggle a career and have a young child.' Happy times: While the actor is revered for his role in the acclaimed show, fatherhood is likely to be his most exciting project yet . The star has always been rather quiet when it comes to his love life but chose to announce his betrothal to Sophie with a £324 advertisement in The Times newspaper. The traditional heart throb flew to Edinburgh to ask her mother's permission for her daughter's hand in marriage before getting down on one knee. The piece read: 'Mr BT. Cumberbatch and Miss S.I. Hunter: The engagement is announced between Benedict, son of Wanda and Timothy Cumberbatch of London, and Sophie, daughter of Katharine Hunter of Edinburgh and Charles Hunter of London.' Benedict and Oxford-educated Sophie, who first met in 2009, had gone to great lengths to avoid being seen together in public since they started dating last year ahead of their engagement announcement. They can't get enough of him: The popular actor was shielded by an umbrella as she made his way back to his car surrounded by a throng of people . They were first seen publicly together in June 2014 at the French Open but they first met when starring opposite each other in Burlesque Fairytales in 2009. But since becoming engaged, they have walked down the red carpet together at events such as The London Evening Standard awards and The Imitation Game premiere. Sophie was also Benedict's date at the wedding of the actor’s old school pal, James Rhodes, but it is believed she has wanted to remain anonymous since the beginning of their relationship. Supporting role: Sophie took pride of place on Benedict's arm at the New York premiere of his latest movie, The Imitation Game on November 17 . A ratings hit: The star plays Alan Turing in the wartime biopic alongside Keira Knightley (left) - who is also pregnant with her first child . Cumberbatch previously spent 10 years with The Thick Of It star Olivia Poulet, who met while studying at Manchester University, before splitting in 2010. Since then, the Sherlock star has been linked with several high-profile women, including Star Trek co-star Alice Eve and Lord Of The Rings actress Liv Tyler. More recently, Cumberbatch has dated furniture designer Anna Jones in 2012, before apparently rekindling an old friendship with Russian model and actress Katia Elizarova in 2013.

"Sainsbury's suffered sliding sales over Christmas - its first fall over the festive period for at least a decade. The supermarket said today like-for-like sales fell 1.7% in the 14 weeks to January 3 - a fourth consecutive quarterly fall - and boss Mike Coupe said the outlook remained 'challenging'. It is the first time in at least ten years that the retailer has suffered a fall over Christmas even though it said it enjoyed a record-breaking week before December 25 with 29.5 million customer transactions. Sainsbury's is the first of the Big Four to announce its results for the Christmas period, but while sales were down they were better than expected. Mr Coupe, who replaced Justin King as CEO in July, said Sainsbury's sold 'the same amount of stuff we sold last year at Christmas, but the prices were lower'. Results: Sainsburt's has said like-for-like sales fell 1.7% in the 14 weeks to January 3 and boss Mike Coupe said the outlook remained 'challenging' Analysts had forecasted sales would be down between 2.5 and 4.4 percent and represents an improvement from a second quarter decline of 2.8 percent. As a result shares opened up 6p at 241p this morning. The decline means there is huge pressure on its new chief executive, Mike Coupe, to come up with a big idea to halt the slide in sales, which he believes will continue to drop. He said: 'Sainsbury's has provided a great Christmas for our customers. Food price deflation and falling fuel prices have enabled our customers to treat themselves over the festive period. 'The outlook for the remainder of the financial year is set to remain challenging, with food price deflation likely to continue. We currently expect our fourth quarter like-for-like to be similar to that of our first half. To date, the supermarket giant has largely remained aloof from the price battle triggered by the rise of chains like Aldi, Lidl and Netto, believing its quality would retain the loyalty of shoppers. It came as experts predicted a 'discount revolution' where one in four shoppers will switch to a budget supermarket to save money in 2015. To fight the trend of falling sales across the big four Asda was the first to announce price cuts this morning, and was swiftly followed by Sainsbury's. Tesco and Morrisons are likely to follow. Asda has promised to spend £300million slashing the cost of 'essentials', including fruit and vegetables, cereal, milk, meat, eggs, fish, nappies and toilet rolls. Price comparison: With price drops across Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Sainsbury's, we've compared some of the essentials (source: moneysupermarket.com) Cutting prices: Asda said today it is ploughing £300million into price cuts in the first three months of this year . Today Sainsbury's will  announce more than 700 permanent price cuts tomorrow, which are added to reductions on more than 200 introduced in the run-up to Christmas. While the likes of Tesco, Asda and Morrisons battle to keep up with discounting rivals Aldi and Lidl, high-end supermarkets remain popular with consumers. Upmarket Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, today reported a 2.8 per cent increase in store sales over the Christmas period, results which are predicted to outperform all of the firm's major rivals. The employee-owned company said total sales in the five weeks to 3 January, excluding fuel, were £728million, up 7 per cent year-on-year. The upmarket grocery chain's online sales also fared well, increasing by 26.3 per cent. Waitrose's managing director Mark Price said: 'As a business owned by the people who work here, we can take the long-term view and our Christmas results show the effectiveness of our strategy of investing in good value, in making our shops attractive destinations and in building our online business'. Although Waitrose has won sales from rivals it has not been immune to the ongoing industry price war. In September it posted a 9.4 per cent fall in first-half operating profit, partly because it had to cut prices and step up promotions to remain competitive. Mr Coupe has pledged a £150million investment per year for the next three years, which would translate into cuts to regular prices on more than 1,000 of the most popular items in customers' baskets and followed 200 lower prices put in place in November. Many products have been reduced by £1, such as a whole roasting chicken, a pack of ten Taste the Difference Ultimate Sausages, 460g packs of chicken breast fillets and 240g packs of salmon fillets. Sainsbury’s is promoting the fact that it is delivering big reductions on the cost of a full English breakfast fry up. It has cut the price of a large white sandwich loaf by 30p to £1, while a pack of eight pork sausages is down by the same amount to £1.10. Butter is down by 15p to 95p, a litre of UHT milk by 20p to 70p and a litre of orange juice down by 10p to £1. The price of a pack of large Happy Eggs Large free range eggs came down from £2.15 to £1.90 in the autumn. The update comes during a key week for the retailers announcing Christmas trading figures, with Tesco and Marks & Spencer due to disclose sales numbers tomorrow. Supermarkets are engaged in a fierce price war amid a squeeze on their market share by discounters Aldi and Lidl while upmarket food offerings from Waitrose and M&S are also doing well - with Waitrose yesterday reporting a 2.8% Christmas sales rise. Sainsbury's own high-end range, Taste the Difference, did well over the third quarter with growth of five per cent, including prosecco sales up 30 per cent. It also sold more than 57 million mince pies and more than 550,000 turkeys, up eight per cent year-on-year. Experts have said that although discount shoppers are happy with the prices, they found customers are getting increasingly upset about the shopping experience. Long queues, foreign workers and lack of choice are among the top moans of those more used to the comparative luxury of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's or Morrisons. Two studies revealed the growth of the called 'Lidl Class', shoppers who now do either a weekly or simple top up shop at the discount chains. According to comparison site GoCompare, 26 per cent of Brits will, this year, do more of their shopping at one of these chains as part of their moneysaving strategy. Other plans to rein in spending include giving up coffee shop treats and takeaways as their poll of 2,000 adults revealed 15 per cent are 'seriously worried' about their outgoings. Going down: Since the start of 2015, some of the UK's biggest supermarkets have further cut fuel prices . Since the start of this year, Britain's 'Big Four' supermarkets - Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco - have knocked 2p a litre off their prices for petrol and diesel. Asda was the first to announce its fuel price cuts yesterday but it wasn't long before the other major supermarkets announced matching reductions. The cuts mean Asda customers pay no more than 107.7p a litre for petrol and 114.7p a litre for diesel. The latest price cuts marked the thirteenth time since September that Asda has reduced fuel prices since the end of September taking, in total, 19p a litre off petrol and 15p a litre off diesel. Mike Coupe said today that prices could hit a £1-a-litre or go even lower.","Supermarket says like-for-like sales down 1.7% in 13 weeks to January 3 .

"During a TV documentary charting his final playing season at Manchester United, Ryan Giggs is shown getting angry in the wake of a home defeat to Sunderland in his second game as interim manager. His knuckles go white on his car’s steering wheel. Three months on, United’s new assistant manager is no longer angry as he sits in a low chair in a Beverly Hills hotel. The message, though, is exactly the same. ‘The players have got to take a bit of pride in how they perform, train and play,’ says Giggs. ‘There’s no doubt that few players lived up to the standards of what they are capable of doing last season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal taking charge of shooting practice . Bad way to start: Ryan Giggs had a spell as caretaker manager at Manchester United last season . Slump: By the time Giggs took control it was too late to stop United finishing seventh in the Premier League . ‘They are not bad players but last . season’s league position showed that we didn’t perform. The way back for . them has started already, in training. There is no time to waste. The . recovery has to start now, getting some kind of form. ‘That . is why I was so disappointed after the Sunderland game. The team I put . out would have won if they had played to their potential.’ United have a new manager now of course, Dutchman Louis van Gaal, but the wreckage of last season remains. A . seventh-place Barclays Premier League finish means no European football . while some of the continent’s biggest stars have decided to look . elsewhere for their career development. It’s . tempting to say that Giggs has seen it all before, but he hasn’t. He . hasn’t seen United off their perch, looking desperately for the . credibility and authority that always seemed part of their DNA. Asked . if there was fear in United’s football at Old  Trafford last season, . Giggs says: ‘Yeah, there was. Old Trafford had always been a fortress . over the years, the place nobody wanted to go. Towards the end of last . season it wasn’t like that. ‘You don’t know if players will be scarred by last season but you hope they respond in a positive way. ‘In my first season we lost out in the league against Leeds and I couldn’t wait in the pre-season to get back. ‘I wanted to get rid of that feeling I had because until you could do something about it that feeling was always there. ‘I’m sure these players can’t wait to get to Old Trafford and produce the form they are all capable of.’ Legend: Ryan Giggs retired as a player after a career which included 963 games and 34 trophies . Emotional exit: Although Giggs was caught up in the moment he is determined to look to the future now . Giggs, . 40 now, has been impressed by Van Gaal. Offered the role of assistant . after half an hour of chat in a Dutch hotel last May, he believes he . sees some of the great Sir Alex Ferguson in his new mentor’s methods and . thinks he sees United’s players responding to the 62-year-old’s simple, . clear methods. It will seem strange never to see Giggs in a red shirt again. United’s record appearance holder’s time has finally passed. He isn’t overly interested in sentimental reflection, though. Giggs . admits he became  emotional briefly at the end of last season — . wondering if his time at the club was up — but all that disappeared once . he met Van Gaal in Amsterdam. Dominant figures: Giggs has drawn similarities between Sir Alex Ferguson and Louis van Gaal . Straight to the point: Giggs claims he wasn't asked to be Van Gaal's assistant, he was told . VIDEO Van Gaal delighted with new-look United . ‘He was pretty direct about it,’ recalls . Giggs. ‘It was after about half an hour of meeting him. He straight out . asked — or did he tell me?! He might have told me actually! ‘He . just said: “You’re my assistant manager” — or “I want you to be my . assistant” — and I didn’t think twice. It was obviously a tremendous . opportunity for me to learn from one of the great managers and stay at . the club and try to get better as a coach. ‘I . do think there are similarities with Sir Alex. They do have an aura . about them. That comes from the success they have had. They demand the . players respond and they demand respect. ‘In the short space of time I have worked with Louis you can see why he has been a success. On a high: Van Gaal's success with Holland at the World Cup has earned him the respect of the United squad . Bold: Van Gaal's decision making has also earned him praise from Giggs, such as bringing Tim Krul on for Holland's penalty shootout win against Costa Rica in the quarter-finals . ‘He . is infectious. He wants everything right from the first minute of . training to the last. Everything he does is clear. And everyone gets it . straight away. ‘He has got a . unique way of putting it over and it’s brilliant to see. To see it . first-hand is great for my  experience and the players. ‘What . he did at the World Cup with Holland was brilliant, the way he changed . his goalkeeper against Costa Rica for example. If I was the opposition . penalty-taker it would be somewhere in my head: “Why have they changed . keepers. Is he someone special?” ‘It’s . what makes top managers — their decision-making. If it had gone wrong . he would have had to face the consequences. That’s what you’ve got to . do. You’ve got to back what you think is right. ‘Sometimes . it will go wrong but if you stick to your principles usually it will be . OK. You have to do that if you are manager of Manchester United.’ With . the season looming, United’s first steps on the road back to . respectability have already been made. In Giggs’ mind, though, there . should be no baby steps. Two  decades at Old Trafford have taught him . that much. Asked if a . top-four finish would be acceptable this season, his eyes darkened and . it was possible to imagine those knuckles whitening on the wheel again. ‘No, . no,’ he says. ‘With the players we’ve got I want to be contesting for . the league. There are people in that dressing room who have won the . league many, many times. ‘They are winners who were hurt by the way we played last year. We’ll be wanting to win the league.’ Top dogs: Giggs insists a top four finish is not enough for United next season, they must go for the title .","Ryan Giggs compares Louis van Gaal to former manager Sir Alex Ferguson .

"Rockne Newell, 60, has filed a federal lawsuit against Monroe County Correctional Facility for the right to less starchy prison food . A man jailed for killing three people at a town planning meeting in Pennsylvania is suing for the right to less starchy prison food. Rockne Newell, 60, has filed a federal lawsuit against Monroe County Correctional Facility, alleging he has been subjected to cruel treatment because his special dietary requests have been ignored. His attorneys claim the prison's high-starch meals trigger erratic mood and energy swings, which could endanger Newell's long-term health. They say that he'd be better off with the kosher meals Jewish inmates receive. Apparently Newell's attempts to purchase healthier options have been hindered by commissary spending limits. According to the Scranton Times-Tribune, his lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a court order for him to be provided with foods not harmful to his welfare. Newell has been held without bail since August 5, 2013, when he was charged with three counts of homicide following a shooting spree at the Ross Township supervisors' meeting that night. Monroe County District Attorney David Christine intends to seek the death penalty for Newell, who pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. Prosecutors have said the junk dealer was upset over the loss of his debris-strewn property after a lengthy court fight with the township. The township had acted on complaints that he lived in a storage shed, built an illegal culvert and used a bucket outside as a toilet. The township supervisors were about 15 minutes into their public meeting on the first Monday in August when things reportedly went 'terribly awry.' Newell has been held without bail since August 5, 2013, when he was charged with three counts of homicide following a shooting spree at the Ross Township supervisors' meeting that night . Ramshackle: The deadly shooting was allegedly connected to a 23-year dispute over Newell's property (above) Killed were Gerard Kozic, 53, David Fleetwood,62, and James V. LaGuardia, 64. Three other people were injured before Newell was restrained by Bernard Kozen, the township's parks director. Township solicitor John Dunn, who was one of Newell's alleged targets but escaped injury, testified at the suspect's preliminary hearing. Newell has since said he regrets that 'innocent people got hurt' in the shooting.","Rockne Newell is currently at the Monroe County Correctional Facility on triple murder charges .

"A former guidance counselor has been sentenced to two years behind bars for having sex with a male student - even though his parents asked a judge not to send her to prison. Mackenzie Land Matthews, a 34-year-old married mother who resigned from her job at Heath High School two months ago, wept at the sentencing hearing in Licking County, Ohio on Tuesday. She had pleaded guilty to having sex with an 18-year-old student she met at the school. Even though the contact was consensual, it is a crime for a teacher to have sex with a student in Ohio. 'If she'd just waited four months (for the student to graduate), it wouldn't have been a crime,' Prosecutor Ken Oswalt said, the Columbus Dispatch reported. Locked up: Mackenzie Matthews, 34, has been sentenced to two years in prison for having sex with an 18-year-old student in 2010. During the hearing, she apologized to her husband, children and the victim . Matthews, who was also ordered to register as a sex offender for the rest of her life, apologized for her actions at the sentencing hearing. 'I just want to sincerely apologize to the victim and his family, and to the Heath community and my school system,' she said tearfully. 'I want to apologize to my friends and my family and my children, and especially my husband. I want to express the remorse I have for this, and I accept the responsibility for my actions.' The male student was not in court. None of his relatives were present, in a bid to protect his identity. Oswalt told Licking County Common Pleas Judge Thomas Marcelain that the victim's parents did not want Matthews to receive prison time for the sake of her children. The victim had said he wished the outcome to be left to the courts, the Newark Advocate reported. Although the judge said it was unlikely Matthews would repeat the offense, he chided her for using her job to facilitate the relationship, even though she was 'obliged to prevent such conduct'. Matthews had pleaded guilty to one count of sexual battery for having sex with the then-high school senior while they were off school campus between February and March 2010. Scene: She met the student while working at Heath High School in Ohio as a guidance counselor. The relationship came to light when he told someone last year, and that person went to authorities . They kept the relationship quiet until the man told someone about it this year, and that person contacted the Licking County Children Services, who in turn alerted police. When questioned by police, neither Matthews nor the victim denied the accusations. Matthews, who was hired by the school district in 2005, was charged in November and handed in her resignation shortly afterwards. After her resignation, school district officials expressed their relief. 'It's good to have resolution on the district's end, but this has been very, very difficult,' Superintendent Trevor Thomas told the Newark Advocate. 'We're a small town, so it's really just devastating, because everyone knows everything.' Matthews had been the district's only guidance counselor and had had no disciplinary action. In her latest review, Matthews wrote about how much she enjoyed her job. 'This is my 9th year working at HHS,' she wrote. 'I feel very lucky to be part of such a wonderful school district. I truly enjoy what I do, and that is something you can't put a price on.'","Mackenzie Land Matthews admitted in November to having sex with one of her students at Heath High School in Ohio in 2010 .

"Nine small earthquakes rattled North Texas just hours apart on Tuesday, though no damage has so far been reported from the temblors. The magnitudes of the earthquakes, which began around 7.30am, ranged from 1.6 to 3.6, according to the USGS. Earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest people can feel. The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four quakes to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb. At least two of those could be felt throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Seismologists also installed a new earthquake-monitoring device in Irving this week, after minor temblors rocked an area which is near the site of the former Dallas Cowboys football stadium. Scroll down for video . Map: The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four quakes to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb in North Texas . The first quake at 3:10 p.m. measured 3.5 in magnitude. Another at about 7 p.m. measured 3.6, while tremors at 8:11 p.m. and 8:12 p.m. measured less than 3.0. The first four happened within an area near the Trinity River that's seen a swarm of mild temblors in recent months. USGS geophysicist Jana Pursley says Tuesday's quakes were the 'largest since the earthquakes started happening there in the last year.' According to NBC DFW, a 1.7 earthquake took place close to a Dallas intersection at 9:54pm, and a 2.4 earthquake hit Irving's University of Dallas campus  at 10:05pm. A 1.6 earthquake struck at 11:02pm - and like many of the other quakes, was also in the vicinity of the Trinity River, the affiliate station reported. Carrieann Bedwell, a geophysicist with the USGS in Golden, Colorado, said senior scientists would be investigating the temblors. 'They will be looking at the parameters, magnitude, depth, location of each of the events,' Bedwell said Wednesday. 'Right now we're calling it a swarm, because we've had multitude events happen.' The seismic series has left residents on edge, wondering if the situation will get worse and what has been behind an uptick in quakes over the last several years. 'The safety and security of our residents is paramount for the city of Irving,' said Irving City Manager Chris Hillman. Some residents believe the implosion of Texas Stadium in 2010 may have exacerbated problems. There is also speculation the quakes might be related to hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking,' an energy extraction technique that has a long history in north Texas. Trouble: Some residents believe the implosion of Texas Stadium in 2010 may have exacerbated problems with earthquakes in the area . Irving, headquarters of Exxon Mobil's XTO unit that helped pioneer hydraulic fracturing in the region, has two gas wells that were fracked in 2010, according to city officials. The Irving area, with a population topping 250,000, has had more than 25 minor earthquakes since early September, according to Brian Stump, a seismologist with Southern Methodist University. 'SMU's seismology team is committed to helping North Texans understand more about the increasing number of earthquakes felt in our region over the last few years, most recently near the city of Irving,' Stump said in a statement Tuesday. SMU researchers installed a seismometer in Irving on Monday. Other devices were set up earlier near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and on the Dallas campus. The study is aimed at pinpointing the quakes' epicenters, Stump said. About 40 miles west of Irving, a series of small earthquakes rattled the town of Azle a year ago, causing sinkholes and cracks in house foundations. Residents blamed fracking and injection disposal wells for drilling waste as the cause but an official finding is still pending. Energy industry officials have said fracking is safe and causes no significant seismic damage.","Nine small earthquakes rattled North Texas hours apart on Tuesday .

But people who share lots of selfies are displaying psychopathic traits, according to a new study. It found that men who regularly post selfies on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, are more likely to be narcissistic, impulsive and display other characteristics, such as a lack of empathy. Obsessed with selfies? Men who regularly post them on social media sites are displaying psychopathic traits, according to a new study, which found that selfie addicts are also likely narcissistic. Male celebrities such as Justin Bieber (pictured) regularly keep their fans updated with self-portraits . Researchers also revealed that self-objectification may be a bigger problem for men than previously thought, with many taking the time and effort to edit and improve their selfies, before posting them online. Psychologists from Ohio State University found that men who posted selfies regularly, scored higher than average for levels of anti-social traits. For example, men who doctor their images to improve their appearance, show signs of narcissism and self-objectification, said assistant professor of communication Jesse Fox. Narcissism is most commonly associated with vanity but as a psychological flaw, relates to a feeling of being more intelligent, attractive and better than others, according to the study published in the journal, Personality and Individual Differences. Researchers also revealed that self-objectification (illustrated with a stock image) may be a bigger problem for men than previously thought . Men who put their pictures online as soon as they can are more likely to show signs of psychopathy, which is defined as having a lack of empathy or regard to others and impulsiveness. Professor Fox explained: ‘Psychopathy is characterised by impulsivity. They are going to snap the photos and put them online right away. ‘They want to see themselves. They don’t want to spend time editing.’ To come to their conclusions, the researchers surveyed 800 men aged between 18 and 40 about their social media output, as well as giving them psychological questionnaires to establish personality traits. The survey asked them how often they post pictures on sites like Instagram and Twitter and whether they Photoshop their selfies first. Professor Fox said: ‘It’s not surprising that men who post a lot of selfies and spend more time editing them are more narcissistic. ‘The more interesting finding is that they also score higher on this other anti-social personality trait, psychopathy, and are more prone to self-objectification. ‘Most people don’t think that men even do that sort of thing, but they definitely do.' She warned that such behaviour can lead to further problems. ‘We know that self-objectification leads to a lot of terrible things, like depression and eating disorders in women. ‘With the growing use of social networks, everyone is more concerned with their appearance. ‘That means self-objectification may become a bigger problem for men, as well as for women.’ Experts linked selfies with mental illness in April last year by suggesting suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle from which to portray themselves could in some cases be ill. One leading psychiatrist said the majority of patients he sees with Body Dysmorphic Disorder take a lot of selfies. Dr David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and The Priory Hospital, told The Sunday Mirror: ‘Two out of three of all the patients who come to see me with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) since the rise of camera phones have a compulsion to repeatedly take and post selfies on social media sites.’ Experts have linked selfies with mental illness and have suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle could in some cases be suffering from a confidence-related mental health condition . He told MailOnline: ‘Taking selfies is not an addiction - it’s a symptom of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) that involves checking one’s appearance.’ Cognitive behavioural therapy is often used to help patients moderate their obsessive behaviour relating to their appearance. Sufferers of BDD can spend hours trying to take pictures that do not show any defects or flaws in their appearance, which they are very aware of but which might be unnoticeable to others. In one extreme case of the disorder, a British teenager Danny Bowman tried to commit suicide because he was unsatisfied with his appearance in the selfies he took. He was so desperate to attract girls, he spent 10 hours a day taking more than 200 selfies trying to find the perfect image, but his habit, which began at the age of 15, caused him to drop out of school and lose almost two stone in weight. In an article for Psychology Today, Dr Pamela Rutledge, Director of the Media Psychology Research Centre in Boston Massachusetts, said: ‘Selfies frequently trigger perceptions of self-indulgence or attention seeking social dependence that raises the 'damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don’t' spectre of either narcissism or very low self-esteem.'","Researchers from Ohio State University said men who share lots of selfies are displaying psychopathic  traits, such as a lack of empathy .

"At first glance, it appears as it part of the sky is missing. This amazing image shows a starfield over 700 light years away. However, part of it is blocked by a massive dust cloud - completely obscuring the telescope's view. The dark cloud is called LDN 483 — for Lynds Dark Nebula 483, and such clouds are the birthplaces of future stars. LDN 483 is located about 700 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). The cloud contains enough dusty material to completely block the visible light from background stars. Particularly dense molecular clouds, like LDN 483, qualify as dark nebulae because of this obscuring property. The starless nature of LDN 483 and its ilk would suggest that they are sites where stars cannot take root and grow. But in fact the opposite is true: dark nebulae offer the most fertile environments for eventual star formation. 'Some of the stars appear to be missing in this intriguing new ESO image,' the European Space Observatory says. 'But the black gap in this glitteringly beautiful starfield is not really a gap, but rather a region of space clogged with gas and dust.' The dark cloud is called LDN 483 - for Lynds Dark Nebula 483. Such clouds are the birthplaces of future stars. the image was captured using The Wide Field Imager, an instrument mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. LDN 483 is located about 700 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). The cloud contains enough dusty material to completely block the visible light from background stars. Particularly dense molecular clouds, like LDN 483, qualify as dark nebulae because of this obscuring property. The starless nature of LDN 483 and its ilk would suggest that they are sites where stars cannot take root and grow. But in fact the opposite is true: dark nebulae offer the most fertile environments for eventual star formation. Astronomers studying star formation in LDN 483 have discovered some of the youngest observable kinds of baby stars buried in LDN 483’s shrouded interior. These gestating stars can be thought of as still being in the womb, having not yet been born as complete, albeit immature, stars. In this first stage of stellar development, the star-to-be is just a ball of gas and dust contracting under the force of gravity within the surrounding molecular cloud. The protostar is still quite cool — about –250 degrees Celsius — and shines only in long-wavelength submillimetre light. Yet temperature and pressure are beginning to increase in the fledgling star’s core. LDN 483 is located about 700 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). This earliest period of star growth lasts a mere thousands of years, an astonishingly short amount of time in astronomical terms, given that stars typically live for millions or billions of years. In the following stages, over the course of several million years, the protostar will grow warmer and denser. Its emission will increase in energy along the way, graduating from mainly cold, far-infrared light to near-infrared and finally to visible light. The once-dim protostar will have then become a fully luminous star. As more and more stars emerge from the inky depths of LDN 483, the dark nebula will disperse further and lose its opacity. The missing background stars that are currently hidden will then come into view — but only after the passage of millions of years, and they will be outshone by the bright young-born stars in the cloud.","Amazing image shows a starfield over 700 light years away .

"Three young children were stuck in a car in a Walmart parking lot for seven hours after their parents were arrested for shoplifting and failed to mention them to police. Tosheba Hope, 30, and Gerald Moultrie, 24, were busted at a Walmart in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, after trying to sneak out of the store with $600 in tools and car accessories about 7pm on Monday, according to police.

However, Hope didn't hesitate to mention her children in her bid to be release from jail. WTVJ reports that she told a judge she is the mother of three children and is pregnant with a fourth - in a bid for leniency. She was later released on her own recognizance. 'It's extremely dangerous that the kids were left in a car with no supervision. No one knew they were out there, no one knew where their parents were,' Broward Sheriff Office spokeswoman Gina Carter told the Miami Herald. Police said the children were upset, but otherwise not injured after spending seven hours stuck in a car. In addition to grand theft charges, authorities expect to file child neglect charges against the couple.

"Four people have been arrested in Oklahoma after police allegedly busted them operating a meth lab out of a squalid home with no running water where three young children had been living in despicable conditions. Police say they found a 5-gallon bucket filled with feces in the bathroom of the Tulsa house while the meth lab materials were in the kitchen alongside rotting food. According to Tulsa World, there were no beds for the children - aged 2, 4 and 6 - to sleep on, and many of the rooms had been closed off. The kids were taken in by child services after a search warrant was served at house on December 29.

"The designer behind the Tower of London poppy exhibition has revealed he was disturbed by the 'frenetic, obsessive surge of emotionalism' that the commemorative installation created. Tom Piper was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honour's List in recognition of his work on Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, the hugely popular display which attracted millions of visitors. But the theatre designer admitted he was 'not comfortable' with the outpouring of emotion it triggered, saying he was 'perturbed' by the reaction. Scroll down for video . Tom Piper, the designer behind Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, said he was 'perturbed' by the 'frenetic, obsessive surge of emotionalism' which the commemorative installation created . He told The Independent: 'When it got to a point where it started to become a sort of pilgrimage, it felt familiar in a way that I was not comfortable with. 'There have been other moments when the British public has focused on something like that. [I was] slightly perturbed by the frenetic, obsessive surge of emotionalism that the installation invoked.' An estimated five million visitors flocked to see the display, which was co-created with ceramicist Paul Cummins to mark the centenary of the star of the Great War. But, despite the praise heaped on the artwork, some criticised the duo for not being 'conventional artists', something which Mr Piper said made him 'livid'. A row also broke out after The Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones claimed it was 'toothless' and 'fake' and that the Tower's moat should instead be filled with 'barbed wire and bones'. Reacting to the review, Mr Piper said: 'The theatre designer in me would say: ""Just because a play is about World War I you don't fill the stage with bones – that would be such a crass, clichéd thing to do"". You find the metaphor and you allow people in.' Mr Piper said he was 'livid' that he and fellow creator Paul Cummins (left) were viewed as not being 'conventional artists' The hugely popular display, created to remember every British and Colonial death during the First World War, attracted millions of visitors . The exhibit saw 888,246 ceramic poppies gradually planted in the moat at the Tower, marking 100 years since the start of the Great War. The Prime Minister and royal family were among those who planted ceramic poppies as part of the exhibit. In her Christmas message the Queen spoke of her own visit to see the poppies, saying: 'The only possible reaction to walking among them was silence.' The artist also hit back at comments made by The Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones who suggested the moat should be filled with bones, by saying: 'That would be such a crass, clichéd thing to do' The exhibit became so popular that national campaign was launched to extend it. The leaders of all four main political parties demanded the display should be extended for an extra week - something which also made Mr Piper feel uncomfortable. He said he 'didn't really like the fact' that various politicians started trying to take ownership of it.","Tom Piper was awarded MBE in recognition of commemorative installation .

"The socialite ex-girlfriend of Tommy Gilbert, the trust-fund Princeton graduate believed to have shot dead his father, says she was repeatedly warned that he 'would chop her into tiny pieces'. Anna Rothschild, 49, dated the 30-year-old aspiring model and actor for four months early last year but broke off the relationship because there was no long-term future. The socialite, who is not related to the powerful Rothschild banking dynasty, exclusively told the Daily Mail Online that when she first began seeing Tommy, after meeting him at a friend's dinner party, a close friend had called her out of deep concern. Ms Rothschild said: 'Very soon after going out with him, a mutual friend of ours told me: ''Anna you have to be really careful - Tommy is going to chop you up into little pieces.'' Scroll down for video . Anna Rothschild, pictured with Thomas Gilbert Jr, at a New Year's Eve party in 2013.

Anna Rothschild (pictured left this week), the ex-girlfriend of accused murderer Thomas Gilbert Jr (pictured right with the socialite). The couple dated for four months in 2014 . Ms Rothschild dismissed the remarks, thinking her friend was joking and perhaps jealous because Gilbert, a tall, muscled blonde surfing instructor, was so handsome. 'My friend just said he got a really bad vibe off Tommy and thought he was psycho because he never spoke - I just thought it was because he was shy,' she said. 'He called me up the day after the shooting and said, ''I told you so.''' Gilbert Jr, was charged with murder on Monday - a day after he allegedly shot dead his 70-year-old father, $200million Wainscott Capital hedge-fund boss Thomas Gilbert Sr, at his Manhattan home. The father and son, whose $2,400 Chelsea apartment rent was paid for by his parents, had reportedly argued about Tommy's weekly allowance being cut from $400 to $300. Ms Rothschild, who runs A. Rothschild & Co PR firm, revealed that she began dating Tommy after sitting next to him at a Christmas dinner party at a mutual friend's home in 2013. She said: 'We were sat next to each other. I had no idea who he was or who his family were. It was hard not to be attracted to someone who is so attractive.' ‘We talked and a day later he called and he asked me out. He was very down-to-earth. He wasn’t a spoiled brat - he was low-key.’ Society queen: Ms Rothschild, 49, broke off her relationship with Gilbert because he was too young for her to have a serious relationship with. She said that he was 'absolutely devastated' when it was over . Gilbert Jr, appeared in court on Monday night, accused of shooting dead his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr at his Manhattan home on Sunday . Ms Rothschild and Gilbert Jr dated for four months after attending a NYE party in Manhattan. She said 'he wasn't a spoiled brat - he was low-key' Ms Rothschild revealed that the pair met again at a friend’s apartment for a New Year’s Eve party. She said: 'He was painfully shy, extremely quiet and introverted but opened up when he knew you. 'He would come over to mine and we would cook or order in. We both loved sushi.' She revealed that Gilbert had been working for his father but that the job didn't work out. He then dreamed of being a model and actor but his plans disintegrated because of his lack of confidence. 'He did a photo-shoot once with a photographer but nothing came of it,' Ms Rothschild said. 'I told him acting was not a great idea because he didn’t talk.' Despite rumors circulating that he was a closet homosexual, his former girlfriend was quick to rubbish them. Ms Rothschild, who lives in an apartment on the Upper West Side, said: 'I don’t believe rumors that he was a closet homosexual.' She also laughed off the image of him as a 'party boy', caught up in the whirlwind of New York's social circuit. 'It’s absurd to say he was on the social scene. He didn’t drink. He had about four drinks in the four months we dated.' She explained that Tommy was devoted to fitness and taught surfing in the Hamptons last summer. 'He didn’t do drugs. He was against all that,' she said. 'He used to get up every day, really early and go the gym and play tennis. I suspected his drugs arrest in 2007 was probably pot-related but he was past that when I knew him. 'He was very healthy. He said once a psychiatrist prescribed him meds but he saw a therapist instead of taking them. I never saw any signs of drug taking.'

Gilbert's ex-girlfriend said that the 30-year-old Princeton grad (left) was extremely good-looking and had dreams of becoming a model. She also revealed that he had a troubled relationship with his father (right) who he stands accused of murdering . Mr Gilbert Sr's body was removed from his Manhattan apartment on Sunday night after he suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head . However she became aware that the 30-year-old, who attended one of Manhattan's most prestigious private schools before going on to Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and then Princeton, had a dark side. 'I thought he was damaged and that something happened to him in childhood so I started digging. He never talked about his Mom, always about his Dad,' she said. Ms Rothschild also said that although his 24-year-old sister Clare lived in Manhattan, he rarely spoke about her. Twice-divorced Ms Rothschild said she 'delicately' tried to break things off with Tommy in spring 2014 by seeing him less and less frequently. 'I broke it off because I was never going to marry a 29-year-old,' she confessed to Daily Mail Online. 'It wasn’t right for me. It was absurd that it went on for as long as it did. I started to phase him out. It went from seeing him every other day, to once a week, to me ignoring his texts. She added: 'I finally met him for dinner and told him. He looked absolutely devastated, like a kid who had his toy taken away from him.' But when she officially tried to end the relationship face-to-face, Ms Rothschild revealed that her younger lover began bombarding her with text messages which she ignored. In retrospect, Ms Rothschild said today that she felt nothing but relief, adding she may well have been a victim. 'I feel extremely lucky. He kept texting me. I feel so lucky. I feel I could have been one of his victims,' she added. Soon after the relationship ended, the former PR firm owner left the U.S. for Europe and Turkey where she spent six months  travelling. She last saw Tommy in late December when they met as friends for their favorite meal sushi at Upper West Side restaurant Sushi Yasaka. 'I saw him two weeks before the shooting, as friends. We stayed friends,' she said. 'As usual he paid. $150.... He was actually upbeat. He always paid and never mentioned any money problems or his allowance.' Ms Rothschild also speculated that Gilbert may 'have been on meds and came off them' when he fatally shot his father. Gilbert was also charged with 21 counts of criminal possession of forgery devices after skimming device and 21 blank credit cards found at his home on Sunday. 'I've cut ties now,' she added: 'I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried to contact me but I won’t have anything to do with him now.' The accused killer's former girlfriend said that he didn't talk much about his mom Shelley (left) or sister Clare (right) but mostly about his father .

"Loic Remy's £8.5 million move to Liverpool dramatically collapsed on Sunday after he failed a medical. The France forward had flown out to Boston earlier this week after Liverpool had met the release clause in his contract and he had agreed personal terms and a long-term contract before beginning his fitness assessment. Given Liverpool, who also completed a £20million deal for Dejan Lovren on Sunday, have been based in unfamiliar surrounds, the medical had taken longer than normal to conduct but when the results came back, Liverpool decided they had no other option but to pull the plug on the move. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Loic Remy in shooting practice during France training . No deal: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, seen here at the end of his team's 1-0 win over Olympiacos in Chicago on Sunday night, described the collapse of an £8.5m move for Remy as 'unfortunate' It's off: Loic Remy was unable to complete his move to Liverpool but the club have not yet explained why . Match winner: Raheem Sterling settled Liverpool's International Champions Cup match with Olympiacos after five minutes . VIDEO Remy deal collapses . Liverpool have declined to comment on the specific reason they have withdrawn from the move but it is understood that the 27-year-old, who has a historical heart condition, is devastated his dream move to Anfield has fallen through. Manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed the deal was off after Liverpool beat Greek champions Olympiacos 1-0 in the International Champions Cup in Chicago. He said: ‘It's very simple we have made a decision as a club not to go ahead with the deal. It's unfortunate for the player. We are disappointed for the player but there’s nothing more to be said and we will move on and look at other targets.’ Having sold Luis Suarez to Barcelona, they must now decide whether they look for another forward as Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert are the only senior strikers. They are in the process of sealing a £10million deal for Divock Origi but the Belgium forward will be loaned back to Lille next year. Liverpool have spent close to £100million this summer yet they have funds available. Manager Brendan Rodgers, however, will not make a decision in haste, preferring instead to consider his options. He may even wait until the winter transfer window to sign a striker. Confirmed: Rodgers was boosted by the completion of Dejan Lovren's £20m move from Southampton . Incoming: Liverpool are also close to wrapping up the signing of Lille and Belgium forward Divock Origi . Rodgers said: ‘There is money to spend, no question, but I won’t spend it for the sake of it. It has to be the right type. If that means I have to wait until January then that’s what I will do. The players at the moment are in great condition, they are working very well and very hard. ‘I have seen the development in some of the young players but if the right ones become available we would like to do something because i still have a lot to do on that front – but if they’re not available, I will wait.’ It is the second blow for Rodgers in the space of 48 hours after he lost Adam Lallana, his £23.6million signing from Southampton, for six week after he damaged his lateral collateral knee ligaments in training. Rather than flying back to England, Lallana – who does not need surgery – will stay with Liverpool’s squad for the remainder of their US tour in order to get to know his new team-mates but there is no disputing his frustration. Still, Rodgers feels it will not impact on Liverpool too severely. Disappointment: Remy has been left devastated after his proposed £8.5m move to Anfield fell through . ‘Last year if someone like Adam had gone down it would have really hurt us,’ Rodgers said. ‘It’s unfortunate for him but thankfully at this stage of the season, where he has got a good level of fitness, which means he can recover quicker. ‘He won’t be too far away after the start of the season, which is great news. This year is vital for us. You’re going to pick up injuries and we need to have the players who can step in and that’s what we are trying to build.’ There was, at least, something positive for Rodgers with the news that his pursuit of Lovren has reached a successful conclusion. The Croatia international has signed a long-term deal and will link up with Liverpool in either New York or Charlotte, their next stops on this American tour. Lovren, who has become the most expensive defender in Liverpool’s history, described the move as a “dream come true” and Rodgers believes he has the type of characteristics that will enable his side to vastly improve on the 51 goals they conceded last season in the Barclays Premier League. The manager believes Lovren can fill the void left in the back four that has been there since Jamie Carragher retired in 2013. Rodgers said: ‘He's right footed so he can play on the right but he prefers to play on the left. It will depend what needs must. The Important thing is that we have got the player and we will use him where we feel he needs to be. He’s a player who can still improve. Meet and greet: Rodgers signs autographs for some of Liverpool's American-based fans as they played Olympiacos in Chicago . Pride and passion: Liverpool fans show their colours during the friendly at Soldier Field in Chicago . ‘I think Dejan is a really commanding central defender. I said since we lost Jamie Carragher we needed that leadership and he's a player who will gives us that. He's strong and can play. I was impressed by him when he was at Lyon and he was a big driving force for Southampton.’ Lovren will join up on Liverpool’s United States tour either in New York or Charlotte after agreeing a five-year contract and Rodgers believes his squad is now taking shape – and he is no longer mourning the sale of Luis Suarez. ‘I’m really pleased with how it's all coming along,’ said Rodgers, who should see Divock Origi become a Liverpool player in the next 24 hours, having agreed a £10million deal with Lille. ‘Our World Cup players have just come back. ‘We have only just been together as a squad over the last week or so. I know the group well and I know those coming in will fit what we're trying to do. When the Southampton game (at Anfield on August 17) comes up, we will be ready for that.' Of the performance against Olympiakos, Rodgers added: ‘I was delighted with the team. As pre-season goes well, we will be getting sharper in our movements and passing but, at this time, we are building up the resistance of players and getting minutes under the belt. ‘In the first half, our passing was crisp and precise. We looked real threat at top end of the field. I was also very pleased with how we defended. We are in good shape and I am delighted.’","Liverpool have pulled out of proposed £8.5m move for Loic Remy .

"Jumping on the healthy eating bandwagon this January? Sam Faiers is offering her fans virtuous eating plans to help them trim down this month. Sam, 23, has launched an exclusive website, Celebrity Training With Sam Faiers, packed full of tutorials, advice and tips she says will help you maximise your workout and achieve a healthy, strong and feminine dream body. The former The Only Way Is Essex star has devised healthy alternatives to her favourite foods with the help of healthy eating specialist Sophie Bradshaw. Sam Faiers, who has just launched a new fitness site, has added a healthy eating section to it and created  virtuous menu plans she says are 'life changing and so easy to make' Diet-wise, Sam starts the day with an acai berry smoothie, has a sweet potato and carrot soup for lunch and a superfood kale and mushroom frittata for dinner. Speaking to FEMAIL about her healthy new eating regime, she said: 'I also eat a lot of chicken for lunch and dinner and porridge for breakfast. 'With my Crohn’s I have to be careful with what I eat and Celebrity Training has a great healthy eating expert, Sophie Bradshaw, who recommends the best in healthy home cooking.' One of her favourite meals is the almond and turmeric crusted chicken with parsnip fries - a paleo recipe . Sam has sweet potato and carrot soup for lunch, right, and a superfood peanut butter hot chocolate, left . One of her favourite meals is the almond and turmeric crusted chicken with parsnip fries. Speaking about the dish, she said: 'This paleo recipe gives KFC a serious run for their money. 'No joke - the chicken strips taste so good when coated with the almonds which act as breadcrumbs when baked in the oven. 'The parsnips are just as delicious, and are packed with fibre to keep your digestive system happy and healthy. 'This is a fabulous pre or post work out meal to fuel your body with packs of protein. 'Trust me, you won’t ever want to stop off for a saturated fat laden chicken and chips ever again. This is life-changing and so easy.' The former The Only Way Is Essex star has devised healthy alternatives to her favourite foods with the help of Sophie Bradshaw such as this vegetable stir fry . She has also created healthy versions of hot chocolate using peanut butter and superfoods, which she says is a great source of protein to help your body recover after working out. 'This is a perfect treat that's delicious and healthy,' she adds. Other main meal options in her healthy-eating programme include kale and pesto baked seabass, quinoa, kale and pecan salad and celeriac, kale and mushroom frittata. Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest venture, the businesswoman said: 'I have wanted to step into the world of health and fitness for a while now, as it’s a big passion of mine. 'When I lost a lot of weight from my Crohn’s disease, I wanted to make a change and make sure that I was healthy, fit and feminine. 'My motivation is to show that you can keep your body in a healthy and strong place. This is far more important than what size you are. It’s about how you feel.' Sam, 23, has launched health and fitness website Celebrity Training With Sam Faiers . Sam isn't the first star of The Only Way Is Essex to launch a fitness project - her friend Lucy Mecklenburgh also has her own online fitness channel. 'Celebrity Training is innovative and different because you can do it at home, work or travelling so can you use it on your smartphone or tablet,'  Sam said. 'It's also completely bespoke to you; it has target graphs and you can upload pictures of your improvement. 'I’ve been working with personal trainer Nicole Attrill to make regular workouts for the website so the content is always fresh.' TOWIE star Sam said that she always wanted to step into the world of fitness and when she lost  weight from the Crohn's disease diagnosed earlier this year, her priority was remaining healthy, fit and feminine . Sam and personal trainer Nicole Attrill demonstrate the exercise tutorials which are then posted online . Sam is so convinced by the power of her programme that she uses it three times a week on her phone or iPad when she's travelling for work. She starts  with the warm up, Get Started,  and finishes with Cool Down. Then she alternates between the weights-based Get Strong routine and Get Focused, which includes targeted body exercises. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel condition which affects 115,000 Britons. Its symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue. Although she is following a healthy and sensible diet and exercise regime, Sam admits she has felt pressure to lose weight in the past, particularly prior to her stint on Celebrity Big Brother. 'I think it’s because there were cameras everywhere  so there was nowhere to hide when it comes to your body,' she said candidly. She continued: 'I would say my Crohn’s was a wake-up call, I want to look healthy and not a bag of bones. I couldn’t help it as I was unwell but I wanted to look healthy, fit and feminine and thanks to Celebrity Training I’m so confident with my body now. 'I would say that you should feel confident at any weight or size as beauty is skin deep. I’ve struggled in the past to feel confident - I’ve either been bigger than I wanted to be or too thin. 'Nowadays I don’t stress about being skinny, I just want to be in a healthy and happy place.' Sam, pictured, left, earlier this year and, right, in 2011, admits she has felt pressure to lose weight in the past, particularly prior to her stint on Celebrity Big Brother because of all of the cameras in the house . Sam's plight didn't come without criticism and she came under attack on social media from people who said she was only skinny because she has Crohn's. In response to those messages, Sam said: 'It's well-known that I found out I have Crohn's earlier this year. Before I got into exercising it was important for me to healthily put some of the weight back on that I'd lost. 'When I felt ready and was at that point I began moderately training to build and tone my body. It's unfair for people to say I'm skinny because of Crohn's, you don't get abs and definition through Crohn's, it's through working out, healthy eating and my programme I have devised.' The fitness fan admires Beyoncé, who she says 'works so hard for her body and looks healthy at the same time', as well as  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who she thinks looks 'fit and feminine'. And it seems Sam is aiming for the same level of success as the stars. 'I have a new collection coming out from my range with Very and I will be doing a launch for my lash range, Lashes by Samantha.' Sam, who unveiled her first clothing range for Very this year, has a new collection coming out in 2015 .

"After one too many bad cups of tea, a clever inventor has designed a nifty little gadget that promises to deliver the perfect cuppa every time. At seven inches long and two inches wide, the 15-ounce gizmo, which costs $29 (£19), has a built-in mechanism - modelled on an egg timer - which beeps to let you know when your tea is brewed. The device is the brainchild of Lennart Rieper, who is currently raising funds on crowdfunding website Kickstarter to bring his smart infusion device to fruition. Tealightful Timer: The clever gizmo is the invention of German designer Lennert Rieper. It has a built-in mechanism - modelled on an egg timer -  which beeps to let you know when your tea is brewed . The Tealightful Timer, which can be loaded up with tea leaves, will automatically stop the steeping process at the right time, so your cuppa isn’t brewed too bitter or strong. The German native, who studied industrial design in his homeland as well as in the US, has worked with international designers on various products but this is his first sole creation. His device works on the same mechanics as an egg timer. Consisting of four parts – two sections at the top and two at the bottom –the inner top part of the infuser holds the timer mechanism and is held securely by the outer top section. The inner bottom section holds the tea bag or leaves - which will be infused in the water - while the outer bottom section acts as a sealant, preventing the leaves from leaking out. The timers come in a variety of shades. They all measure seven inches long and two inches wide . Consisting of four parts – two sections at the top and two at the bottom –the inner top part of the infuser holds the timer mechanism and is held securely by the outer top section . The bottom section comes in two parts (left). Tea leaves are placed in the inner bowl of the bottom section . All you have to do to make a perfect cup of tea is fill the timer with leaves or a tea bag. Then close the infuser and wind up the mechanism, first setting the preferred time, before dropping it into the water. Your tea will now steep for as many minutes as you want it to before the brewing process stops automatically and the timer beeps to alert you that its job is done. The timer is designed to fit in a variety of cups and glasses and will hold loose leaves, herbal infusions and tea bags. Mr Rieper needs to raise $40,000 (£26,000) by 1 February to start production. His crowdfunding page has currently raised $9,157 (£6,000). The infuser can hold tea bags or tea leaves. The device is estimated to go into production in February . The end to over-brewed tea? Simply screw in the bottom bowl firmly and set your timer (left) before placing it in a mug of hot water for the steeping process to begin (right) Lennert Rieper, the creator of Tealightful Timer . The device also comes on its own, without a timer for those who are already able to brew the perfect cuppa. 'The biggest challenge in the past was the mechanic inside the timer that had to be 100 per cent waterproof,' Mr Rieper writes on his Kickstarter page. 'Within a team of experienced mechanical engineers we found several solutions, and I am proud that we don't have to use any electronics to set the timer. 'As of now we have decided on a mechanic that is very similar to the one used by egg timers - inexpensive and simple to manufacture. '[The] second biggest challenge is to find out how many times this campaign is being backed and therefore how many Tealightful Timers have to be made. 'Depending on the quantity we then have to choose which manufacturer will be the right one to produce the parts.'","Nifty gizmo is the brainchild of German product designer Lennart Rieper .

"Sedimentary structures have been found on Mars that mimic those formed by microbes on Earth. It is the latest piece of evidence that suggests life was once on Mars, although it is not direct proof of its existence. The structures were revealed in images of a lakebed that is thought to have undergone seasonal flooding billions of years ago. Scroll down for video . A geobiologist from Old Dominion University in Virginia has revealed pictures that show structures on Mars similar to ones on Earth formed by microbes in images from Curiosity in Gale Crater. Shown is an overlay of a sketch on a photograph from above to assist in the identification of the structures on the rock bed surface . Dr Nora Noffke, a geobiologist at Old Dominion University in Virginia, has spent the past 20 years studying these microbial structures. On Earth, carpet-like colonies of microbes trap and rearrange sediments in shallow bodies of water such as lakes and coastal areas, forming distinctive features that fossilise over time. In December 2014 it was announced an instrument on the Curiosity rover had identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface. The new discovery, reported in the journal Science, followed studies of gas samples by Curiosity's Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis. It revealed a low background level of methane, which spiked 10-fold over a period of just 60 Martian days. While there are non-biological explanations, experts suggested that its finding may be a sign of life on Mars. These structures, known as microbially-induced sedimentary structures, are found in shallow water settings all over the world and in ancient rocks spanning Earth's history. In a paper published in the journal Astrobiology, she detailed the striking similarities between Martian sedimentary structures in the 3.7 billion-year-old Gillespie Lake outcrop and microbial structures on Earth. The distinctive shapes include erosional remnants, pockets, domes, roll-ups, pits, chips and cracks, which on Earth can extend from a few centimeters to many kilometers. She adds that it is not definitive proof that these structures on Mars were shaped by biology. Such confirmation would require a rock sample to be returned to earth for microscopic analysis. 'All I can say is, here's my hypothesis and here's all the evidence that I have,' Dr Noffke said, 'although I do think that this evidence is a lot.' The findings follow the recent detection of methane on Mars that could have originated from organics on the planet. 'Along with the recent reports of methane and organics on Mars, her findings add an intriguing piece to the puzzle of a possible history for life on our neighboring planet,' said Dr Penelope Boston, a geomicrobiologist at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. On the left is a comparison of cracks in Gillespie Lake outcrop on Mars and in a modern microbial mat in Bahar Alouane, Tunisia. On the right, knob-shaped structures on Mars are compared to similar structures caused by erosion of microbial mats at Carbla Point, Western Australia. On Earth, both are formed by microbes . Gillespie Lake is an ancient body of water that was once believed to once be at the bottom of Gale Crater on Mars, shown here in this illustration. The patterns found in the Gillespie Lake outcrop are consistent with the microbial structures found in similar environments on Earth . Dr Noffke spent several weeks investigating images centimetre by centimetre, drawing sketches and comparing them to structures on Earth. The photos showed striking morphological similarities between the terrestrial and Martian sedimentary structures. The distribution patterns of the microbial structures on Earth vary depending on where they are found. Different types of structures are found together in different types of environments. For instance, microbial mats that grow in rivers will create a different set of associations than those that grow in seasonally flooded environments. The patterns found in the Gillespie Lake outcrop are consistent with the microbial structures found in similar environments on Earth. In her paper, she also describes alternative processes through which these could have formed. For instance, the chips, pits and cracks could be the product of erosion by salt, water, or wind. 'But if the Martian structures aren't of biological origin, then the similarities in morphology, but also in distribution patterns with regards to microbially-induced sedimentary structures on Earth would be an extraordinary coincidence,' she said. Last month, scientists in California revealed evidence that suggests there is life on Mars based on readings taken by the Curiosity rover (shown). They say methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria. This sedimentary finding is the latest feather in the cap for the possibility of life once existing on Mars .","Geobiologist from Old Dominion University in Virginia has revealed pictures that show structures on Mars similar to ones on Earth .

"It is definitely smarter that the average computer - and it set to bring a new level of intelligence to everything from dresses to drones. Intel has unveiled a new smart camera system that can sense depth - and it could revolutionise the way we interact with machines. The chip giant showed off a tablet that can use hand gestures to scroll a recipe, drones  that can manoeuvre an obstacle course without human intervention and even smart clothing that can help the visually impaired navigate safely - and a smart cocktail dress that can repel people who invade the wearer's space. Scroll down for video . Intel's 3D-printed experimental dress crowned at the collar with robotic spider legs. The legs move when somebody invades the wearer's personal space, or they become stressed. The dress rises when the wearer is stressed out (right) but returns to normal (left) when they calm down . Intel's 3D printed dress in action - the dress can sense the wearer's mood . During its keynote, Intel also unveiled a tiny wearable computer, called Curie, that is the size of a small button. Intel's button sized PC for wearable computers . While the Curie hardware is based on Intel's first purpose-built system-on-chip (SoC) for wearable devices and is expected to ship to manufacturing partners in the second half of this year. Packed into the tiny computer is Bluetooth, sensors and battery charging capabilities. It will help firms make smaller smartwatches and other wearables. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich also used the keynote to show off the company's RealSense technology for seeing and understanding depth. 'The rise of new personal computing experiences, intelligent and connected devices, and the wearable revolution are redefining the relationship between consumers and technology,' he said. During his keynote at the annual CES show in Las Vegas, he also called for tech firms to hire a more diverse workforce. 'Our goal with Intel technology is to help solve real problems and enable experiences that are truly desired by people and businesses. 'In order to do this, we must also do more to lead the growth of diversity and inclusion within the technology industry. 'Women and under-represented minorities will continue to play a greater role as consumers, influencers, creators and leaders.' Intel also showedoff experimental designer Anouk Wipprecht's latest Spider Dress. 'Fashion and tech are merging at the moment, beyond blinking dresses or cute skirts, she said. 'I'm showing how fashion can be thought provoking, something that pushes people to think and share their feelings. Ther 3D-printed experimental dress crowned at the collar with robotic spider legs which move. 'Spider Dress acts as the interface between the body and the external world,' said Wipprecht. 'It uses technology and the garment as a medium of interaction.' The so-called animatronic arachnid limbs on the Spider Dress know exactly when someone is invading the wearer's personal space. The legs are driven by computer and sensor technologies that allow it to be autonomous, but assistive and adaptive to the owner's emotions and desires. 'Since the system based with mechanic spider legs is literally hosted on the shoulders of the wearer and attacks using the same viewing angle as the wearer, the system knows how you feel and adapts to those feelings,' she said. Giant screens driven by Intel's Realsense technology at the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas . Eliana Pereira Mecham gestures while interacting with RealSense Technology at the Intel booth during the International CES The technology uses 3D and infrared cameras to allow the user to interact with images on a monitor. Using wireless biometric signals, the system makes inferences based on the stress levels in your body. It can differentiate between 12 states of behavior. Wipprecht calls it an interesting interplay between co-control and education of your own body and mind. 'When approached at an aggressive pace, the system answers in a territorial attack mode,' she said. 'But when you walk up to the dress in a more cautious, friendly symbiotic way, you can almost get the dress to invite you closer, as if to 'dance' with you.' CEO Brian Krzanich also used a keynote Tuesday to show off the company's RealSense technology for seeing and understanding depth, showing off: . •Food Network with Intel RealSense 3D Camera: Intel and Food Network have collaborated to create a cooking application that uses Intel RealSense technology to eliminate the need to touch the device and instead use gesture control and voice commands on an Intel RealSense 3D camera enabled device for easy scrolling through the application and navigation of recipes in real time. This will be available in the Spring of 2015. •All-in-one PC with 3D Display Concept: Intel showcased a futuristic '3D I/O' technology that integrates Intel RealSense technology with a specialized glass screen to enable an immersive, hologram-like experience without the need for additional eyewear. •Intel RealSense technology and wearables: Looking into the future, Krzanich also demonstrated a wearable technology research project that can help vision-impaired people navigate their environments more easily and safely. The wearable solution places sensors on clothing, equipped with Intel RealSense 3D cameras that sense the vicinity and trigger vibrations as a feedback mechanism, helping people to navigate their environment. •Intel RealSense technology inside Robotics and Multi-copter drone: Intel demonstrated an iRobot® AVA® 500 video collaboration robot equipped with Intel RealSense cameras to support the platform's autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance technologies. In addition, Intel highlighted the growing possibilities for multi-copter drones, including the inspection of fields and power lines, delivering goods, and even monitoring endangered species. As these drones become smarter, they can see, react, and even move safely through the environment. During the CES keynote, Intel created a make-shift obstacle course inside the CES keynote ballroom and demonstrated a number of AscTec* Firefly multi-copter drones equipped with Intel RealSense cameras that provide 360-degree sensing and enabled with unique collision avoidance capabilities. Intel's RealSense camera module, which weighs as little as 8 grams and is less than 4mm thick, brings depth perception to drones both indoors and outdoors with minimal impact to payload and flight times. Intel hopes to put the realsense system into laptops and tablets. The Intel RealSense technology of software and depth cameras enables more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices, the firm says. Cutting-edge facial detection and tracking, emotion detection, 3D scanning, depth-sensing photography, background removal, and the tracking of 22 joints in each hand for accurate touch-free gesture recognition are some of the new capabilities made possible with Intel RealSense technology.

"They were the glamorous Jeffrey Epstein aides who refused to testify about Prince Andrew’s visits to the ‘House of Sin’. Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marchinova both pleaded their right to silence under the US Fifth Amendment when asked if the royal had sex with teenage girls – earning themselves the nickname the ‘blondes who took the Fifth’. Today, Epstein’s former PA Miss Kellen and Miss Marchinova – his on-off girlfriend – have reinvented themselves as Sarah Kensington and Nadia Marcinko. Scroll down for video . Sarah Kensington - formerly Sarah Kellen - and her racing driver boyfriend Brian Vickers (left) and Nadia Marchinova, who is now Nadia Marcinko (right) Miss Kensington, 34, is an interior designer who boasts of renovating corporate apartments in New York, the Caribbean and Paris – and dating a handsome racing car driver. Miss Marcinko, 29, is a pilot and the chief executive of Aviloop, a company selling discounted flying lessons. Intriguingly, they both operate from £1.5million addresses in a Manhattan building majority-owned by Mr Epstein’s brother Mark. Neither woman seems keen to draw attention to their past work for the billionaire paedophile. Both women were given immunity from prosecution in a controversial deal fixed by Epstein when he was jailed for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. Miss Kellen was named as the chief fixer who travelled the world with Epstein and was accused by lawyers in legal filings of ‘bringing girls to Epstein’s mansion to be abused’. Quizzed under oath, she had an opportunity to deny Andrew had sex at the £6million Florida mansion, dubbed the ‘House of Sin’, but chose to remain silent. Citing the Fifth Amendment, Miss Marchinova also declined to say if she had sex with Andrew. Since those scandal-engulfed days, both women have led dramatically different lives, a Mail investigation has discovered. Both women were given immunity from prosecution in a controversial deal fixed by Epstein (left and right). He is said to have gone to huge efforts to cover-up his crimes, promising to ‘look after’ those who kept quiet . When quizzed under oath, Ms Kellen had an opportunity to deny Andrew (pictured left with Epstein) had sex at Epstein's £6million Florida mansion, dubbed the ‘House of Sin’, but chose to remain silent . Miss Kellen moved to Hawaii for a number of years where she married and took her husband’s surname Bonk, before taking on her current identity. On her interior design website, sarahkensington.net, she describes being ‘fortunate to say that I’ve been able to travel to many locations around the world, which in turn has broadened my designing skills’. She is in a relationship with a successful Nascar driver, stating on her website that ‘most of my fans know that I am Brian Vickers’ girlfriend’. Slovakia-born Miss Marcinko’s biography on the Aviloop website now states: ‘Over the years, she has proven herself to be a distinguished entrepreneur’. Virginia Roberts (pictured) claims in court she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times while underage . Prince Andrew pictured in 2001 with Virginia Roberts. She is said to be planning a book about her life . She also penned an online blog under the name ‘Gulfstream Girl’ which more than 77,000 people ‘liked’, until the company Gulfstream objected and she changed it to ‘Global Girl’. She described how she started her flight training at Palm Beach Airport before accepting ‘an offer from a friend’ to obtain her Gulfstream II pilot rating. Epstein, 61, is said to have gone to extraordinary efforts to cover-up his vile crimes, promising to ‘look after’ people who kept quiet. His brother Mark told The Guardian newspaper he owned ‘the majority of the units in the Manhattan building’ and had never heard of the two women’s companies. The Duke (pictured) fiercely denies any sexual contact with underage girls, while Epstein's lawyer has described the claims as lies . He said Jeffrey did not own any of the units in the building, adding: ‘They’re rentals. The ones I own, I rent all of them out.’ It was also claimed yesterday that Epstein intimidated a pregnant journalist by asking where she was due to give birth. British-born writer Vicky Ward was so afraid of the US financier that she had security put on the intensive care ward where her premature twins were being treated. The Cambridge-educated journalist, 45, said he tried to ‘control’ her when he learned she was writing an in-depth article about him for Vanity Fair magazine in 2002. Describing how Epstein ‘spooked’ her, she said he feared he was ‘coming for my little ones’ when he asked at which hospital she was giving birth.

"Very little has gone wrong for Steve Smith this summer, until, that is, the Australian captain's close encounter with the controversial 'Spidercam' which appears to have hindered his attempt to take a vital catch on day three of the fourth Test on Thursday. In what was a frustrating morning session for the home side and the skipper in particular, a miscue from Indian batter Lokesh Rahul sent the ball skyward and Smith made ground to position himself underneath it for the catch. But just as he appeared in control of the catch, out it spilled and Smith immediately pointed skyward, suggesting the camera, perched on wires above the ground, may have interfered. Scroll down for video . The eyes have it. Australian captain Steve Smith gets underneath the ball after a top-edge by India's Lokesh Rahul and looks set to take the catch . Dropped. Steve Smith points to the sky after spilling the chance, appearing to claim he was unsighted by the 'Spidercam' which is strung on wires above the field of play to give an aerial view of the game . This is Spidercam. The unit strung above grounds for major sporting events by broadcasters like the Nine Network to give an aerial view of the field of play . It continued a session of near-misses for the home side, Smith clearly upset with team-mates when a gilt-edged opportunity to effect a run-out was also spurned, soon after his Indian counterpart Virat Kohli came to the crease. But the drama with the camera and the catch was his alone. The Nine Network sports team has responded, suggesting there was no impact between ball and camera ahead of Steve Smith dropping the chance . That wasn't supposed to happen. Everything Steve Smith has touched this summer has turned to gold, except this catch off India's Lokesh Rahul . The dropped catch is one of the few things to have gone amiss during the cricket season for Australia's new Test captain, who has led his side to a series win and leads the run-scoring too . The Nine  Network has responded with a tweet which said: 'Word from Spidercam is that the ball did not hit the camera or wires'. It appears most likely Smith was either unsighted at some point or put off by the equipment as he positioned himself. And this has been confirmed by a joint statement on Thursday afternoon, by Cricket Australia and the Nine Network. 'We (CA & Nine) have spoken about the matter involving Spidercam and the dropped catch before lunch and it’s clear the ball did not hit the camera or its supporting wires,' the joint statement read. 'Captain Steve Smith was distracted by one of the wires in his eye line. Both CA and Nine will continue to work together on the use of Spidercam in the broadcast coverage and will take on board any player feedback as necessary. 'As it stands, if any player has a concern about the placement of Spidercam they can ask the umpires for it to be moved.' Day three of the Sydney Test is Jane McGrath Day in aid of breast cancer nurses fundraising. Here Steve Smith presents a pink cap to Australian fast-bowling great Glenn McGrath . Steve Smith is the leading run-getter this summer, boasting an average of well over 100 during the four Test series versus India .

"The selfie stick was so 2014; this year will be all about the much more bizarre Belfie Stick. That's what one company will be hoping anyway, with their new device for smartphones. If you're confused by the name, don't be; the 'b' is for behind and, yes, this is a stick that helps you take a picture of your rear end. Scroll down for video . US company On.com has revealed a selfie stick for your backside. Called the Belfie Stick (shown) it has an extendable arm and a hinge. This allows you to get the optimum angle to snap an image of your behind. A Bluetooth button at the end of the stick lets you easily take photos . The Belfie Stick, from US company On.com, lets people more easily take a picture of their behind using a bendable design. Evolutionary scientists claim the male attraction to a large female bottom is due to an ingrained preference for women with a small 'waist to hip ratio.' The waist-hip ratio is calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip size. The smaller the waist in relation to the hip, the more attractive a woman appears to a man. The study found that fat around curvy hips and thighs holds higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for the growth of the brain during pregnancy. Reporting in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, the researchers found that the children of curvy mothers are more likely to do well in cognitive tests than others. The extendable and adjustable arm, with a hinge in the middle, helps amateur photographers get the perfect angle without needing to use a mirror. At the tip of the stick is a Bluetooth button, which can be synced with your device to activate the shutter on your camera. And almost all smartphone users will be able to bask in the joy of the Belfie, as it supports Android, Windows and Apple devices. 'With our bendable stick, you can position your back side without the need of a mirror and shoot the exact angle you are looking for,' the company explains on their website. 'Bend in ways you never thought possible with our patent-pending design!' The product will be available later this year and is expected to retail for £53 ($79.99). And who knows - perhaps, before long, this will be the latest inexplicable craze sweeping the world. The Belfie Stick is reminiscent of the currently popular selfie sticks, but it has a hinge in the middle to help you get a better angle on your behind. The product will go on sale later this year for £53 ($79.99) and supports Android, Windows and Apple devices . Perhaps the most famous 'belfie' of all time is this picture of  Queen of Curves Kim Kardashian . No one's looking at her hair! Kim's husband Kanye's ex Amber Rose is one of few who can match Mrs Kardashian-West at her belfie game . Another fan of suspicious belfies is former reality TV star Lauren Goodger who posted this on her Instagram . On.com's chief technology officer Kevin Deegan said the reason for the product's creation came from a belfie trend being noticed in their online photo galleries. 'Our users are our biggest indicator of selfie trends being that it's the type of photo they post most often,' he said. 'We've noticed a huge spike in users taking butt selfies in recent months so the natural next step was for us to develop a device to assist our users in taking one.' The selfie stick, shown here, is becoming a regular fixture among normal social activities like BBQs, holidays, sports events and parties, sometime to the annoyance of others - but is it about to lose its status as the most frustrating recent invention to the Belfie stick?","US company On.com has revealed a selfie stick for your backside .

"An Army veteran who fatally shot a psychologist at a West Texas veterans' hospital before killing himself was a former clerk at the clinic. He had publicly threatened the doctor in 2013, the FBI said on Wednesday. The gunman in Tuesday's shooting, which caused hundreds of patients and staff to seek shelter, was Jerry Serrato, 48, who was medically discharged from the Army in 2009 after serving in Iraq two years earlier. Serrato used a .380-caliber handgun to shoot Dr Timothy Fjordbak, 63, and himself at the El Paso Veterans Affairs Health Care System at Fort Bliss, Texas. Police officers guard an entrance to the Beaumont Army Medical Center, adjacent to the veterans' hospital where Jerry Serrato, 48, shot Dr Timothy Fjordbak, 63, before turning the gun on himself . Officials said Serrato shot Fjordbak on the fourth floor of the clinic before taking his own life on the third floor. Fjordbak was a psychologist who left private practice after the September 11 terrorist attacks because he wanted to work with military veterans, officials said. Serrato had served in the Ohio Army National Guard from 1985 to 1993, then enlisted in the Army in July 2006, military records show. He served in Iraq for five months in 2007. The FBI has not  given a motive for the shooting. However, Fjordbak had reported Serrato made an unspecified verbal threat against him at an El Paso supermarket in 2013. Code White: Hundreds of patients and staff sought shelter as a 'code white' was issued over the clinic's intercom system indicating the presence of an active shooter . Douglas Lindquist, who heads the FBI's El Paso office, said Serrato had some sort of perceived or real grievance against Fjordbak and had said something to the effect of, 'I know what you did and I will take care of it.' 'It was something in public at a grocery store where Mr Serrato approached Dr Fjordbak, who did not recognize him, and he made a verbal threat, and that was the extent of the report. As far as we can tell, that was the only connection that they had,' Lindquist said. Both men worked at the VA at the same time in 2013, but authorities do not believe they had a working relationship, Lindquist said. There also was no immediate indication the gunman was a patient, the FBI said. A security assessment is underway at the clinic following the shooting, which comes four months after it was found that the base was not compliant with Department of Defense directives . Sutton Smith, a worker at the VA clinic, said a 'code white' was issued over the intercom system Tuesday indicating an active shooter and ordering people to seek shelter. Smith said he hid with about a dozen people in a locked room with the lights off for some two hours. Apart from the initial alert and some communication among managers via cellphone, no official updates were provided during the lockdown, he said. A security assessment is underway at the clinic in the wake of the shooting, said Peter Dancy, the VA hospital's acting director. The shooting comes just four months after the Fort Bliss Commanding Officer Major General Stephen Twitty announced new security measures after a military assessment found the base was not fully in compliance with Department of Defense directives. The measures included random vehicle checks and limiting access to Defense Department personnel at some gates. However, four gates still remained open to the public, according to a press release. A Department of Homeland Security helicopter flies over the El Paso VA and Beaumont Army Medical Center campus during the search for a gunman in El Paso, Texas on Tuesday . On Wednesday, civilians were still able to access the post with only a driver's license, passing through just a single checkpoint manned by several soldiers. Investigators talked outside the closed VA clinic, warning of broken glass, while soldiers entered the adjacent William Beaumont Army Medical Center. The El Paso clinic came under scrutiny last year after a federal audit showed it had among the longest wait times for veterans trying to see a doctor for the first time. A survey last year of more than 690 veterans living in El Paso County found that they waited an average of more than two months to see a Veterans Affairs mental health professional and even longer to see a physician.","Jerry Serrato, 48, shot Dr Timothy Fjordbak, 63, before turning the gun on himself at the Fort Bliss veterans' clinic near El Paso, Texas .

"A young mother and cartoonist who survived the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris today said she had let the suspected Al Qaeda killers into the magazine office. Corrine Rey said she had returned from picking up her young daughter from a kindergarten when she was confronted by two heavily armed men wearing balaclavas. 'I had gone to pick up my daughter at day care, arriving in front of the magazine building, where two masked and armed men brutally threatened us,' said Ms Rey, who draws under the name 'Coco'. Scroll down for video . Desperate: Corrine Rey, who's a cartoonist for Charlie Hebdo, hid underneath a desk with her daughter to escape the terrorists who killed her colleagues . Siege: The two men, who claimed to be from Al Qaeda, threatened Miss Rey into giving them the code to enter the building . Killers: One of the masked men mercilessly shot and killed a wounded police officer on the street outside . Death: 12 people, including four Charlie Hebdo journalists, were killed in the attack before the assailants fled . 'They said they wanted to go up to the offices, so I tapped in the code,' said Ms Rey, referring to the digi-code security system on the inter-phone. Miss Rey and her daughter hid under a desk, from where they saw two other cartoonists being executed. 'They shot Wolinski and Cabu,' she said, 'It lasted five minutes. I had taken refuge under a desk. She said the men 'spoke French perfectly' and 'claimed they were 'Al Qaeda terrorists'. According to Charlie Hebdo's lawyer, four cartoonists were killed by the masked gunmen: Cabu, Wolinski, Tignous and Charb, the pen name of Stephane Charbonnier, also the chief editor at Charlie Hebdo. Corrine's story is one of several horrifying tales from people who saw and survived the attack in Paris today. Another eye-witness, who works in an office in the same building, told the BBC World Service: 'When I arrived at the scene it was quite disturbing as you can imagine. There were several corpses on the floor. He arrived at the scene of the massacre just minutes after the attackers had left, and described how he tried to make some room for the wounded in the office. Showdown: There was a fire-fight between French police and the two attackers, who claim to be from Al Qaeda, outside the building . Terrifying: Eyewitnesses say they saw the men firing indiscriminately on the street outside. This tweet allegedly shows a bullet hole from inside the Charlie Hebdo office building . Getaway: After shooting a policeman, the pair escaped in a black Citroen (pictured), which they crashed . On the run: The men, described as 'calm and highly disciplined', remain on the loose in Paris . He added: 'As we progressed through the rooms, we saw there were a lot of people down on the floor and there was blood everywhere. 'We're extremely relieved that nobody was affected by the attacks in my own office... but obviously I'm very traumatised by this attack and everything and now we're in psychological hell where we're being attended to by professionals.' Giles Boulanger, who also works in the same building, described to French news station Itele how a colleague warned him that armed men had entered the building. He said: 'several minutes later, we heard several shots in the building from automatic weapons from all directions. 'It was really upsetting. You'd think it was a war zone.' The headquarters of Charlie Hebdo was attacked with a 'firebomb' in November 2011, after they put an image of the Prophet Mohammed on its cover. Out-gunned: One eyewitness told Sky News the security presence around the building was 'useless' Shooting: Lead cartoonist Jean 'Cabu' Cabut (pictured) was among the 12 massacred by terrorists in Paris . Security presence around the building was ineffective against the 'well trained' attackers, Stefan De Vries told Sky News. The French journalist, who arrived at the scene moments after the attackers had fled, said: 'There was protection at the door but they killed the police officers, they executed them and they started shooting in the offices. There were more than 50 people inside. ‘It  was difficult to enter but these people, the suspects were heavily armed, and shot the police so yeah, there was security but it was useless.’ Witnesses said the suspected Al Qaeda killers were heard to shout 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' – 'God is greatest' – as they stalked the building. Horrific footage also emerged showing an injured police officer slumped on the pavement outside the office as two of the gunmen approach. Police officers were involved in a gunfight with the men, who escaped in a hijacked car, speeding away towards east Paris and remain on the loose, along with a third armed man.","Corrine Rey and her daughter saw two other cartoonists being killed .

"An avocado a day could help improve bad cholesterol levels, claim researchers. The ‘avocado diet’ also improves other blood fat scores linked to heart disease – even in the overweight. Researchers say a daily helping of avocado can replace unhealthy fats in the diet with a healthier version. A daily avocado appears to lower levels of 'bad' cholesterol in the body, reducing the risk of a heart attack . Study leader Penny Kris-Etherton, chair of the American Heart Association’s nutrition committee, said: ‘In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. ‘Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. 'But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. ‘Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.’ In the study 45 healthy, overweight or obese patients between the ages of 21 and 70 were put on three cholesterol-lowering diets. For the study researchers used Hass avocados, the ones with bumpy green skin. Participants consumed an average American diet (consisting of 34 per cent of calories from fat, 51 per cent carbohydrates, and 16 per cent protein) for two weeks prior to starting one of three cholesterol lowering diets. They were assigned to a lower fat diet without avocado, moderate-fat diet without avocado, and moderate-fat diet with one avocado per day. 'Many people do not know how to incorporate avocados in their diet except for making guacamole and eating it with corn chips, which are high in calories and salt,' the researchers warned . The two moderate fat diets both provided 34 percent of calories as fat (17 per cent of calories from monounsaturated fatty acids/MUFAs), whereas the lower fat diet provided 24 per cent of calories as fat (11 per cent from MUFAs). Each participant consumed each test diet for five weeks. The researchers found that compared to the baseline average American diet, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - the so called ‘bad cholesterol’ - was 13.5 mg/dL lower after eating the avocado diet. In a patient with high LDL, this would be the equivalent of a 10 per cent fall. LDL was also lower on the moderate fat diet without the avocado (8.3 mg/dL lower) and the lower fat diet (7.4 mg/dL lower), though the results were not as striking as the avocado diet. Several additional blood measurements were also more favourable after the avocado diet including total cholesterol and triglycerides. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Heart Association (must credit). In addition to MUFAs, avocados also provided other beneficial compounds that could have contributed to the findings such as fibre and phytosterols. The heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fatty fish, and foods rich in monounsaturated fatty acids--like extra-virgin olive oil and nuts. Dr Kris-Etherton, Distinguished Professor of Nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, in University Park, Pennsylvania, said: ‘This was a controlled feeding study, but that is not the real-world - so it is a proof-of-concept investigation. ‘We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats.’","Daily helping can replace unhealthy fats in the diet with a healthier version .

"Nick Clegg today unveiled his Lib Dem election team, as rivals began plotting to replace him as leader. In the biggest demotion, Vince Cable has been dumped as the party's main economic spokesman as Mr Clegg named his 'Liberal Democrat Cabinet'. But with the Lib Dems fifth in the polls behind Ukip and the Greens, senior figures including Ed Davey made clear their leadership ambitions if Mr Clegg is forced to 'hang up his clogs'. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured today, confirmed his frontbench team which he will lead into the election on May 7, including demotion for Vince Cable (right) Vince Cable (right) is ousted as the party's main economic spokesman, to be replaced by Danny Alexander (left) who has been in the Treasury as George Osborne's deputy in 2010 . Mr Clegg announced that Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will take the lead on the economy, a job given to Mr Cable before the 2010 election. However, Mr Alexander has been accused of 'going native' in the Treasury, seen by some as too close to Tory Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Cable will be responsible for business policy, but in the list of names released today was placed fifth in seniority, behind the likes of Lynne Featherstone and Tim Farron. A source close to Mr Clegg insisted that the two men were simply 'mirroring the jobs they've done for the last five years'. 'We are lucky in the party to have two such strong voices on the economy', the source added. Aides to Mr Cable stressed that he would still be speaking on the economy in his role covering business, innovation and skills. Mr Clegg said: 'This is a team that will never pander to the politics of grievance, fear and blame but instead work every day to keep Britain anchored in the centre ground. 'Over the coming months, they will prove that the Lib Dems are the only party that can balance the budget, cut taxes for 30 million people, invest in health and education and protect our environment.' Mr Clegg led his new team on a campaign visit to Hornsey in north London . The new team will be tasked with taking on their Tory coalition partners and Labour during the election campaign . Mr Alexander is seen as a leading contender to replace Mr Clegg if he is ousted after the general election. Allies of the Lib Dem leader believe Mr Alexander has been 'positioning' for the role for more than a year. Last night Energy Secretary Ed Davey threw his hat into the ring, declaring his willingness to lead the party if it 'falls' to him. He told LBC radio: 'If it turns out when Nick Clegg hangs up his clogs as leader … whether that's directly after the next election – I doubt it – or in a few year's time – more likely – when he does that, of course there will be colleagues like myself and others, who will think about whether they want to stand for leader. That's not unreasonable.' He added: 'If one day it falls to me to lead it, then obviously, I'd like to do that.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey revealed he would throw his hat into the ring to be Lib Dem leader 'when Nick Clegg hangs up his clogs' Mr Davey will speak for the party on energy and climate in the run-up to the election, . Grassroots favourite Mr Farron, widely regarded as a favourite to become leader, will be responsible for foreign affairs while Ms Featherstone will cover home affairs. Two ministers sacked by Mr Clegg during the coalition are offered a comeback. Sir Nick Harvey returns to speak on defence while Michael Moore, ousted as Scottish Secretary in 2013, will cover Europe. General Election Coordinator Paddy Ashdown added: 'If in Government after the General Election this team will finish the job and make sure Britain doesn't lurch to the Right or Left. 'We all know Labour are a risk to the economy and the Tories will cut too much, threatening the NHS and sacrificing the least well off.'","Lib Dem leader unveils his frontbench team to fight the election in May .

"Women should not drink any alcohol while they are pregnant because of the risks to their unborn child, an MP said today. Bill Esterson wants it to  be made compulsory for all alcoholic beverages to carry compulsory warning labels directed at expectant mothers. The Labour MP for Sefton Central on Merseyside presented his Alcohol Labeling (Pregnancy) Bill during this morning's session of Parliament, after PMQs. Mr Esterson told MPs that 7,000 children a year were born in the UK damaged by alcohol, equating to one in every 100 births. He said: 'Mild brain damage can be caused to children by even small amounts of alcohol at the wrong time during pregnancy, especially in the early stages when an embryo does not have the protection of a blood stream. 'Much scientific evidence suggests that there is no safe limit when it comes to drinking in pregnancy but sadly not everyone is aware of the dangers.' MP Bill Esterson presented his Alcohol Labeling (Pregnancy) Bill in Parliament today, urging pregnant women to stop drinking in a bid to protect their unborn babies from Foetal Alcohol syndrome . He said at least one in 100 babies are born damaged because of the effects of alcohol . 'This is a vitally important issue,' he said ahead of introducing his bill today. 'Everything possible needs to be done to bring this to an end, and MPs in Parliament have the power to take steps to do just that. 'There has been confusion for pregnant women over whether they should or shouldn't drink during pregnancy. 'There has been confusion over how much they can drink. 'The best advice is it is better to be safe than sorry. If you're pregnant don't drink. 'But there is still some ambiguity from the Government on this.' He told MPs: 'My Bill is about making sure that all the facts are available and about avoiding confusing or conflicting advice, whether from Government or elsewhere. 'The labels in place now are inadequate, that is why I am calling for a mandatory system of labelling that is clear, that cannot be easily missed and that gives the best advice. 'That advice must be not to drink at all while pregnant or trying to conceive. 'Such a system of labelling should be designed to help cut the number of children damaged at great cost to themselves and to society.' Mr Esterson's drive to protect unborn children from the effects of alcohol was inspired by his wife Caroline. She learned of the devastating effects of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) when attending a meeting on the subject as part of her role on Sefton Adoption Panel. Babies born with FASD are prone to suffering learning difficulties, memory problems, hyperactivity and poor problem-solving skills. Those diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol syndrome (FAS) are also known to suffer birth defects, including a smaller head circumference, heart problems, limb damage, kidney damage, damage to the brain, eye problems, hearing problems and specific facial characteristics. Mr Esterson said he wants to see all alcoholic drinks carry clear health warnings directed at expectant mothers, warning them alcohol can harm their unborn child . Mr Esterson said: 'At the severe end of the spectrum, there are 7,000 live births of children with more severe FAS each year, with three or four times as many babies being born with more moderate damage but still suffering from FASD in the UK. 'There is however, suggestion of under diagnosis as symptoms are similar to those resulting from conditions such as ADHD. 'Across Europe and North America, estimates suggest that at least one in 100 children suffer from the effects of drinking during pregnancy and some experts say the true figure may be as high as three or four in every 100. Drinking while pregnant increases the risk of your unborn baby suffering Foetal Alcohol syndrome (FAS) and Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). When a pregnant women drinks alcohol it travels across the placenta to the foetus via the bloodstream. Because the foetus's liver isn't fully formed, it is unable to metabolise the alcohol quickly enough. At this stage a baby has a high blood alcohol concentration. It therefore lacks oxygen and the nutrients needed for its brain and organs to grow properly. Timing also plays a factor. A baby's facial features are formed during weeks six to nine of pregnancy. Mothers who drink during this three-week window are therefore more likely to have babies with the facial deformities associated with FAS, Professor Neil McIntosh, an Edinburgh-based neonatologist said. Damage to a baby's organs through drinking is most likely to happen in the first three months. Children with FAS have distinct features, including small and narrow eyes, a small head, a smooth area between the nose and lips and a thin upper lip. They may show symptoms of: . FASD is the umbrella term used to describe the conditions that occur in people who are diagnosed with some, if not all, of the symptoms of foetal alcohol syndrome. Experts estimate one child in 100 is born with FASD. It can be more difficult for a specialist to diagnose FASD, because children may not have the same facial deformities as those diagnosed with FAS. Children with FASD may suffer: . Dr Raja Mukherjee who works for Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'If you drink a low amount when you are pregnant your baby has a low risk of developing FAS or FASD. If you drink heavily you have a high risk. If you don't drink, there's no risk at all.' Source: Drinkaware . 'Something needs to be done to stop this. 'There are simple steps that we as a country can take to make sure that this issue is tackled. 'Basic steps which are already being taken in other countries, such as Canada and France where FASD is taken more seriously than it is here. 'The government needs to give concise 'no drinking while pregnant' advice. 'We need to introduce a programme of awareness, starting in schools. And we need compulsory health warning labels on alcoholic drinks as part of a wider campaign of awareness. 'Britain needs to catch up. We need to take Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder seriously. 'And we need to do everything we can to cut the often devastating effects that drinking alcohol when pregnant can have on an unborn baby's life for years to come.' In the U.S. bottles and cans containing alcoholic drinks feature a clear health warning. But in the UK there is a voluntary system. In 2007 he said, Labour peer Lord Mitchell introduced a Private Member's Bill in the House of Lords which led to a voluntary system of labelling in the UK, but despite this, not all alcohol containers had a warning and questions remained over the effectiveness of the labels. Many suppliers carry warnings on their alcoholic drinks, but Mr Esterson argues they are so small they are not immediately obvious to the consumer. Mr Esterson urged the drinks industry to consider the current content of labels and make the changes without legislation and called on the Government to update its guidance and support his Bill. The Department of Health currently advises pregnant women 'to avoid alcohol altogether'. It adds that if a pregnant woman does opt to have a drink, it recommends sticking to one or two - the equivalent of one small glass of wine - once or twice a week to minimise the risk to the baby. Nice echoes that advice, recommending women 'abstain from alcohol completely during the first three months of pregnancy because of the risks of miscarriage'. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says the safest option for women is not to drink alcohol at all during pregnancy. But it adds that small amounts of alcohol have not been found to be harmful. Mr Esterson told MPs: 'The Chief Medical Officer says women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should avoid alcohol altogether, however if they do choose to drink, to minimise the risk for the baby we recommend they should not drink more than one or two units, once or twice a week and should not get drunk. 'She goes on to say there is uncertainty about how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy. 'The Chief Medical Officers also says that if a low level is consumed there is no evidence of harm to an unborn baby. However this is a view that is not universally shared.' The effects on a child he said could range from reduced intellectual ability and attention deficit disorder to heart problems and premature death. He added: 'Many children experience serious behavioural and social difficulties that will last a lifetime. In fact what most of us take for granted is a lifelong struggle and the damage caused cannot be reversed. 'Now not everyone whose mother drinks during pregnancy suffers damage that affects their life chances and this is certainly not an attack on women. 'But the damage done by alcohol to too many children shows the need for action and it shows that too many of us do not understand the potential risks of drinking alcohol at any point during pregnancy.' Mr Esterson's Alcohol Labelling (Pregnancy) Bill would establish a statutory scheme providing for clear and consistent labelling of alcoholic beverages as they related to foetal health and safety and that of pregnant women. The Bill, which had cross party support, was earmarked for a second reading on March 6 but is unlikely to become law due to a lack of Parliamentary time.","MP Bill Esterson presented his Alcohol Labeling (Pregnancy) Bill in Parliament following PMQs today .

"Pensioner Harry Harrison (pictured at Hull Crown Court) wrote a suicide note and selected pills to take before picking up a six-inch knife from the kitchen and marching to his neighbour's home to stab him . An 82-year-old man wrote a suicide note before grabbing a kitchen knife and attempting to kill his neighbour in a dispute over noise. Harry Harrison had marched over to confront his neighbour at 4.50am after he said he heard him using his washing machine- which was turned off at the time. The former serviceman then lunged at his neighbour Jamie Branch-Peard with the 6-inch knife in the hallway of his home. Harrison stabbed him twice in the stomach and slashed him twice across the chest as he kept repeating: 'You are evil. You should not be here.' Harrison, from Bridlington in Yorkshire, told police he had wanted to kill his neighbour and had problems with him for three weeks. Officers later found the suicide pills laid out in the pensioner's house along with the note to the East Yorkshire Coroner mentioning the washing machine being on at anti-social hours. He said he had planned to attack Mr Branch-Peard the previous evening after hearing the washing machine on at 10pm, but had second thoughts. He pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and was sentenced at Hull Crown Court to four-and-a-half years in jail. One charge of attempted murder was left to lie on the file. Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, said: 'This was a serious attack on an innocent man in the early hours of the morning. It has had repercussions for the man, including him having to be off work for four weeks and leave his own home. 'This is a tragedy from everyone's perspective. You are the author of that tragedy.' Crown barrister John Thackray said Harrison had a number of issues with his neighbour- all of which were found to be false. He said Harrison had initially taken issue with a garden shed, first claiming it was being used to run a business, and then that it was used for breeding dogs. East Riding Council officials became involved and advised the neighbour to contact the police. Mr Harrison was spoken to by a Humberside. A police special constable and told he was being unreasonable and appeared to understand. However, in the days before the stabbing Mr Harrison had appeared at his neighbour's door and seemed 'very confrontational and wagging his finger' saying he was going to the council about the washing machine. On April 11, Mr Harrison had laid out pills in his house and written a suicide note before going to confront his neighbour. 'The neighbour opened the door and asked him what it was about,' said Mr Thackray. 'He appeared agitated and was asking him why the washing machine was on. He said it was not, and the neighbour tried to placate Mr Harrison. 'Before he knew it, Mr Harrison had lunged at him - pushing him into his hall. He was grappling with him and trying to push him out of the house. 'He then noticed Harrison had a knife, which he had not seen before, as he had opened the door half asleep. Mr Harrison then began stabbing at him with his right hand towards his legs and stomach. 'The neighbour described Harrison as crazed. He feared for his life. He said he did not think he would have been able to stop Mr Harrison, if he had not put up such a struggle. '(Harrison) kept saying: 'You are evil. You should not be here.' Mr Thackray added  the pair had been grappling in the doorway when the knife blade broke during the struggle. A third party then intervened and pulled the pair apart. The police were called and an ambulance took Mr Branch-Peard to Hull Royal Infirmary where he was treated for two knife cuts to the chest, two 1cm puncture wounds to the stomach, and scratches to the neck and arm. The court heard that the neighbour had to take four weeks off work to recover. He now suffers flash backs and cannot face living in his own home. Harrison was sentenced to four-and-a-half-years for the frenzied attack when he appeared at Hull Crown Court (pictured) yesterday . Defence barrister Anil Murray said Mr Harrison was a hard working man who had been widowed and described by friends a proud gentleman who they could not believe was capable of such violence. He said at the time of the attack he suffered from psychosis and paraphrenia - a delusional mental health condition which can happen to elderly, widowed people who live on their own. Mr Murray said the defence accepted there was never any noise from the washing machine, but it was described by a psychiatrist as an auditory hallucination. He said Harrison had been married for 54 years but his wife died in 2008 and he had since lived on his own. Sentencing Judge  Richardson told Harrison: 'There are a lot of elderly people who we all have experience of who have irrational thoughts, but what they don't do is pick up a knife and go around to their neighbours and stabbing them in the early hours of the morning.' 'I have given you due weight to your psychosis and mental disorder you were suffering from at the time. Had you been a younger man and not suffering from a mental disorder you would have been sentenced to very much longer. 'This is a very usual and difficult case . 'You are 82 years old. You have no previous convictions and you have led an exemplary life with responsible work and a happy marriage until your wife died in 2008. You now fall to be sentenced for a very serious crime which warrants a custodial sentence. 'Given your age that sentence will fall harder on you. You will be a vulnerable prisoner and the late-evening-of-your life will be spent in misery. You have ruined your own life.' Harrison, who wore head phones to boost his hearing, smiled to his family in court before being led away to cells below court and a waiting prison van.","Harry Harrison grabbed a kitchen knife and went to confront his neighbour .

"Americans think sitting President Barack Obama is the nation's worst leader since the last World War, according to a poll released this morning. A third of Americans singled-out Obama as their least favorite president since 1945 in Quinnipiac University's latest presidential poll, just ahead of George W. Bush, who received 28 percent of the vote. In a head-to-head match-up between the two most recent presidents, Bush and Obama, Bush narrowly came out the victor, with 40 percent of survey-takers saying he was a better president than Obama and 39 percent saying he was worse. Scroll down for video . Buyer's Remorse: Americans say the country would be better off if Obama, pictured here yesterday watching the U.S. in the World Cup, had lost to businessman Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election . Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush are by far the most disliked U.S. presidents since 1945 . 'Over the span of 69 years of American . history and 12 presidencies, President Barack . Obama finds himself with President George W. Bush at the bottom of the . popularity barrel,' Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac . University Poll, said in a statement. Ranked in order of how bad Americans say they were, the 12 presidents included in the survey were: Obama, Bush, Richard Nixon,  Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy. Americans told Quinnipiac the best man to serve as leader of the free world since WWII was Reagan, a former Hollywood actor who held the office of the president for two terms from 1981- 1989. Reagan took a solid 35 percent of the vote, beating out his closest competitor, Clinton, by 17 points. Clinton, who was impeached by Congress during his second term for lying about his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, was selected by 18 percent of the poll's takers as their favorite. Fellow philandering president John F. Kennedy came in third with 15 percent of the vote. Miss me yet?: Americans are starting to think that George W. Bush, pictured here in April, wasn't that bad of a president after all, compared to Obama . Ronald Reagan is still the most beloved president in modern history. This December 1987 photo was taken while he giving a speech in Washington, D.C. 'I believe that we will win': Obama hops on the World Cup bandwagon to lead White House employees in a soccer chant at the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building before yesterday afternoon's match between the USA and Belgium . Obama's favorability ratings were underwater in nearly every issue area Quinnipiac asked voters about except the environment. The president scored below 50 percent on healthcare, the economy, terrorism and foreign policy. Respondents . were clear about their disapproval of the president's signature law . Obamacare. The nays beat out the yeas by 12 points. Questions . about the way Obama was doing his job overall were also met with bad . news for the president. A majority, 53 percent, said they did not approve of the job he was doing, while 40 . percent they approved. Likewise, 51 percent said Obama does not have 'strong leadership qualities,' compared to the 47 percent of respondents who said he does. Americans . were split over whether they could trust Obama, with 48 percent . answering in the affirmative and 48 percent answering in the negative. The poll also hinted at a bit of buyer's remorse among voters. By a margin of 45 percent to 38 percent, respondents to Quinnipiac's poll said they think the country would be better off if  businessman and Republican politician Mitt Romney had been elected president in 2012 instead of Obama. 'Would Mitt have been a better fit?  More voters in hindsight say yes,' Malloy said in a statement. Fairweather friends: Even young people, like the ones pictured at Obama's speech yesterday, say they prefer Reagan to Obama . Obama is pictured here yesterday greeting his fans at the Georgetown Waterfront Park in Washington, D.C., where he gave a speech about the importance of funding transportation and infrastructure projects . The White House struggled to defend the president's bad showing in the Quinnipiac poll when a reporter broached the subject this afternoon at press secretary John Earnest's daily briefing. Asked if Obama still has 'the chops' to call on the American people to support his crusade against Congress, Earnest said,'There's no doubt that the president has the leadership and stature necessary to call upon the American public to rally around the kinds of ideas that are in the best interests of the country.' 'The president is going to continue to do that,' he said. Seemingly unphased by the news that Americans have said in every recent poll that they don't agree with the direction in which Obama is taking the country, Earnest went on to explain how the 'power' of the president's 'ideas' would propel him forward, as would the 'power wielded by citizens all across this country.' Americans 'have within them, based on our system of government, the ability to bring pressure on their elected representatives to actually act in the best interests of the country,' Earnest said before changing topics. The White House will find out soon enough if its instincts were correct. Voters go to the ballot box in four months to elect a new Congress. Generic congressional polls taken in the last several weeks put Democrats slightly ahead, but still within the margin of error. Republicans are likely to keep the House, but the Senate, which is currently controlled by the president's party, could go either way. Even if Republicans don't win the Senate, but they keep the House as expected, the president's agenda will continue to be stalled, making it difficult for him to rebuild the widespread support that ushered him into office.","Sitting president Barack Obama was cited as the worst U.S. president out of the dozen men who have held the position dating back to 1945 .
Former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan ranked first on survey-takers' lists, followed by philandering presidents Bill Clinton and John F. Kennedy .
Americans are so chafed by Obama's leadership that they say the country would be better off with businessman and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney at the helm ."
"The US Ambassador to Switzerland has caused a furore among Swiss after she made comments on Facebook and Twitter about the 'chaos' she'd experienced the Swiss ski resort of Adelboden. Suzi LeVine was accused by Swiss tabloid Blick of 'violating diplomatic etiquette' by posting critical comments about the resort on her Facebook page and Twitter feed. 'I’m trying to understand the chaos in the lift lines at Swiss ski resorts,' LeVine wrote after spending New Year’s Day in the resort. The Swiss system of queuing (or not) to get onto lifts came under fire after the US ambassador visited the resort of Adelboden in Switzerland. (File pic shows skiers in Zermatt, Switzerland) LeVine: 'Chaos at the ski lifts' She added: 'We enjoyed a great day at Adelboden but I was so puzzled by the scrum heading to the lift (and the inefficiency in terms of how many people were on each lift).' She also asked her Facebook followers which Swiss resorts were the best organised, and wrote: 'Is there an optimal way to navigate the line?' On Twitter she asked people to share their ski lift experiences . Blick said the ambassador’s remarks were an attack on Switzerland’s winter tourism and suggested that her comments could lead to a full scale diplomatic row, contacting Switzerland Tourism director Jürg Schmid to ask for his reaction. Schmid duly commented: 'I talked to the ambassador and advised her to wait until the end of the season before drawing a final conclusion about the organization of Swiss ski resorts.' He also added that the Swiss ski resorts were 'not elitist', unlike in the US. Blick said LeVine, 42, had made matters worse by trying to 'round up criticism' about Switzerland by asking readers to share their lift line experiences, good, bad or indifferent, although she did not restrict the issue to Swiss resorts. 'Ambassadors tell their governments about their host country in secret dispatches,' the German-language tabloid wrote, adding that they should not 'snub' the country in public. The ambassador and the head of tourism then tweeted each other about the issue. Jürg Schmid wrote, 'Thanks for skiing in #Switzerland. Yesterday was busiest day of season. Rest of the season will be different - check it out.' to which LeVine replied, 'Schmid I'm looking forward to checking it out A LOT! :-)' LeVine, contacted by Blick, admitted that she did not know whether the ski lift criticism was appropriate for a US ambassador, but she told the newspaper she believed that using social media was a suitable forum for dialogue on such matters. View onto the resort of Adelboden, Switzerland, where American ambassador LeVine skiied at New Year . The issue certainly prompted much debate, including readers who said it was 'perfectly reasonable to ask why this is tolerated in a civilized society'. An comment from 'Radders' left on a Swiss newspaper website read: 'It's not arrogant or ignorant it's simply true - the queues for ski lifts can become quite nasty especially at the height of the season when there's not much snow around. There's never really any ""British"" style queuing at any ski resorts. Why shouldn't diplomats be allowed to express an opinion about a leisure activity?' Others said if she'd had an opinion to express on operational efficiency it would have been better to have addressed the staff at the resort. The Twittersphere also erupted with people leaping in to comment on her very public criticism. After her tweet, 'Ich habe eine frage [I have a question]: I'm trying to understand the chaos in the lift lines at Swiss ski resorts' User Kurt Rustem tweeted, 'I'm trying to understand the chaos your government is producing around the world.' LeVine subsequently posted a positive post: . 'I had a great day of skiing @ Adelboden & am looking forward 2 more there & across the country. Simply seeking advice on the experience.' Facebook user Anton Kohler's tongue in cheek comment may well have raised a smile among those following the spat: 'The queue at a Swiss ski lift is not much worse than the line before the immigration at JFK-Airport New York.'","US ambassador Suzi LeVine sparked anger branding queue system 'chaos'

"Roman Polanski in October in Paris. The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite the director over an unlawful sex charge with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 . The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite filmmaker Roman Polanski over a 1977 child sex crime conviction, officials said on Wednesday. A lawyer for the director - viewed by many Poles as one of . their greatest living cultural figures - said Polish . prosecutors already questioned Polanski last year and let him go . free, and since then nothing had changed. Polanski, 81, who was born to Polish parents but lives in . France, has been spending time in the southern Polish city of . Krakow, where he is planning to shoot a film. Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor general's . office in Warsaw, said the extradition request, which came from . prosecutors in Los Angeles, will be passed on to the . prosecutors' office in Krakow. 'Prosecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning,' Martyniuk said. The spokesman said that as a rule Poland does not extradite its citizens. In October last year, prosecutors in Krakow interviewed . Polanski in connection with a U.S. warrant over the 1977 . conviction. They said there were no grounds to arrest him, and . they would await a U.S. extradition request before deciding on . any further steps. 'In our view no new circumstances have arisen which could . lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor's office in . October,' one of Polanski's Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, . told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex . with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los . Angeles, fuelled by champagne and drugs. Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea . bargain. He fled the United States the following year, believing . the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him . in jail for years. In 2009, Polanski was arrested in the Swiss city of Zurich . on the U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest. He was freed . in 2010 after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him to . the United States. His lawyers have been seeking assurances from the Polish . authorities that he can travel freely back and forth to Krakow . to work on the film project, about the 19th-century Dreyfus . affair, without risking another arrest. Paris-born Polanski spent his childhood and youth in Poland but lives in France. He holds Polish and French passports.

"Germans have voted British Dyson vacuum cleaners as better than anything Germans can make themselves . British Dyson vacuum cleaners are better than anything German firms make – say the Germans themselves. The company founded by Sir James Dyson, who reinvented the vacuum cleaner by doing away with the bag, came top in a study of consumers by Germany’s Institute for Quality. German families rated Dyson above their own Miele, Vorwerk, Siemens, AEG, Bosch and Karcher. It is a rare example of a British manufacturer still run by its founder that is not only doing rather well in this country, but has carried the flag for innovation and quality around the world. Indeed, Dyson cleaners are also the market leader in the home of technology, Japan, in terms of the value and volume of sales. They are also number one in terms of value in Taiwan and Hong Kong, while it is reporting strong growth in China, where companies have a reputation for ripping off successful ideas and creating their own cheaper versions. The study’s findings were welcomed by Dyson’s German chief executive, Max Conze, who said: ‘German consumers rate us ahead of their home grown companies, like Bosch and Miele. ‘It disproves the common thinking that only Germans can manufacture world-class technology. Interestingly we are seeing a similar pattern in Japan, where we are now number one, overtaking home grown successes in their own back yard. ‘It seems we are ‘out-Germaning the Germans!’. ‘ . Dyson’s prowess means it has become a magnet for graduates and engineers, creating thousands of jobs in highly skilled jobs in this country, while its machines are made in Malaysia. Today – 22 years after it got rid of the bag - it is unveiling its latest improved vacuum cleaner the Dyson Cinetic Big Ball. The big change is that having done away with the bag, the new cleaner has now removed the need for a filter that – in other machines – can become clogged and needs to be cleaned or replaced. On most existing so-called cyclone machines the filter is needed to hold the finest particles of dust that are sucked up to prevent them clogging up the tubes. However, the Dyson team found that if they created flexible tips on the tubes which funnel the dust into the machine, they vibrate so quickly that the tiny particles cannot block them. The company was founded by Sir James Dyson, pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron, who reinvented the vacuum cleaner by doing away with the bag . The flexible tips, which it calls Cinetic, vibrate 350 times a second which means dust as small as 0.5 microns, which is smaller than a skin cell, are spun through the machine and into the collecting bin. Sir James said: ‘Removing the bag from a vacuum solved one hassle, but filter maintenance remained an annoying problem that needed fixing. 'Dyson engineers have spent six years perfecting cyclone technology to make filter maintenance obsolete. 'The constant flexing of Cinetic tips ensures the cyclones do not block as microscopic dust is spun out of the air – not trapped in a cyclone or on a filter.’ The technology is the result of nearly six years intensive research and development by a team of 29 Dyson engineers. Some 2,000 prototypes were developed whilst creating the new technology. The company said the removal of the need for a filter, which can become clogged, means the machine remains a constant high level of suction, so removing dirt and dust particles that can trigger allergies. Its new Dyson Cinetic Big Ball machine is available from its website with a price tag of £459.99.","Germans voted Dyson vacuum cleaner better than any other German brand .

"The ultimate water fight is on with not one but two street water slides headed for Melbourne's CBD. Radio station Nova has announced it will be transforming Landsdowne Street on January 24 into a giant slide. The station will beat Slide.Melbourne to the punch who publicised the same event on the same street but for February 15 and March 9 earlier this month. Scroll down for video . It is believed more than 11,000 people lined up for their chance to slip and slide down St George's Terrace in the Western Australian capital last month (pictured above) Nova's green-and-gold slide will be 315 metres long, while Slide.Melbourne's will be slightly larger at 400 metres. 'We’re taking this Aussie backyard tradition to the next level,' the station's website read. 'Get your mates together and get ready for some adrenaline pumping slip-sliding fun and much more to keep you entertained throughout the day.' Like Slide.Melbourne's Nova has reassured the street slide will be recycling the water used on the day. 'The event organisers will pay local authorities to access water equivalent to 300 average showers, which will be circulated and reused throughout the slide during the course of the day,' its website said. 'The water will be constantly monitored, filtered and tested to ensure that Department of Health regulations are met and exceeded.' Similar to the one in Perth (pictured above), Nova's will transform Melbourne's Landsdowne Street. This follows Slide.Melbourne announced it would do the same . In November, it is believed more than 11,000 people lined up for their chance to slip and slide down St George's Terrace in Perth. When Slide.Melbourne announced its Lansdowne Street event, it claimed the slide would be 'the longest city street slide anywhere in the world'. It promises to be three lanes wide and 400 metres long. Like Nova's version, Slide.Melbourne guarantees no drop will go to waste. Its 'Splashback Policy' outlines the slide's water consumption equals that of 400 showers. The used water will then be recycled and used to keep Melbourne's gardens looking green. But it is also asking participants to do their bit as well. 'Imagine if on the day you slide with us, you promise to only have a two-minute shower,' Slide.Melbourne's website said. 'If you promise to do that then you and Slide.Melbourne could actually save over 100,000 litres of water.' For a $40 and a 'small booking fee', sliders can get the most bang out of their buck for two hours. Slide.Melbourne said ticket holders could fit in at least three slides in their session.

"Brendan Rodgers has warned his defenders that they must get better if Liverpool are to mount another challenge for the Premier League title this season. The free-scoring Reds came within two points of winning the championship last season, but conceded 46 goals along the way and the manager has identified his back-line as the main area that needs to be improved.

'It wasn’t good enough to concede that many goals, considering the amount of possession we had and amount of goals we scored. 'Generally of course the whole team will be looking to improve, and there are areas that we will specifically be looking at between now and August.' Liverpool will be tested more this season now that they have qualified for the Champions League, although Rodgers says their return to Europe's elite competition has made signing new players easier. Europe's elite: Champions League football has attracted top players like Adam Lallana . 'We’re in the Champions League, players want to come here and play and that’s great,' he said. 'It is easier to attract players but you’ve still got to do your work and convince players to come. 'The off-season wasn’t much of a holiday really! The scouting team, myself, the directors were flying all over Europe to get players in.'

"A prisoner allegedly used a smuggled mobile phone to arrange for Parcelforce to deliver imported machine guns from Germany, a court has heard. Alexander Mullings, 23, allegedly masterminded the operation from his cell at Wandsworth Prison by communicating with four co-defendants each time a weapon was dispatched by the delivery company. The prosecution at the Old Bailey hinges on records from illicit mobile phones via numerous websites and apps including Instagram, Whatsapp, Youtube and even escort sites. Alexander Mullings, 23,  imported machine guns (pictured) from Germany and had them delivered by Parcelforce using a smuggled phone from his cell at Wandsworth Prison, a court has heard . Mr Mullings, who goes by the street name 'Smokey', has admitted organising drug deals from his prison cell. He also admits co-ordinating the packages to help former girlfriend, Emily Ciantar, 20 - who is also on trial - pay off a £20,000 drugs debt owed to a violent gang lord referred to in court as 'Mr X'. However, he claims that he thought the packages contained imitation firearms. Mr Mullings is standing trial alongside four other defendants - including Ms Ciantar - on joint charges of transferring machine guns and ammunition with intent to endanger life. The court heard how three Skorpion sub-machine guns, two of which contained 74 and 100 bullets, were intercepted by police between April and June last year. But five other lethal firearms delivered via Parcelforce to north London have not been recovered, the court was told. One of the sub-machine guns was seized by police during a dramatic firearms raid in April in Mitcham (pictured) Seven of the eight parcels were delivered to a house in Finsbury Park, which was occupied by 55-year-old Joseph Macgillivray. Mr Macgillivray, a drug addict, claims that he thought the packages contained pornography and that he was collecting them from a friend to save him from embarrassment. One of the sub-machine guns was seized by police during a dramatic firearms raid in April in Mitcham. The trial comes as proposed new legislation by the Ministry of Justice and Home Office discussed in Parliament this week could see phone networks compelled to cut off mobile phones being used by prisoners. Detective Inspector Matthew Husher said it had become more difficult for prison staff to prevent mobile phones being brought into prisons with some models matching the shape and size of a car key fob. Prisoners' visitors have also been known to conceal Sim cards in their mouths. In 2013, 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized from UK prisons. Speaking about the proposed new legislation, prisons minister Andrew Selous said: 'We will never tolerate the use of mobile phones in prisons and will continue to clamp down on their illicit use. 'Our range of tough security measures has already successfully seen the number of seizures increase, but this proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem. 'By ordering a phone to be cut off once it is identified, we will be able to reassure victims and prevent further criminal activity faster and wider than ever before.' The prosecution claims it was delivered by Ms Ciantar to Spencer Inglis, 24, who intended to use it to endanger life. Mr Inglis, who is in custody, has denied the allegations but declined to give evidence in court. The recovered machine gun and ammunition carried fingerprints belonging to Sarah Anderson, 24, from Islington, who is also standing trial. She is a known friend of Mr Mullings, who took him in for six weeks when he was hiding from police for a previous conviction. She told the court she could not explain how her fingerprints came to be on the gun and ammunition and has denied all charges. Delivering his closing speech yesterday, prosecuting barrister Benedict Kelleher presented a narrative of a team of trusted accomplices - most of whom were linked to Mullings by sex or drugs - who he used to run a lucrative business from his prison cell. He said Mr X, whose real identity is known to police and barristers, was in fact another accomplice used by Mr Mullings to deal drugs and smuggle weapons. He said: 'This was a conspiracy run by Mr Mullings to import machine guns and ammunition to be redistributed to those around London that wanted them. 'The one reason people want guns and ammunition is to be able to fire them at people and to endanger lives and that's why Mr Inglis took possession of that gun.' The jury is expected to reach a verdict later this week. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Alexander Mullings arranged operation from Wandsworth Prison, court told .

"Sainsbury’s has blamed a supermarket price war that has cut the cost of food for the first annual fall in Christmas sales in at least a decade. The chain said shoppers put just as much food in their baskets over the festive period, however they were paying less than a year ago. The net effect is that same store sales in the three months to January 3 were down by 1.7per cent on the same period the year before. Sainsbury’s has blamed their fall in Christmas sales on the price war among supermarkets in the UK . The news gives some insight as to how the rise of the budget chains Aldi and Lidl have fundamentally changed food shopping, dragging mainstream rivals like Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons into a genuine price war. Figures due to published by Tesco this morning are expected to confirm that its Christmas sales have fallen for the second year in a row, which will add to the air of crisis around the UK’s biggest supermarket. The company has issued a series of profit warnings and lost a whole raft of senior management over claims its accounts were rigged to inflate profits, so misleading investors. Sainsbury’s has been forced to respond to the budget store threat by announcing a series of permanent price cuts on food essentials, from bread and butter to roasting chickens, worth £150million. It has also cancelled the building of more than 40 ‘big box’ supermarkets as consumers move away from doing one weekly big shop towards using local convenience stores more often. Sainsbury's said shoppers put just as much food in their baskets over the festive period, however they were paying less than a year ago . Asda has also announced cuts worth £300m, while Tesco is expected to step up its price cuts in the coming weeks. Sainsbury’s like-for-like sales for the 14 weeks to January 3 fell by 1.7%, an improvement on the 2.8% dip seen in the second quarter and a better performance than analysts expected. It was the fourth successive quarter of decline and the first time Sainsbury’s has reported a fall over its third quarter, which includes the festive period, since 2005. Sainsbury’s said it enjoyed a record-breaking 29.5 million customer transactions in the week before Christmas with the result shares in the company bounced up by 4per cent in early trading. Chief executive, Mike Coupe, warned of a ‘challenging’ outlook to come as food prices continue to fall. ‘Sainsbury’s has provided a great Christmas for our customers. Food price deflation and falling fuel prices have enabled our customers to treat themselves over the festive period,’ he said. Discount war: Boss Mike Coupe warned of a ‘challenging’ outlook to come as food prices continue to fall . ‘The outlook for the remainder of the financial year is set to remain challenging, with food price deflation likely to continue.’ Retail expert Richard Hunter, the head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the chain is strong in terms of having a large number of convenience stores and a popular online shopping arm. But, he said the price squeeze is bound to hit profits. ‘The intense pressure on margins shows no sign of easing,’ he said. ‘The cost conscious consumer continues to add to the discounters’ emergence and, even though the deflationary effects of food and petrol prices play into the consumers’ hands, supermarkets in general remain on alert to shave their selling prices even further,’ he said. Shore Capital’s Clive Black said Asda’s recent price cuts looked ‘punchier’ than those offered by Sainsbury’s. He suggested Tesco and Morrisons might also have an edge because low prices are the key factor in attracting customers. He said: Sainsbury’s could be a vulnerable player in the middle, undercut by more price and cost-aggressive retailers beneath and losing share to the growing premium retailers in the form of Marks & Spencer and Waitrose above.’","Sainsbury's has seen first annual fall in Christmas sales in ten years .

"A billionaire mining mogul has paid more than £46million for a London flat in one of the UK's most expensive public property deals, it was revealed today. Aristotelis Mistakidis, head of copper at mining giant Glencore and in the top 50 richest men in Britain, bought the duplex apartment in the exclusive Chesham Place, Belgravia. The luxury flat, which boasts 7,900sq/ft of space, was developed by the Candy brothers - Nick and Christian - who have built up a shared wealth of hundreds of millions in less than 20 years. The property, designed by Lord Norman Foster, has a master bedroom suite, four guest bedrooms, a large living area and staff quarters, two underground car parking spaces and a 24-hour concierge. Record deal: A billionaire has bought a flat for £46million in this exclusive development in Chesham Place, Belgravia - the third most expensive public deal of all time in Britain . Development: The block was designed by Lord Norman Foster, left, and the brainchild of the Candy brothers - Nick and Christian, right . The duplex, built in 2008, was sold for £46million - making it the third highest sale ever logged with the Land Registry. And the £5,800 per sq/ft price is a record for Belgravia, home to the likes of Roman Abramovich and Nigella Lawson. According to Land Registry figures, the most expensive property ever sold is on The Boltons in Kensington, which was sold for £55million in 2012. The second was a penthouse on Princes Gate which sold last year for £50million. The record sale could be higher because in Britain if you buy a property through a company it does not have to be logged with the Land Registry. Aristotelis Mistakidis is a British billionaire who was born in Greece. Described as a self-made man he has risen to become head of zinc, copper and lead mining giant Glencore. He is worth an estimated £1.5billion, making him the 46th richest person in the UK. He is also in the top 850 wealthiest people in the world. Mr Mistakidis joined Glencore in 1993 and was in charge of its zinc, copper and lead commodity department in 2000. He is also a director of Katanga Mining and Recylex, and is chairman of Glencore unit Mopani Copper Mines. Before that he studied at the London School of Economics and worked for U.S. trading giant Cargill. He is said to split his time between Switzerland and London. Rokstone, the central London estate agency, were the selling agents for Chesham Place. Becky Fatemi, the company director, declined to discuss the parties involved. It is understood there were three ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWI) who offered the asking price for the property. But Mr Mistakidis, 53, who is based in Switzerland, managed to get a deal done first, according to official Land Registry documents. Simon Barnes, a high-end property consultant, says it is rare a home of this value is bought by an individual. He said: 'I have been dealing with these sorts of properties for 30 years and historically they are traded through companies, which helps maintain a level of anonymity. 'Chesham Place is phenomenal. You're not just talking about a flat in Belgravia. 'Candy and Candy have done a fantastic job - the presentation and finish is very good. It ticks all boxes and you couldn't replicate it.' On top of a sizeable estate agency commission, the treasury has also benefited from the sale - with Mr Mistakidis paying £3.2 million in stamp duty. However, this is small change to the businessman, who took a £45 million dividend last year. And when Glencore floated in 2011, Mr Mistakidis's shares in the company were valued at more than £2 billion. Design: Architect Lord Foster was involved in the design of the flats in the luxury development, which contains six apartments . Grand: The flat is believed to have several spacious terraces, including one like this, and also has a media room and drawing room . Nick and Christian Candy bought 21 Chesham Place in 2005 for £13 million, with the former BT telephone exchange their first major development. After a year of difficulties with local authorities, they were then granted planning permission to convert 80,000sq/ft property into six luxury flats, immediately doubling the value of the property. The brothers, who are behind One Hyde Park, commissioned Lord Norman Foster, regarded as one of Britain's best architects, to design the flats with Candy & Candy responsible for the interior design. A spokesperson for Candy & Candy declined to comment. Only one other property - a penthouse on Princes Gate - has publicly sold for more in the last 12 months after it went for £50 million. A flat in One Hyde Park, which is the Candy Brothers' halo development, recently sold for £21.5 million. Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'If property developers were Premier League footballers, everyone would be trying to sign the Candy Brothers in this transfer window. 'It is a very significant transaction, all the more so that it was bought in the public domain, and not under a corporate wrap.' How Russia's oligarchs have started a new stampede for high-end London property to protect their wealth from country's collapsing economy . Hundreds of Russian oligarchs are preparing to buy swathes of ultra-expensive property in London to protect their wealth against the country's crumbling economy, experts have said. Last month six buyers in a few days have contacted luxury London agents Beauchamp Estates and requested £100million homes in upmarket Mayfair, Belgravia and Kensington in order to get their money out of Moscow. Beauchamp has also seen a 10 per cent spike in requests from Russian buyers as panic about an economic collapse spread ahead of the country's currency plunge. Two days after the first Russian sanctions came into effect in April, Penthouse D was bought for £140million by an Eastern European, sparking speculation it was a Russian trying to secure their cash . The new wave of investors will further tighten Russia's grip on London's super-prime market, as they already buy one in five of the capital's most expensive properties. The rouble went into free-fall last month as its value dropped by up to 20 per cent against the dollar, an all-time low, causing tech company Apple to suspend sales of its products online today. While ordinary Russian citizens flocked to Ikea as the budget store warned of price rises, the country's super-elite trained their sights on the London property market. Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said: 'The rouble has seen a massive collapse in value. 'Wealthy Russians are desperate to get their money out of Moscow at present, and we have seen a 10 per cent upturn in Russian clients since the decline in value and the international sanctions biting into the Russian economy. 'I currently have half a dozen Russian clients urgently looking to spend over £20million each on buying a new home in prime Central London'.","Aristotelis Mistakidis is worth £1.5bn in the top 50 richest men in Britain .

"Thousands of Twitter users are expressing their solidarity with news magazine Charlie Hebdo with the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie after the attack at their offices this morning. Journalists around the world led the trend for the hashtag, which translates as 'I am Charlie', as events following the massacre unfolded this afternoon. By 4.15pm, nearly five hours after three gunmen stormed the building and opened fire in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, it had already been tweeted more than 250,000 times, according to one social analytics website. Scroll down for video . 'Je suis Charlie': Journalists hold placards reading 'I am Charlie' as they hold a minute of silence at the offices of news agency Agence France Presse in Paris . Making his point: A man holds a placard which reads 'I am Charlie' to pay tribute during a gathering at the Place de la Republique in Paris tonight . Abroad: People gather for a rally in solidarity with the killed Charlie Hebdo employees, in Geneva, Switzerland . Journalists hold signs reading 'I am Charlie' as they hold a minute's silence at Agence France Presse in Paris . The three masked attackers burst into the satirical magazine's offices at 11.30am this morning, opening fire on staff after seeking out journalists by name. Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France – men who had regularly satirised Islam and the Prophet Mohammed – including the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Stephane Charbonnier. The phrase #JeSuisCharlie had become a rallying call within minutes of yesterday’s attack on the office of Charlie Hebdo. By late afternoon it had been tweeted more than 250,000 times by people showing their unity with the satirical magazine and the victims. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted the hashtag and wrote in French: ‘The response to such demonic violence is love for those who suffer and virtuous action against evil’, followed by the same tweet in English. Twitter users wrote poignant outpourings of grief alongside the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag last night. One, Sebastien Kuntz, said: ‘To all the ordinary people around the world standing up for freedom despite terrorist threats... My heart bleeds #JeSuisCharlie.’ Another, Lara Meone Savine, wrote: ‘France stands together and the world stands with France. Your love, unity is beautiful and inspiring. I’m with you tonight.’ Showing their solidarity with the magazine, thousands of Twitter users also posted the hashtag along with the famous Voltaire misquote: ‘I do not agree with what you have to say, but I’ll defend to the death your right to say it. Many of the tweets included satirical cartoons, including one published in 2012 by New Yorker magazine of a blank square with the message: 'Please enjoy this culturally, ethnically, religiously and politically correct cartoon responsibly. Thank you.' Light in the darkness: People place candles in tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack, in Geneva . In Germany: A man holds an 'I am Charlie' poster as people gather in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin . Making a stand: Demonstrators hold stickers reading 'I am Charlie', during a demonstration in Paris today . Stationery protest: People hold up pens during a gathering in front of the city hall of Rennes, western France . Another tweet under the hashtag by David Pope, political cartoonist at The Canberra Times in Australia, included a cartoon showed a masked gunman standing next to the corpse of a cartoonist. A speech bubble says: 'He drew first.' Among the first to use the hashtag was Thierry Puget, who made the graphic at the top of this story, which has been widely retweeted by others expressing solidarity with the magazine. Others posted images of Charlie Hebdo's most famous and controversial front covers of recent years, including one of an issue supposedly guest-edited by the Prophet Muhammad promising 'a hundred lashes if you don't die laughing.' The US embassy in France was one of those which changed its official Twitter profile, @USEmbassyFrance, to show the #JeSuisCharlie logo as its picture. Meanwhile the French news agency AFP tweeted a photograph of its dozens of staff holding placards, and held a minute’s silence for their fellow journalists. #JeSuisCharlie: A graphic made by Twitter user Thierry Puget, who was one of the first to use the hashtag . Joining in with the hashtag: The Archbishop of Canterbury said on Twitter tonight that the response to 'such demonic violence' should be 'love for those who suffer and virtuous action against evil' Google France paid tribute to the Charlie Hebdo victims by posting an image of a black ribbon below its search box, and the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag was also shared by tens of thousands of people across the image-sharing website Instagram. A Facebook group called Je Suis Charlie was set up to inform people of vigils throughout the world – which it described as ‘good gatherings of peace-lovers’ – and had attracted more than 80,000 members within hours of forming. Charlie Hebdo’s website crashed last night and when it returned online simply showed a black screen with the words ‘Je Suis Charlie’ in white, followed by a link to a seven-page document with ‘Je Suis Charlie’ written on each page in seven languages, including Arabic, German and Spanish. Twitter user Jay McKinnon wrote: ‘Tonight’s crowds give me hope that France will show us that #JeSuisCharlie means more freedom, not less.’ The ‘I am…’ sentiment has become a fiercely powerful expression against injustice. The phrase ‘I am a man’ was first used during black civil rights strikes in Memphis – which had the support of Martin Luther King. It was also used last year in Missouri, America, amid civil unrest and protest against the killing of black teenager Michael Brown when protesters chanted and wore T-shirts bearing the phrase ‘I am Michael Brown’. By midday there were reports of up to 12 people dead and 10 wounded, four critically, including journalists, administrative staff, and police officers who attended the scene. An injured person is carried into an ambulance after the massacre at the offices of French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France . High security: A French soldier patrols in front of the Eiffel Tower after the attack . President Francois Hollande described the bloodbath as a 'barbaric attack against France and against journalists' and vowed to hunt down those responsible. As well as the AK47 assault rifles, there were also reports of a rocket-propelled grenade being used in the attack, which took place during the publication's weekly editorial meeting, meaning all the journalists would have been present. They are said to have sought out staff 'by name', according to a police source, adding that Charbonnier, known as Charb, a cartoonist responsible for an anti-Islam front page, was among those killed. Mr Charbonnier was included in a 2013 Wanted Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam article published by Inspire, the terrorist propaganda magazine published by Al Qaeda. Cartoonists Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski were all also reported dead.","Hashtag started trending on Twitter just an hour after news of attack broke .

"Three motorbikes owned by the late Steve McQueen are set to go under the hammer on Thursday, with a total pre-sale estimate of $330,000. The vintage two-wheelers once driven by The Great Escape star include an extremely rare 1912 Harley Davidson Big Twin, an 1936 Indian Chief and a Husqvarna 250 Cross bought new in 1971. Many of McQueen's bikes were previously sold at the famous 1984 McQueen Estate Auction. The sale came four years after his death, aged 50, following surgery for lung cancer. The actor's trio of vehicles which have resurfaced will be included in Bonham's fifth Motorcycle Auction at Bally's Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on January 8. Up for auction: This ex-Steve McQueen 1912 Harley-Davidson X8E is in full running condition and is expected to make up to S140,000 at Bonham's auction in Las Vegas on Thursday . It is believed to be the highest-valued sale of motorcycles ever in the U.S. with lots boasting a cumulative pre-auction estimate of $5.8million. Actor Peter Fonda - who is most famous for his role as Harley Davidson riding Captain America in the 1969 indie cult classic Easy Rider is selling a 2006 MV Agusta F4CC. It is from the 74-year-old's personal collection of stylish motorcycles and with just 2,000 miles on the clock the machine is estimated to sell between $60,000 and $80,000. There are also motorcycles from the estate of Fonda's late co-star Dennis Hopper, who is known to millions as the deranged bomber in the 1994 action film Speed. Back to market: This 1936 Indian Chief from McQueen's collection was sold as part of the famous 1984 McQueen Estate Auction in Las Vegas as lot 538 - It comes with the sales's original certificate of authenticity .

"The scene, the date and, most significantly, the words remain crystal clear. It is July 2012 and at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground a film crew is working on a fly-on-the-wall documentary. Joe Allen, who is on the brink of completing a £15million move to Anfield, is warmly greeted by Brendan Rodgers, given they had worked together at Swansea.Liverpool’s new manager turns to the camera and delivers a standout line. ‘This is the Welsh Xavi,’ Rodgers proclaims. As far as build-ups go, this one could not have been any bigger. A comparison with one of the greatest Spanish footballers in history guaranteed that rather than being able to slip quietly into his new surroundings, as he may have wanted, the spotlight was instantly shining on Allen. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Joe Allen discuss his favourite books . Top billing: Brendan Rodger's (R) described Joe Allen as 'the Welsh Xavi' after signing him in 2012 . Peas in a pod? Joe Allen still has some way to go before he can rival Barcelona playmaker Xavi (R) There have been times in the subsequent two years when that comment, coupled with the price tag, looked to weigh heavily on his slender shoulders. Though he began brightly, Allen’s form tailed off in his first campaign and, during last season’s charge for the title, he only made 15 starts. Given that Rodgers has spent much of this summer recruiting a plethora of new midfield options, it would seem Allen is facing a fight to live up to that exalted billing but, to stand next to him, you can see he has prepared himself extensively for the battle that lies ahead. When he first walked through the doors, he was elfin in stature but now, thanks to a extensive hours in the gym and the advice of Liverpool’s conditioning team, Allen is sporting a considerably more muscular frame and his shoulders are significantly bulkier to carry that expectation. Beefing up: Joe Allen cuts a more muscular figure after extensive work in the gym . Pass master: Joe Allen completed almost 90% of passes in the Premier League last season . ‘It has been a process over the last season, really,’ says Allen. ‘I have been much more focused in that department. When you have a few injuries, you get more into a routine in the gym but it was something that I needed to do. ‘I can definitely feel the benefits of it and I think there is a bit more to do. It is about getting those marginal gains . . . you have to realise how much of a difference it can make.’ Clearly he is ready for the fight. Allen is never happier than when he is at his rural home with his young family, but, equally, the responsibility of thriving for Liverpool is not something he will ever shirk. ‘For some people the Xavi comparison could probably be an albatross,’ he adds. ‘But, then again, he is some player to be compared to. If I’m honest, I don’t take things like that too serious even if some people have maybe used that in a negative way.’ Stalled: The Wales midfielder only made 15 starts during Liverpool's push for the title last season . Top boyo! Brendan Rodgers brought Joe Allen for £15m after working with him at Swansea . Rodgers remains a huge admirer of his talents but the Wales international knows it is crucial over the coming 12 months to establish himself. The talent is certainly there. His passing accuracy percentage for last season was 89.68 and, with Liverpool having the Champions League added to their workload, he will have a role to play as Rodgers looks to consistently find a winning blend while preserving freshness. How, though, will he become one of the main men? Adam Lallana’s untimely injury might offer him a chance to profit and, in the early hours of Monday morning, when Liverpool face Olympiakos here in the Guinness International Champions Cup, Allen will be ready. ‘It is a big year personally, of course, but every year is at a club like this,’ he explains. ‘We have lost a world class player, in Luis Suarez . . . but the club are reinvesting and we have brought in some really quality players. This season we go again. We can dream of going one step further.’","Joe Allen moved to Liverpool from Swansea for £15m in 2012 .

"They give a retro glimpse at what holidaying on another planet could be like. 'Experience The Gravity of HD 40307g' one poster reads, listing the planet as 'A Super Earth'. Kepler-16b and its twin suns in ideal for sunseekers, and is 'where your shadow always has company'. Scroll down for video . Kepler-16b is a planet dubbed 'Tatooine' because of its system's resemblance to Luke Skywalker's home in Star Wars with its two suns. The posters were created by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab, and are marked as coming from the Exoplanet Travel Bureau. Kepler-16b  is a planet dubbed 'Tatooine' because of its system's resemblance to Luke Skywalker's home in Star Wars. It was spotted by Nasa's Kepler spacecraft in 2012 by catching a dips in starlight as the planet passed in front of its star. Kepler-16b could be a rocky planet (as pictured here) or a gas giant like Saturn. 'This discovery is stunning,' Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution for Science Department of Terrestrial Magnetism said when it was discovered. 'Once again, what used to be science fiction has turned into reality.' Binary stars - two suns turning around each other - have been seen before, and astronomers have suspected planets exist around them, but Kepler's observations are the first to confirm it. Kepler-186f was the first Earth-size planet astronomers ever found inside the 'Goldilocks' or 'habitable' zone around another star. Kepler-186f was the first Earth-size planet astronomers ever found inside the 'Goldilocks' or 'habitable' zone around another star, where moderate temperatures could allow for the presence of liquid water. It circles a red dwarf star 500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. A light-year is almost 6 trillion miles. The planet is about 10 percent larger than Earth and may very well have liquid water — a key ingredient for life — on its surface, scientists said. That is because it resides at the outer edge of the habitable temperature zone around its star — the sweet spot where lakes, rivers or oceans can exist without freezing solid or boiling away. The planet probably basks in an orange-red glow from its star and is most likely cooler than Earth, with an average temperature slightly above freezing, ""similar to dawn or dusk on a spring day,"" Marcy said. The final destination on offer, HD 40307g, is a planet twice as voluminous as earth with eight times its mass . It orbits at about the same distance from its sun, meaning it receives a similar amount of solar energy as Earth gets - increasing chances it may be habitable. Kepler-186f was the first Earth-size planet astronomers ever found inside the 'Goldilocks' or 'habitable' zone around another star - and according to Nasa could be perfect for extreme sports enthusiasts. The posters were revealed a day after eight new planets have been discovered in the 'Goldilocks' zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist. The discovery doubles the number of small planets less than twice the diameter of Earth which are believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Among these eight, astronomers say there are two that are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date. The eight new planets have been discovered in the 'Goldilocks' zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist. 'Most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky, like Earth,' said lead scientist Dr Guillermo Torres, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, US. The two most Earth-like planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. With a diameter just 12 per cent bigger than Earth, Kepler-438b has a 70 per cent chance of being rocky, the scientists have calculated. Kepler-442b is about one-third larger than Earth, and the likelihood of it being rocky is around 60 per cent. The two most Earth-like planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. An artist's impression is pictured . The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet . To be in the habitable zone, also known as the 'Goldilocks zone', a planet must be not too hot or too cold and receive roughly as much sunlight as Earth. Too much heat from its star, and any water would boil away as steam. Too little, and the water would freeze solid. The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry. For example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out. How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes. Researchers in Scotland now claim that Earth-sized planets could support life at least 10 times further away from stars than first thought. 'For our calculations we chose to adopt the broadest possible limits that can plausibly lead to suitable conditions for life,' Dr Torres added. Kepler-438b receives about 40 per cent more light than the Earth giving it a 70 per cent probability of having a habitable zone orbit. In comparison, baking hot Venus has twice as much. The other star gets about two-thirds as much light as Earth and is 97 per cent likely to be in the habitable zone. Co-author Dr David Kipping, also from the Centre for Astrophysics, said: 'We don't know for sure whether any of the planets in our sample are truly habitable. All we can say is that they're promising candidates.' Neither of the planets are our close neighbours. Kepler-438b is located 470 light-years from Earth while the more distant Kepler-442b is 1,100 light-years away. The team, whose findings were presented at the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting in Washington DC, studied planetary candidates first identified by Nasa's Kepler space telescope. All the planets were too small to confirm by measuring their masses. Instead, they were validated using a computer program that determined they were statistically likely to be planets. After the analysis, follow-up observations showed that four of the planets were in multiple star systems. The research is also published in the Astrophysical Journal.

"More than 100 people have fallen severely ill following a major food poisoning outbreak at a Chinese restaurant in Queensland. Authorities have shut down Chin Chin Chinese Restaurant in Springwood, south of Brisbane, after customers ended up hospitalised when they ate at the establishment on the weekend. A Metro South Health spokesman said many people had been hospitalised and patient testing indicated a salmonella outbreak, likely from contaminated egg products. Scroll down for video . Authorities have temporarily shut down Chin Chin Chinese Restaurant in Springwood, south of Brisbane . More than 100 people have been fallen severely ill following a major food poisoning outbreak . Patient testing  indicates a salmonella outbreak, likely from contaminated egg products . 'There have been a lot of people who had the deep fried ice cream who got sick,' the spokesman said. 'But other people didn't have the ice cream and have still gotten sick.' The spokesman said patients had been presenting at Queensland emergency departments with extremely severe stomach cramps, exacerbated by dehydration. 'In some cases people have been hospitalised and in hospital for a number of days,' he said. 'The age is from very young children to the elderly. Amy Herbst, 18, was at the restaurant on Sunday with nine others for her grandmother's birthday . Ms Herbst (left) at the restaurant with brother Ryan, father Jason (who was hospitalised) and mother Rebecca . 'Their conditions are quite serious, we don't want people underestimate the problem.' People who dined at the restaurant on Saturday, Sunday and Monday night have been affected. Customers have made formal complaints to Queensland Health and have bombarded the restaurant's Facebook page with angry comments. Amy Herbst, 18, was at the restaurant on Sunday with nine other family members for her grandmother's birthday. The family ate the banquet and all 10 got sick, with her father and cousin ending up in hospital. 'Seven of us got severely sick and the other three got it for 24 hours or so,' Ms Herbst told Daily Mail Australia. Contaminated egg products, including those in deep fried ice cream, are believed to have caused the outbreak . Patients have been presenting at Queensland emergency departments with extremely severe stomach cramps, exacerbated by dehydration . 'We're still exhausted, we're still all sick and it's just pretty upsetting. 'We've all had to take time off work and it's been really hard because it's been so severe.' A Logan council spokeswoman said a temporary closure was placed on the restaurant to ensure no further risk while the investigation is being completed. 'We also encourage people who would like to report any other alleged cases of illness to contact Queensland Health,' she said. The council and Metro South Health say the closure order doesn't mean the restaurant is to blame for the outbreak as it may have been supplied with contaminated food.","Authorities have shut down Chin Chin Chinese Restaurant in Springwood .

"Dogs only migrated to the Americas 10,000 years ago, thousands of years after the first human migrants crossed a land bridge from Siberia to North America, researchers have found. The biggest analysis so far of ancient dogs in the Americas looked at the genetic characteristics of 84 individual dogs from more than a dozen sites in North and South America . Researchers say studying our canine companions could even help explain human migration around the world - as they faithfully follow. Use the interactive map below to see how dogs arrived in the Americas . The Janey B. Goode site is located near the ancient city Cahokia (below), the largest and first known metropolitan area in North America. Occupation of the Janey B. Goode site occurred between 1,400 and 1,000 years ago, the researchers said, while Cahokia was active from about 1,000 to 700 years ago. Dozens of dogs were ceremonially buried at Janey B. Goode, suggesting that people there had a special reverence for dogs. While most of the dogs were buried individually, some were placed back-to-back in pairs. The findings appear in the Journal of Human Evolution. Unlike their wild wolf predecessors, ancient dogs learned to tolerate human company and generally benefited from the association: They gained access to new food sources, enjoyed the safety of human encampments and, eventually, traveled the world with their two-legged masters. Dogs also were pressed into service as beasts of burden, and sometimes were served as food, particularly on special occasions. Their 11,000- to 16,000-year association with humans makes dogs a promising subject for the study of ancient human behavior, including migratory behavior, said University of Illinois graduate student Kelsey Witt, who led the new analysis with anthropology professor Ripan Malhi. 'Dogs are one of the earliest organisms to have migrated with humans to every continent, and I think that says a lot about the relationship dogs have had with humans,' Witt said. 'They can be a powerful tool when you're looking at how human populations have moved around over time.' Human remains are not always available for study 'because living populations who are very connected to their ancestors in some cases may be opposed to the destructive nature of genetic analysis,' Witt said. Analysis of ancient dog remains is often permitted when analysis of human remains is not, she said. Previous studies of ancient dogs in the Americas focused on the dogs' mitochondrial DNA, which is easier to obtain from ancient remains than nuclear DNA and, unlike nuclear DNA, is inherited only from the mother. This means mitochondrial DNA offers researchers 'an unbroken line of inheritance back to the past,' Witt said. The new study also focused on mitochondrial DNA, but included a much larger sample of dogs than had been analyzed before. See interactive map. Molecular anthropologist Brian Kemp of Washington State University provided new DNA samples from ancient dog remains found in Colorado and British Columbia, and the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS) provided 35 samples from a site in southern Illinois known as Janey B. Goode, near present-day St. Louis. The Janey B. Goode site is located near the ancient city Cahokia, the largest and first known metropolitan area in North America. Occupation of the Janey B. Goode site occurred between 1,400 and 1,000 years ago, the researchers said, while Cahokia was active from about 1,000 to 700 years ago. Dozens of dogs were ceremonially buried at Janey B. Goode, suggesting that people there had a special reverence for dogs. While most of the dogs were buried individually, some were placed back-to-back in pairs. In Cahokia, dog remains, sometimes burned, are occasionally found with food debris, suggesting that dogs were present and sometimes were consumed. Dog burials during this time period are uncommon. Dogs are one of the earliest organisms to have migrated with humans to every continent . Dozens of dogs were ceremonially buried at Janey B. Goode, suggesting that people there had a special reverence for dogs. While most of the dogs were buried individually, some were placed back-to-back in pairs. As previous studies had done, the Illinois team analyzed genetic signals of diversity and relatedness in a special region (the hypervariable region) of the mitochondrial genome of ancient dogs from the Americas. The researchers found four never-before-seen genetic signatures in the new samples, suggesting greater ancient dog diversity in the Americas than previously thought. They also found unusually low genetic diversity in some dog populations, suggesting that humans in those regions may have engaged in dog breeding. In some samples, the team found significant genetic similarities with American wolves, indicating that some of the dogs interbred with or were domesticated anew from American wolves. But the most surprising finding had to do with the dogs' arrival in the Americas, Witt said. 'Dog genetic diversity in the Americas may date back to only about 10,000 years ago,' she said. 'This also is about the same time as the oldest dog burial found in the Americas,' Malhi said. 'This may not be a coincidence.' The current study, of only a small part of the mitochondrial genome, likely provides an incomplete picture of ancient dog diversity in the Americas, Malhi said. 'The region of the mitochondrial genome sequenced may mask the true genetic diversity of indigenous dogs in the Americas, resulting in the younger date for dogs when compared with humans,' he said. More studies of ancient dogs are in the works, the researchers said. Witt has already sequenced the full mitochondrial genomes of 20 ancient dogs, and more are planned to test this possibility, the researchers said. Many researchers believe the earliest dogs in the Americas were similar to the Dingo (pictured)","Biggest analysis so far of ancient dogs in the Americas looked at the genetic characteristics of 84 individual dogs .

"A couple who stole 17 poppy collections tins in the days before Remembrance Sunday have been warned they are facing prison. Heroin addicts Roma Taylor, 51, and Anthony Archer, 53, distracted shop staff and in some cases replaced the real tin with a dummy one to steal the Royal British Legion tins, a court heard. In a spree of thefts between October 28 and November 8 last year, the pair stole thousands of pounds of donations from the Poppy Appeal. Heroin addicts Roma Taylor (left) and Anthony Archer (right) have been warned they are facing jail after stealing 17 poppy tins in the run up to Remembrance Day . Caught on CCTV: Taylor was seen distracting the cashier as Archer cuts the wire securing a tin and hides it under his jacket . They had targeted shops across Essex including Colchester, Tiptree, Chelmsford and Maldon. Judge Christopher Ball QC, at Chelmsford Crown Court, said: 'The reports may help the sentencing judge find out what drives people to sink as low as this, to steal charity collection boxes in the days leading up to November 11. 'You are plainly at risk of a severe sentence because of the public abhorrence learning of a campaign like this to steal the Poppy Day money, which went on for a fortnight.' Victims and fundraisers have said there are relieved Taylor, of Tiptree, and Archer of Writtle, in Essex, will be jailed. Speaking after the hearing, Terry Sutton, president of the Colchester branch of the Royal British Legion, said: 'It's a shame when people have to go to the depths of stealing from old servicemen. Terry Sutton (pictured) president of the Colchester branch of the Royal British Legion, said he had no sympathy for the pair and was pleased police had been able to track them down and bring them to justice . 'I'm pleased the police have managed to catch them. 'I have got no sympathy them. Perhaps they deserve some time in prison to help them reform.' Archer and Taylor were remanded in custody and will be sentenced next month, once reports are prepared by the Probation Service. Frank O'Toole, mitigating, said they both were 'heavily addicted to heroin and have been for some considerable time.' One of the 17 shops targeted was West Mersea's Tates Spar shop. CCTV . The cashier was distracted by Taylor while Archer cut the wire on the tin and hid it under his jacket. Kevin Fisher, who is in charge of the food department, said: 'I'm not surprised they will be going to jail because it is a really low thing to do. 'You never know what is going to happen when things such as charity tins get stolen so I am really glad the police caught them. 'We are just glad we managed to help get them caught.' Sue Allen-Shepherd, Royal British Legion appeal organiser in Tiptree, said the charity received an anonymous donation of £500 to make up for the thefts. She said: 'It's very sad thing that people steal from charities. 'We don't know their circumstances, whether they are straight forwardly dishonest or desperate for money but it's difficult to believe this kind of thing happens. 'Obviously they had cottoned on to it and they chose a year when people were being very generous. It's the static collections in shops which are vulnerable.' The couple stole thousands of pounds from last year's Poppy Appeal (pictured) which marked 100 years since the beginning of the First World War . Sholto Morton, 79, Poppy Appeal organiser in the Maldon areas said he was delighted the two thieves had been caught. He said: 'The police are to be congratulated for catching them. A prison sentence seems appropriate and we certainly hope that this doesn't happen again.' Most shops secure collection tins to the counter, but Mr Morton said he will not put additional security measures into place. He said: 'Short of having a chain on every one, which is going a bit over the top.' Despite the thefts Mr Morton's collectors had a record year, collecting £34,000 as the Poppy Appeal marked 100 years since the beginning of the First World War. Asda supermarket and Millins butchers, both Church Road, Tiptree, were also targeted.","Roma Taylor and Anthony Archer admitted taking Royal British Legion tins .

"Musicians who want to write a chart-topping song need to move in a different musical direction than the pack, research has revealed. More than 25,000 songs on the Billboard 100 from 1958 to 2013 were analysed as part of the study of audio attributes. It found the key to a hit song was that it should sound different from anything else in the charts, but not so distant that it puts music fans off. Adele's number one song Someone Like You, Simon and Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Water, and Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, all hit the top spot because they were distinct from other songs around at the time. Adele's number one song Someone Like You hit the top spot because it was different from other songs around at the time . The graph shows that songs in the top 20 show the least amount of conventionality out of any section of the Billboard Hot 100 over time . Researchers discovered that songs that faltered in the middle of the Billboard 100 were most likely to sound the same, whilst weird singles failed to make the charts at all. The study was carried out by Noah Askin, professor of Organizational Behaviour at INSEAD, in Paris, and Michael Mauskapf, a PHD student in Management and Organisations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, in Chicago. They used Spotify's audio analysis program, The Echo Nest, to examine the singles and created a new metric called Song Conventionality. As part of the study they examined 11 attributes of each song, including danceability, duration, key, temp and acousticness. Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You and Simon and Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Water also went to number one because they stood out . The number one song is the least conventional of the top 10. The top 10 are less conventional than the top 20 . 'Songs that are slightly less conventional than average tend to outperform their peers on the charts,' the pair added. The researchers found that songs that secured the coveted number one spot moved in a different musical direction and stood out from the pack of other musical releases. However, Mr Mauskapf and Mr Askin added:  'Nevertheless, predicting hit songs is nearly impossible to do, because performance is largely contingent on a song's relationship to other songs that are produced and released contemporaneously.'","More than 25,000 songs on the Billboard 100 over 55 years were analysed .

"Dressed from head to toe in black, two heavily armed gunmen emerge from their small black Citroen at 11.20am on a chilly and dry Paris day. One carries a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and both are armed with Kalashnikovs. A third man is in the car. Having abandoned the vehicle in the middle of the tree-lined street, the pair make their way towards the door of No 6, Rue Nicolas-Appert. How the attack unfolded: This graphic shows the route taken by the gunmen who stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo at about 11.25am . ‘Is this Charlie Hebdo?’ they scream at two unassuming maintenance workers. The men tell them the office of the satirical magazine is two doors down and the gunmen move on, but not before shooting dead one of the workers – the first of their 12 victims. According to tweets from Yves Cresson, who works for the media production company Bayoo next door, the two attackers initially walked into his office. ‘Taking advantage of the postwoman, two armed men wearing balaclavas entered our offices,’ he tweeted. ‘They were looking for Charlie.’ 11.25am: Terror of the young mother and her daughter . Florence Pouvil, a sales assistant who worked opposite the Charlie Hebdo offices, said: ‘I saw two people with big guns, like Kalashnikovs, outside our office and then we heard firing. We were very confused. There were two guys who came out of the building and shot everywhere. We hid on the floor, we were terrified. ‘They came from the building opposite with big guns. We feared for our lives so we hid under our desks so they wouldn’t see us. Both men were dressed in black from head to toe and their faces were covered so I didn’t see them. ‘They were wearing military clothes, it wasn’t common clothing, like they were soldiers.’ Threatened: Corinne Rey was forced to give gunmen the magazine's entry code . An estate agent said that before entering the building, the attackers approached another man in the street, saying, ‘Tell the media that this is Al Qaeda in Yemen.’ Arriving at No 10 – the offices of Charlie Hebdo – the two men approach Corinne Rey, a cartoonist who is arriving at work with her young daughter, having just picked her up from kindergarten. The gunmen force the terrified woman, also known to her friends as ‘Coco’, to punch in the four-digit security code allowing them access to the magazine’s office. Miss Rey was frogmarched upstairs with her daughter. The pair hid underneath a desk during the subsequent chaos. Miss Rey said: ‘They said they wanted to go up to the offices, so I tapped in the code. ‘They shot on Wolinski, Cabu… it lasted five minutes. I took shelter under a desk. They spoke perfect French. They said they were from Al Qaeda.’ 11.35am: It’s like a butcher’s – there are so many dead . Inside the magazine’s modern building, on the second floor, reporters and editors are holding their morning news conference. One witness, who was in an office across the corridor, said she heard ‘a huge boom’. ‘Then someone opened the door to our office and asked where Charlie Hebdo was. He had a rifle. We backed away,’ she said. Inside the office, the men call out the names of their targets before shooting them dead. Among those killed were Stephane Charbonnier, 47, the magazine’s editor; his police bodyguard; renowned cartoonists Georges Wolinski, 80, Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac, 57, and Jean Cabut, along with 68-year-old writer Bernard Maris. Laurent Léger, a Charlie Hebdo writer, managed to sound the alarm and make a phone call at 11.40am. He told a friend: ‘Call the police. It’s carnage, a bloodbath. Everyone is dead.’ Then the line went dead. A police source said the two ‘calm and determined gunmen’ went directly up to the editorial room and knew their target. ‘It was Charb they were targeting. The two attackers looked for him in the room, shouting, “Where is Charb? Where is Charb?” They killed him then sprayed everyone else.’ Amid the carnage, one journalist texted a friend to say: ‘I’m alive. There is death all around me. The jihadists spared me.’ Others took refuge on the roof, including Benoit Bringer, a journalist whose office is next door. ‘There were very many people in the building,’ he said. ‘We evacuated via the roof just next to the office.’ Witnesses said the pair cried ‘we have avenged the prophet’ and ‘Allahu akbar’ (God is greatest) as they left. Another said: ‘It’s like a butcher’s inside there now. There are so many dead.’ 11.50am: Police arrive on bicycles – then a firefight . The gunmen return to the street – apparently as calmly as they had arrived. From his position on the roof, Mr Bringer said he saw them emerge from the office. ‘Three policemen arrived by pushbike,’ he said, ‘but they left naturally as the attackers were armed.’ The gunmen climb back into their Citroen as more police arrive on the scene and a firefight ensues. The killers fire at the police car, shooting more than a dozen times. A police spokesman, Rocco Contente, said the men ‘appeared to have opened fire on everyone. ‘It was carnage, absolute butchery.’ As they drive away, the gunmen come across another police car in the street. They get out and spray the car with bullets as its wounded driver desperately reverses back up the street. The reversing police car crashes into a parked car and the wounded officer staggers from his vehicle. Distressing video footage shows two of the attackers getting out of the vehicle and opening fire on the officer from about 20 yards away. He falls to the floor, his arms out – apparently pleading for mercy. Among those killed were Stephane Charbonnier, 47, the magazine’s editor (left) and cartoonist Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac, 57 (right) Jean Cabut, also known as Cabu, (left) and economist and contributor Bernard Maris (right) were also among the 12 victims killed yesterday . Cartoonist Philippe Honore (left) was a regular contributor who was killed as well as Michel Renaud (right) who was guest editing the magazine . They advance towards him, rifles on their shoulders. One of the gunmen, who is slightly in front of the other, casually breaks into a jog, and shoots the wounded policeman in the head at close range before walking back to the car shouting: ‘We have avenged the Prophet Mohammed, we have killed Charlie Hebdo.’ One of the gunmen bends down to pick up a shoe before getting in the car, which speeds away. At the magazine’s offices, a man emerges crying. ‘They are all dead,’ he says, desperately pleading with bystanders to call the police. Gérald Kierzec, 40, a casualty doctor on duty at Hôtel Dieu, was among the first on the scene. Georges Wolinksi, pictured with his wife, was one of the cartoonists shot dead . ‘I could see this was a military-style attack,’ he said. ‘There was a first body lying in the lobby. Then I took the stairs which were covered in blood. ‘When I got to the second floor, there were bodies lying one on top of another. ‘It was carnage with war wounds. There was blood everywhere. ‘These were Kalashnikov injuries with huge bullets that create huge trauma in the victims’ faces and chests. They literally explode. As a civilian doctor who deals with car accidents and the like, I have never seen anything like it in my career, so many wounded by gunfire. This was clearly a terror strike.’ Some survivors are taken to Hotel Dieu. They were visited by President Francois Hollande, who left in a car with blacked-out windows. Other victims were taken to Pitie Salpetriere, the hospital where Princess Diana died in 1997. Elsewhere on the street, there was terror. Fradji Guez said his four-month-old granddaughter Joanne was in the nursery near the Charlie Hebdo offices. ‘The staff heard the shooting and were so frightened that they hid the children under the cots,’ he said. ‘They were utterly terrified. It’s horrific.’ Noon: They steal another car – but spare a dog . Offices of French media, including Le Monde, the country’s main newspaper, are put under police protection. The terror alert in France is raised to high. Driving away at high speed, the Citroen ran down a pedestrian, who is reported to be in a serious condition. The attackers made it as far as the junction of Rue Sadi-Lecointe and Rue de Meaux, in the 19th Arrondissement, not far from the Place de Stalingrad, before abandoning the damaged car and hijacking another. A witness said: ‘They pulled a man, around 60, out of the car behind, a grey Renault Clio. The guy said, “Wait, let me have my dog!” They let him get his dog before they drove off. The police arrived five minutes later.’ 4.30pm: Possible hideout searched by police . Anti-terrorist police search a possible hideout used by the attackers. The rented flat is situated in the north-east Paris suburb of Pantin. There were no arrests. 5pm: Thousands gather to mourn the victims . As night falls, thousands start gathering in central Paris in protest and solidarity against the killings. At the Place De La Republique, mourners lit candles spelling the word ‘Charlie’. One woman said: ‘It’s hard to describe. Wolinski was, well, he was France’s cartoonist. It is like someone has come to kill Dali, Picasso – all in one go. They have killed the satire, the “patrimoine”, the heritage. This is one of Paris’s saddest days.’ 'Massacre': Two masked gunmen brandishing Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers attack the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo office .

"Hundreds of patients could suffer impaired vision after receiving eye surgery by a high street optician, experts fear. Safety concerns have been raised over a type of replacement lens implanted in patients by Optical Express, the UK’s leading commercial eye surgery provider. More than 6,500 British patients are thought to have received the Mplus X lens, manufactured by German company Oculentis, which went on sale just over a year ago. Oculentis and Optical Express both deny any fault with the lens, which is used in a corrective procedure called refractive lens exchange to fix minor sight problems usually associated with age. But leading eye surgeons have contacted the Medical Health Regulatory Authority after their patients complained of severe loss of vision after receiving the implant. Moorfields Eye Hospital in London flagged the problem to the MHRA after two of its surgeons complained about the lens. Scientific study: A spokesman for Optical Express said every lens type that its uses has passed a 'rigorous and time-consuming evaluation to make sure that it is both safe and effective' Charlie Jackson: Paid £4,200 for eye surgery . At 46, Charlie Jackson needed reading glasses for detailed work and had noticed his long vision was going. Two minor operations later and he can barely see six inches in front of his face. The company director, from Henley-on-Thames, went into an Optical Express branch in Reading to enquire about £700 laser eye surgery so he would no longer need glasses. A short while later he had parted with £4,200, having been persuaded he needed to have the lenses in both eyes replaced with high-tech plastic discs. ‘They really gave me the hard sell,’ Mr Jackson said. ‘They kept saying I would have “HD vision”.’ But he claims he can no longer focus on anything more than five inches away, requires bright lights in the house and struggles to see at night. A spokesman for Optical Express said: ‘Mr Jackson is in the very early post-operative phase and with additional management his symptoms will subside and he will be able to fully enjoy his new vision without spectacles for distance or near vision.’ Nick Grant of law firm Devonshires, who is representing the patients, said he anticipated that he would reach 100 concerned patients very shortly. There has been a sales culture at Optical Express where there has, on occasions, been a failure to properly explain the risks of surgery to patients.’ Private surgeon Sheraz Daya, who runs the Centre For Sight, called for far better regulation of High Street corrective eye clinics. Mr Daya said: ‘The major problem here is that model of care is “pile them high, sell them cheap”. You have eye surgery being sold in heavily marketed, time-limited offers. These are complicated procedures, but they are being sold like they are TVs or second-hand cars. ‘The regulations are there but they are not being enforced.’ Sasha Rodoy, 61, who has been campaigning for better regulation of the corrective surgery industry, said: ‘The only reason anybody should have these operations is if it is the only option that will stop them going blind. They are just not safe.’ A spokesman for Moorfields Eye Hospital said: ‘Two surgeons had used these lenses in a very small number of patients, some of whom developed visual problems and required replacement of the lens. ‘Moorfields reported concerns with this particular make of lens via the MHRA’s yellow card scheme. Moorfields Eye Hospital no longer uses this lens.’ A spokesman for the MHRA said: ‘We are currently investigating and will take action if necessary. If patients have any questions they should speak to their optometrist or surgeon.’ Worries: Moorfields Eye Hospital (pictured) in London flagged the problem to the MHRA after two of its surgeons complained about the lens . A spokesman for Optical Express said: ‘Every lens type that we use has passed a rigorous and time-consuming evaluation to make sure that it is both safe and effective. Commercial eye clinics are regulated by the Care Quality Commission, but experts claim the organisation takes only a general overview. Sheraz Daya, a leading eye surgeon, said tonight that the CQC should establish far stricter inspections and monitoring. He also called for new guidelines limiting refractive lens exchange in commercial corrective sight procedures to people aged over 50. 'This includes the MPlus X lens, which is being used here in the UK by many providers and around the world. ‘It is vitally important to stress that there have been no safety concerns whatsoever expressed about this lens. 'A tiny minority of patients are reported to have experienced poorer than expected distance vision, but the overwhelming majority have had their sight and their life significantly improved by having this lens implanted.’ A spokesman for Oculentis confirmed the firm had received four ‘incident reports’ from the MHRA. He added: ‘We are currently in the process of analysing the facts, as all of these reports are very unspecific and unsubstantiated, only basically mentioning poor distance vision as the main complaint. ‘The MplusX is considered to be one of the better balanced intraocular lenses available and is used by many renowned surgeons whose opinions are generally based on medical evidence. We believe very strongly in the concept and it is by no means a “faulty” model of lens.’","Safety concerns raised over replacement lens used by Optical Express .

"Prince Andrew is a 't**s and bums man' who is prone to making spectacularly inappropriate comments about women, a former acquaintance has claimed. The source said Andrew often breached the bounds of social acceptance with his remarks - including one that left a pregnant woman 'ashen-faced' with shock. 'He has always been a t**s and bums man,' said the acquaintance. The claims came as historic pictures of the Prince re-emerged, showing him surrounded by topless women in tiny bikinis enjoying an end-of-year holiday back in 2001. The picture, it is understood, was taken while Andrew was on holiday in Phuket, Thailand, with his friend Jeffrey Epstein. Scroll down for video . Prince Andrew sits on a yacht in Thailand back in 2001, during a holiday at a £2,300-a-week resort which is thought to have come courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein . A former acquaintance of the Prince has said he is a 't**s and bums man' On this particular trip, the Prince was joined by Jacqui Hamilton-Smith, the daughter of Lord Colwyn, Nellee Hooper, 37, a Bristol-born record producer, Atomic Kitten singer Jenny Frost and socialite Normandie Keith. It is known Epstein and Andrew regularly holidayed together - from weekends at Balmoral and Sandringham, to trips to New York. Epstein was, the source told The Times, 'a big part of [Andrew's] life' - and pictures of the Duke surrounded by women thanks to the financier seem to have been par for the course. 'It would always be, ""Epstein is in town with the girls"", and everyone would raise their eyes to heaven and move on,' the source said. The unnamed source said, despite pictures like these of Andrew surrounded by people, he didn't have many friends . But Prince Andrew was close to Epstein for a number of years - although the source described the billionaire as an 'unsavoury' character . But the former acquaintance has also said the Prince is 'quite a bad chooser of friends', describing Epstein as 'a pretty unsavoury character'. Epstein was jailed in 2008 for 13 months on a charge of soliciting sex with an underage girl. The Duke's unfortunate friendship with Epstein has led him to be implicated in the latest scandal to hit the 61-year-old New Yorker. Virginia Roberts alleges she was forced to have sex with him in the US while aged 17 and working as a masseuse for Epstein. Epstein denies her claims that she was his 'sex slave'. The allegations – first revealed in US court documents last week, in which Miss Roberts, now 30, claimed she had been forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002 – have also been vehemently denied by Buckingham Palace. Yet despite the source's qualms over some of Andrew's 'schoolboy' humour - they claimed 'he made some completely inappropriate comment to someone who was pregnant and had massive boobs', they did not believe he was involved. 'You assumed some activity was happening, but I don't think any of us actually thought he [the duke] was involved.' Epstein and his then-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell - pictured here at Sandringham - were close friends of Andrew for a number of years . It is alleged it was Maxwell who introduced Prince Andrew and the then 17-year-old ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts, photographed here in 2001 . The source described Epstein as 'an unbelievable networker' - and told The Times he was the Duke's intellectual superior. 'I don't know if he liked him or not. He probably didn't. He probably thought he was an absolute buffoon. But he was the son of the Queen. It probably came down to that,' said the source. For a while, however, the two men — and their mutual friend Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the media tycoon Robert Maxwell — were close. 'They were good friends. It is generally understood that he was going to these parties. But I still question whether he did what he was being accused of doing.' What got him into trouble [in 2011], said the acquaintance, was Andrew's 'foolishness and naivety, and arrogance — and hoping to have some fun'. 'A heady mix. Whereas Epstein is much more manipulative and calculating.' An American journalist has revealed she tried to expose Jeffrey Epstein's predatory behaviour 11 years ago - but Vanity Fair refused to print it. Vicky Ward, a contributing editor at the magazine for 11 years, was asked to profile the billionaire back in 2003. In a blog for The Daily Beast, Ms Ward - who describes Epstein as a 'Gatsby-esque character' - describes how she was made uncomfortable almost immediately. 'Epstein had invited me to an off-the-record tea at his Upper East Side house (during which I distinctly remember he rudely ate all the finger food himself) and then had his assistant call to tell me he’d thought I was pretty,' she recalls. But it wasn't the unwanted compliment which worried her: it was - among other things - a conversation she had with a mother of a 16-year-old Epstein had allegedly molested. 'He’d gotten to them because of his money,' Ms Ward wrote, adding: 'The girls’ mother told me by phone that she had thought her daughters would be safe under Epstein’s roof, not least because he phoned her to reassure her, and she also knew he had Ghislaine Maxwell with him at all times.' But when she tried to include the account in her final piece, it was pulled. A Vanity Fair spokesman told the Daily Beast the decision was taken because “Epstein denied the charges at the time and since the claims were unsubstantiated and no criminal investigation had been initiated, we decided not to include them in what was a financial story”. But Ms Ward - who said Epstein had 'a way of spooking you' - says it wasn't a financial piece - adding: 'it has often struck me that if my piece had named the women, the FBI might have come after Epstein sooner and perhaps some of his victims, now, in the latest spate of allegations, allegedly either paid off or too fearful of retribution to speak up, would have been saved.'

"Scientists have developed a device that could map a room simply by shining a laser through a keyhole . Looking through the keyhole could soon reveal far more than you imagine. Scientists have developed a device that could map an entire room simply by shining a laser through a 2cm gap. The system could be used in applications such as firefighting, battlefield surveillance and disaster recovery operations. The technology is the work of Harbin Institute of Technology in China and is based on a laser that can see around corners, according to a report by Jacob Aron at the New Scientist. The system worked by firing ultrafast laser pulses at walls 'behind' an area that can't be seen, to capture a ghostly 3D reflection. The technique is similar to using a mirror to see round a corner - but instead of a mirror, the 'reflection' is reconstructed from laser light that scatters back off a wall. The camera 'times' the beams of light as they bounce back to its sensors, and builds an image, which is slightly wobbly, but precise to ranges of just one centimetre. The group’s latest project has built on this technology to measure the 3D shape and position of three cardboard letters, spelling HIT, through a 2cm hole in a wall. But in this set up time, the light returning from the object passes through the hole and on to another wall, which then scatters light into the camera. However, the technique may not work as well the real world. In this study the letters were coated in reflective material and the rest of the room was covered in black cloth. Last year, British scientists used a similar technique to create a camera that can peer round corners without the aid of a mirror. By taking pictures at the speed of light, the device could reveal hidden objects .

Last year, British scientists used a similar technique to create a camera that can peer round corners without the aid of a mirror. By taking pictures at the speed of light, the device could reveal hidden objects – from people, to parked cars, to military tanks. The device, created by Jonathan Leach, of Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University, is made up of a laser, a super-fast camera which sits beside it and a computer. To see something that is around a corner, the laser is pointed so that its light ricochets off a wall and onto the hidden object. Some of this light will automatically bounce back off the object and back onto the wall and a tiny fraction will go back towards the camera. The camera in this device takes 15 billion shots a second, making it fast enough to catch the reflected light. A computer then uses the amount of time the light spent travelling to the camera and the pattern of the reflections to work out the shape of the object and how far away it is. The technology could be used by the military (graphic, pictured), by rescue teams searching for survivors in collapsed buildings or mines, or simply by motorists who struggle to reverse park .","System could be used in battlefield surveillance and disaster recovery .

"A billboard company is suing a couple in rural Pennsylvania for their 'protests' over a brightly lit sign which have allegedly driven away six advertisers. Oliver Outdoor Advertising claims it has lost $50,000 in revenue due to Andrew and Patricia Colberg's constant complaining. The couple allegedly called advertisers asking them to pull ads from the billboard near their home on Butler Road in West Kittanning stating that the light made it difficult for them to sleep at night. A billboard company is suing a couple in rural Pennsylvania for their 'protests' over a brightly lit sign (pictured) which have allegedly driven away six advertisers . In total, they reportedly contacted 18 of Oliver Outdoor Advertising's clients with six complying to their request. They also complained to local officials with the hope of pushing through legislation to regulate outdoor adverts. However, any new direction would not help the Colbergs as it would only address signs erected in the future. 'There's nothing we can do to existing signs,' said Kittanning Borough Council President Bob Venesky. Source of the problem: Andrew and Patricia Colberg allegedly called advertisers asking them to pull ads from the billboard near their home on Butler Road in West Kittanning stating that the light made it difficult  to sleep . In light of Oliver Outdoor Advertising's filing last month, the Colbergs now plan on counter suing. This would be the only way they could get the billboard -  installed in 2012 - removed. According to Tribune Live, the counterclaim will also request that the  Colbergs be compensated for legal fees and aggravation. The couple's attorney, Gregory Swank, believes that Oliver Outdoor Advertising's case 'lacks merit'. 'The Colbergs haven't interfered with Oliver's business - they were just talking to people about this situation,' he said.

"A father who died after his car hit a wild boar in darkness on the M4 has been named as a popular Girl Guiding volunteer. Raymond Green's death was described as a 'tragedy for the whole town' of Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, where neighbours said he had lived with his wife and two children for several years. He was killed instantly after his black Seat Ibiza hit the animal - the first seen in Wiltshire since 2009 - between junctions 16 and 17 of the motorway near Swindon before being hit by a lorry. A man died after a car crash on the M4 near Chippenham involving a wild boar that strayed onto the road . Liz Radford, District Commissioner for Royal Wootton Bassett Girlguiding, said Mr Green became involved with the charity when his daughter joined as a member. The charity raised more than £20,000 and helped build an extension to the group’s guide hut. 'He chaired our Friends of Guiding Committee and was responsible for overseeing the upkeep of the building for many years,' said Ms Radford. 'Thanks to Ray’s efforts hundreds of girls were able to enjoy the fun, friendship and adventure of guiding in a safe environment. 'We were extremely saddened to hear of Ray's passing and our thoughts are with his family at this sad time.' Royal Wootton Bassett’s deputy mayor Ian Ferries added: ‘The whole thing is a tragedy, both for his family and for the town as a whole. ‘He and his wife have been involved in youth organisations for many years. Not only is the family going to suffer, the town is going to suffer too. ‘The motto of the town is “we honour those who serve” and it’s not just military people, it’s people who serve the community, which he has done.’ Wild boar numbers have risen in nearby Forest of Dean and a wild one may have been involved in the crash . Mr Green lived in a quiet cul-de-sac in the town with his wife and two children in their early 20s, according to neighbours. One said: 'They've been there a long time. It's just so sad. Absolutely dreadful. 'My neighbour came around last night and asked if I'd heard the news. Its just such an awful thing to happen. 'They have got two children who I believe are older, university age.' The accident, which took place just before 7pm on Monday, happened less than two miles from a farm which has bred 200 wild boar. Wild boar were hunted to extinction in Britain several centuries ago. But their population has started to rise again after several programmes to reintroduce them in the last fifteen years. There are now thriving herds spreading out into the countryside. Boar are usually secretive and nocturnal and are likely to stay out of the way of humans. When fully grown a wild boar weighs around 20 stone and can jump 6ft. They can also travel large distances and reach speeds of 30mph. In medieval times, boar from the Royal Forest were supplied for the Royal table - there is a record of an order for 100 boars and sows for a Christmas feast in 1254. Boar are known to inhabit parts of the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean. The animals have roamed wild in the Forest of Dean in 2004, after a 700 year absence. They started to populate the wild in 1999 after several escaped from a farm and in 2004 a group of 60 were dumped - further boosting wild populations. Since then the population has grown steadily - with complaints about them digging up graveyards, gardens and grass verges. Farming of wild boar in Britain became fashionable in the 1970s and boar originating from the European mainland were kept under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. However police and owners of the Real Boar Company said the animal involved in the accident was not from the site. After the car hit the animal it was then struck by a white Renault articulated lorry, police said. The motorway was closed for eight hours until 1am on Tuesday. Sergeant Steven Love said: 'This is a truly tragic incident and my thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim. 'It is quite rare for a wild boar to be on the carriageway of the motorway. It is more common for the police to receive calls involving horses or deer but each is equally dangerous to motorists. 'This was a particularly large wild animal and would have caused considerable damage to any vehicle. 'I would appeal for anyone with any information about the incident to contact us as soon as possible.' The driver of the car was killed instantly and the lorry driver did not suffer any serious injuries in the accident. The boar is also thought to have died in the crash. Populations of wild boar have risen recently, particularly in the Forest of Dean where the animals have caused havoc by digging up a cemetery and damaging a roadside verge. There are fears populations of the wild pigs are rising out of control after a number of recent incidents where they have invaded and destroyed playgrounds and football pitches. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said that officers were baffled as to how the wild boar came to be wandering in the motorway - with the nearest colonies thought to be in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire and in East Sussex. The last time a wild boar was seen in Wiltshire was on the on the A365 in December 2009. Wild boar were hunted almost to extinction but have started to return to the UK in the last 15 years, with populations growing in the Cotswolds and Forest of Dean - near the crash site. They can run up to 30mph and weigh around 20 stone when fully grown. The animals can also jump 6ft. Simon Gaskell, who owns the Real Boar Company that breeds the animal for salami, said: 'Wild boar do travel and they are prepared to travel quite a distance. It's only a matter of time before they start causing trouble. 'It wasn't one of ours involved. They are all behind a big fence. I have heard of boar coming up from the Forest of Dean though. They would have been here about three to four hundred years ago but they are not common any more. 'You always here rumours of them being around though. It's not very often they're spotted here. It's much more common in Devon and Cornwall where it's much quieter. In the area we've always tried to keep them away for this very reason. Residents in Lydney in the Forest of Dean had their gardens damaged by the beasts last year . 'This incident is one of those horrific things that happens when they are around. Boar are very hard and very dense.' A children's playground was left destroyed in November after a herd of wild boar grazed on the land in the Forest of Dean for two months. Homeowners in Lydney also reported damage to their gardens. Rangers say the Forest of Dean wild boar population is doubling every year thanks to the spread of commercial crops such as maize. In 2013 people living in and around the Forest of Dean said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby. Wild boar dug up land where the ashes of loved ones were scattered at the Pan Tod Beacon beauty spot on Ruardean Hill outside Cinderford. The animals also destroyed grass verges in the area and in 2013 the Forestry Commission announced a cull on the population. In 2008 one had to be shot at Ruardean Primary School and two years later the animals destroyed a football pitch.","Raymond Green died after his car hit animal on motorway in Wiltshire .

"We are sitting in the dining room of Le Chateau de Bel Ombre. The doors are thrown open to the night and a warm breeze carries the whisper of surf. 'Oh, look - a shooting star!' our nine-year-old daughter exclaims. A definite winter warmer: Mauritius is a guaranteed escape zone for those seeking to flee January in Britain . It's like a miniature, tropical Versailles. The estate has existed for centuries, but until recently it was being put to a more workaday use. Much has been written about the perils of sugar dependency. The Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, on which the enchanting chateau is to be found, knows this well. It is trying to kick a 350-year-old habit. The Dutch introduced sugar here in the 17th century, and almost all the island's agricultural land was once under cane. More then half of it still is. A place of dramatic contours: Mauritius's ruggedness is summed up by the mountainous bulk of Le Pouce . But the EU's preferential import agreements are about to end. Mauritius knows that the plant which dominates its human history has had its day. Tourism will have to shoulder a greater economic burden. So on arrival at the island's international airport, after an agreeable overnight flight, my wife, two primary school-age daughters and I are confronted with a brand-new terminal which cost a cool $300 million (£192 million). It's the largest structure ever built on the former British colony. It is also rather beautiful, having been designed to resemble the traveller's palm tree. Passenger numbers are set to double. At least, that is what the Mauritian government hopes. It is a long way to travel, but for a young family there is much to do on the verdant land and reef-protected lagoon. The natives are super-hospitable and child-doting and, as we are told more than once, there's 'nothing that will kill you' on the island. A place in the sun: Richard stayed amid the luxury of the Heritage The Villas complex on Mauritius . That promise has drawn an Anglo-French crowd with a smattering of South Africans and, more significantly perhaps, newly rich Chinese on a recently opened direct service from Beijing. The rugged and relatively undeveloped south-west coast of the island lies an hour's drive from the spiffy terminal. Here, the ocean pounds the offshore reef which surrounds the 330km (205m) coastline with a particular intensity. And it's here, between the Savanne mountains and the sea, that you will find the Domaine de Bel Ombre. Established by French settlers in 1765, the estate today is some 19 sq miles of hillside, plain and coast. The colonnaded mansion where we dine dates from the 19th century, and for much of its previous existence stood at the heart of a huge cane plantation. Bel Ombre's factory closed in 1999 and the Mauritian owners diversified into pineapples, potatoes, peanuts and palms. Cane is still grown, but has to be harvested by machete, as the rolling hills are unsuitable for machines. It takes 14 sticks of cane to produce just one cup of brown sugar. The rest of the land has been turned into a five-star resort which encompasses several hotels, private luxury villas for sale or rent, a championship golf course, a top end health spa, all-day kids' club and, best of all for me, an exquisite nature reserve. Full of character, charm and grace: Le Chateau de Bel Ombre oozes a classic colonial charm . First, let's deal with the basics. The white sand beach is dotted with palm trees and swimming pools are posh and plentiful. We are staying in a five-bedroom villa with an infinity pool which offers a view across open country to the mountains. Our golf buggy is parked outside, so we can better traverse the vast estate. The girls are thrilled. To our mild embarrassment, we find we also have a butler called Brando, a tremendously efficient lad. We allow him to run us a bubble bath. He also excels himself as the major-domo of a barbecue on our verandah. The family tries kite-surfing in the shallow lagoon. One memory will be of our eight-year-old daughter being yanked into the air as the wind catches her mini-kite. On another day we take a motorboat through the gap in the reef and on to the high seas. We cruise westwards towards the dramatic Le Morne peninsula, a Word Heritage Site, watching a pod of dolphins and a school of flying fish. In the end, the natural world trumps the extravagant luxury. Almost 200 years ago the Irish botanist and humanitarian Charles Telfair was active in Bel Ombre, easing the plight of plantation slaves while recording and shaping the island's flora. Most of what lives in Mauritius today - from the people to the trees - was imported from every corner of the empire. Telfair transplanted bananas from China, lending a specimen of the fruit to William Cavendish, the 6th Duke of Devonshire. Today the Cavendish banana is the most popular variety in our shops. Fly and flop - or not: The former sugar plantation has been transformed into a holiday haven, with golf course . My highlight of the trip is a jeep safari through the 1,300-hectare Frederica Nature Reserve. It is like a cross between the Devon hills and the forests of Asia. Pheasants and quail run before us among papaya trees; above us fly mynah birds, fruit bats and giant dragonflies. We come across the chimney and mill wheels of a sugar mill abandoned in 1877. We swim under a waterfall and spot Javanese deer across a glen, then reach the highest point on the estate and the lush world opens up beneath, the white smile of the reef and the ocean beyond. What a sight.

"Chilling details have emerged in the fatal shooting of a teenage boy by his younger sisters as both girls, aged 15 and 11, were charged with murder. Misty 'Ariel' Kornegay, 15, allegedly fatally shot her older brother with a gun that their parents had locked up while they were away with the help of her 11-year-old sister Nicole. The pair then took off from the home, authorities in Florida said on Wednesday.

The older girl got the gun from a room that her parents had locked, Smith said, after the parents left the children home alone for days. The two Florida sisters have been charged with murder. But a motive for the shooting, in the town of fewer than 800 people on the banks of the Suwannee River, remained unclear on Tuesday. 'There's no real rhyme or reason to it,' Smith told The Gainesville Sun. On Wednesday morning, the family home was still cordoned off by crime scene tape. The family lives off a dirt road in rural Columbia County. A red truck and a car were parked outside the house, parked near a lawn mower and a scattering of children's toys. Few other houses are nearby. White Springs police said they began looking for the girls late on Monday night after a tip from the mother of the younger sister's friend. The friend had received a 'weird phone call' from the girl, saying she had run away and needed someone to pick her up from a Dollar General store, according to a police report. When the woman arrived, she found the older sister there, too. Damien Kornegay, 16, was allegedly murdered by his little sisters in their home . The older girl remarked that something might have been wrong with another sibling at home, officers Brad Meeks and Joseph Dyess noted in their report. The teen told the officers that her parents weren't expected home until 5am on Tuesday. As she spoke, she applied makeup and 'would not maintain eye contact and appeared emotionless,' the officers wrote. But soon she started crying and told the officers that her brother had beaten her, thrown her into her bedroom, and locked the door. She told officers that when he went to sleep, her younger sister unlocked the door. The teen said she then shot her brother, according to the report. The teen told authorities the weapon was on a blanket in the hallway. Deputies found the brother dead in the living room. A younger sibling, age three, also was in the home at the time and was in state custody Wednesday. The agency is working with deputies to determine what happened and to help the surviving siblings, Department of Children and Families spokesman John Harrell told The Gainesville Sun. He said state law prohibited him from releasing details of any past incidents the family might have had with the department. Keith Kornegay, 37 and Misty Kornegay, 33, were out of town at the time of the shooting, but were arrested Tuesday on charges of child neglect for failing to supervise their children . The parents were charged with child neglect and are accused of failing to supervise in the treatment of children, Smith said. He said the father is a truck driver and the mother had left with him on a trip. The home had no recent history of visits from the sheriff's office, Smith said. Third Circuit State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister said he hasn't decided whether to charge the girls as adults. Children arrested for crimes and treated as juveniles can be held in detention for a maximum of 21 days, per state law. But the judge has granted an extra nine days in this case, Siegmeister said. 'Sometimes we can send them home after that, but in light of all of the facts in this case, we don't have any place to send the children,' Siegmeister told The Sun. 'I may be forced to actually charge them as adults to hold them in juvenile detention until I can work something out. I don't know all of the facts yet.' On Wednesday morning, the family home was still cordoned off by crime scene tape.

"President Barack Obama today condemned the 'cowardly, evil attack' on a satirical newspaper in France - two years after the White House questioned its judgment for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. Speaking from the Oval Office about the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, Obama said his thoughts were with the people of France, which he called 'America's oldest ally'. 'For us to see the kind of cowardly, evil attacks that took place today, I think reinforces once again why it's so important for us to stand in solidarity with them just as they stand in solidarity with us,' he said. The paper had been repeatedly threatened for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, and in 2012, the White House roundly criticized the paper for the cartoons. Scroll down for video . Support: President Obama spoke from the Oval Office on Wednesday (pictured) to offer his support to France following what he called an 'outrageous attack' on a satirical weekly newspaper on Wednesday morning . Somber: Obama spoke beside Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday . On September 19, 2012 then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney slammed the magazine's 'judgment' for publishing the artwork. 'We are aware that a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad, and obviously we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this,' Carney told reporters at a press briefing. 'We know these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential be be inflammatory,' he warned. On Wednesday, the president said that he would help France pursue those responsible for the attack on the journalists and, in turn, freedom of the press. 'The values that we share with the French people, of freedom of expression, is something that can't be silenced because of this senseless violence,' he said. He went on: 'We will stand with the people of France during this very, very difficult time.' Attack: A victim of the shooting at Charlie Hedbo's offices in Paris on Wednesday is taken to an ambulance . Masked gunmen stormed the office of the satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday and asked for the editor and certain staff members by name before killing them. The attackers then escaped in a stolen car and remain at large. Twelve people were killed, in what is France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades. Footage also apparently shows a police officer being shot in the street as he begs for mercy. Charlie Hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and other controversial sketches. Among the victims were four of France's most revered cartoonists - Stephane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and Jean Cabut - who were behind the images. Witnesses said the killers were heard shouting 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' as they stalked the building. Investigation: Forensic experts examine the car believed to have been used as the escape vehicle by the gunmen who opened fire on the newspaper, killing 12 people, on Wednesday . A little more than two years ago, the administration roundly criticized Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons that enraged the Islamists responsible for Wednesday's attack. On September 19, 2012 then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney slammed the magazine's 'judgment' for publishing the artwork. 'We are aware that a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the prophet Muhammad, and obviously we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this,' Carney told reporters at a press briefing. 'We know these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential be be inflammatory,' he warned. The White House did not immediately respond on Wednesday to questions about its about-face in defending the magazine. Ten people are also believed to have been wounded, four critically, including journalists, administrative staff, and police officers who attended the scene. President Francois Hollande described the bloodbath as a 'barbaric attack against France and against journalists' and vowed to hunt down those responsible. At a press conference on Wednesday morning, House Speaker John Boehner added: 'This vicious terror attack is a reminder that we must always be vigilant against the enemies of freedom.' Secretary of State John Kerry said that the U.S. stands with its ally in solidarity and that the U.S. is committed to working with France to confront extremism and promote the cause that extremists fear: Freedom - or 'la liberte'. Kerry, who has family ties to France, has visited Paris more than any other foreign city as America's top diplomat. In earlier television interviews, Obama press secretary Josh Earnest also cautioned that the attack was still in the initial stages of investigation. 'We're at the very early stages of what happened and who was responsible,' Earnest said. He said it is known that there are 'strong ties' between the al Qaeda terrorist network and the Islamic State extremists. 'We obviously are trying to monitor what we consider to be a very important threat,' he said. Together: Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. is committed to working with France against extremism . 'This is an attack on the basic freedoms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press,' he said. A senior official from the Department of Homeland Security said they are 'closely monitoring' the situation. 'DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,' the official said. Intelligence agencies are also scrambling to see if they missied warnings of a terrorist attack against France, a senior U.S. official told CNN. But officials have so far found 'nothing that matches'. The official said they do not believe the attack suggests further attacks against Americans the U.S. 'Our major concern is to quickly identify the individuals involved,' the official said. On Twitter, the U.S. embassy in France said it has 'no plans to close or limit access' to the embassy or other diplomatic facilities.","President Obama offered support to 'America's oldest ally' in the aftermath of the shooting at a satirical French newspaper on Wednesday .

"Many pools ask swimmers to shower before getting in the water, and a new study has highlighted the grim reality of why this is. Tests on water collected from indoor swimming pools in the US discovered that everyday pharmaceuticals, such as makeup, could be reacting in a harmful way with the chlorine in the pool. The analysis found traces of chemicals typically found in skin care products, insect repellent and flame retardants, all of which have the potential to be ingested by swimmers. Tests on water collected from indoor swimming pools in the US discovered that everyday pharmaceuticals, such as makeup, could be reacting in a harmful way with the chlorine in the pool. The analysis found traces of chemicals found in skin care products and insect repellent that have potential to be ingested by swimmers . Chlorine is added to swimming pool water to keep it clear of certain bacteria. Previous research has shown that elements of urine including urea, uric acid, and amino acids, interact with chlorine to produce potentially hazardous disinfection by-products in swimming pools. And this new research suggests chemicals from pharmaceuticals and personal care products, or PPCPs, could be causing a similar effect. ‘The whole motivation for examining pharmaceuticals and personal care products is that there is this unknown potential for them to bring about undesired or unexpected effects in an exposed population,’ said Professor Ernest Blatchley from the Lyles School of Civil Engineering and the Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering at Purdue University. Chlorine is added to swimming pool water to keep it clear of certain bacteria. But previous research has shown that elements of urine including urea, uric acid, and amino acids, interact with chlorine to produce potentially hazardous disinfection by-products in swimming pools. The disinfection by-products included cyanogen chloride (CNCl) and trichloramine (NCl3). Cyanogen chloride is a toxic compound that affects many organs, including the lungs, heart and central nervous system by inhalation. Trichloramine has been associated with acute lung injury in accidental, occupational, or recreational exposures to chlorine-based disinfectants. This research suggested that about 93 per cent of uric acid introduced to pools comes from human urine. ‘There are literally thousands of chemicals from pharmaceuticals and personal care products that could be getting into swimming pool water.’ A research group led by Ching-Hua Huang, a professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, recently developed a technique that identifies and quantifies 32 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water. ‘Because professor Huang had already developed an analytical method, we thought, “Why not use it and see what we find in swimming pools?” said Professor Blatchley. Water samples were taken from indoor swimming pools in Indiana and Georgia. Of the 32 chemicals investigated, the researchers detected three in particular. The first was N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, known as Deet, and is an active ingredient in insect repellants. Caffeine was also detected, as was tri(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP). ‘The other 29 could have been present at concentrations below the detection level,’ Professor Blatchley said. ‘And because there are literally thousands of pharmaceuticals, this is just a small subset of compounds that could be present in swimming pools. Pharmaceuticals may get into swimming pool water from personal care products applied to the skin such as insect repellant, makeup (stock image) and sunscreen. Many pharmaceuticals that are ingested are not fully metabolised by the body and are excreted in sweat and urine . ‘The main issue is that the release of chemicals into a place like a swimming pool is completely uncontrolled and unknown. I don't want to be an alarmist. We haven't discovered anything that would be cause for alarm right now, but the bottom line is we just don't know.’ Some chemicals are volatile, which means they can escape into the air to be inhaled. Others can be ingested or absorbed through the skin. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recreational water illnesses (RWIs) are caused by germs. These germs are spread by swallowing, breathing in mists or aerosols, or having contact with contaminated water. RWIs also can be caused by chemicals in the water or chemicals that evaporate from the water and cause indoor air quality problems. A wide variety of RWI infections include gastrointestinal, skin, ear, respiratory, eye, neurologic, and wound-related. The most commonly reported RWI is diarrhoea. ‘Swimmers are exposed to chemicals through three different routes: You can inhale, you can ingest and it can go through your skin. ‘So the exposure you receive in a swimming pool setting is potentially much more extensive than the exposure you would receive by just one route alone,’ Professor Blatchley said. Pharmaceuticals may get into swimming pool water from personal care products applied to the skin such as insect repellant, makeup and sunscreen. Many pharmaceuticals that are ingested are not fully metabolised by the body and are excreted in sweat and urine. ‘Urine, I think, is really the primary mode of introduction,’ Professor Blatchley said. ‘When it comes to pharmaceuticals, these are chemicals designed to be biologically active at pretty low concentrations. 'Birth control pills, for example, contain hormones. If those chemicals and others are present, especially in a mixture in a water sample that humans are going to be exposed to, then what are the consequences of that? 'That is a largely unanswered question.’ The findings are published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters. However, Steve Levan, chairman of the Bromine Science and Environmental Forum (BSEF) told MailOnline: 'Brominated flame retardants consist of more than 70 different chemical substances with different properties. 'In fact, there is a wide range of reactive, polymeric, halogenated, phosphorus, mineral and many other types of chemicals that act as flame retardants, often applied in combination. 'This variety is necessary because the materials and products which need to be rendered fire-safe are also very different in their nature, their composition, and indeed their application. 'The term “flame retardant” only describes the function of a substance and not its chemical nature which determines the properties of the substance. 'Properties or findings from one substance should not be attributed to an entire family of chemical.' He continued that BSEF has 'proactively taken responsibility' for the products it puts on the market, to reduce emissions of flame retardants at production phase by implementing best practices.","Researchers collected water from pools in Indiana and Georgia .

"Firemen are increasingly being used to take patients to A&E because ambulance staff are so overstretched. They are having to turn their fire engines into makeshift ambulances even though they have only basic medical training and just a few bandages for equipment. Union leaders say the public is being put at risk because the practice is becoming more common due to the increasing pressures on the NHS. Ambulances queuing up outside the Accident and Emergency department at the Royal Bolton Hospital . The revelation emerged as seven hospitals remained on a status of ‘major incident’, having declared they were struggling to cope with sheer numbers of patients arriving in A&E. Over a 36-hour period on Monday and Tuesday, an unprecedented 13 hospitals across England announced they were experiencing ‘major incidents’, meaning they were drafting in extra staff and cancelling non-urgent operations. Such measures are usually reserved only for events when there are mass casualties – such as terror attacks or rail crashes. And last night it emerged that another hospital was diverting mothers-to-be to a maternity unit 16 miles away because its labour ward was full of A&E patients. Weston General in Weston-super-Mare said: ‘We would like to offer our sincere apologies to any women affected by this and who were referred to St Michael’s in Bristol instead.’ In Birmingham, the Heartlands Hospital has asked administrative staff including receptionists and office workers to help out on wards, even though they have no medical training. Figures on Tuesday showed A&E waiting times are at their worst in a decade. Jenny Knowles, who had to wait for more than seven hours to be seen by a doctor after failling and breaking her nose . Woman, 88, with broken nose made to wait 7 hours . An 88-year-old woman who fell and broke her nose had to wait more than seven hours to be seen by hospital doctors. The saga began shortly after midnight on Monday when Jenny Knowles fell at her nursing home in County Durham. Staff contacted her daughter, Gloria Wills, 66, who is an ex-chairman of the now disbanded Sedgefield Primary Care Trust. Workers at the home in West Cornforth rang 999 for an ambulance at 12.05am but Miss Wills said it was not until 3.30am before one operated by St John’s arrived and took her mother to University Hospital of North Durham. At the overstretched A&E unit, it was only at 7.15am that an X-ray confirmed that dementia sufferer Mrs Knowles had a broken nose. North East Ambulance Service said: ‘We would like to apologise to the patient.’ Great-gran’s family gives up after 16 hours . A frail great-grandmother spent 16 hours waiting to be treated at an overstretched A&E department after a suspected mini-stroke before her disgusted family gave up. Aimee-Louise Richards said her 81-year-old grandmother, who she did not want to name, was taken by ambulance to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth last Thursday. It was for the same hospital that Florence Cunningham, also 81, had had to wait 11 hours for an ambulance. Miss Richards said her grandmother spent two hours in an ambulance outside A&E before being transferred to a second ambulance at 1am. ‘It wasn’t until 4am that she was even brought into the unit and put on a trolley,’ she said. The pensioner was taken home at 4.30pm after the family lost patience. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust failed to respond to a request for a comment. Yesterday the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firefighters – warned that staff were increasingly being relied upon to cover for ambulances. General secretary Matt Wrack said: ‘The public are being put at risk because the Government have cut staff, resources and equipment in both the NHS and fire and rescue service. ‘In certain incidences, firefighters have been diverted away from their own work.’ The crisis has come about as many ambulance crews are queuing outside A&E – unable to drop off patients because it is so busy inside. So when another 999 call comes in, they are unable to respond. On Tuesday, an elderly woman who had fallen in the street was taken to the A&E unit at York Hospital, North Yorkshire, by firefighters passing through because the ambulance service was too busy. A paramedic later said there were queues of up to ten ambulances outside the hospital entrance. But it is not an isolated case – County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Services both responded to three emergencies instead of ambulances in December and January. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘The crisis in ambulance services means that more and more 999 calls are being attended by fire engines and police cars.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Occasionally – as has been the case for many years – fire crews stabilise patients when first on the scene of a particular incident but fire engines are not being diverted as makeshift ambulances.’","Firemen taking patients to A&E due to overstretched ambulance staff .

"The same year Sydney Siege gunman Man Monis was dropped from national watch lists, it’s been revealed he was also reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal. As more information comes to light about Monis’ violent and disturbing past, people continue to question why the man with a history of threatening behaviour was not being more closely monitored by authorities. It’s alleged that Man Monis repeatedly made threats to the principal of a South Sydney school, accusing him of being a traitor and a ‘sell-out’ for allowing the school to engage in interfaith activities, according to SMH. Scroll down for video . Man Monis - under the name Mohammed Hassan Manteghi - (pictured protesting outside the Downing Centre's local court in November 2009) convinced Amnesty International that was an Iranian spy in 2007 . After sending about twelve abusive faxes, ranting about the school’s choice to associate with a Jewish school and for holding an interfaith Anzac Day ceremony, Man Monis’ messages became more sinister. 'People like you will get what's coming your way,’ he wrote to Osman Karolia, who was then the principal of Arkana College in Kingsgrove. Mr Karolia became concerned and asked if that was intended as a threat, to which Monis replied ‘yes’. Mr Karolia contacted Australian Federal Police, deeply concerned that Man Monis was acting in a hostile manner towards himself and the school. Although Monis was investigated, police still elected to stop monitoring Monis by removing him from watch lists that same year. The self-made Sheik went on to commit a string of awful crimes before he shocked the world on December 15 with the hostage crisis. In 2013, he was charged with being an accessory in the murder of his ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal. He has was also charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and was charged for sending abusive emails to the family of dead Australian soldiers in 2011. The lawyer who defended him in the case, Nazir Daawar, has also come forward, alleging that the criminal had high-level connections with Iran’s intelligence services. Mr Daawar reveals that Monis had been the director of a travel agency, which has a series of significant implications, according to The Australian. Amnesty wrote a letter supporting Monis' refugee application after reviewing Iranian anti-regime poetry he had published . In the Iranian community, a travel agent is a hugely important role as they have the power to obtain visas, meaning they have the ability to decide who can enter or exit Iran. By having this authoritative position, Daawar alleges that it can be assumed that Monis had an intimate understanding of the inner workings of the Iranian intelligence services. Amnesty International have also made an admission that they wrote a letter to the Australian Government in support of crazed Sydney siege gunman Man Monis seeking asylum after the conman was successfully convincing in his perception of an Iranian spy. Monis approached the human rights body in April 1997, under the name Mohammed Hassan Manteghi, claiming that his life was in danger after writing poetry published by an Iranian anti-regime outlet. Amnesty wrote a letter of consideration to the Immigration Department to be taken into account in their determination of the Iranian national's refugee application before his visa was granted in 2001. 'Mohamed Hassan Manteghi’s status as a cleric, his involvement with the Ministry of Intelligence, and his connections with high level individuals are relevant considerations which add objective weight to his fear of persecution, and to his fear of being targeted by the authorities outside Iran,' The Daily Telegraph reported the supposed letter from Amnesty International stated. Amnesty refugee coordinator Dr Graham Thom highlighted the political nature of Mr Manteghi's poetry published in Iran, after reviewing copies of the work printed in the Payam-e Daneshju publication. 'As detailed in this letter, we confirmed that the Iranian authorities had arrested the publisher of this poetry in July 1996 for ""publishing lies and causing public confusion"",' he said. 'The editor of this publication continues to be in and out of jail in Iran for his writing.' However, Dr Thom conceded if he had been the coordinator at the time then he would have been written the letter differently. 'Amnesty's processes have certainly changed … today when I get evidence we will only state something as a fact when we're able to verify it,' The Daily Telegraph reported. 'I'm not sure why (Monis's claims) were taken at face value.' He said Monis gave names that matched those of Iranian officials which was presented as evidence to the Australian government. Monis held 17 hostages for up to 16 hours in the Lindt cafe in Sydney last month . The floral tribute outside the cafe in Martin Place following the siege that took Monis' life and two hostages . Terrorism expert Greg Barton said part of the issue was that Monis was a 'brilliant individual' who was 'very manipulative'. 'He was a good con artist - certainly not a regular person,' he told Daily Mail Australia. He also praised Amnesty for the handling of the costly blunder. 'It's easy to be critical - kudos to them for admitting to making a mistake.' Monis approached Amnesty International for a second time in August 2010 under the guise of Sheikh Haron. He visited the Sydney office without notice and requested support. 'Amnesty International declined to provide him with assistance, as his case did not meet the organisation's human rights criteria,' Dr Thom said. 'After declining this request for support, Amnesty International had no further involvement in his case and advised him to contact police.' Amnesty declined to provide Monis for assistance when he appraoched them a second time in 2010 under the name of Sheikh Haron .","Sydney Siege gunman Man Monis threatened a South Sydney school .

'What happened is we were all gathering and ... (the bomber) exploded right next to all of the police college classmates,' eyewitness Jamil al-Khaleedi told The Associated Press. 'It went off among all of them, and they flew through the air.' Dozens more people were wounded in the explosion, officials initially said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorised to brief journalists. The blast was heard across the city and a large plume of smoke was visible near the college in a heavily congested part of the city near the central bank and the defence ministry. A charred taxi cab smoked near what remained of the minibus, yards from a gate for the police academy. 'The situation is catastrophic. We arrived to find bodies piled on top of each other,' a paramedic at the scene told Reuters as ambulances took casualties away. 'We found the top part of one person yelling, while his bottom half was completely severed.' A policeman told Reuters that another car had been passing as the bomb went off and was set on fire along with everyone inside.

Washington considers al-Qaida in Yemen to be the world's most dangerous branch of the terror network as it has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland. The blast comes after Shiite rebels known as Houthis seized large areas of Yemen, including Sanaa, in September as part of a protracted power struggle with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Their critics view them as a proxy for Shiite Iran, charges the rebels deny. Collateral damage: A policeman inspects a damaged car at the scene of the car bombing .

"A senior Korean Air executive who exploded in a rage at a flight attendant after her peanuts were served in a bag instead of on a dish has today been charged over the incident. Furious Cho Hyun-ah, a senior vice-president at the airline, angrily demanded the removal of a crew member from a flight for failing to serve her macadamia nuts in the correct way. She has now been charged with 'threatening the plane's safety' and could spend up to 15 years in prison if found guilty of the four charges she faces. Scroll down for video . Ashamed Cho Hyun-ah arriving at the Seoul Western District Prosecutors Office in Seoul, South Korea, last week. Today she has been charged following her 'nut rage' incident . In December, Cho forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal at New York's JFK Airport to kick the flight attendant off the plane. Flight 86 was already on the runway for its departure when Cho lost her temper after the unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class. Furious that he had not followed protocol and presented them in a dish, she screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company's in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight. The Airbus A380  eventually arrived in South Korea 11 minutes late. Embarrassed Cho, senior vice-president at Korean Air, apologised for delaying a plane leaving New York's JFK Airport over the way she was served nuts. She said sorry for her outrageous behaviour when she appeared in front of South Korean media . Prosecutors said Cho was facing charges of violating aviation security law and obstructing a government investigation. Deputy chief prosecutor Kim Chang-hee said Cho had disrupted the flight and 'threatened the plane's safety'. Prosecutors accused her of forcing a flight to change its normal route, which is the most serious charge and carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. The three other charges she faces are the use of violence against flight crew, hindering a government probe and forcing the flight's purser off the plane. Ashamed Cho could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty of all four charges she faces, according to Attorney Park Jin Nyoung, spokesman for the Korean Bar Association. Wearing a black coat, Cho was forced into a grovelling public apology where she sincerely apologised for her behaviour . Following the December 5 incident,  Cho made a grovelling apology where she bowed her head in shame and admitted in a trembling voice that she was 'sorry'. 'I sincerely apologize.' she said, gloomy-faced, adding that she will 'apologize sincerely' at a meeting with the victimized crew member. Adding to her humiliation, her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho called her behaviour 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he didn't raise her better. He added that his eldest would resign from her executive roles at all affiliates of Hanjin, the group that controls Korean Air. Cho Yang-ho, Cho's father and chairman of Korean Air, said he regretted he had not raised his daughter better and described her behaviour as 'foolish' South Korean media branded the 40-year-old a princess and while others branded her an embarrassment to her country. Cho's behavior caused uproar in the country and the airline's defense of her and its attempt to blame the crew member prompted even more criticism. The incident touched a nerve in a country where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law.","Cho Hyun-ah delayed flight when nuts she ordered did not arrive in a bowl .

"Boxing great Muhummad Ali has won his bout with a severe urinary tract infection. The three-time world heavyweight champion was released from a hospital Tuesday night, family spokesman Bob Gunnell said Wednesday. Ali is back home and looking forward to celebrating his 73rd birthday on January 17 with his family and friends, Gunnell said. Released:  A family spokesman for Muhammad Ali says the boxing great has been released from a hospital after recovering from a severe urinary tract infection. Muhammad Ali is shown before the Ali Humanitarian Awards ceremony in Louisville, Kenthuck in September . 'He's in great spirits and enjoying being back home,' Gunnell said. 'He's back in his daily routine.' Initial reports of Ali's hospitalization declined to reveal where the sports legend was being hospitalized. However, his daughter Rasheda Ali-Walsh told TMZ in December her father was being treated in his home state of Kentucky. 'My daddy is a strong man. He's so resilient and we're all very grateful and blessed,' Ali-Walsh said at the time. Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed with the brain disease about three years after he retired from boxing in 1981. Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends. Fighter: Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends . Ali's daughter Rasheda Ali-Walsh, one of his nine children, told TMZ in November that her father was being treated at a hospital in his home state of Kentucky . Ali was hospitalized December 20 with what was initially believed to be a mild case of pneumonia. Doctors later determined Ali was suffering from a severe urinary tract infection and not pneumonia, Gunnell said. He said the Ali family appreciates the outpouring of support and well wishes. Ali appeared in public in September at a ceremony in his hometown of Louisville for the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. Ali did not speak to the crowd but posed for photos with award winners, including former NFL great Jim Brown. Brown leaned over and whispered to the seated Ali during the photo session. Later, Brown said he told Ali: 'You're the greatest of all time.' Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have homes in Paradise Valley, Arizona; Berrien Springs, Michigan; and in Louisville. Gunnell would not say which of his homes Ali had returned to.

The 27-year-old, who left Plymouth College of Art in 2008, got her first big break after working on designs for the Clothes Show in Birmingham. She said: 'I always knew what I wanted to do but I didn’t expect to do it so quickly. It kind of happened by accident. 'When I graduated I just fell into doing my own brand - it was all sooner than I had planned. 'I signed up to an online portfolio site and managed to get contact details for stylist Alexis Knox. 'She got back to me and asked if I would be interested in providing some clothes for the opening scene of the Clothes Show in Birmingham.'

Alice, pictured modelling one of her own designs, said she fell into doing her own brand . Her big break came when renowned stylist Alexis Knox, who has worked with Little Mix, asked Alice to provide some clothes for the opening scene of the Clothes Show in Birmingham . After being spotted at the show by several celebrities Alice was inundated with commissions - including a £300 playsuit made from a unique Amazonian print. She also designed items to be used on X Factor and Britain’s Next Top Model and got to meet Jessie J in London. 'I went to a fitting for her,' she said. 'I worked solidly on her outfit for about five days - there were so many different pattern pieces. 'I flew up to London from Cornwall in the end. She’s so nice though - so down to earth.' Despite her success Alice doesn’t get starstruck. Discussing working with celebrities, she said: 'When people like Jessie J wear my clothes, all my friends go crazy, but it just becomes part of the job.

It’s not that it isn’t exciting - it’s just all part of it.' One of Alice’s most successful ranges is her collaboration with My Little Pony, which celebrated their 30th birthday. It includes skin-tight leotards and dresses emblazoned with bright letters and pony prints. 'I was a huge fan of My Little Pony when I was younger.

Alice attended Cornwall College and did a national diploma in Fine Art before moving into fashion. 'I got into fashion via art instead of via textiles. It’s quite unusual but mainly because I don’t like sewing! 'I get inspired by weird things. I take so many photos of nature when I’m out and about. I have also come up with my own colour palette. 'When I was younger I didn’t have any concept of what was appropriate - I just did what I wanted. I think it’s fun to express yourself with clothing. 'I walk out of the house wearing a lime green maxi skirt and bright pink hair but I still think I look boring. I normally just do whatever I want!'

I have a new range coming out soon,' she reveals. 'I’m bringing out some slightly looser clothing and bomber jackets soon.

"The hectic pace of modern life has led to time-saving showers becoming more popular than baths, a study has shown. While three-quarters of people still have a bath and a shower in their home, it is the shower that sees the most use – with Britons taking an average of 227 showers a year. And a third of us take just four baths or fewer over the course of an entire year. A woman enjoys a bubble bath. New research has shown a third of Britons take just four baths or fewer over the course of a year (file picture) Research by the hotel booking site, LateRooms.com also showed those living in the southwest take the fewest showers – 208 per year on average. Meanwhile people living in Wales take the most showers every year – 251 on average. But baths prove more popular when people visit hotels with businessmen and couples much more likely to soak in a bath than take a shower. Andrea Tarpey, of LateRooms.com said: ‘We polled more than 2,000 UK adults in order to shed some light on the nation’s bathing habits. ‘The bathroom is a hugely important part of a hotel stay and often why guests will even choose a room, so we wanted to examine the nation’s perceptions about the whole bathing experience. The average Briton takes 227 showers a year but those living in the southwest take the fewest showers – 208 per year on average . ‘Our research shows that almost a quarter of the UK (24 percent) admits that even when plunged into a relaxing bubble bath they can’t resist using their smartphone to check up on social media and texts. 'According to these new statistics, the average time Brits spend soaking in a tub of hot water is 20 minutes. ‘What is abundantly clear is that while our busy lives means we don’t have as much time to enjoy a hot soak in a lovely bath as we’d like, we still prefer baths to showers. ‘And that means when we take a relaxing trip away from home we’re much more likely to indulge ourselves and have a bath rather than a shower.’","A third of Britons take just four baths or fewer over the course of a year .

"Baltimore police officers disarmed a man who told them he was ordered by the Black Guerrilla Family, a violent prison gang, to smuggle a loaded gun into a city police station. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said 29-year-old Jason Armstrong walked into the Northeastern District substation about 8 a.m. Tuesday smelling strongly of marijuana. Batts said officers noted Armstrong's strange behavior and searched him, finding marijuana, cocaine and a .22-caliber handgun with a round in the chamber. When officers interviewed Armstrong, Batts said, he told them he had been ordered by the Black Guerrilla Family (BGF) gang to smuggle the contraband into the station house to test the department's security. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Police said that 29-year-old Jason Armstrong told them he was ordered by the Black Guerrilla Family, a violent prison gang, to smuggle a loaded gun into a city police station . 'An organized gang in the city of Baltimore sent an armed suspect into our building to see our security, to test our security,' Batts said at a press conference filmed by WMAR. Batts also said 'We're not going to cower. We're not going to back down. We're not going to shy away from tough situations. We will be a constitutional police department.' 'I'm not going to sit on my heels and wait for it to happen again,' Batts said. 'We will move forward and hold those people responsible for sending him into that police station. We will hold them accountable.' WMAR reported that BGF was behind a scheme to sell drugs from Baltimore Detention Center, and that both employees at the facility and BGF members have been indicted. Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez also spoke at the press conference, and said of Armstrong 'He did not go in there on his free will. This person had very little option, according to his statement.' 'We have verified as much as we can now his affiliation and his prior contacts with the police,' Rodriguez also said. 'We know of incidents that took place before that caused him to be in this situation.' Officers said late Tuesday that Armstrong had been charged with weapons and narcotics offenses. The FBI issued a memo last month warning of potential threats against police officers nationwide. The incident also comes less than a month after the December 20 slayings of NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu by Issmaiyl Brinsley, who earlier wrote online he was 'putting wings on pigs.' Brinsley killed himself after the fatal shooting.

"Armand De Saint-Salvy's 30-second video, titled Manchild, has been selected as one of the finalists in Doritos' Crash the Super Bowl ad competition . An Australian man's hilarious advertisement has secured a position as one of the top 10 world finalists in a competition that could see him pocket $1 million and have his work aired at the US Super Bowl. Armand De Saint-Salvy's 30-second video, titled Manchild, was selected by Doritos from almost 5,000 entries as a front-runner in their Crash the Super Bowl ad competition. The Sydney based freelancer and director from Bondi told Daily Mail Australia that it was his own behaviour and 'the universal truth of the man-child' that inspired the theme of his advertisement. 'It's based on myself – I can be quite immature. I get pumped about the game, I get excited to go out with the boys, I yell at the telly when the referee makes a call; I'm a child sometimes,' Mr De Saint-Salvy said. Excitement first hit the talented filmmaker when he was informed of his finalist position by Hunger Games actress Elizabeth Banks, one of the judges of the competition. 'I got a phone call early in the morning that woke me up and I answered all groggy and half asleep, and I hear: ""Hi, I'm Elizabeth Banks. I'm a Hollywood actress do you know who I am?"",' Mr De Saint-Salvy said. Scroll down for video .

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel tonight backed allowing European countries to impose tighter controls on benefits, insisting she 'very much likes' having Britain in the EU. Appearing in Downing Street after talks with David Cameron, Mrs Merkel insisted that the principle of freedom of movement across the continent could not be 'questioned' but stressed 'where there is a will, there is a way' to addressing the UK's concerns. Mrs Merkel suggested that tackling abuse of the benefits system - a central plank of Tory demands for reform - could be addressed by individual member states without agreement in Brussels. David Cameron and Angela Merkel gave a press conference in Downing Street today after talks on EU reform . Mrs Merkel stressed that she wanted to keep Britain in the EU, telling Mr Cameron: 'Where there is a will there is a way' At the press conference in Downing Street Mrs Merkel suggested changes to benefits could be made by EU countries at a 'local' level . Mr Cameron will go into the general election in May promising to stage a two-year renegotiation of Britain's membership of the EU, before staging an in-out referendum. He insists he thinks his plan will succeed, and he will then recommend staying in the EU. If he fails he admits he will 'rule nothing out', raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28-nation bloc. Today Mr Cameron said: 'Let me just be clear, I support freedom of movement but what I don't support is the abuse of freedom of movement and that is as I set out in my very comprehensive speech is what we need to change.' Mrs Merkel insisted that she will not support any moves to alter the fundamental principle of freedom of movement. But she suggested changes to benefits could be made by EU countries at a 'local' level. 'We have no doubt about the principle of freedom of movement being in any way questioned,' she said. 'But we also have to look at abuse of those principles. We are looking at legislation here and we want to see how this plays out at local level. 'We want to also say to our local authorities that abuse needs to be fought against so that freedom of movement can prevail. 'We have to take a very close at the individual social security systems of individual member states that after all are not part of communal law, to what extent they have to be adjusted to this situation.' The two leaders toured an exhibition on German history at the British Museum before meeting in Downing Street to 'discuss key issues to advance our common agenda'. Mrs Merkel said: 'As regards our future co-operation within the European Union... where there is a will, there is a way to find common solutions.' She added later: 'I very much like having the UK in the EU.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined David Cameron for a tour of the British Museum before talks on reforming the European Union . Mrs Merkel has made clear she backs the idea of limiting access to benefits claimed by migrants moving around Europe . The exhibition - Germany: Memories Of A Nation - traces 600 years of the country's history, with exhibits including works of art and a Volkswagen Beetle . Mr Cameron will go into the general election in May promising to stage a two-year renegotiation of Britain's membership of the EU, before staging an in-out referendum. He insists he thinks his plan will succeed, and he will then recommend staying in the EU. Speaking at the press conference with Mrs Merkel, he said: 'I don't think the right answer is for Britain to leave the EU.' Schools are allowing anti-German feeling to flourish by tolerating jibes about the war and football, a top headmaster says. Richard Cairns, head of fee-paying Brighton College, said there is a ‘sub-culture of anti-German feeling in young people’ – which isn’t helped by history lessons focusing on German imperialism and the rise of the Nazis. He urged schools to do more to give pupils a broader perspective on the European power. He went on: 'We have shown over the last five years what we can achieve together, over the budget, over the single market, over making Europe more competitive. 'I want to fix the problems in Britain's relationship with the EU, which the British people can find very frustrating. I am convinced this can be done. 'It is about securing what is in the best long-term interests of Britain but also I believe the long-term interests of Europe too.' In a major speech last year Mr Cameron set out four key areas for reform: . Mrs Merkel has made clear she backs the idea of limiting access to benefits claimed by migrants moving around Europe. In November the European Court of Justice ruled that jobless EU migrants cannot move around the continent living off state handouts – and have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves. It ruled against a Romanian single mother who moved to Germany without a job, and made no effort to look for work, but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers. Downing Street aides stressed that Britain is a key ally to German, as well as needing support in Berlin for his proposed reforms . Mr Cameron has warned Mrs Merkely that if he fails to secure EU reform he will 'rule nothing out', raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28-nation bloc . The leaders held talks in Downing Street, which were expected to focus on the G7 and EU reform but also covered the terror attack in Paris which left 12 people dead . Tensions between Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel emerged last year when it was suggested he would demand a cap on the total number of migrants able to move to Britain. Berlin made clear this would amount to an acceptable infringement of the principle of freedom of movement. The idea was dropped from Mr Cameron's speech before he delivered it at the end of November, after opposition from Mrs Merkel. A Downing Street source said: 'They have both been around a long time. They know each other well and see each other a lot. There is no doubt this is a strong relationship. FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU: . No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years . No social housing for four years . No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK . FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS: . No support from the UK taxpayer . Deportation if they do not get a job for six months . Other measures include: . Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU . Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK . Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals . Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels . 'Germany is a key ally for us, but we are a key ally for them as well in lots of issues in the EU.' However former Europe minister David Davis said the Prime Minister needs to persuade Germany that the prospect of the UK leaving the EU is not just ‘sabre-rattling’. And Ukip leader Nigel Farage said that Mr Cameron had abandoned any opposition to freedom of movement. He told Channel 4 News: ‘What it means is the red line, which is that we should control who comes to settle in our country … has [been] surrendered.’ As part of today's trip, Mrs Merkel and Mr Cameron visited the British Museum to see a history of her country. The museum's Germany: Memories Of A Nation exhibition traces 600 years of the history, with exhibits including works of art and a Volkswagen Beetle. Ahead of their meeting, the Prime Minister and Chancellor Merkel issued a joint statement which said: 'We meet to discuss key issues to advance our common agenda, in particular with regard to the German G7 presidency. 'At the same time, we must do more to make the EU more stable and competitive than it is today. We have both taken steps at home to consolidate our public finances and it is important that we continue to pursue this long-term plan. 'We must do more to harness the potential of the single market and reduce regulation that is hampering business. 'We must also dismantle further barriers to trade, in particular by agreeing an EU-US trade deal in 2015, which was launched at the UK's G8 summit in Lough Erne.' Downing Street said that the pair's talks would focus on the German presidency of the G7. However Mr Cameron also reiterated his warning that if he fails to secure the reforms he could back Britain's exit. His demands on welfare reform include banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels. Mr Cameron said at the weekend: 'EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here. UK taxpayers will not support them if they don't.' However, there are reports that the European Commission is preparing to block the move. The Guardian said the commission is preparing to let Number 10 know that the proposal would be unworkable because it would be impossible to distinguish between EU jobseekers and tourists entering the UK. Ahead of the visit, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'Germany is facing its own problems at the moment and would not want Britain to start turning away EU jobseekers, potentially redirecting them to seek work there. 'If Chancellor Merkel agreed that UK can close the door on EU jobseekers she would also have to recognise that a great many that were Britain bound would instead seek work in Germany as the continent's biggest economy, and that is a risk she is likely to be unwilling to take.' Labour's shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden said Chancellor Merkel would not be driven by 'the need to pander to the eurosceptics inside today's Conservative Party'. He added: 'Even once her visit is over, the gap between what David Cameron's eurosceptic backbenchers are demanding and what European allies such as Germany will accept, remains unbridgeable. 'Europe does need to change, but the tragedy for Britain is that since being elected, David Cameron has spent more time negotiating with his backbenchers than with other EU leaders.'","German Chancellor tells PM: 'Where there is a will, there is a way'

"Thousands of pigeons have invaded a small town in Scotland - coating roofs, streets and pavements in droppings and feathers. Frustrated residents in Alva, Clackmannanshire, have hit out at council officials for failing to take action to remove the birds after they claim they have been hit be a 'plague of pigeons'. It is thought the birds are looking for a place to roost after the demolition of a former pub, the Alva Glen Hotel, which had lain empty for years and where they had taken residency. A small town in Scotland has been invaded by a swarm of pigeons, which have coated roofs and pavements with droppings and feathers . But it was recently knocked down after it was discovered that drug barons had been using it as a cannabis farm in 2009. Residents have complained that persistent problems include pigeons taking to balconies and that roofs of buildings are being covered in feathers and droppings. Frank Cairns, 45, a local publican who lives and works in Main Street where most of the birds have settled, said: 'It's an absolute nightmare. It's like we've gone back to the Middle Ages with street hygiene. 'It will harm trade, no doubt about that. It gives us a harder job to keep the place clean.' His sister Katrina Cairns added: 'We have had to clean the gutters three times to clean out the pigeon mess. It is all getting dragged in here. 'School kids are walking along the street, walking it into shops, the school, their houses. 'I know the council said they are sending a cleaner along the street, but the mess is still there. The disease it brings - they are not exactly clean animals. It is thought the birds are trying to find somewhere to roost after their previous home - the Alva Glen Hotel - was recently demolished . The pigeons can be seen in their thousands as they sit on roofs of houses. Furious residents have complained the council has not done enough to remove the birds . 'It's not great, you have to try to avoid it in the street.' Graham Johnston owns a watch shop and has many of the pigeons roosting on his roof: 'It is annoying. Someone must be feeding them or they'd be away by now. 'There is droppings all along the pavement. It's horrible. The mess gets brought into the shop from the pavement outside. There is nothing being done about it.' James McDonald, 64, who lives opposite where the hotel used to be, added: 'It's not very nice, the mess in the street is horrible.' George Horsburgh, former secretary of Alva Community Council, who is also part of the Alva Community Action Group, said: 'This has infuriated many residents of Alva who are worst affected, in particular residents of the flattened dwellings in The Wynd. 'The residents there have to put up with many of the pigeons roosting on their balconies overnight and part of the day, making them unusable to the residents, some of them have resorted to fitting strawberry netting across the front of their balconies to prevent the pigeons from gaining access. 'One older lady constantly complains that they roost on her window ledges and wonders why no action has been taken.' Residents have complained that persistent problems include pigeons taking to balconies and that roofs of buildings are being covered in feathers and droppings . The derelict former hotel was bought and flattened by construction firm Murdoch Smith last year after it was branded an eyesore, due to its state of disrepair and problems surrounding the maintenance of the building date as far back as 2006. Local MP Gordon Banks agrees the pigeon issue is causing distress for many people, and believes the situation has been a long time coming. He said: 'There can be no doubt that there are hundreds of pigeons displaced from the old Alva Glen Hotel and such populations are an obvious result of buildings lying empty and falling into disrepair, so the problem has been a long time in the making. 'Now that their roost has been destroyed these birds are in the open and can often be seen swarming in their hundreds in the area. 'The council's hope that they will naturally disperse does not seem to have much support and I hope there is some way that the council will rethink their position and investigate methods for dispersal. 'This is a problem where buildings are allowed to fall into disrepair and impacts other areas of the county as well, so I look forward to the council being more proactive on empty buildings in the future.' Another resident said: 'As soon as they took the roof of the Alva Glen Hotel, the town was hit by a plague of pigeons flying around wondering where their home had gone. They had all been roosting in the attic.' The birds had been roosting in the Alva Glen Hotel (pictured) before it was recently demolished after residents complained it was an 'eyesore' The small town of Alva in Clackmannanshire has been inundated with the pigeons and the local council has organised extra street cleaning . Clackmannanshire Council said it had been concerned about the potential for problems from pests from the site and, in advance of the demolition, had investigated options for culling the birds. A spokeswoman for the council said: 'Due to animal welfare legislation we were unable to net the buildings as it would have trapped the birds inside and due to the poor state of the building we were unable to gain access to poison the birds. 'It was expected that the pigeon population of Alva would decrease as the air temperature dropped and the pigeons are forced to find new sheltered spots for roosting at night. 'The persistence of birds during daytime is indicative of food being put out for the birds during the day. 'The council has investigated a number of reports and spoken to those responsible. 'To reduce the impact off the pigeon droppings on the pavements of Alva, the council has organised extra street cleansing and also arranged for high powered jet washing of the worst affected areas. 'Council officers will continue to monitor the situation, and consider further action should the issue persist.'","Residents in Alva, Clackmannanshire, have hit out at council officials for failing to take action to remove the birds .

"Overweight London Mayor Boris Johnson has joined the Prime Minister on a post-Christmas diet after piling on the pounds over the festive holidays. The Prime Minister said that he was now watching what he eats and taking extra exercise, after admitted: ‘I have put on a bit of Christmas. I can feel a bit of tightening around the belt buckle.’ Mr Johnson yesterday revealed that he had ballooned to more than 16 stone and needed to cut back. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson was yesterday in Farsley, Leeds meeting small shop owners a art gallery and old mills . The Prime Minister has admitted he is watching what he eats and taking extra exercise - including a New Year run (right) - after putting on weight last year . On a visit to Halifax, west Yorkshire, Mr Johnson said: ‘I weighed myself this morning and I am 16 and a half stone and I need to come down by a stone. ‘I'm going to do that through guts and determination, by sheer will‎power, by eating less. ‘I take on an almost unbelievable amount of exercise, but I have a bad habit of eating the children's supper for breakfast.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘I was out pounding the pavements on a run yesterday and I will be doing a bit of light dieting over the next few weeks and hopefully I will shed the pounds. ‘I’m running a couple of miles every other day. It is easier to put it on than to take it off.’ Mr Cameron said he did not weigh himself but admitted he realised he had gained weight after photos emerged of him taking part in an annual Christmas mud run in his. He told BBC Radio West Midlands he enjoyed running along the canals in Birmingham. The PM also claimed that he was expert at dodging dog mess while out jogging. He said: ‘I am pretty nifty on my feet. I can tell you know how to dodge those.’ Four years in power has taken its toll on the waistlines of many members of the Cabinet. A combination of stress, eating on the go and endless receptions with tempting - but high calorie - canapes means it is all too easy to pile on the pounds. The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread. In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’ Prime Minister David Cameron participated in The Great Brook Run in his constituency of Witney on New Year's Day . Mr Cameron said he will be doing 'a bit of light dieting over the next few weeks and hopefully I will shed the pounds' But last summer he was photographed looking portly and sunburned on a beach while on holiday in Cornwall. At the Conservative Party conference in October he joked that the unflattering photos of him wearing only a Mickey Mouse towel did at least demonstrate he had the ‘stomach for the fight’. In an interview in January this year the Prime Minister described himself as a ‘middle-aged, slightly overweight man’. He said he tried to go jogging once or twice a week in parks near Downing Street, and was rarely recognised. ‘The thing about the parks in London is its mostly full of tourists who just see some middle-aged slightly overweight man trotting past them and they just think it’s another one,’ he said. Questions about the Prime Minister's dieting emerged after photographs showed George Osborne’s fashionable 5:2 diet appears to be paying off, with the Chancellor looking noticeably leaner on the breakfast TV sofa yesterday. The Chancellor is said to have shed significant amounts of weight by cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week. It follows his decision to start wearing a hi-tech Jawbone wristband to keep track of his fitness regime and sleep patterns.","PM confesses he is now watching what he eats and taking extra exercise .

"It is one of the best kept secrets in the art world and has long been at risk of falling into disarray and dilapidation. But now a house designed 200 years ago by artist JMW Turner is to be saved from crumbling into obscurity. Sandycombe Lodge, the only house designed by the artist, has been given a £1.4million grant by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham in London, a property designed and lived in by artist JMW Turner and his father William, has been saved with a £1.4million heritage lottery grant and will be restored throughout 2015 before it can be opened to public viewings from 2016 . The grade II listed, painted by Turner's contemporary William Havell, was placed on the English Heritage at risk register in October 2013 because of its condition . The funding will not only allow vital repairs to be made to the house in Twickenham in London but will also mean it can be opened to the public and fans of the artist, whose first love was architecture. Turner designed and built Sandycombe Lodge in 1813 as a country retreat for himself and his father, a retired wigmaker who worked in Covent Garden. The property was later used as a 'shadow factory' for designing airmen's goggles. It was eventually sold and has recently been in the hands of a private owner, but its dilapidated state meant it was at risk and was only open to the public once a month or for special bookings. Timothy Spall played the renowned watercolour artist JMW Turner in the popular 2014 film Mr Turner, directed by Mike Leigh . The dilapidated front door and crumbling window arches of Sandycombe Lodge led to fears that the building would crumble into obscurity . The distinctive archways and winding staircases were designed by Turner for the Twickenham property showing his love of architecture . The grade II listed house was put on the English Heritage at risk register because of the large amounts of damp in the property and its damaged ceiling. But it will now be restored over the next 12 months to return it to its previous condition, with some of the later additions made to the building removed so it resembles the house that Turner lived in. Catherine Parry-Wingfield, chairman of the Turner House Trust, said: 'The Heritage Lottery Fund's award is the most wonderful news and will allow the Trust to bring this beautiful building back to life.' The restoration means the property will now be open to the public for 46 weeks a year. Turner is pictured with his father, William Turner played by Paul Jesson (right) in the film and both were often seen in the property's gardens . The Turner House Trust said it feared without the grant Sandycombe Lodge could not have survived another winter and more downpours . Sandycombe Lodge was passed through hands of private owners but has been in desperate need of repairs to the walls and ceilings . Turner designed and lived in Sandycombe Lodge, a retreat for himself and his father William, for 13 years until he sold it to a private owner . Turner kept hold of a meadow next to Sandycombe Lodge which he later sold to railway developers for a substantial sum of money . The dilapidated front gate and ceilings, one of which has collapsed at the Grade II listed home, will be restored throughout this year . 'We are just so excited, it is superb news – this house is a national treasure, but it is in a sad, sad state, and if we had to get through another bad winter without knowing whether we could go ahead with restoration, it would be truly worrying,' Rosemary Vaux, of the Turner House Trust, told the Guardian. Ms Vaux said the property was badly damaged during last winter's heavy downpours and storms. The funding means the house will close this year while vital repair and restoration work is carried out so it can be open to the public from 2016. The Turner House Trust launched a campaign last year appealing for £2million to help them restore the house to its former glory of 200 years ago. Preliminary sketches by Turner for the design of the house can be seen at the Tate Britain. Turner designed and built Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham in London in 1816. He created the house as a retreat from his own studio in Harley Street and as a haven for his father, William Turner, who had retired from his role as a barber and wigmaker working in Covent Garden. JMW Turner was born in 1775 and was a successful watercolour painter . The artist is believed to have done some of his watercolour work while he was at the property. Sketches for Turner's design of Sandycombe Lodge can be seen at the Tate Britain, and are a revealing example of the artist's true desire to become an architect. Turner owned the property for 13 years until 1826. It is the only surviving property in the country designed by a major artist for his own use. While Turner painted and designed his father took on the role of gardener and housekeeper at the site. Friends, including Alexander Pope, were invited for lavish picnics at the property. In declining health himself, Turner sold the house in 1826 to Joseph Todd, a self-made business man in the London haberdashery trade. It was later passed to his son-in-law James Morrison, who became a fan of the artist and collected many of his paintings. George Duckett Barber Beaumont, a barrister, gentleman antiquarian and inventor of a traction engine, was the next owner and is believed to be responsible for adding several extensions to the property. Some of these will be removed during the restoration process this year. Turner retained a small meadow close to the house until 1848 when he sold the land to Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway Company as the train systems began to develop and be built across the UK. During World War Two the house was used as a 'shadow factory' - a factory concealed as a private house to hide it from enemies - for making airmen's goggles. In 1947 the house was acquired in a poor state by Professor Harold and Ann Livermore who remained committed to restoring it and keeping Turner's memory intact. They helped set up a trust which became the Turner House Trust in 2005.","Sandycombe Lodge, a country retreat in Twickenham in London was designed by renowned artist JMW Turner .

"The Los Angeles Police Department has released surveillance video showing a vicious attack on a woman by a serial purse snatcher who has been on a prowl in the Koreatown section of the city for nearly two months. Police issued a plea Tuesday asking the public for help in catching the suspect, who they believe is responsible for at least four attacks that took place between November 9 and December 30. Each time, the assailant, believed to be a Hispanic man, followed a lone Korean woman into an apartment building elevator, beat and robbed her. Scroll down for video . String of robberies: The Los Angeles Police Department has released surveillance video showing a vicious attack on a woman (left) by a serial purse snatcher (right) inside a Koreatown building . Brutal attack: The video was recorded November 9 at around 4.25am inside an apartment building in the 300 block of Alexandria Avenue . The video made public this week by the LAPD was recorded November 9 at around 4.25am inside an apartment building in the 300 block of Alexandria Avenue. The 17-second footage shows a woman of Korean descent laden with parcels walking through the lobby towards the elevator. Moments later, a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and shorts follows the woman into the elevator off camera, punches her and hurls her to the ground with such force that her body is sent spinning. The victim tries to put up a fight before the attacker yanks the purse hanging around her neck, leaving the woman lying on the tile floor. In a news release, police wrote that the attacker struck again two weeks later, this time punching and robbing a Korean woman in an apartment elevator in the 500 block of Hobart Boulevard. Two more attacks followed on December 23 and December 30. In the former, the victim was sexually battered before being punched numerous times and robbed of her purse inside a building in the 300 block of Alexandria Avenue.

"Two Saudi men are facing jail after they were convicted of deliberately driving over a stray dog ten times until it was dead - and filming the despicable act of cruelty. In the footage, which quickly went viral on social media, one of the men is seen driving a 4x4 vehicle in an unspecified desert area in Saudi Arabia while the second videos the clip. The dog had been standing in the road when the car driver deliberately smashed  into it. Clearly still alive, but obviously crippled and unable to escape, it was then repeatedly run over. Despicable: A frame from the video showing a young Saudi man repeatedly running over a dog in the desert . The video clip - which is too distressing to republish here on MailOnline - provoked a furious reaction. The pair were arrested after people who saw it urged authorities to take action. It also sparked a campaign for the Saudi Wildlife Authority (SWA), responsible for the conservation and development of wildlife, to develop strong laws that would lead to harsher penalties for anyone who tortures animals. The campaign to bring the men to justice was also backed by several key legal figures who said that it was not only inhumane but also against the teachings of Islam. 'This animal is a God's creation and its torture is a violation of the Islamic teachings,' said one of the participants in a social media group. Another added: 'Islam recommends merciful treatment of animals.' 'Violation of Islamic teachings': The video went viral on social media, where commenters slammed it as a deeply immoral act and urged authorities to take action against the pair . The court adjourned before sentencing and the pair face either jail or a fine of up to £90,000. Jabir Al-Shehri of the Ministry of Agriculture said the two young men had clearly breached the terms of the the unified code of merciful treatment of animals adopted by all Gulf states. Al-Shehri said the vehicle's number plate, which was clearly visible in the clip, was an important lead that helped security forces to arrest the culprits, who have not been named.","Online commenters call it 'a violation of the Islamic teachings' on animals .

"You're most likely leave on time if you fly from Bristol Airport, according to new research. Aviation analysts OAG have named the west country airport most punctual, as part of its Punctuality League 2014, which draws on flight status data from the whole of last year. An impressive 94.4 per cent of flights departed or landed within 15 minutes of their scheduled time - compared to a measly 60.1 per cent of flights at Gatwick and 75.5 per cent at Heathrow. Bristol Airport is more punctual than Heathrow and Gatwick with 94.4 per cent of flights leaving on time . 'This achievement is a joint effort and is testament to the collaborative approach taken by airlines, ground handlers and our own team,' Bristol Airport Chief Executive Robert Sinclair told the Bristol Post. 'It demonstrates the advantages offered by regional airports such as Bristol, where airlines operate in uncongested airspace with greater flexibility and resilience in the event of any disruption.' Airports were divided into three categories: small - defined as fewer than 10 million scheduled seats per year; medium - between 10 and 20 million scheduled seats and large, which were defined as having more than 20 million scheduled seats per year.

"Bryan Ferry has thanked fans for their kind messages of support after his youngest son's horrific car crash. Merlin, 24, was trapped in the wreckage of a vehicle for almost an hour after he was involved in a three-car collision in a country lane in Shropshire, West Midlands, a fortnight ago. The former Marlborough College pupil suffered multiple fractures and a head injury in the crash, which left his silver Volvo saloon looking 'like a mangled box of tin'. Scroll down for video . Bryan Ferry, left, has thanked fans for their messages of support after his son Merlin, right, was in a car crash . A message posted on the former Roxy Music star's Facebook page said: 'On behalf of BF and the family, many thanks for all the kind messages of support for Merlin following his road accident before Christmas.' It went on: 'Merlin has undergone a series of operations and is now stable in hospital, with a long period of recovery ahead of him.' The message also thanked the fire and ambulance crews which helped as well as the medical staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. Merlin's brother Otis had described the wreckage, following the crash on the A458, half a mile to the north west of Cressage, as looking 'like a mangled box of tin'. One of the other vehicles in the tangled wreck had erupted in flames while Merlin was still trapped in his car, but a passer-by was able to quickly put out the dangerous blaze. At the time the West Midlands Ambulance service said he suffered multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis, left arm and had a head injury. The crash, which took place on the A458 near Cressage, Shropshire, left Merlin's silver Volvo saloon looking like 'a mangled box of tin'. The wreckage also involved a red Mercedes (seen on the right of the image) His eldest brother, Eton-educated Otis, informed his followers the day after the crash on December 22 and updated them on his sibling’s condition via his public Instagram page. After uploading a picture of the crash scene, he said at the time: ‘He had a head-on collision, has lots of broken bones and is having an operation on his heart as we speak. ‘He was conscious before he went into theatre and his biggest concern was that he had missed Christmas! He is in the best possible hospital for this type of procedure.’ Otis, who is master of the South Shropshire Hunt and has in the past been arrested for his pro-hunting activism, also thanked firefighters for freeing his brother from the wreck. He wrote on Twitter: ‘Thank you for extracting my brother alive from what looks like a mangled box of tin. We are all continuing to pray.’ Merlin had been travelling along the A458 about half a mile north-west of the village of Cressage, in Shropshire, at the time of the collision. Family affair: Merlin (circled) with brothers Isaac, Otis and Tara as their father Bryan received the CBE in 2011 . His car and a red Mercedes, which was travelling in the opposite direction, had collided head-on at around 6.40pm. The 49-year-old Mercedes driver from Kidderminster escaped with minor injuries. A third vehicle, a Scania lorry, which was travelling in the same direction as the Mercedes was also involved but little damage was caused to it. The driver was uninjured. Merlin, who narrowly escaped jail in 2013 after he was found carrying a knife for a second time, is one of four sons the 69-year-old has with his ex-wife, former model Lucy Helmore. Their 21-year marriage ended in divorce in 2003 while his second marriage to PR executive Amanda Sheppard, who is 38 years his junior, also ended in divorce earlier this year. The couple had separated in August last year after being married for two years. Merlin had accompanied his siblings Otis, Isaac and Tara to Buckingham Palace three years ago to see their father receive his CBE.","Merlin Ferry, 24, was involved in three-car collision just before Christmas .

"This is the moment that an unexploded World War II bomb was detonated after a father-of-two dug it up  in the back garden of his home. Marcus Fairs, 47, found the World War Two three inch mortar while planting a bamboo screen at the rear of his £1.25 million property in Stoke Newington, north London. His wife Rupinder Bhogal, 44, and their two children Jordi,10, and Millie, eight, were also at home when he made the discovery of the device, which weighed the same as a bag of sugar. Scroll down for video . The moment that the bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion on the World War II bomb that was found  by gardener Marcus Fairs, 47 . The family and their neighbours were told to move to the front rooms of their houses while the Bomb Squad removed the device before carrying out a controlled explosion in nearby Clissold Park, Hackney. 'I was just digging away putting in some black bamboo to screen the back fence,' said Mr Fairs, editor of online architecture magazine Dezeen. 'I had dug up a lot of bricks already, because, ironically, there had been an air raid shelter at the back of the garden. I was really going for it with the shovel and hit something that was metal and then I hit it again. The discovery was made by Marcus Fairs as he dug up his garden to make way for a new bamboo screen . 'It was about eight inches down and I removed the dirt around it. 'When I first saw it, I just thought it was a bomb and I was really excited. It was about a foot long. 'I was a bit nonchalant about it and I picked it up and took a picture of it a posted it on twitter asking what to do. 'Someone then told me to call the police. But before I did that I made sure I finished the work in the garden because I didn't know if we were going to be evacuated. 'I called 101 and they were really helpful and said someone would be on the way. Within five minutes there were three squad cars here. 'We were told to move to the front of the house and so were all the neighbours. My family were a bit nervous about it because they didn't know what was going to happen. Mr Fairs sent a message to his Twitter followers asking what he should do after digging up the unexploded bomb . 'All the neighbours knew about it and there was a mixture of excitement and concern over my foolhardiness. 'When the police were examining it in the garden it was a light-hearted atmosphere, but when the Bomb Squad guys turned up things went a bit hush hush. 'I felt a bit left out to be honest, but I thought the whole thing was very exciting. 'Then all of a sudden the guy who was dealing with it got up and brought it through the house with tape around the end and they told us they were going to conduct a controlled explosion in the park. The Bomb Squad examined the device in the garden of the £1.25million home before taking it to a nearby park and carrying out a controlled explosion . 'I wasn't worried about it being carried through the house because if it was going to go it would have been when I hit it with the shovel, so I wasn't too concerned. 'I was a bit disappointed when they took it away, because I thought it was my bomb and my discovery. 'It was only when they took it to the park when I realised it was really live and it was a real bomb. I saw the video of the explosion and it was huge. 'The whole experience was really exciting and I wasn't really worried or terrified about it. I thought it was interesting.' Experts believe the device was a three inch British mortar that had been kept by a serviceman as a souvenir . However, the drama has not put him off his gardening hobby and he plans to be turning the soil again this weekend. He said: 'Gardening is a hobby and a bit of the necessity at the moment. The garden needs a bit of work and there is a lot more to do. 'I'm going to be out here again next weekend working at it all again. 'I have been gardening for years and have found lots of stuff at in other gardens, like bottles and horseshoes, but I have never found a bomb and this has to be the highlight of my gardening career.' This is the moment that the mortar was detonated in in nearby Clissold Park, Hackney . Mr Fairs said 'It was only when they took it to the park when I realised it was really live and it was a real bomb. I saw the video of the explosion and it was huge' Mr Fairs said he found the whole experience 'really exciting' and was not terrified or worried . The bomb was taken to Clissold Park, Hackney, which was evacuated by police where it was destroyed in a controlled explosion . Mr Fairs said: 'I saw the video and was amazed at how powerful it was. 'They even put insulation around it to lessen the effect of the explosion, but it was still huge. 'Since it happened I have been told by a friend it looked like a British mortar, which may have been brought back by a serviceman after the war and kept in the air raid shelter as a memento.'","Marcus Fairs, 47, uncovered the mortar at his home in Stoke Newington .

"The cold-blooded outrage in Paris is not a story about one magazine or one country – and it is not just about freedom of the Press. It is about the right of every single one of us to be free to express ourselves. And it is high time the nations of Europe woke up to how gravely that right is under threat. Because what happened yesterday – though the most appalling incident of its kind yet – is in many ways far from unprecedented. It is just the latest chapter in a long, concerted campaign to shut down criticism and discussion of one religion, its founder and its teachings. Scroll down for video . Appalling: The incident in Paris is just the latest chapter in a long, concerted campaign to shut down criticism and discussion of one religion, its founder and its teachings. Above, the gunmen kill a police officer . Challenge: The aim of the campaign is to place that religion – Islam – above the level of all other religions or ideas and make it immune from criticism. Above, two armed men flee the scene after the attack this morning . The aim of the campaign is to place that religion – Islam – above the level of all other religions or ideas and make it immune from criticism. And the tactic is working. This campaign has been gathering pace for at least 25 years. It really started in the West in 1989 after the publication of Salman Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses, which contained passages considered deeply offensive by some Muslims. The novel resulted in Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issuing a fatwa – a religious judgment, in this case a death sentence – on Rushdie that forced the author into hiding. Though Rushdie survived, the fatwa was followed by the murder of a translator of his works and knife attacks on two others. Then, as now, some people claimed that Rushdie had been deliberately provocative. Then, as now, even if that were the case it would matter not a jot. No society can be considered truly free if its members are terrorised into silence and hiding by fatwas and mortal threats. Even so, ever since the Rushdie affair, most authors, artists and publishers have avoided producing anything that might stoke the ire of fundamentalist Muslims. Of course it is important to state that the great majority of Muslims are peaceful, law-abiding citizens, who abhor violence. Indeed yesterday Muslim leaders in Britain were among the first to condemn the Paris atrocity. Threats: The campaign began after the publication of Salman Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses, which contained passages considered deeply offensive by some Muslims. The author, above, was forced into hiding . Nevertheless, there have been a very troubling number of attacks carried out in the name of Islam on those in the West considered to have criticised or shown a lack of respect to the religion. In 2004, the Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh was shot, stabbed and partially decapitated in broad daylight on a Dutch street. His killer, Mohammed Bouyeri, objected to a film van Gogh had made which criticised some of the Koran’s teachings about women. Fear works. It breeds self-censorship. In 2005 the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten discovered that no illustrator in Denmark would depict Islam’s founder for a series of children’s books on world religions. The paper commissioned a dozen cartoonists to break this apparent taboo and published the results. The subsequent furore saw burnings and lootings of Danish Embassies across the Middle East and threats against Danes worldwide. Confronted: Film-maker Theo van Gogh was shot, stabbed and partially decapitated in daylight on a street over a film he had made that critisised some of the Koran’s teachings about women . Having investigated and written about the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and its effects on our society for some 15 years, I came to know some of those involved in that Danish newspaper, as well as those at Charlie Hebdo, the French magazine attacked yesterday. I began to realise how they had to endure constant threats to their safety, yet they continued to publish because they believed supremely in the right to freedom of expression, the right to make jokes about anyone and any subject, however powerful or revered they may be. Charlie Hebdo is a satirical, secular, punchy magazine which has picked up themes most people wanted to ignore. In the wake of the 2005 Danish cartoons furore, it was about the only magazine that, sticking to its principles, chose to print any depiction of Islam’s founding prophet. The magazine, which laughs at all religions, politics and beliefs, argued that if you are to be free you cannot allow any ideology to hold such a privileged position as to be above criticism. And so they lampooned Mohammed, and ISIS – as well as other targets like critics of Islam and the Far Right politician Marine le Pen. After an issue that played on the magazine’s name and sharia law with the title ‘Charia Hebdo’, and mercilessly mocked Islamic fundamentalists, a firebomb was thrown into its offices. Its editor – who died yesterday, along with his police protection officer – received constant death threats. But Charlie Hebdo magazine was not alone in being targeted for daring to poke fun. In 2010 one of the Danish cartoonists was confronted in his home by an axe-wielding Islamist trained by the Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab. A different cartoonist from Sweden, Lars Vilks, was targeted for death in a separate attack. Across Europe I have encountered countless people – Muslim, ex-Muslim and non-Muslim – who have faced death threats. Two years ago a 70-year-old friend of mine in Denmark – the historian and journalist Lars Hedegaard, who founded a Free Press Society in the wake of the cartoons affair – woke to a ring from the postman. Daring: Charlie Hebdo lampooned Mohammed, and ISIS – as well as other targets like critics of Islam and the Far Right politician Marine le Pen. Above, the paper's editor and cartoonist, Stephane Charbonnier . But the man at the door was not the postman. He was a young man with a gun who fired at Lars’s head at almost point-blank range. Miraculously he missed. As Lars struggled with his would-be assassin on his own doorstep, the man fired again. The gun jammed and the culprit ran off. If you have seen and studied these cases of assassination and attempted assassination as many times as I have you notice certain patterns emerging. One of the most common is for Western apologists for these terrorists to suggest that the victims have provoked the rage of fundamentalists – and they have therefore brought it upon themselves. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The only people responsible for the carnage in this insidious and evil campaign to stamp out our freedoms are the thugs and murderers who carry it out. In galleries, newspapers and magazines every day and week of the year there are works of art and articles that offend mainstream Christians. Cartoons abound at Christmas depicting the Three Wise Men or the Virgin Mary with a humorous twist; there are revolting and puerile cards whose Christmas messages contain foul language. Imagine that a Christian – any Christian – were to have responded to those cartoons or images by decapitating or gunning down the editor or staff of the magazine, newspaper or art gallery in question. Would we blame his victims, saying they had provoked the outrage? I think it highly unlikely. Politicians in France have in the past dismissed Charlie Hebdo as radicals of the Left and ‘provocateurs’ – although one would hope yesterday’s events will shock them out of complacency. The fact is this challenge to our freedoms from radical Islam is real and happening now. If mainstream politicians ignore or shy away from it, tragedy beckons for all of us.","Paris attack is latest in long campaign to shut down criticism of Islam .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers and his new girlfriend headed up a pack of the club's stars and their WAGs on a night out in the city to celebrate a players birthday. The pair were seen smiling and laughing as they made their way into Secret nightclub in Liverpool city centre on Tuesday night to celebrate player Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday. Mr Rodgers and his girlfriend Charlotte Searle, formerly Hind, were both smartly dressed for the occasion - with the results of Mr Rodgers' dramatic image overhaul evident. Scroll down for video... Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers also celebrated Skrtel's birthday by attending the party with girlfriend Charlotte Hind . Steven Gerrard, pictured in Liverpool on Tuesday night to celebrate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday, will finalise his move to LA Galaxy on Wednesday . Liverpool's squad turn out for Srktel's birthday bash. (back row): Mamadou Sakho, Jon Flanagan, Jose Enrique, Jordan Williams, Emre Can, Danny Ward, Simon Mignolet, Brad Jones; (middle row): Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini, Suso, Joe Allen; (front row): Alberto Moreno, Lucas, Philippe Coutinho, Steven Gerrard, Skrtel . The wives and girlfriends of the Liverpool stars turn out for the evening in the city centre . 1 - Unknown; 2 - Amy Lambert (Rickie Lambert) ; 3 – Charlotte Hind (Brendan Rodgers’ girlfriend); 4 – Javi Manquillo’s girlfriend; 5 – Laura Johnson (Glen Johnson); 6 – Barbara Lovasova (Martin Skrtel’s wife); 7 – Erin O’Neill (Fabio Borini’s girlfriend); 8 – Dani Lawrence (Brad Jones’ wife); 9 – Amy Jaine (Jose Enrique’s girlfriend); 10 – Suso’s girlfriend; 11 – Aine Coutinho (Philippe Coutinho); 12 – Unknown; 13 – LiLia Granadilla (Alberto Moreno’s girlfriend); 14 – Unknown . The Liverpool manager split from his wife of 12 years Susan, mother of his two children, over a year ago. Since taking on one of the top jobs in football, the 41-year-old has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight through sessions in the club gym, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat. He has since started a relationship with mother-of one Ms Searle, 31, who used to work at Liverpool FC as a travel coordinator. The glamorous blonde, who has a young daughter with former husband Steven Hind, was wearing a pale pink coat accessorised with nude heels. The night out to an official club function has appeared to cement their public status as a couple. Also pictured heading to the club was Rickie Lambert  who was pictured with wife Amy, front . Glen Johnson also attended with partner Laura as the team celebrated Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday . The team were on a night out to Secret nightclub in Liverpool . Her hair was swept into a smart ponytail and she carried a small rectangular black clutch bag. Northern Irishman Mr Rodgers, who has developed a somewhat warmer glow to his skin since he joined the club, was wearing a charcoal grey blazer and trousers, paired with trainers. Also on the night out was captain Steven Gerrard who is expected to finalise his transfer to US team LA Galaxy today. The 34-year-old Liverpool captain has agreed an 18-month contract, worth £3.9million a year, to move to California and will start playing in the MLS when their mid-season transfer window opens in July. Javi Manquillo and Alberto Moreno are all smiles as they make their way to Skrtel's birthday party . Jose Enrique (left) and his partner Amy Jaine pose outside the city centre venue . Summer signings Lazar Markovic, Alberto Moreno and Rickie Lambert were also in attendance along with defenders Glen Johnson, Luis Enrique and Javier Manquillo. Gerrard revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, Europe and the Middle East. But he also revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England. When he ended his England career after the World Cup, it was with the intention of committing to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until last November. Lazar Markovic (right) appeared in good spirits as he left a car and walked into the city centre nightspot . ‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool. ‘I didn’t want my club games to be tailored. My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. ‘It is all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. There’s no blame and I’m not angry about it. ‘There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. Liverpool FC have been unbelievable for me since I was eight. This club has helped me fulfil my dreams.’ Manager Rodgers had wanted to keep Gerrard at Anfield and the iconic midfielder insisted again that the decision to part was amicable; he made his decision after Rodgers revealed he would be tailoring his game time next season.","Mr Rodgers and his girlfriend Charlotte Searle were out with the club .

"An unarmed man killed by a Montana police officer during a traffic stop was told repeatedly to raise his hands before the officer shot him three times, according to video footage shown Tuesday during an inquest into the shooting. Billings Police Officer Grant Morrison shot 38-year-old Richard Ramirez in April when authorities said Ramirez — a suspect in a recent drug-involved shooting — appeared to reach for something during the traffic stop. In the previously unreleased video from a patrol car dash-cam, Morrison could be heard yelling 'Hands up!' at least six times before firing three shots into the vehicle in rapid succession. Police video footage of the April 2014 shooting of Richard Ramirez by Billings Police Officer Grant Morrison, (screen) is shown to a seven-person jury in Billings, Montana . Richard Ramirez had been wanted in an armed robbery and ignored the officer's orders, making a sudden movement during a traffic stop . The actions of Ramirez could not be seen in the footage. The two-day inquest will determine if Morrison was justified in the killing. It comes amid heightened scrutiny of law enforcement and recent nationwide protests in response to police killings of unarmed suspects including in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. Detective Brett Kruger, who investigated the shooting in Billings, testified that two cellophane bags with a small amount of methamphetamine and a syringe were later found near where Ramirez had been sitting in the backseat of the vehicle. Kruger said Ramirez had two outstanding warrants and was trying to get the drugs out of his pocket to avoid arrest. Two of the three people in the car with Ramirez testified that Morrison's commands for them to raise their hands were clear. Both said they were in the front seat and couldn't see if Ramirez complied. The person sitting next to Ramirez, Tom Black, told The Associated Press in the days after the shooting that Ramirez was trying to unbuckle his seatbelt when he was shot. Police dash cam footage shows as Officer Morrison makes his approach (left) and gets ready to fire (right) In 2013, Morrison shot and killed another man during a traffic stop after the man reached for something that was later determined to be a BB gun. An inquest cleared Morrison of wrongdoing in that case. A seven-person jury will decide if Morrison acted appropriately in the killing of Ramirez and advise prosecutors on whether charges should be pursued. Montana law requires an inquest whenever someone is killed by law enforcement or dies in custody. Morrison was expected to testify when the inquest resumes Wednesday. Before Ramirez was shot, Morrison recognized him as the suspect in a shooting the night before where authorities had recovered 90 grams of methamphetamine, Senior Deputy Yellowstone County Attorney Ed Zink said. 'His hand goes up and down two or three times in his pocket while officer Morrison was screaming at him,' Zink said about Ramirez. Ramirez's sister Julie (left) consoles her mother, Betty Ramirez, during court proceedings over the cop shoot . About a dozen Ramirez family members and supporters attended the inquest. Most wore T-shirts with an image of him. Sister Julie Ramirez said outside the inquest that the family wants Morrison charged with murder. She noted that her family is half-Mexican and accused the police of racial profiling in the case. 'He could have tased my brother or called for backup,' Julie Ramirez said. 'When Officer Morrison got out of that patrol car he knew he was going to kill my brother.' Two of Morrison's co-workers, Sgt. Matthew Brewer and Officer Mark Snider, testified that on the night before his death, Ramirez was identified as the suspect in a shooting across town. Morrison was aware of that information and had been searching for Ramirez with other officers, testimony showed. A distraught Officer Morrison is comforted by a fellow officer after using his gun in the line of duty . Brewer and Snider said Ramirez was known to them as a methamphetamine user, which Snider said can make suspects violent and uncontrollable. Members of the Ramirez family have acknowledged his drug use and previous arrests linked to drugs. However, they say that criminal history was wrongly used to rationalize his death. Ramirez was the fifth man to be fatally shot during a two-year period by law enforcement in Billings, Montana's most populous city. Last week, the wife of one of those people, Daniel Brawley, filed a civil rights lawsuit in Montana District Court against the City of Billings and Officer David Punt, seeking damages for alleged excessive use of force. Brawley was shot by Punt after being arrested in a burglary and trying to escape in Punt's patrol car, striking the officer. An inquest into Brawley's death determined Punt's actions were justified. The city has not formally responded to the lawsuit, but Billings Police spokesman Lt. R.D. Harper said Tuesday the inquest confirmed Punt did not use excessive force.

"A former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader faces a final case review in March on charges that she raped a teenage boy and provided other minors with alcohol. A case review for 47-year-old Molly Shattuck, of Maryland, had been scheduled for Wednesday, but there were no issues to bring before the judge. The final case review was scheduled for March 18. Shattuck was indicted in November on charges of third-degree rape, unlawful sexual contact and providing alcohol to minors. She has pleaded not guilty. Scroll down for video . Final: Molly Shattuck, 47, former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader faces a final case review in March on charges that she raped a teenage boy and provided other minors with alcohol . Instagram: Shattuck's alleged inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old boy began on Instagram with Shattuck reportedly sending the teen provocative messages . A lawyer for the mother-of-three, who is free on $84,000 bail, discussed the woman's case with prosecutors but said Shattuck does not plan on altering her not-guilty plea, the Detroit Free Press reports. Shattuck's alleged inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old boy began on Instagram with Shattuck reportedly sending the teen provocative messages, the Baltimore Sun reports. The teen reportedly sent Shattuck pictures of himself via text message and police say she picked the teen up from summer school during lunch breaks several times. Police say the two would 'talk and eat and then get in the back of the car and kiss or make out.' The Free Press reports that Shattuck and the boy reportedly met for romantic encounters in the back seat of her car. Labor Day: The inappropriate relationship with the teen culminated when she allegedly performed oral sex twice on the boy at a rented beach house over Labor Day weekend. During Labor Day weekend, the Sun reports that Shattuck rented a beach house for her teenage son and his friends -- the victim included. It was then that Shattuck allegedly purchased beer for the boys and later performed oral sex on the 15-year-old at least twice. She offered to have sex with the teen, but he declined, police say. The next day, the boy's parents picked him up from the beach house and his family reported Shattuck to the police on Sept. 26. Divorced: Nearly one month before her indictment, Shattuck's now ex-husband, Mayo Shattuck, a prominent Maryland energy executive, divorced Shattuck after rumors of the scandal spread throughout the small community of Owings Mills, MD . Cheerleader: In 2005, Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad. The Baltimore native is also a fitness consultant and advocate as well as an author . Nearly one month before her indictment, Shattuck's now ex-husband, Mayo Shattuck, a prominent Maryland energy executive, divorced Shattuck after rumors of the scandal spread throughout the small community of Owings Mills, MD. It is unknown whether Shattuck was offered a plea deal, however a plea deal could sentence Shattuck to a lesser penalty than if she were found guilty at trial. The Sun reports that the terms of a  plea deal could likely require Shattuck to register as a sex offender. The label could bar Shattuck from attending events at her children's schools.

"Liverpool: . Olympiacos: . Raheem Sterling scored the only goal of the game early on as Liverpool beat Olympiacos 1-0 in Chicago in their first group game of the International Champions Cup. Sterling turned home Daniel Sturridge's mishit in the fifth minute, as Liverpool failed to build on a quick start against the Greek champions. See how the match panned out by scrolling through the text commentary below. Host commentator . Host commentator . Host commentator . An opportunity for both sides in the final moments as Brad Jones makes a good save for Liverpool, before Ibe breaks and nearly finds Joe Allen with a reverse pass. So, Liverpool open up their International Champions Cup campaign with a win... but we probably expected more goals after Sterling put the Reds ahead after 5 minutes. Some rustiness from Liverpool, and they face Manchester City on Wednesday night . Not sure what to make of this performance from a Liverpool perspective. Solid in some areas, unconvincing in others. Olympiacos have had more than enough opportunities to score, while Liverpool have only had one clear-cut opportunity from which they scored. The performance of Lazar Markovic, though, will be encouraging to all Reds fans. The Serbian was perhaps Liverpool's best player. What an opportunity for Bouchalakis as Joe Allen gives away possession in the worst possible area - central, with no cover and 40 yards from goal. Bouchalakis speeds through, skipping through Kelly but he can't reach the ball after going round Brad Jones. He didn't go down after the challenge from the goalkeeper, but perhaps he should have. 'More changes and now Raheem Sterling’s afternoon is over. He spoke impressively on Friday about how he will deal with the expectation and pressure that is going to be on him next season but he has the tools to deal with that; this was an exciting cameo from the 19-year-old, one that augurs well for him developing again when it really matters.' Coutinho, who has looked very bright since coming on, unleashes a piling effort from 25 yards, which fizzes just wide of the Olympiacos goal. Daniel Sturridge comes off for Lambert, as Sterling makes way for Jordan Ibe. Olympiacos still pressing forward in search of an equaliser, and Bouchalakis, who scored a superb goal against AC Milan on Thursday, hits one high and wide over Jones' goal. And here's Raheem Sterling giving Liverpool the lead early on (Getty) Coutinho does brilliantly well to give the ball to Robinson but his cross evades everyone, and then at the other end Martin Skrtel makes another superb interception from Kasami's through ball. More changes on their way for Liverpool on the hour mark, with Lucas, Coates and Kelly coming on for Johnson, Toure and Gerrard . Papadopolous has a shot from range, and Jones had to show some interest in it as it nearly creeps in the Liverpool goal. It's been a bit flat here from Liverpool, as it was in Boston last week. Rodgers will want the intensity to increase soon, especially given Manchester City's ruthless 5-1 win over AC Milan earlier tonight. 'The substitutions have started and Liverpool have replaced the lively Lazar Markovic and Emre Can, as well as left-back Jose Enrique, with Philippe Coutinho, Joe Allen and Jack Robinson. Coutinho is a player whose progress needs charting this summer. 'Rodgers has described him as “the brain” of Liverpool’s team but for all his talent, there is no guarantee yet that he is going to be a starter from the word go. Should he play as he did against Roma on Wednesday, however, Coutinho might make Rodgers’ decision easy. 'He looked like a high-class performer in Boston and maybe this challenge will inspire him further.' So unlucky for Gevorg Ghazaryan, who gets into the penalty area on the break and strikes the woodwork from 15 yards. Jones was rooted to the spot. Dossevi then gets a few yards of space in a similar area, but his shot dragged just wide to the left of Jones' goal. Coutinho, Allen and Robinson come on for Enrique, Emre Can and Lazar Markovic. Skrtel gets a vital touch on the ball after a dangerous ball into the box nearly found Dossevi. Olympiacos have been competitive so far, and have worried Liverpool throughout. Olympiacos are keeping the ball beautifully around Liverpool's penalty area, with Saviola dropping deep to get involved. The ball drops to the Argentine Saviola, with just Jones to beat, but Enrique recovers well to put the ball out for a corner. The corner goes short and finds Diamantakos, but his effort drags wide. Markovic slips through two tackles on the left corner of the penalty area, and his curling effort has too much on it as it goes two yards high and wide. Great play from the 20-year-old Serbian, who has looked exciting so far. Glen Johnson calmly clears the ball under pressure, but it's Olympiacos with the ball so far... until Liverpool break through Markovic and Sterling... but the latter's ball can't find Jordan Henderson, who would have had a one-on-one on the left. Gerrard's corner is punched clear by Megyeri in the Olympiacos goal. 'Interesting to watch Steven Gerrard operating here. When Liverpool played Olympiakos in the Champions League 10 years ago, Gerrard was a marauding midfielder, who operated high and dynamically around the opposition area. 'Now, in this new role, Gerrard sits deep and performs like a quarter-back, dropping deep, splitting his central defenders and launching attacks. His influence on this team going forward should not be understated. 'As for the atmosphere here, it is lively without being anything you would associate with the Premier League. Suggestions that Soldier Field would be full to its 61,000 capacity have proven a little over optimistic.' Aha, there's a glimpse of Lazar Markovic in full flow. The new signing paces through the Olympiacos midfield before being brought down on the edge of the area cynically. He limps off but should be okay... as Sturridge's free-kick hits the wall before Gerrard's follow up goes well wide. Saviola brings a great blocked save out of Jones, but he is called offside after a quickly-taken free-kick on the left. It nearly, very nearly, caught out the Liverpool defence, who are living dangerously at the moment. Olympiacos attack again, and Dossevi has a chance to blast the ball on the volley, but it's blocked well by Skrtel. Liverpool haven't got into too much of a rhythm since scoring, as Jose Enrique cleans up with Saviola looking dangerous for the Greek side. 'So here we are in Soldier Field and there is a good chance this Liverpool side will be close to how Brendan Rodgers lines up on the first day of the campaign against Southampton. 'Steven Gerrard is lying deep with Emre Can and Jordan Henderson alongside, while Raheem Sterling – scorer of Liverpool’s first goal here – Lazar Markovic and Daniel Sturridge are providing the threat. 'The defence will be reshaped, especially as Dejan Lovren has just signed, but this is the base Rodgers will work off.' Johnson loses the ball Ghazaryan, who piles into the box, but his curling effort doesn't trouble Brad Jones, going wide of the goal. That was poor from Johnson, who predictably turned inside towards Jones, and wasn't fouled by the Olympiacos man. Raheem Sterling! It was a tad fortunate, but Liverpool won't care about that. They lead after five minutes at Soldier Field. Sturridge wound up a long shot from outside the area, but he missed his kick. Luckily, the ball fell nicely into the path of Raheem Sterling to tuck away from six yards. 1-0 to Liverpool. Liverpool, wearing their 'Dennis the Menace' style third kit, get us underway at Soldier Field, home to the Chicago Bears NFL team. Steven Gerrard is leading his team-mates out of the tunnel and onto the pitch Solider Field in Chicago. Game looks set to kick-off about 10 minutes late as it stands, but stay with us for all the action as it happens. Manchester City are currently dishing out a severe beating to AC Milan. Manuel Pellegrini's men are 5-1 up courtesy of two goals from Stevan Jovetic and strikes from Scott Sinclair, Jesus Navas and Kelechi Iheanacho. Starting XI: Megyeri, Abidal, Papadopolous, Siovas, Do Carmo, Ghazaryan, Maniatis, N'Dinga, Diamantakos, Dossevi, Saviola . Loic Remy's move to Merseyside is OFF after the QPR striker failed his medical.

"A foundation created to honor a firefighter killed on Sept. 11 has raised enough money to pay off the mortgages and make repairs on the homes of two slain New York Police Department officers. The Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation said $860,000 has been donated, and another $150,000 has been pledged for the families of Detectives Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

The widows of the men, along with other family members, attended the announcement, along with an audience made up primarily of police officers including members of the men's precinct. Other speakers included police and fire department officials, along with former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 'We would like to extend our greatest gratitude and appreciation to everyone who gave their generous contribution,' said Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen. In a tear-choked voice, she added, 'To all my extended blue family, be safe out there and appreciate life each day.'

'Nothing will ever bring my brother back, but just to know my sister-in-law and the boys can sleep just a little bit better amidst this tragedy' means a great deal, she said. The foundation says the money will be used to pay off mortgages and make repairs to the homes, with any extra going to the two families. They reached out to the banks to get the payoff amounts. Foundation CEO Frank Siller said there had been over 10,000 donations, coming from all over the country and internationally.

"Preston 'Pret' Dahlgren has led what might seem like a picture-perfect Mormon life: He met his high school sweetheart in Sunday school as a teenager, completed his mission and married her. He is active in the church and the proud father of two young daughters. Dahlgren also is attracted to men. His story is the subject of a new TV show called 'My Husband's Not Gay.' And while it may shock some, Mormon leaders have spoken in support of the controversial series. 'While the church does not promote marriage as a treatment method for same-sex attraction, couples who are trying to be lovingly supportive of each other while being true to their religious convictions deserve our support and respect,' said church spokesman Eric Hawkins. Scroll down for video... 'Deserve our support': Preston and Megan Dahlgren hold their daughter Naomi as they pose for a photograph Monday near Salt Lake City. Two Utah men set to appear in the reality TV show My Husband's Not Gay, say they're fulfilled in their relationships to their wives even though they're attracted to other men . Co-stars: Jeff Bennion and his wife Tanya kiss in front of their home near Salt Lake City. The concept of My Husband's Not Gay has come under fire since it was announced by the TLC network last month . Meanwhile, gay-rights advocacy groups are calling irresponsible and dangerous. They want the TLC cable network to pull the plug on the program before it airs Sunday. Dahlgren and another Mormon man from Utah featured in the show say they're happy in their marriages, and they hope the program shows gives stories like theirs a foothold in the conversation about sexuality. Dahlgren said he's known he was attracted to men since he was about 12 years old, but he also always wanted the kind of family he grew up in: a father, mother and children. 'There are a lot of stories out there, and this just isn't one of them,' Preston Dahlgren, 32, said in an interview with The Associated Press this week. The gay rights group GLAAD, however, says the show sends the wrong message and is a sad reminder of so-called gay conversion therapy, often faith-based efforts designed to change sexual orientation that can be emotionally scarring. New Jersey and California in 2013 banned therapists from practicing gay conversion therapy on children and teenagers. The American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association do not support the therapy. As pro-gay groups like GLAAD vent outrage over the show's premise, the LDS Church has spoken out in support of the unlikely TV stars . 'No one can change who they love, and, more importantly, no one should have to,' GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. 'By investing in this dangerous programming, TLC is putting countless young LGBT people in harm's way.' The organization pointed to a change.org petition asking TLC to cancel the show that so far has gathered more than 80,000 signatures. Responding to GLAAD, the network says it will tell compelling stories about different ways of life, and the four men on the hourlong show speak only for themselves. Jeff Bennion, 44, met his wife, Tanya, more than 13 years ago after he had dated men. He told her he was attracted to men after they'd been dating for about a year and a half. 'I was devastated because I didn't know what that meant for me,' said Tanya Bennion, 42. She worried that he'd cheat on her with a friend but said the couple's strong connection helped her work through her questions. Megan Dahlgren says her marriage remains strong, including the physical aspects of their relationship.  'We do have a happy, healthy sex life,' she said. Dahlgren and Bennion both said their upbringing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was a big part of why they wanted to remain in a husband-and-wife relationship. 'I would say it was part of my decision early on, especially, and a big influencer of that,' Dahlgren said. 'It certainly helped guide me toward where I'm at today, no doubt about it.' Jeff Bennion said he would be horrified if a parent told a gay child that they should be more like one of the men on the show. 'That's not anything that I would support or agree with,' he said. But Bennion said that he's happy with his wife and their 6-year-old son. 'I can't believe how lucky I am,' he said. Dahlgren and Bennion both said their upbringing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was a big part of why they wanted to remain in a husband-and-wife relationship. 'My Husband's Not Gay' is not the only show about people from Utah in unusual marriages. TLC also airs the shows 'Sister Wives' and 'My Five Wives' about polygamous unions.","Church leaders say Salt Lake City men in show My Husband's Not Gay deserve our support .

"You no longer have to rely on an honest friend to tell you whether your breath smells unpleasant - now there's an app for that. Breathometer, a San Francisco-based company that previously launched a Bluetooth breathalyzer last year, has created Mint, a new gadget that assesses both the quality and hydration level of your breath. A small device that's placed in the mouth automatically draws an air sample and, seconds later, the Breathometer smartphone app reveals whether you're minty fresh or breathing fire.

Users receive a 'mint score' between one and five, letting them know whether they're 'good to go' or 'need a mint'. 'Breath quality, it turns out, is something a lot of consumers aren't aware of,' Breathometer CEO Charles Yim told Yahoo. 'It is very indicative of your overall body health. It helps you see the earlier signs in your oral cavity first. So when we say breath quality, it’s more than just bad breath.'

Mint detects odor by measuring the volatile sulfur compounds in your mouth, which the company says can also indicate gum disease or tooth decay. The gadget also measures the moisture level of your mouth's mucus membrane and lets you know whether you need a glass of water. Breathometer is currently seeking support for the invention via the crowd-funding site Indiegogo, where it has already raised $26,420, exceeding its goal of $25,000.

"My mother, Joha, was a massive stickler for housework, and ran the house in which I grew up as though it were a military operation. Our home was spotless, but she rarely got to enjoy one of her delicious Sunday lunches, because she was too busy cleaning the kitchen afterwards. That’s why, after growing up and having two sons of my own — Rory, 23, and 19-year-old Ewan — I adopted a little mantra, which is that a home needs to be clean enough to be healthy and dirty enough to be happy, otherwise it gets in the way of living your life. Scroll down for video . Aggie's (pictured) mother was a stickler for cleaning too, and ran their house like a military operation . This may shock a lot people who think of me as something of a hygiene champion because I was co-presenter of the long-running television series How Clean Is Your House? It certainly surprised many when I admitted on the Today programme last week that I don’t always change the bed sheets between guests. In fact, I say it’s fine to have a hygiene hierarchy, where relatives of the same sex do not require a change of bed linen every time they stay. As far as men under the age of 25 are concerned, it’s a rule-free zone. They rarely notice. With that in mind, I’ve compiled a little list of my lazy-lady tips which can help keep your house looking decent — without unmasking your inner slob. QUICK CRISP SHEETS . Ironing your bed linen while still on the bed can work wonders . There once was a time when I happily spent my spare time ironing bed linen. It didn’t last long, particularly once I’d had children and realised I could be spending the time more productively, either with them or on the sofa with a glass of wine. Of course, there’s no denying freshly ironed sheets look lovely — it’s just a shame that getting them is so time-consuming, particularly if you’re dealing with an unwieldy king-size duvet cover. So these days, if I want to please my guests, I simply iron the pillowcases and then give the top of the duvet cover a quick once-over with the iron when it’s in situ on the bed. It’s amazing how much it looks as though you have done the whole thing. Incidentally, ‘waffle pattern’ duvet covers don’t need ironing at all — something you might want to bear in mind if you’re sale-shopping for new bed linen. INSTANTLY PLUMP AND PERFUMED PILLOWS . Freshen up your cushions and pillows by throwing them in the tumble dryer for ten minutes . Often the illusion of cleanliness is as good as the real deal. I’m a stickler for keeping my upholstery fresh, but even I have to concede that not everyone has the time to wash cushions and pillows every few weeks. You can, however, freshen them up by popping them in the tumble dryer for ten minutes with one or two scented fabric-softening dryer sheets, which will easily mask ingrained smells without going to the aggravation of washing and drying them. On the same theme, a few drops of tea-tree oil on a cotton wool ball rubbed along the edge of a radiator can do wonders in eliminating stale odours for a while — a particularly handy tip if you have guests who may wander into a teenage boy’s toxic bedroom. VACUUM-FREE STAIRS . I rarely vacuum my stairs but use a dustpan and stiff bristle brush instead, which does just as good a job in a fraction of the time. Believe me, by the time you’ve gone to the faff of hauling the vacuum cleaner out of the cupboard and fitting the assorted attachments required to do the job, it’s far less effort to get down on your knees and brush them. After all, it’s what our mothers and grandmothers did, and their stairs were always spotless. The old-fashioned method also has the advantage of protecting your paintwork from bashes with the vacuum-cleaner, not to mention eliminating the trip hazard of having a cable snaking up and down your stairs. Just make sure people take their outdoor shoes off before they go anywhere near the carpet to minimise dirt. WASH-UP YOUR CLOTHES . Got a stain on your jumper? Rub in a bit of washing up liquid to remove grease stains . On a similar theme, I often bypass the washing machine when it comes to clothes, and instead use a trick handed down by my dear old mum who, despite her endless rota of housework, did the laundry only once a week. If we ever had a stain on a jumper or skirt/trousers, she would give it a quick scrub with a damp cloth mixed with a dash of washing-up liquid, which is, after all, designed to cut through grease, until it had disappeared. I always used to do this with my boys’ clothes when they were little, and I still do it with my own to this day. SOCK IT TO THE FLOOR . This is an easy two-for-the-price-of-one cheat: if you have guests arriving for Sunday lunch and your floor needs a quick scrub after all your food preparation, you can get it washed and dried in half the time if you wear a pair of towelling socks over your slippers while you mop. That way, you can walk over the wet surface without making muddy marks and dry the floor as you go. If you use the rubbish bin in place of a bucket to hold your detergent, you can give your bin a quick clean at the same time. SCRATCH SCUFFS WITH TEA . Wooden floors may look lovely, but they can also easily get scratched and stained, particularly if the wood is untreated, as it is in my study. I’ve been known to move furniture around when guests come, to hide stubborn marks, but in recent years I have hit upon this novel way to save scrubbing and sanding. Make a pot of strong tea, leave it to cool a little then apply it to the scratches using a damp kitchen cloth. Of course, you may have to experiment with the strength of tea depending on the type of wood — but once you hit the mark, this cheap remedy can save hours on your hands and knees. STEAM CLEAN THE MICROWAVE . Want a sparkly clean microwave? Put in a bowl of hot water with lemon slices and turn it on high . It’s years since I have wasted elbow grease scrubbing my microwave. Now, I employ a foolproof short-cut which removes even the most stubborn of stains — put a heatproof bowl half-filled with hot water and a few lemon slices inside the microwave before turning it on high for five minutes. BABY-WIPE YOUR BATHROOM . Never underestimate the power of a pack of baby wipes, which are great for performing a quick and instant clean-up on most surfaces. I keep a pack in my car and run one over the dashboard and steering wheel every few weeks to keep the dirt and dust at bay — it takes less than 30 seconds to do, but makes your car look as though it’s been valeted. I’m not above swooshing one over my bathroom surfaces either when time is of the essence — combined with a quick squirt of detergent down the loo, you can mask a multitude of sins.","Lots of hard to reach areas or stains you just can't seem to remove?

"In the period drama Downton Abbey, servants are portrayed as loyal, deferential and discreet. But experts claim that finding a modern-day butler with such traits can be a tall order. Estate agent Knight Frank claims that after debt, death and divorce, staffing problems are one of the main reasons behind the sale of country homes. While some aspire to own a sprawling estate complete with a gardener, housekeeper, nanny and butler, the dream can turn into a nightmare, it is claimed. Finding good staff like Carson in Downton Abbey, played by Jim Carter (right), is becoming a burden for  upper class country home onwers, with good workers 'like gold dust', estate agents Knight Frank has said . In its latest ‘rural report’, Knight Frank said that many customers simply cannot find the staff. This upper-class problem may attract little sympathy, but experts claim that employing workers for a country house ‘can be a burden without expert help or advice’. The report said issues around recruitment and retention were common problems, while some employees are litigious and ready to sue their boss if they feel their rights are breached. It said: ‘Staffing issues – especially if they ever reach the court – can be extremely costly, in terms as time and personal angst, as well as money. ‘It is vital to keep abreast of any new rules to avoid being sued by disgruntled employees. ‘People are becoming increasingly well-informed about their rights and litigious, especially if they have a high-profile employer.’ Social media has also caused a fresh headache for employers, who could find their secrets splashed across Facebook or Twitter by disgruntled or indiscreet workers. Knight Frank said anyone hiring staff should ensure they sign confidentiality agreements which includes social media, saying: ‘Domestic staff in particular may have access to very personal aspects of your life, things that you probably don’t want shared with the entire world.’ Knight Frank said staff should sign confidentiality agreements to protect the personal lives of their employers from being exposed, as happened in the trial of the aides to Nigella Lawson and ex-husband Charles Saatchi . Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband and art dealer Charles Saatchi found their own personal lives exposed after a much-publicised court case involving their assistants Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo. The Grillo sisters were found not guilty in December 2013 of defrauding the former couple of hundreds of thousands of pounds while working for them at their Belgravia townhouse. But during the trial, details of Saatchi and Lawson’s rocky marriage and lifestyles emerged. Francesca Grillo claimed she typically started cleaning at 6am and would often still be getting texts about work from the art dealer at just before midnight. She also said Miss Lawson seemed 'unhappy' in the marriage and claimed her unsociable husband blocked her attempts to break into the US market. Yesterday, Knight Frank said a rise in overseas millionaires buying property in the UK meant the demand for good private staff now outweighed supply – enabling the top workers to name their price. Carson is a much-loved butler in Downton Abbey, but finding staff like him is proving to be difficult . Angus Harley, who heads Knight Frank’s consultancy service finding staff for the super-wealthy, said: ‘Owning a country house can very quickly become unenjoyable if the people they have hired are not looking after it as they would like. ‘Good workers are like gold dust and they do not tend to move around often.’ He said that many wealthy people tried to hire couples so that one could do the housekeeping and cooking while the other did outdoor work such gardening, driving and security. However, such arrangements also came with drawbacks, he said, should the couple split up. Mr Harley also urged people to carry out full checks to ensure applicants had no debts, driving infringements or criminal records, claiming he had come across ‘in-post butlers who have done time for burglary’. All is not lost for those who find themselves forced to sell their country home after failing to find the right staff though. Knight Frank said those who found themselves unable to suitable workers for their rural abode simply bought ‘a chalet in the Alps’, which they did not have to staff all year round.","Country home owners struggling to find butlers, gardeners and nannies .

"An elderly grandmother died of pneumonia after yobs hurled a breeze block through her window – leaving her exposed to freezing temperatures on the coldest night of the year. June Green, 83, who had been the victim of three previous burglaries, stayed in her bedroom when she heard the noise and spent the next 12 hours huddled under blankets not daring to investigate. Raiders waited until she was asleep before entering the bungalow where she lived alone to steal a handbag containing a purse with around £60 cash from the bedroom. June Green (pictured) died aged 83 after developing pneumonia when yobs threw a brick through her front window on a freezing cold night . Five days after the break-in the widow developed pneumonia and was taken to hospital by ambulance. She died on Sunday – exactly a week later. Her family say police initially refused to attend the council house in Doncaster because it was a ‘damage only’ incident. However, action was only taken after the purse was found two days later at a local supermarket and Mrs Green’s daughter Gail Benson-Green complained. A police community support officer went to the property 90 minutes after Mrs Green's carer called the police to reassure her and carry out house to house enquiries. Yesterday Mrs Benson-Green, 59, blamed her mother’s death on the burglars – who are still being hunted. ‘I think the fact the window had been broken and she was left cold and in fear after what had happened are responsible for my mum’s death,’ she said. Mrs Green, a mother of two, had lived alone since her husband Neville, an engineer, died more than 20 years ago but was visited by carers. According to her daughter she had suffered three burglaries in the last decade – the latest about two years ago when jewellery was stolen by a conman who tricked her into briefly leaving the property. The following morning Mrs Green was found by carers shivering under blankets in her home (pictured) In the latest incident last month the pensioner was startled by the bang as the living room window was smashed and called her daughter, who lives 250 miles away in Gosport, Hampshire. Mrs Benson-Green, who claims her mother could have been killed by the breeze block had she not gone to bed early that night, said: ‘She didn’t seem to have realised the enormity of what had happened and the seriousness of the situation. ‘She must have just stayed in the bedroom and we now know that later on someone was hovering over her bed to steal her handbag which is always left in the same place near the bed.’ Temperatures that night plunged to around -6C, the coldest night of the year in England. The next morning Mrs Green’s carer called the police after arriving to find the window smashed and damage to the room. But even though there were scuff marks, officers allegedly refused to come out because it was not known if anything was missing. The following day Mrs Benson-Green was called by her local Asda supermarket where her mother’s purse had been found – with the cash missing. The pensioner was not told that burglars had crept into her bedroom for fear of upsetting her. But she realised her handbag was missing when she was about to be taken to hospital with a chest infection. ‘It was the last conversation I ever had with her and she was very distressed,’ said Mrs Benson-Green. Yesterday a police spokesman said inquiries into the ‘reported burglary’ were continuing, adding: ‘No arrests have been made and police continue to appeal for information.’ Last night the broken and boarded window had yet to be replaced with glass. Mrs Benson-Green added: 'When one of my mum's carers went round at 8.50 am the following .","On  December 28 yobs threw a breeze block through June Green's window .

"When Truffle the dog fell from a cliff, no-one could have imagined it would result in one of the most fun-filled, novel Summers of his life. The Sydney pooch broke both of his paws in his awful fall on Boxing Day, meaning he is completely incapable of moving with two bright green casts encasing his front legs. His owner, Peter Taylor, from Darlinghurst in Sydney inner eastern suburbs, was worried that his beloved pet would spend the summer cooped up in the apartment, unable to enjoy the sunshine. However, the dedicated owner had a brainwave - deciding that a stroller would be the perfect way to make sure that Truffle wouldn’t miss out on a second of the action. ‘It’s hysterical. Truffle has a look of glee on his face that I’ve never seen on that scale before when I wheel him around in the ‘Truf-mobile,’ Mr Taylor told Daily Mail Australia. The sight of Truffle the dog in his stroller, smiling happily with two casts on his front legs has been bringing smiles and laughter to everyone he encounters . Truffle is thrilled that he can join his best friend Enzo on their favourite daily walks in Sydney's sunshine . The pet's loving owner prepares to take his pooches on one of their walks, with Enzo on his lead and Truffle in his 'Truf-Mobile' ‘I love the little guys to bits and hated the thought of Truff being confined to a one bedroom apartment for up to six weeks...I only wish the solution didn't make me look quite as kooky as the stroller does!’ The result is both hilarious and incredibly sweet, as the pup is unable to contain his excitement every time he is strapped into the stroller, just like a child. Mr Taylor walks his dogs through the streets of his Kings Cross neighbourhood everyday – a place where these types of ‘kooky’ activities aren’t out of place! Although Truffle is enjoying every moment, Mr Taylor is a little more self-conscious, trying his best to ignore the funny looks they get while he pushes Truffle down the street . ‘I am worried that people think I’m attempting to channel a Hilton or a Kardashian with my dog in a stroller!’ laughs Mr Taylor. ‘In reality just trying to make sure my dogs, Truffle and Enzo, make the most of the summer and can get away from the apartment.’ ‘I’m so happy that Truffle is out of the house again and roaming the streets with his partner in crime, Enzo.’ He is a sweet-natured pup, which means he happily poses for hilarious snaps to his owner's delight . The normally energetic pup wasn't himself after the accident, and being confined to the home gave him a case of 'cabin fever', although his owner Peter Taylor says it was remarkable that he 'never complained' His two gorgeous dogs love being outside and before Truffle’s accident would swim in the harbour everyday, walking through beautiful park lands to Rushcutters Bay in Sydney’s east or Lady Macquarie’s Chair in the inner city. It was during one of these ventures that Truffle’s awful accident took place. ‘They are both Lagottos, a breed of Italian water dogs, so their favourite thing in the world is swimming. ‘After a swim on Boxing Day, we were walking to the top of a viewing platform near Lady Macquarie’s Chair when he slipped down a rock face.' It was a silly accident as 'there’s a bit of a ‘blonde’ element to Truffle,' explained Mr Taylor. 'He took one step too far and disappeared over the edge.' It was a tense, distressing moment when the shaggy-haired pup disappeared from view. ‘I heard a horrible scream from the footpath below and someone later told me that they saw a dog flying through the air,’ explains Mr Taylor. ‘Truffle’s best friend Enzo ran down to him straight away and we found a pretty crumpled Truffle down below.’ After the accident during a fun day of swimming and fun by Sydney's harbour (left), an  X-ray at the vets confirmed that he had broken both of his front paws (right) During the visit to the vets, despite the awful injuries he had suffered, Truffle remained smiley . They rushed him to the vet at nearby Potts Point where X-Rays confirmed that he had fractured both his front paws. ‘He was given plenty of TLC and wrapped up in plaster and bandages. They were bright orange casts but we just changed them to a bright green,’ said Mr Taylor. ‘He has little robot arms at the moment – he can lift them up and down but that’s about it!’ Although the pooch was very brave and ‘never once complained’, he developed ‘cabin fever’ and it very quickly became clear that Truffle needed to get outside and enjoy the sunshine; a challenge as he is completely incapable if moving. ‘I tried carrying him a few times but he’s close to 20 kilos so I could only carry him a couple of blocks.’ Truffle's owner says he did experience moments of cabin fever and was clearly missing his daily trips to the park and his active time in the sun . Both Peter Taylor's beloved dogs are very active. Mr Taylor walks them everyday, but so do other friends who stop by to visit the pups while he is at work, meaning their owner 'doesn't know what they get up to everyday, but they know everyone in the area, even people I've never seen before!' Mr Taylor had the ingenuous idea to ask if any of his friends had a spare stroller. It was an instant success. ‘Once I put him in there, he was like a duck to water. He couldn’t have been any happier,’ explained Mr Taylor. ‘He just loves being wheeled around on his ‘throne’, the Truf-Mobile,' ‘It’s party central for him!’ The sight of the pup strapped in his stroller like a baby has been quite the novelty, bringing smiles to the faces of strangers. They are frequently stopped by people who ask to take selfies with Truffle, who has a comical smile plastered to his face during every trip in his stroller. ‘He’s loving the attention, although I’m not a huge fan of all the looks we get from people in main street of Kings Cross,' said Mr Taylor. ‘He couldn’t be happier to smile and pose for selfies.’ Mr Taylor has shared lots of sweet pics on his Instagram, @pupsinthecity. Peter Taylor is trying to make sure Truffle enjoys his Summer as much as possible. The dog's casts have just been changed from orange to green during a check up, for a touch of variety! Although Mr Taylor does laugh that Truffle could become a diva and become attached to the stroller, long after his injuries have healed. ‘I just don’t know how he’ll return to normal life when the casts come off!’ the Darlinghurst resident laughed. An unexpected response has been the joy and laughter Truffle and his stroller is bringing to the streets of Kings Cross – a place which is home to some downtrodden and disadvantaged members of society. ‘You get the most sense of glee watching Truffle enjoy himself in his stroller!’ explains Mr Taylor. ‘It’s nice walking around Kings Cross with him, because a lot of people you do come across are having a pretty tough time or might be having a rotten day. ‘One of the unexpected benefits is that he can put smile on faces that would otherwise be pretty gloomy.’ His two pets have an incredible bond that has also been very special to witness. Enzo and Truffle have a beautiful friendship and their owner says it has been remarkable to see how much Enzo has nurtured for his injured companion . Enzo and Truffle before Truffle's accident, preparing for the festive season with some bubbly . Peter Taylor explains that Truffle has a 'bit of a blonde streak' Truffle’s playmate is a very special dog in his own right, as Enzo has worked for the past four years as a ‘therapy dog’ in a mental health practice. ‘Enzo sits with the psychiatrists and gives the clients that little bit of extra TLC that doctors can’t do,’ said Mr Taylor. The beautiful chocolate Lagotto provides company to people during appointments, to help and comfort them in vulnerable moments. ‘He gives the clients a nudge and they can pat him as they talk through the tough stuff,’ said Mr Taylor. Enzo is a 'therapy dog', but is currently focusing his attention on providing 24/7 comfort to Truffle . Truffle and Enzo (before the accident) are wonderful companions to their owner, Mr Taylor, accompanying him to the park as he catches up on work - truly man's best friends! However, Enzo is having a break as he commits fulltime to the task of helping his pal recover. ‘He’s made the switch from being a therapy dog for humans to a therapy dog for his best mate!’ ‘It’s been amazing to watch, he honestly hasn’t left Truffle’s side since the incident. He gives him nudges on the nose and licks on the paw to remind him that he’s there with him.’ What began as a very sad event for the little family-of-three has now become a fun adventure, proving that a dog really is man’s best friend. The most wonderful lesson has been in the face of adversity, the only thing we can control is how we respond. ‘I was thinking “poor Truffle, two front legs broken and he’s completely out of action, how sad!” ‘But he’s embraced life to the full. He hasn’t whinged once, just constantly smiling,’ said Mr Taylor. ‘When life serves us lemons, you’ve just got to make the best possible lemon meringue pie!’ The dogs are thrilled that they can still spend time together during walks, with Mr Taylor explaining that Truffle (left) only becomes anxious or fidgety when his best mate Enzo (right) is out of view .

"This video footage shows the moment a young female rhinoceros named Rihanna led two pals on an escape bid from a safari park after spotting the security guard had fallen asleep. The footage shows the rhinos escaping from the front entrance of the Ramat Gan Safari Park in the city of Ramat Gan in the Tel Aviv district of western Israel after a security guard nodded off to sleep and failed to notice until too late what was happening. Although another employee of the park gave chase, it was too late to stop the white rhinos from hitting the road. The Rhinos, led by Rihanna, make a dash for it past the clueless security guard in Israel . An enquiry is now ongoing to find out why the gate to their enclosure and the gate to the facility itself had been left open. Police who got a call to say that three rhinos were on the loose said that they initially doubted it, but when they realised it was true they had stopped the animals' further escape with a roadblock. They then worked with zoo staff to stop the three rhinos travelling too far, and to drive them back to the safari park. The rhinos make a run for it after seeing their chance with the security guard sneaking in a nap . As the pesky three trot past, the security guard is awoken from his slumber and gives chase . A police spokesman said: 'We located the rhinos in the car park not far from the safari park itself.' All three white rhinos including Rihanna as well as the other two females named Keren Peles and Karnivala were returned to the park after their brief adventure without further incident. Zoo spokeswoman Sagit Horowitz said: 'Overall, the rhinos were outside about 10 minutes, in which they were in the parking lot adjacent to the entrance and did not enter the national park.' The security guard that was supposed to stop the rhinos has reportedly been relieved of his duties. Freedom is in sight for the trio and they bound towards the exit - thankfully customers weren't in yet . The security guard has reportedly lost his job as a result of letting the rhinos go .","Lead rhino called Rihanna and two others escape towards freedom .

"He once labelled climate change 'absolute crap', Tony Abbott was also determined to keep the burning issue off the G20 Summit and was unconvinced Australia should play any part in the recent global climate negotiations in Peru but the Prime Minister . 'Look, climate change is real. Humanity does contribute to it and it's important that government make a strong and effective effort to combat it and that is exactly what the Australian government is doing. 'We are absolutely confident that through the various policies we have in place, particularly our direct action plan, our emissions reduction fund, we are very confident that we can reduce our emissions by 12 per cent on 2005 levels by 2020.' But Mr Abbott repeated his belief that bushfires, such as those which have crippled parts of South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia this summer, are not the by-product of warmer weather caused by climate change. 'Climate change is real'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott had made a public admission during a tour of bushfire impacted zones across South Australia . Prime Minister Tony Abbott tours the CFS command centres at the heart of the bushfire zone near One Tree Hill in Adelaide. He refutes suggestions climate change has led to more natural disasters in Australia . 'I think it is wrong to try to attribute particular natural disasters to climate change - that is certainly the warning that the CSIRO has given, it's the warning that the Bureau of Meteorology gives, and while there is no doubt that over time climate change could make a difference to these sorts of occurrences, fire, flood, storm are a part of living in Australia - always have been, always will be,' he said. However, this stance appears to be in direct conflict with the government's environment departmental website which reports that there is 'a growing and robust body of evidence' that the amount of extreme weather events are likely to jump as a result of climate change factors and Australia is already being impacted, as evidenced by the number of bushfiires. 'The important thing is yes we do our bit in tackling climate change but also that we remain very well placed to deal with whatever comes, I think the response to this particular disaster shows that we are well placed to deal with problems,' Mr Abbott said. 'We think that Australia is making a strong and effective contribution to reducing emissions.' Mr Abbott infamously declared in 2009 the scientific argument was 'absolute crap' but has since stated he accepts humans are contributing to global warming. A year later he declared that global warming 'hasn't increased .. the point is not the science'. The Prime Minister has had a chequered, often thorny, relationship with the issue. Australia only bowed to international pressure and pledged $200 million to the UN-backed Green Climate Fund, to mitigate the impact of global warming on poor countries. With the use of coal-fired power and a relatively small population of 23 million, compared to others, Australia is considered one of the world's worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters and has been increasingly isolated over a perceived reluctance to do more to tackle the climate threat. Mr Abbott speaks with Country Fire Service volunteers in Adelaide. The PM has announced victims of the South Australian bushfires will receive federal assistance during a tour to the bushfire zone . 'Fire are certainly not a function of climate change, they're a function of life in Australia,' Mr Abbott has long contended but on Thursday he did admit that 'climate change is real' Mr Abbott, in the past, took a United Nations executive secretary, Christiana Figueres, to task over her claims that Australian bushfires is 'already paying the price of carbon'.  He accused the official of 'talking through her hat' and that 'fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they're a function of life in Australia'. He also made a point of preventing climate change from being placed on the official agenda of the G20 in Brisbane last year and was latterly accused of trying to block Australia's involvement in the Climate Change forum in Peru. That subsequently led to a showdown with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Post the summit, he didn't mince words again, saying 'we are doing a very great deal and I suppose given what we are doing we don't intend at this time to do more'. The PM, who is also the Minister for Women, lauded the axing of the carbon tax, at the third attempt, as his greatest achievement for female Australia. That's because women were particularly focused on the household budget, he said at the time. And repealing of the carbon tax meant that the average family's budget was better off by $550 a year. As opposition leader, Mr Abbott in 2010 was dubbed old fashioned after declaring that housewives would bear the cost of a price on carbon pollution through higher electricity charges as they did the ironing. His stance on cutting greenhouse gases emissions has always come with a rider that it should not 'clobber the economy'.","The PM reveals that 'climate change is real'

"Jochemus Venter (pictured outside court in December 2013) was jailed for the scam and has now been struck off by the General Dental Council . A fiddling dentist has been struck off for cheating the NHS out of £48,000 of work on bogus patients and treatment he never carried out. Jochemus Venter, 56, put in bills for non-existent treatment on more than 100 patients in a four-year fraud spree. He charged the NHS £300 for crowns when all he did was fillings - and up to £1,200 for orthodontic work which was never done. His dental fraud was exposed by two 'whistle-blowing' staff who reported his scam to police. South African-born Venter has already been jailed for 18 months for false accounting for a total of £47,947 at his surgery in Llandrindod Wells, Powys. Now he has been struck off by the General Dental Council (GDC) who ruled he 'breached the need for a dentist to be honest and trustworthy at all times.' A spokesman for the GCC said: 'Public trust and confidence in the profession, and in the regulatory process, would be damaged if a finding of impairment were not made. 'Furthermore, the committee considers that dishonesty on this scale over a four-year period is not remediable. 'In the words of the sentencing judge, ""this was a deliberate, concerned and sophisticated fraud"". 'Accordingly, the committee has determined that the appropriate and proportionate sanction in this case is that of erasure.' In total, Venter made 211 fraudulent claims for bogus dental work on more than 100 patients . Cardiff Crown Court heard that he would charge up to £40 for a sports mouth guard and then put in a £1,200 bill for orthodontic work. The court heard that father-of-three Venter was a school governor and the well-respected only dentist in the Wales town of Llandrindod Wells. He had sold the practice in 2008 to a dental company - but continued working there doing mainly NHS work. The NHS fraud service was finally alerted to Venter's scheme after concerns were voiced by the dental nurse and receptionist at the practice. Sentencing Venter to 18 months in prison, Judge Tom Crowther told him: 'This was a deliberate, concerted and sophisticated fraud over four years driven by greed.' Pictured is Venter's former dental practice, located on the second floor of this building in Llandrindod Wells . NHS fraud service spokesman Mark Weston said afterwards: 'He was a highly paid professional but was greedy for more. 'The sentencing demonstrates that crime against NHS Wales will not be tolerated.' Mr Weston said the NHS had already recovered the £47,900 under the Proceeds of Crime Act.","Jochemus Venter, 56, lodged bills for non-existent treatment and patients .

"Watched over by guards in full SS uniforms, held at gunpoint and ordered to line up for inspection, these incredible black and white photographs look like they were taken of prisoners of war in Germany during the Second World War. But in reality, they were shot at a bizarre British-based Nazi themed holiday camp known as Butlitz in the 1980s. Based at a disused hospital at Weyhill, near Andover in Hampshire, guests paid £30 each to live the life of a PoW for the weekend. Watched over by guards in full SS uniforms, held at gunpoint and ordered to line up for inspection (pictured) these incredible black and white photographs look like they were taken of German prisoners of war during the Second World War . It is believed the 50 'SS' guards were made up of members of a military re-enactment society and the men staying at the compound were encouraged to escape. On arrival at the compound, which was surrounded by a 10ft high barbed wire perimeter fence, they were greeted by German marching songs blaring from speakers. The visitors were then ordered to line up for an inspection by the 'Camp Commandant' Bob Acraman who organised the 'holiday.' But the extraordinary set of black and white photos were actually shot at a British-based Nazi-themed holiday camp known as Butlitz . A 'prisoner' is taken back to the camp, where guests paid £30 to live the life of a prisoner of war for a weekend, at gunpoint by a German soldier after trying to escape . One of the photos shows a bespectacled Nazi pointing a pistol at one of the prisoners as he was brought back to camp after attempting to flee, while another shows a man sat in an isolation tank. Those caught trying to escape were made to sit in a metal chamber for up to half an hour. In one photo a guard can be seen manning a watchtower but it is not apparent if he is wearing a Nazi uniform. Former paratroop regiment sergeant Mr Acraman was quoted at the time about his unusual venture. He said: 'We have a big tower here and when someone said to me that it looks like a prisoner of war camp it gave me the idea of running a holiday camp on prison lines. He added: 'I am now looking around to buy a train to bring people here in cattle trucks. If I can't get one I shall probably use old army lorries and shunt them down in those. Guests were watched over by guards in full SS uniforms who are believed to have been made up of members of a military re-enactment society . Punishments for paying visitors at the camp included being put into an isolation tank (pictured) for up to half an hour . The unusual holiday camp was created by former paratroop regiment sergeant Bob Acraman who played the part of Camp Commandant . 'There are plenty of people around who are just as crazy as I am. They'll enjoy it, in fact we'll make sure they enjoy it.' 'Prisoners will be interrogated for information. On arriving at the camp people will be briefed, given army ranks and then their photographs will be taken.' When asked where the visitors to his camp had come from Mr Acraman replied: 'Mainly London.' Gary Howard, of Ilford, Essex, was quoted at the time saying he had managed to flee the camp. He said: 'I was in a pretty bad state because I walked for 45 miles. I had to ring up the camp and asked to be picked up. 'I had no money, no food and no help from anybody and got soaked to the skin three times. I think I felt what it felt like to be a PoW.'","The bizarre Nazi themed camp was based at a disused Hampshire hospital .

"They are among the most famous trainers in film history - and according to Back to the Future, are available in 2015. During Back To The Future II, Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet - using so-called power laces. Now, Nike has confirmed it plans to release the real thing this year. Scroll down for video . During Back To The Future II (1989), Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet using so-called power laces, pictured . One of the most coveted pieces of futuristic tech seen in the Back To The Future franchise was the hoverboard - a skateboard-style device that can levitate. Inspired by this board, a team of Australian inventors designed the Baja board - a four-wheel drive motorised skateboard capable of reaching 31mph (50kmh). Elsewhere, California-based Future Motion created a self balancing, one wheeled skateboard. Called the Onewheel, the $1300 gadget can reach speeds on 12mph, and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board. Aside from the time travelling Delorean and coveted hoverboard, the Back To The Future franchise featured another simpler, yet equally futuristic design - self-tying laces. Nike released a limited range of McFly's Nike MAGs with manual laces in 2011, and now designer Tinker Hatfield has revealed the power laces will arrive in 2015. Hatfield made these comments because 2015 was the year Back To the Future II was set in. Without giving a release date, Tinker confirmed that his team is working as hard as possible to deliver the Nike MAG in 2015 with Power Laces, but also reminded us all that we still have '11 and two-thirds months left in 2015″, according to Nice Kicks. 'Are we going to see power laces in 2015? To that, I say yes.' Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when Nike applied for a patent for 'automatically lacing trainers.' It said: 'The automatic lacing . system provides a set of straps that can be automatically opened and . closed to switch between a loosened and tightened position of the upper. 'The . article further includes an automatic ankle cinching system that is . configured to automatically adjust an ankle portion of the upper.' The Back To The Future-inspired Nike MAG range was then launched in 2011. Nike's Tinker Hatfield confirmed that his team is working as hard as possible to deliver the Nike MAG in 2015 with Power Laces, but also reminded us all that we still have '11 and two-thirds months left in 2015″, . Only 1,500 models of the High Tops were made, and every pair was auctioned off on eBay. A total of $6million (£3.5million) was raised from the sales of these shoes, and all the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. San Francisco-based inventor Blake Bevin has already created her own self-tying laces, a prototype which she says will 'tide you over until Nike comes out with something more polished.' Self-lacing shoes EXIST: A Canadian Kickstarter campaign created Powerlace, the athletic shoes that automatically tighten to the wearer's foot. And Nike in 2011 created mock-ups of the cinematic shoes to be auctioned for charity. For 2015, the company has said it intends to create a version that actually lace themselves . Using an Arduino microcontroller, Bevin fitted a sensor to a Nike High Top. When a person steps into the shoe, a force sensor reads the pressure of their foot and activates two servo motors, which apply tension to the laces, tightening the shoe. A touch switch can be used to reverse the servos. Nike also plans on selling power laces next year, according to designer Tinker Hatfield, which will be the same year in which the much loved film is set Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010, after which Nike released a range of Back To The Future-inspired High Tops, (pictured) Only 1,500 models of the Nike MAG High Tops, pictured, were made, and every pair was auctioned off on eBay.

"Within days of Cangrande’s death in the 14th century, rumours began circulating that the Italian ruler had been deliberately poisoned. And now toxicological tests carried out on the exhumed body of the Lord of Verona claim to have confirmed these historical reports. Fatal concentrations of digitoxin from the foxglove plant was found in the liver and faeces of the body, and experts believe the most likely explanation was that he was fed the flower surreptitiously. Researchers from the University of Pisa studied the toxicology of Cangrande's mummified remains. The body was exhumed and unwrapped (left to right) in 2004. During the recent analysis, experts found presence of pollen grains from the poisonous flower foxglove, and toxic levels of digitoxin in liver and faecal samples . The mummy of Can Francesco della Scala, or Cangrande I, was exhumed from its tomb in the church of Santa Maria Antica in Verona in 2004. It was submitted to a multidisciplinary study, that included archaeological, palaeopathological - the study of ancient diseases - palynological – the study of pollens - toxicological and historical tests. In the tomb, researchers discovered a well-preserved mummified body (pictured), wrapped in silk. He was on his back with his arms folded . Inside the mummy, researchers discovered a well-preserved body, wrapped in silk. Cangrande was lying on his back with his arms folded across his chest. The 5ft 7in (1.7 metre) mummy was initially studied using a CT scanner, which identified regurgitated food in the throat, as well as signs of sinusitis. Signs of mild arthritis were additionally found in his elbows and hips, along with evidence of cirrhosis and tuberculosis. Following an abdominal CT scan, the researchers spotted evidence of faeces in the rectum. Gino Fornaciaria from the University of Pisa carried out the autopsy with sample collection of tissues and a histological study. The radiological study was performed at the University Hospital of Verona under the supervision of Professor Giuseppe Gortenuti. The toxicological study was carried out at the University of Verona under the supervision of Professor Franco Tagliaro. And the palynological study was performed at a private laboratory by Dr Silvia Marvelli. Preliminary analysis found presence of pollen grains from the foxglove flower, known as Digitalis, and traces of camomile and black mulberry. Toxicological analysis revealed toxic concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin, from Digitalis, in the liver and faecal samples. Cangrande della Scala was exhumed from its tomb in the church of Santa Maria Antica in Verona (marked). His body was submitted to a multidisciplinary study, that included archaeological, palaeopathological - the study of ancient diseases - palynological – the study of pollens - and toxicological tests . Can Francesco della Scala, or Cangrande, was a member of the della Scala family dynasty. Statue at the Museum of Castelvecchio in Verona pictured . Can Francesco della Scala, or Cangrande, was a member of the della Scala family dynasty. The dynasty dominated Veronese politics from the mid-13th until the end of the 14th century. Cangrande's reign in Verona began in 1311, and following a number of military campaigns, he added Vicenza and Padua to his empire in 1314 and 1318 respectively. He was often referred to as the Lord of Verona. On 18 July 1328 Cangrande, took over the city of Treviso following a long battle to occupy the region of Veneto, in northern Italy. He died four days later. During those four days, Cangrande suffered vomiting and diarrhoea with a fever that, according to written documents, he had contracted a few days before by ‘drinking from a polluted spring’. But rumours about poisoning began to spread shortly afterwards. In 2004, Cangrande’s tomb in the church of Saint Maria Antica was opened to allow a paleopathological study to be carried out on the body. The researchers discovered a well-preserved mummified body, wrapped in silk. Cangrande was lying on his back with his arms folded across his chest. The 5ft 7in (1.7 metre) mummy was initially studied using a CT scanner, which identified regurgitated food in the throat, as well as signs of sinusitis. He additionally showed signs of mild arthritis in his elbows and hips, cirrhosis and may have suffered from tuberculosis. Following an abdominal CT scan, the researchers found evidence of faecal matter in the rectum, which formed the basis for the recent toxicological tests. The researchers added that gastrointestinal symptoms spotted during the autopsy ‘were compatible with the early phase of Digitalis intoxication and the hypothesis of poisoning is mentioned by some local historical sources.’ The study continued that palaeopathological analysis also confirmed Digitalis poisoning and concluded that the tests suggest the Digitalis was administered orally, and that ‘the most likely hypothesis on the causes of death is that of a deliberate administration of a lethal amount of Digitalis.’ Preliminary analysis found presence of pollen grains from the foxglove flower, known as Digitalis, (left) and traces of camomile and black mulberry (right) in the remains. Further analysis revealed toxic concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin, from Digitalis, in the liver and faecal samples . Cangrande's abdomen during the autopsy is pictured left. The well-preserved liver is pictured right. Researchers concluded that the Digitalis found in Cangrande's system was administered orally, and ‘the most likely hypothesis on the causes of death is that of a deliberate administration of a lethal amount of Digitalis’ Foxglove poisoning occurs from ingesting the flowers or eating the seeds, stems, or leaves of the foxglove plant - known as Digitalis. It can also occur from overdosing on medicines made from foxglove, typically used for heart conditions. The poisonous ingredients include deslanoside, digitoxin and digitalis glycoside. Symptoms include blurred vision, hallucinations, fainting and headaches. This turns into stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhoea as well as drowsiness. Although it is not known who would have fed Cangrande the flower, it has been speculated as someone who objected to his reign, and could have been a leader or member of an opposition military faction. Put simply, the experts believe Cangrande was deliberately poisoned by being fed foxglove surreptitiously. Although, they did explain that Cangrande could have mistakenly eaten the flower, along with the other plants found in his remains. Other co-authors include Franco Tagliaro, Federica Bortolotti, Rossella Gottardo, Giorgio Brocco from the University of Verona.

"These haunting images provide a rare glimpse inside a dilapidated New York City hospital that has become a popular stop for curious tourists after being shut for 60 years. Like a scene from a horror film the long-abandoned immigrant hospital on Ellis Island is filled with eerie corridors, crumbling rooms and forgotten equipment. It was where one out of ten arrivals deemed too ill to enter the US were sent to recover or die as they landed in America aboard ships from overseas.

Ellis Island – known as the ‘Gateway to America’ – was the country’s largest and most active immigration station from 1892 to 1924. More than 12 million newcomers were processed, but some were deemed unfit for entry and sent to the hospital which is in ruins after years of decay. The 29-building medical complex, which opened in 1902, was in its day the largest public health institution in America.

"Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, (pictured today) told Cardiff Crown Court that she told police and social services about Watkins' child sex crimes in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 . The ex-lover of paedophile singer Ian Watkins claims to have reported him to police five times over four years before officers believed her, a court head today. Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, told Cardiff Crown Court that she told police and social services about Watkins' child sex crimes in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. But a court heard police refused to collect the phone and computer of Mjadzelics after she told them he had sent her indecent images of a 'very young girl being abused'. The 39-year-old from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is accused of four counts of possessing indecent images of children, two charges of distributing indecent images of children and one charge of encouraging Watkins to send her an indecent image of a child. She denies all charges against her. Mjadzelics claims that she was trying to 'trap' the Lostprophets singer on her own and get 'evidence' against him after police 'failed to act. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has three ongoing independent investigations into the response of South Wales Police, Bedfordshire Police and South Yorkshire Police to allegations that Watkins was abusing children. Taking to the witness stand today, she told the jury she repeatedly went to the police and Watkins' family about his paedophile activities but was not believed until 2012. Mjadzelics told the court she reported him to Pontypridd Child Services and the police child protection unit in December 2008 and gave a statement to a 'woman police constable' at West Yorkshire Police and to officers at South Wales Police in early 2009. She said she also wrote letters to Watkins' mother warning her of her son's paedophile activities only to be questioned by police in March 2009 over 'harassment' of his family. She said she broke contact with Watkins in 2009. However, she told the court they met again in a Leeds hotel in 2010 where he opened his laptop and showed her a video of a 'child crying and being raped' while Watkins had an 'evil smirk' on his face. Mjadzelics said: 'He was looking at me for a reaction and I cried and told him to get out of the hotel room.' She told jurors that she tried repeatedly to report the crime to police but she was 'ignored'. It was then, she claims, that she decided she needed to 'trap' the Lostprophets singer on her own and get 'evidence' against him. She said: 'We contacted each other again in May 2011 and by that time I had decided it was no good crying and sending him away anymore. 'I had to basically change the game and change my reaction and play him.' Cardiff Crown Court heard how mother-of-one Mjadzelics raised concerns with police and social services about Watkins' (pictured) child sex crimes four years before he was finally convicted of a series of offences . Mjadzelics told the court (pictured) she reported him to Pontypridd Child Services and the police child protection unit in December 2008 and gave a statement to a 'woman police constable' at West Yorkshire Police and to officers at South Wales Police in early 2009 . She said the next time he contacted her he told her he had gone to Los Angeles to listen to his album, and had raped a 12-year-old girl and plied her with cocaine. The court heard the graphic and disturbing online chats and messages sent between the pair during May 2011 in which they discuss snatching, murdering and violently sexually abusing and raping children and infants. During the chats Watkins sent Mjadzelics four indecent images of children which she claimed she tried to get police to look at 'as soon as she was able to' in the same month. She told jurors she told Detective Sergeant Andy Whelan at South Wales Police about the four indecent images of a 'very young girl being raped' sent by Watkins to her phone and computer. But she said no one came to collect her phone or laptop. Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 after being convicted of a number of horrific sex crimes including the attempted rape of a baby . Mjadzelics told the court that she had been treated like 'a nut job'. She said she first met Watkins in 2006 after going on the Lostprophets website looking for show tickets for a friend. She received a reply from someone called Ian who she eventually realised was Watkins and their online conversations became sexual with him inviting her to meet him at a Leeds hotel. Mjadzelics, who was working for a private bank, said Watkins filmed their first sexual encounter and later others too. Watkins, from Pontypridd, has since been given a 30-year sentence after pleading guilty to a series of child sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby. Mjadzelics was arrested  in January 2013 for conspiracy to rape a baby. Her defence barrister said she damaged her health because of the 'incompetence and indifference' of the police and child agencies she asked for help. 'She is stressed, traumatised, has suffered a stroke, has disabling migraines', Michael Wolkind QC told jurors. Prosecutor Jim Davis said there was no dispute from Mjadzelics that she was in possession of four indecent images of children, had sent an indecent image of a child and had twice encouraged Watkins to send her an image of child rape. But the jury heard she claimed she kept the images to trap Watkins and bring him to justice. Mjadzelics, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, denies four charges of possessing indecent images of children, two charges of distributing indecent images of children and one charge of encouraging Watkins to send her an indecent image of a child.

"Jessica McDivitt, 26, was hit by a truck in December as she walked home from work . A family who wanted to carry out their daughter's request of being an organ donor have found out it is not possible because doctors have discovered she also had breast cancer. Jessica McDivitt, 26, was hit by a truck in December as she walked home from work in the town of Niagara, New York. She was taken to hospital with severe head and body injuries. And days later her family were told she was brain dead. They decided to switch off her life-support machine and donate her organs - her mother Mildred say: 'It's what Jessica wanted.' But they then received a call saying the organs could not be donated as Jessica had breast cancer. The news left the family reeling as neither Jessica or her family knew she had the cancer. 'They found a lump in her breast, and it turned out to be breast cancer,' Jessica's mother told WKBW. 'It was devastating. We had no idea, no idea.' Although it is possible for people who have had cancer to donate their organs, this usually only happens if there is a long cancer-free interval before the organ donation. At present the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), does not recommend accepting organs from people with 'actively spreading cancer.' According to cancer.org, this means that most people recently diagnosed with cancer cannot donate organs, but it is 'okay to accept organs from donors with primary brain tumors that have not spread beyond the brain stem.' Jessica's mother and sister (pictured) were heartbroken when they found out her organs could not be donated because she had breast cancer . The driver of the truck was not charged on the scene, but was driving without a registration. Town of Niagara Police Chief H. James Suitor told The Buffalo News, the road where Jessica was hit is dimly lit and there are no sidewalks. He said the the driver of the pickup, Fateen Abdellatis, of North Tonawanda, stopped and was questioned at the scene - he told the police did not see Jessica. He was charged at the scene with having an unregistered motor vehicle and the Niagara County Sheriff's accident investigation unit is now handling the case. Jessica's funeral is planned for Wednesday - a Go Fund Me account has been set up to help her family pay for the $10,000 funeral costs.

She said: 'As I got closer, I saw it was someone with their whole body covered in flames. I was right across from it. 'The person was covered in flames. Their hands were up in the air. 'Then they bent down to the ground and put their face into the flames. Their whole body was fire. It was like a human torch.' She added: ''It’s terrible.

Jeff Lake did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Mayor Steve Vaus slammed the events, telling 10News 'You have a party like this and it's as though you're handing out hand grenades as party favors. It's a disaster waiting to happen.'

"A Columbus airport police officer shot dead a man during a confrontation this afternoon just outside the terminal. The man, whose name was not immediately released, was killed at about 1pm outside the departures area of the Port Columbus International Airport, said David Whitaker, a Columbus Regional Airport Authority vice president. The officer who fired the shots was not injured. Scroll down for video . Emergency response: A police officer at the Port Columbus International Airport shot and killed a man during a confrontation just outside the terminal at 1pm Wednesday . 'There was a threat, and we were responding to that,' said Whitaker, who didn't have details of what happened before the officer fired at the suspect. He said the man did not fire at the officer. The man was believed to have arrived at the airport alone, but Whitaker didn't know if he was scheduled to be on a flight. The departures area was blocked off Wednesday afternoon, but the airport said  flights were running as scheduled, with only some affected by the emergency. Departing passengers were directed to enter through the arrivals area on the lower curb level. An SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad as a precaution, Whitaker said. Departing passengers were directed to enter through the arrivals area as the departures area was blocked off . WBNS reported that the suspect was in the ticketing lobby outside security checkpoints. Police said there was also a call for an officer in trouble just before shots were fired. Speaking to the Columbus Dispatch Wednesday evening, eyewitness Jim Shriner said he saw the suspect advance on two uniformed police officers and reach for his waistband before a third plainclothes cop shot and killed him. Shriner, the owner of a towing business, said he was called to the airport to haul away an illegally parked car. When he pulled up outside the departures area, Shriner said he saw a man fighting with two officers and heard two shots fired. The suspect went down, but then got back up and proceeded to advance on the two officers who had their guns drawn but were retreating. Precaution: An SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad . The man pointed at his waistband, but Shriner said he did not see a gun there. One of the uniformed cops struck the suspect with a baton on his legs before the third officer arrived and shot him dead. Shriner speculated that he may have been called to the airport to tow the slain suspect's SUV from the terminal. A perimeter around that area could lead to some flight delays for Delta passengers. 'We don't think that there's an ongoing threat at the moment,' Whitaker said. 'We believe the situation is contained as I've described.' Matt Diehl of Columbus was waiting to board a flight in a growing crowd. He had two hours before it took off for Philadelphia for business, but he wasn't sure if it wouldn't be delayed. 'I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but at this point I'm not optimistic,' he said.","The unidentified man was killed at about 1pm outside the departures area of the Port Columbus International Airport .

"'We have nothing here, but we have everything.' These are the words used by one local to describe Barbuda - Antigua's smaller, lesser-known neighbour, with whom it forms a twin island state that floats dreamily in the eastern Caribbean and which was, until independence in 1981, British. The island had a moment of recognition in the Nineties when it became a favourite holiday spot of Princess Diana's, but has otherwise remained below the radar. Meet the outsider: Less fabled Barbuda has a quiet vibe that is encapsulated by the sands of Gravenor Bay . When I say I am heading there, people mistakenly hear either 'Barbados' or 'Bermuda'. Today, there are only three places to accommodate the few hundred odd guests who make it to Barbuda each year. The most interesting of these is North Beach - five bungalows set on stilts over a desolate stretch of beach, accessible only by boat, on a headland at the windy northern tip of the island. It is to this remotest of locations that my friend Sarah - a fellow harassed mother of single-digit-aged children - and I decamp for some winter sun and solace. We arrive via a Virgin Atlantic flight from London, followed by a 14-minute white-knuckle ride on a seven-seat propeller plane from Antigua. After touching down on a tiny airstrip, we are whisked through the airport (a pink hut) and across the village of Codrington - which was named for the British family who settled it in the 1600s and is nothing more than a few streets lined with colourful houses (many with generations of families idling together on the doorstep), a grocer's and knick-knack shops, with no traffic lights and few cars. A 25-minute speedboat ride through Codrington Lagoon brings us to North Beach. The first thing I notice - but for the wind - is the stillness of the place. Colette, the only full-time member of staff, ambles down the dock to meet us without any of the bustle or forced solicitousness customary in these situations. The big brother: Barbuda sits a 15-minute flight to the north of better known Antigua (pictured) There isn't a welcoming glass of fruit punch or a cool towel in sight. We are deposited in our cottage with hardly a wave. Pared down in the extreme, there are white walls, hardwood floors, green net curtains and some basic wicker furniture. No mirror. No hairdryer. No phone or TV. No art on the walls. Built by native Barbudan Reuben James 30 years ago, there is no sign that North Beach has been upgraded since. As a tangle of MacBook, iPhone, Kindle and digital camera chargers spill out of my suitcase, I wonder how well I will fit in here. And what on earth I will do. The website boasts of no spa, pool, children's club, sushi, dancing, or watersports. To this list I would add that there are no menus, no wine that I wanted to drink, no housekeeping service and no hot water. There is also meant to be no internet, so that guests will go 'off-grid' and truly relax. But, like an alcoholic sneaking his poison into rehab through a shampoo bottle, I circumvent this, procuring the back office wifi code 'for work' and huddling in the dining room hut - the only place with a signal - for my fix. A place to escape the world: Charlotte found her retreat at North Beach (but had to beg for a wifi connection) For most of our stay, the only other guests are an older American couple. 'I chose this place to help my husband break his screen addiction,' the wife tells me, winking, as I tap away on my iPhone. Our paths cross rarely, though, as we all drift around in our enforced idleness. A few loungers dot the beach and we spend most of our time horizontal on these, rising every so often to re-angle ourselves towards the sun. Occasionally, a stray donkey wanders past. Meals entail appearing in the Formica-tiled dining hut whenever hunger (or boredom) strikes and being presented by Colette, a woman of few words and not a great deal of action, with two options scrawled on an envelope. Offerings are whatever has been caught that day, usually Caribbean spiny lobster, conch or snapper, by 'Straight', the friendly boat-driver. After a couple of days of doing my damnedest to get into the 'non-swing' of things — lazing on the beach with a book, swimming, snorkelling and trying to space out wifi visits - I am about as relaxed as I get (if not relaxed by Barbudan standards), and ready for a tour of this 62-square-mile island. Straight, thankfully, obliges. This will do for lunch: Charlotte found herself eating lobster at Uncle Roddy's - after a little persuasion . Barbuda's only 'attraction', besides its empty beaches, is the Frigate Bird Sanctuary. The Codrington Lagoon is home to the largest population of Frigate birds in the western hemisphere, who nest in their thousands amid the mangrove swamps - the males puffing out their chests into red balloons to attract mates. Restaurants do not seem to exist on Barbuda, which has only 1,500 residents and three full-board hotels. An enthusiastic man tries to persuade us to eat jerk chicken from the side of the road for lunch. But when we, more doggedly, refuse, he - clearly amused by the high-maintenance English journalist and her blonde friend — agrees to 'call Roddy and see if he has any lobsters'. Luckily, he does. Uncle Roddy's is a simple beach hut, where we are welcomed warmly, presented with grilled lobsters and local Wadadli beers and regaled with stories. A few steps away is Princess Diana Beach, so named because of her patronage of the nearby K-Club resort - which closed eight years ago and sits derelict. Some locals, Roddy included, are disappointed with its Italian owner, Mariuccia Mandelli of fashion label Krizia, for damaging tourism by refusing to sell the land for redevelopment. Blissful scenes: An encounter with a local donkey and a day on the water, on a true Caribbean gem . Others are relieved that Barbuda's privacy has been safeguarded. It doesn't surprise me that this island would have been a foil to Diana's crazy existence. As I stroll along one of the famous pink sand beaches, I can imagine what a simpler life might feel like, one without deadlines and devices. Apparently, a supermarket magnate from nearby St Maarten has just bought a large stretch of coastline, on which to build a luxury development, so Barbuda might go the blingy way of other islands - a prospect that has split local opinion, much as the closure of the K-Club has. But I suppose the island cannot remain under wraps for ever. And, though its desertedness challenged me, I am glad to have experienced it.

"As the the rubble of the Twin Towers smouldered in Manhattan, President George W Bush authorised Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, to hunt down and kill those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. By October 2001, U.S. and British servicemen began massing in Afghanistan, transiting through the massive Bagram Airbase in the north east of the country. At the height of operations, it had a population of more than 40,000 and was  the air base was the busiest military airport in the world, supporting more than 140,000 operations in a single year - including the Seal Team Six mission to kill Osama Bin Laden. A tented city at Bagram Air Base which was once home to almost 40,000 people is being demolished as part of the U.S. withdrawal . Thousands of tonnes of concrete barriers are being removed from the perimeter of the massive facility as it shrinks in size . At its height, Bagram air base supported more than 140,000 operations a year, including the mission to kill Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden . Troops in Bagram air base put up direction signs marking out their home locations such as Hickham, Holloman and Ramstein air bases . Now, however, the Americans are handing over control of Bagram to Afghan authorities and the size of the facility is being scaled down dramatically. Almost 2,500 members of the U.S. military died in Afghanistan over the past 13 years along with more than 450 British forces or MoD civilians. A further 20,000 U.S. troops have been wounded in action. President Barack Obama has already announced the end of combat operations in Afghanistan for U.S. ground troops, although air support is still being offered. Approximately 10,000 Amercian  ground troops will remain in the country to provide support to the Afghani forces. The U.S. withdrawal comes at a crucial time for Afghanistan as the Taliban has increased the intensity of its attacks on local forces. In its early days, Bagram Air Base was used to interrogate Taliban of Al Qaeda suspects before they were moved to Guantanamo Bay . The massive airbase used its size as part of its security, with several layers of defence to prevent large-scale insurgent attacks . Concrete barriers were used inside the air base to create partitions to prevent an artillery strike causing widescale damage . Local security services face a massive task as they are losing approximately 100 men a week to terror strikes. Today alone, at least nine people were killed across Afghanistan, including two children who were struck by a bomb blast while gathering firewood, officials said. The fatal blast took place in the Zhari district of the southern Kandahar province. A separate bomb blast in the Shahwali Kot district of Kandahar wounded another 10 children, leaving seven in critical condition, said Samim Khopalwaq, the spokesman for Kandahar's governor. Bismallah Jan, father of one of the wounded children said: 'Our children were there to collect wood to burn when they were hit by this bomb. The government should have cleared the area, it their duty to protect us.' Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, and children are often killed or wounded while playing, collecting firewood or tending animals. One of the most effective defences against rocket or mortar attack is the low-tech sandbag which absorbs the explosive force . The temporary wooden structures are being demolished to reflect the size of the far smaller international security operation in Afghanistan . U.S. engineers converted 40ft shipping containers into accommodation units, which are now going to be scrapped as part of the withdrawal . The deaths of the two children brought the day's toll across Afghanistan to nine dead. In the eastern Nangahar province bordering Pakistan, a bomb blast killed Judge Mohammad-ul Hassan and wounded two of his daughters in the provincial capital Jalalabad, police spokesman Hazrat Hussain Mashreqiwal said. The judge served in neighboring Laghman province. In another attack, insurgents killed six people working on a road project, including the head of a construction company, in northern Baghlan province, police spokesman Jawed Basharat said, adding that the attack wounded another person and left two missing. In eastern Khost province, three suicide bombers attacked a police academy, with one blowing himself up in a car and the other two shot by police, the provincial governor's office said in a statement. It said three police officers were wounded. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks in Nangarhar and Khost. Afghan security forces are losing more than 100 men a week to Taliban attacks, which have intensified with the NATO withdrawal . The new shrunken airbase will hold approximately 13,000 U.S. and international troops who will remain for two years to train local forces . Large areas of Bagram airbase have been heavily mined since the days when it was controlled by the Soviet Union . Taliban insurgents have stepped up attacks on Afghan soldiers and police in recent months. U.S. and NATO forces concluded their combat mission at the end of last year and Afghan troops took charge from New Year's Day. U.S. Army Major Eric Lightfoot is serving in eastern Afghanistan where he is training local soldiers how to use heavy artillery, which could give them a crucial advantage over Taliban forces. The training mission is due to continue for a further two years, although Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has suggested that the U.S. and NATO could look at 're-examining' their 2016 withdrawal deadline. Major Lightfoot spends most days at this dusty base surrounded by mountains in Laghman province planning with Afghan army counterparts how they should use D-30 artillery. Up until a few months ago, though, the Afghans weren't using the 122-mm long-range weapon as intended - to hit targets several kilometres away, too far to be seen by those firing. He said: 'They've been using it sort of like a tank, for direct fire at enemies they could see. They're getting better. They are having more successes.' Major Lightfoot said: 'They are having to get used to standing on their own. Come back in a few months, and we'll see where they are.' Much of the debris from the scrapped accommodation units has been piled up in central locations for disposal . The airbase is overlooked by the imposing Hindu Kush mountains which are still controlled by the Talban . The number of NATO troops in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan peaked at more than 130,000 in 2011 before a gradual withdrawal began the following year. According to ISAF, there were around 58,000 troops at the start of 2014 compared with some 13,000 now largely engaged in training. The United States retains a counter-terrorism force that hunts al Qaeda and other militant targets, along with its unmanned drone strikes and limited close air support for Afghan troops under guidelines issued by President Barack Obama allowing limited combat in 2015. Mostly, though, the new mission named 'Resolute Support' is tasked with training, including building up systems like logistics, supply chains, planning and strategy for Afghan forces. Afghanistan's own security personnel are dying at a rate of about 100 per week, a level the U.S. military has described as unsustainable, and foreign forces are advising them on how to reduce the rising casualty rate. By comparison, about 3,500 foreign soldiers have died in the Afghan war since 2001, including around 2,200 Americans.","Bagram air base in Afghanistan was once home to more than 40,000 people and supported 140,000 missions a year .
In October 2001 the U.S. and NATO troops began a massive expansion of the facility to support the war effort .
Now, the outer perimeter is being reduced to account for the withdrawal of coalition combat troops from the country .

"A small town is reeling following two recent suicides. Ado Halkic, 15, and Mike Steve, 18, were both found hanged in their homes in Burlington, New Jersey just four days apart. Halkic took his life on January 1, and Steve took his on January 5 - and no one seems to know why. Scroll down for video . Tragedy:  Ado Halkic (left) and Mike Steve (right) were both found hanged in their homes in Burlington, New Jersey just four days apart . Mystery: No one seems to know why Halkic (above) and Steve ended their lives . Halkic's father Adam told NBC 10 that 'the two were longtime friends who trained together at the JBM Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy in Edgewater Park for about eight years.' He said that on January 1 his son asked him to order chicken wings, and a short time later he found him dead. 'It has been shocking news for us that two of our students, one who was 15 and another who was 18, have committed suicide,' said JBM Gym Director Victor Lopez. Burlington Township High School, where both boys were students, released a statement saying; 'Needless to say, the past few days have been painful for our entire community. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been touched by the sudden death of two of our high school students.' They then added; 'It is in times like these that we need to come together as a community to support each other.' Facebook: Steve posted a message just days after Halkic'd death that said 'see you soon' In a message posted to his Facebook that has since been taken down, Steve wrote following Halkic's death; 'It's a big pleasure still calling him my dearest and closest friend.' He then added; 'I love u buddy I will see you soon!!!' This after he posted photos on his page of his friend. George also gave a speech at school in Halkic's memory during an impromptu memorial service, and hours later decided to take his own life. Services for Halkic were held earlier this week, while services for Steve will be held Friday. For confidential support call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

"A burglar is back behind bars just six months after he vowed to end his 30-year life of crime. Martin Gilbert, 48, blamed drugs and alcohol for his past when he made a public apology last June to a victim whose house he had raided twice. But his promises came to nothing. Just before Christmas he stole jewellery and valuables from five houses and a church in his home city of Newcastle - and some victims were in their 80s. Empty promises: Martin Gilbert (left) grinned in June as he joined Christine Bell (right), whose house he had burgled twice, and promised never to offend again. Now he is back behind bars after doing just that . Gilbert said he was 'totally ashamed' as he pleaded guilty this week to six counts of burglary at Newcastle Crown Court, where he was told a jail term is inevitable. He admitted breaking into a home and two sheltered flats on November 29 before raiding the Presbyterian St Anthony's Church on December 2 and two more homes on December 11. Kevin Wardlaw, prosecuting, said: 'Some of the complainants in these cases are elderly, some in their 80s.' Jamie Adams, defending, told the judge Gilbert wished to be sentenced as soon as possible. 'He is a certified burglar,' he said. 'He knows what to expect.' Recorder Andrew Dallas told Gilbert, who appeared via a video link from prison, he would be sentenced in three weeks and warned more time behind bars inevitable. 'This is someone who has re-offended in six months,' the judge said. 'It's just a question of fixing the length of the sentence.' As he did so the burglar repeatedly said: 'I'm very sorry and I'm totally ashamed of what I have done. I'm very sorry.' Evidence: CCTV had previously caught Gilbert, whose criminal career has lasted 30 years, in the act . Gilbert stole jewellery and cash worth almost £30,000 and covered his hands with socks from a clothes line . Gilbert, from Walker, Newcastle, vowed to turn his back on crime in June after meeting one of his victims and seeing how much misery he had caused, posing with her for pictures in the press. He had fed a drugs habit by stealing cash and valuables from the homes of others during a crime career spanning 30 years. Gilbert, whose son was murdered in 2008, was jailed for three and a half years in 2011 for a burglary spree during which he raided 18 homes, stealing cash and jewellery worth almost £30,000. Most of the thefts were from elderly people's bungalows and during broad daylight. He was eventually caught on CCTV using residents' own tools to smash his way into their homes. At one he even took socks off the washing line to cover his hands. He was released from prison on licence in July 2013 after serving 21 months. As part of his rehabilitation he was offered the chance to take part in a 'restorative justice' programme, which gives criminals the opportunity to meet their victims and see the impact their crimes have had. Reconciliation: Christine Bell (right), from whom Gilbert stole previously, said she was disappointed . So in June last year Gilbert, who has two daughters and is a grandfather, was introduced to Christine Bell, whose home he burgled twice. Mrs Bell, who works as a court usher, had told him how his raid left her feeling nervous entering her own home. Today she said she was disappointed. 'If I'm ever tempted again I will think of her,' Gilbert said last year. 'I just want to say sorry to everyone I have burgled. 'At the time I didn't think about the victims at all, I was so off my head on drugs and alcohol. I was in a bad state and was just doing it for money to feed my habit. 'I just needed money. But I've realised now and I'm just really really sorry for all the pain and hurt I have caused. 'I have been in and out of prison most of my life, but this time I just thought; ""I don't want to end up back here. I need to change my ways.""' Gilbert will be sentenced later this month.","Martin Gilbert, 48, made vocal apology in June after 30-year life of crime .

"The information was obtained by Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames - pictured at the party conference - after a two year Freedom of Information battle with the Met . The identities of dead teenagers as old as 17 were stolen by undercover police officers according to figures released by Scotland Yard. The Metropolitan Police revealed that dead children aged '0, 1, 4 to 14, 16 and 17' had their identities stolen by the rogue Special Demonstration Squad in a practice the force conceded was 'morally repugnant'. The information was obtained by Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames after a two year Freedom of Information  battle with the Met. The force only released the figures after a court date was set to hear the Met's appeal against a ruling by the Information Commissioner to publish the figures, and after Mr Hames had tabled a parliamentary question on the matter. The practice was widespread according to an investigation of the secretive squad by Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon, who has also looked at claims that officers were involved in inappropriate sexual relationships while undercover. Mr Creedon found that out of 106 covert names used by the squad between 1968 and 2008, 42 can be confirmed or be treated as highly likely to have come from dead children. Mr Hames said families with children who died aged two, three and 15 during the time the practice was going on could now be reassured that their identities had not been stolen. The MP for Chippenham said: 'The reason I started pursuing this matter was a constituent who had lost his daughter when she was 15. 'When he first heard about this practice he was galled at the thought that someone could be using her stolen identity, leading the life that she should have led, and he is not alone. 'Unfortunately this practice was sufficiently widespread but now a small proportion of families will be able to use this information to be reassured that their child's identity was not stolen, which does raise the question whether there is any other way that the police could help reassure more families. 'But it also proves our case that the Information Commissioner was rightly to make in court that there was a public interest in this information being released.' The data was published nearly two years after Mr Hames originally submitted an FoI request to the Met in Feburary 2013. The force twice refused Mr Hames' request although it acknowledged the information was available. After the MP appealed to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in January 2014, it ordered the Met to disclose the information in August, saying this would not lead to the identification of undercover officers. The force then appealed against the decision to a tribunal, with the ICO and later Mr Hames being confirmed as respondents to the appeal. Undercover police stole identities of dead teenagers, according to Scotland Yard figures . Scotland Yard only released the figures after a court date was set to hear the Met's appeal against a ruling by the Information Commissioner to publish the figures . On December 17 the hearing date was set for February this year and a day later Mr Hames tabled a parliamentary question to Home Secretary Theresa May on the matter. Four days after that, the Met wrote to Mr Hames informing him that it would withdraw its appeal and publish the information. In its final response to the MP, the Met acknowledged that Mr Hames had been on a 'difficult journey' in getting the information but said it had reconsidered its challenge to the ICO and acknowledged the fact that stealing dead children's identities may be viewed as 'morally repugnant'. Nigel Shankster, the force's senior information manager, wrote: 'Before I get to the information itself the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) believes it pertinent to mention that it has been recognised by the Police Service and the MPS in particular, that the tactic of using the identity of a deceased child to form a legend for undercover police officers may be viewed by some as 'morally repugnant' and that it is no longer police practice. 'The MPS has, in the intervening period, reconsidered its position in challenging the decision of the ICO at Tribunal and has decided that disclosure will indeed be made in this case. Therefore, in accordance with the aforementioned decision notice, please find below the information held by the MPS relevant to your request: . 'The ages of deceased children that were used by undercover officers are 0, 1, and 4 to 14, 16 and 17. 'The MPS fully understands and appreciates that it has been a difficult journey in arriving at this position but does now hope that the information above is of interest.'","Scotland Yard said dead children aged between 0 and 17 had IDs stolen .

"A former Ohio high school football player who was convicted of raping a West Virginia girl following an alcohol-fueled party and sentenced to  two years in custody has been released from juvenile detention. WTOV-TV in Steubenville reports Trent Mays will now be given probationary status and will have a sex offender classification hearing. A statement from attorney Adam Neeman says Mays earned his release and is now 'eager to prove himself.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Released: Ohio football player Trent Mays, pictured crying today in court,  has been released from juvenile detention after serving two years for the rape of a 16-year-old girl . Free: A statement from attorney Adam Neeman says Trent Mays, pictured today in court, earned his release and is now 'eager to prove himself' 'The Mays family is elated to be reunited with their son after this trying ordeal. Trenton has excelled during his rehabilitative process, and has earned the right to be released. He is an extremely promising young man, eager to prove himself on behalf of his family and his community. The family would appreciate their privacy during this time together, which they have so longed for,' said the statement. Mays and one of his Steubenville teammates, Ma'Lik Richmond, were found delinquent in the 2012 rape. Richmond had a one-year sentence and was released earlier. A statement from the girl's family and their attorney says they hope the pair realize the pain they caused and maintain a higher moral standard in the future. 'We hope the guilty parties hold a higher standard of morals and values as their rehabilitation continues. We also hope that they realize the magnitude of lifelong pain that they have caused the victim and pray that the memory of their crimes lives in their souls as a constant reminder to treat women with dignity and respect,' said the statement. Gulty: Trent Mays (L) and Ma'lik Richmond (R) sit in juvenile court in Steubenville back in 2013 when they were found guilty and sentenced to time in juvenile detention . Punished: Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond  sit in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio in March of 2013 around one year after they allegedly raped a 16-year-old girl at an alcohol fueled party . In August 2012 the girl, then 16, was catastrophically drunk as she was dragged from one party ‘like a rag doll,’ digitally penetrated, stripped naked, abused and photographed face down on a basement floor. The full horror of that night only came to light when pictures were shared via social media in a crime that appalled America. In texts and tweets exchanged between the attackers and their friends Steubenville High School’s revered athletes crowed over the girl, denigrated her online and made her a victim twice over. Video footage posted on YouTube showed former High School student Michael Nodianos on the night the crimes took place, laughing hysterically as he referred to the victim as ‘so raped right now.’ In a tweet posted that night he wrote, ‘Song of the night is definitely 'Rape Me' by Nirvana.’ Quarterback Mays and wide-receiver Richmond were convicted of rape and, in Mays’s case an additional charge of dissemination of nude images of a minor, last March. This Instagram photo is physical evidence of the 16-year-old's rape by the athletes in August of 2012 . Hearing: Trent Mays, 17, sits in the court room during a break on the fourth day of the juvenile trial in 2013 for he and co-defendant Ma'lik Richmond, 16, on rape charges in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio . Juvenile detention: Defense attorney Adam Nemann, Trent Mays, then 17,  Ma'lik Richmond, then 16, and defense attorney Walter Madison listen to the prosecuting attorney's statement in juvenile court in 2013 . Sentenced on year: Ma'lik Richmond reacts as the guilty  verdict is read in the juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio March 17, 2013 when he was sentenced to one year . They were tried as juveniles and though both were classified as Tier II sex offenders – the State’s second highest category - Mays was sentenced to two years detention and Richmond to just one year. Both issued apologies to the victim's family during their 2013 sentencing but Trent Mays' apology was much less emotive than Richmond's. Mays merely apologized for taking and sending photos of the girl. 'No pictures should have been sent out, let alone been taken,' he said. Richmond broke into tears apologizing for 'ruining the victim's life forever.' One of the most shocking aspects of the crime which divided the small blue-collar town was, according to Police Chief William McCafferty, that ‘nobody had the morals to say, 'Hey stop it. This isn’t right.' Critics blamed a macho football culture in which star player were given free rein to run amok. There were a wealth of incriminating tweets and photos including one which became the image of the case – the victim hanging limp between her attackers as they carry her by her wrists and ankles. There was also a second alleged rape victim who was just 14 when she was manhandled by the 'Steubenville Rape Crew' months before the rape of the unconscious 16-year-old girl. Off-the-record sources also say that the earlier alleged rape may have occurred in a football coach’s house.","Ohio high school football player Trent Mays who was convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl was released today after two years of juvenile detention .

"When Ludwig van Beethoven composed, he really did just follow his heart, researchers have found. They say the striking rhythms found in some of Beethoven's most famous works may have been inspired by a heart condition. They say passages of music match the irregular rhythms of Beethoven's own heart caused by cardiac arrhythmia. The research in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine analysed several of Beethoven's compositions for clues of a heart condition some have speculated he had. The final movement 'Cavatina' in Beethoven's String Quartet in B-flat Major, Opus 130, an emotionally-charged piece that Beethoven said always made him weep. In the middle of the quartet, the key suddenly changes to C-flat major, involving an unbalanced rhythm that evokes dark emotion, disorientation and what has even been described as a 'shortness of breath.'

The rhythms of certain parts of renowned works, researchers say, may in fact reflect the irregular rhythms of Beethoven's own heart caused by cardiac arrhythmia. 'His music may have been both figuratively and physically heartfelt,' said Joel Howell of the University of Michigan Medical School. 'When your heart beats irregularly from heart disease, it does so in some predictable patterns. 'We think we hear some of those same patterns in his music.' 'The synergy between our minds and our bodies shapes how we experience the world. 'This is especially apparent in the world of arts and music, which reflects so much of people's innermost experiences,' Howell adds. The team studied the rhythmic patterns of several compositions that may reflect Beethoven's experience of an arrhythmia, a condition that causes the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Sudden, unexpected changes in pace and keys in Beethoven's music appear to match such asymmetrical patterns. Take for example the final movement 'Cavatina' in Beethoven's String Quartet in B-flat Major, Opus 130, an emotionally-charged piece that Beethoven said always made him weep. In the middle of the quartet, the key suddenly changes to C-flat major, involving an unbalanced rhythm that evokes dark emotion, disorientation and what has even been described as a 'shortness of breath.' Daniel Barenboim playing Beethoven: The new research in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine analysed several of Beethoven's compositions for clues of a heart condition some have speculated he had. In the composer's directions to musicians playing the piece, the section is marked beklemmt, a German word that translates to 'heavy of heart.' Authors note that 'heavy of heart' could mean sadness but may also describe the sensation of pressure, a feeling that is associated with cardiac disease. 'The arrhythmic quality of this section is unquestionable,' they write. Researchers identified arrhythmic patterns in other pieces as well. They studied the Piano Sonata in A-flat major, Opus 110 – the central sonata in a group of three that comprise Beethoven's final contributions to the genre – and the opening of the 'Les Adieux' Sonata (sonata opus 81a, in E-flat major) written during the French attack on Vienna in 1809. Beethoven has been linked with a litany of mysterious health problems including inflammatory bowel disease, Paget's disease (abnormal bone destruction), liver disease, alcohol abuse, and kidney disease. His most often described ailment was deafness, which the authors say could have heightened his other senses and made him even more aware of his heartbeat. 'We can't prove or disprove that Beethoven had many of the diseases he's been supposedly afflicted with because almost all of today's diagnostic medical tests didn't exist in the 18th century, and we are interpreting centuries-old medical descriptions into the context of what we know now,' says Goldberger. 'However, the symptoms and common association of an abnormal heartbeat with so many diseases makes it a reasonable assumption that Beethoven experienced arrhythmia – and the works we describe may be 'musical electrocardiograms,' the readout of modern heart rhythm testing equipment. 'While these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest Beethoven's genius, there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time.'","Passages of music 'unquestionably' match cardiac arrhythmia .

"Police have issued a warning to drone users to be aware of the law with regards to flying them over famous landmarks. With drones having been a popular Christmas gift, there is set to be an increase in the numbers flown over public events, stadiums and tourist attractions. However, the law states that drones must not be flown within 150 metres of any congested area, or within 50 metres of buildings not owned by their operator. There are also exclusion areas around airports. Scroll down for video . Police have warned drone users to be aware of the law when flying their machines around the country . Speaking to the Evening Standard, Chief Inspector Nick Aldworth, of the Met's Specialist Operations unit, said: 'I compare them to cars. They are perfectly legal to own but it is very easy to break the laws when you are driving. 'Our concern is that in the New Year we will see a lot of these things being flown in London and there is a potential for people to wander into criminal territory. 'We also recognise that people will use these devices for criminal purposes and we want to send them a message too.' Stores reported a 24 per cent increase in sales of drones, which could be purchased for as little as £30. There have been a rise in the number of drone flights over stadiums and public events . Last year a drone almost crashed into a passenger jet flying near Heathrow Airport . Numerous videos have been posted on social networks showing drones flying over London landmarks such as the Shard, the London Eye and Tower Bridge, possibly in breach of the law. There is also the growing worry that rather than drones being used to capture stunning landscapes, they are now being associated with harassing and spying on people. In addition, drones have even found their way onto flight paths in one of the more worrying developments. A drone flying near Heathrow almost crashed into a passenger jet in July last year– raising fears that 2014's must-have Christmas gift could cause a disaster in the skies over Britain. The remote-controlled device, flown by an unidentified amateur, was spotted by the airliner's pilot but alarmingly was not detected by air traffic control radars. A pilot flying over Southend in May last near noticed a drone flying very close to the wing of his aircraft . The UK Airprox Board, the air safety panel that investigates near misses, gave the incident the highest risk rating of A, meaning there was a 'serious risk of collision'. The Airbus A320 that can carry up to 180 passengers was flying at an altitude of 700ft on the afternoon of July 22 when the pilot spotted the drone. He reported the near miss and an inquiry was launched by the board. Worryingly, investigators were unable to identify the drone and it disappeared after the sighting. And back in May 2014 a 74-seater aeroplane was travelling over Southend when the pilot spotted the remote-controlled quadcopter 'very close' to the right wing-tip. An investigation launched into the incident recorded the risk of collision as 'high' The UK Airprox Board report into the inciden revealed how the ATR72 twin-engine turboprop airliner was travelling at 1,500ft as it came in to land at Southend Airport when the pilot noticed the drone. The report revealed how the pilot informed the control tower at Southend Airport over the sighting and told the operator how the object was 'too close' to the plane. He told the tower that he thought he had seen a 'remote-control helicopter with a very small engine' before confirming it was a black and red quadcopter. A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority, said: 'People using drones should apply common sense when thinking about where to fly their devices. It is clearly irresponsible to fly any kind of drone close to an airport or in a town centre, for example. 'Users should take a good look around at their environment before each and every flight. If any potential exists for conflict with other aircraft, people, vehicles or buildings, then try somewhere else. 'Drones are subject to aviation rules and regulations and anyone breaching those rules can be prosecuted.'","Drones are not permitted to fly within 150 metres of any congested areas .
Too close to buildings and airports is also breaking the law .

"A super-antibiotic capable of wiping out everything from MRSA to TB has been found lurking in soil. In tests, the new medicine rapidly cured infections that should have been fatal. The drug also worked ‘exquisitely’ well against hard-to-treat bugs that damage the heart. Crucially, it could be a powerful weapon in the war against antibiotic resistance, in which once easy-to-treat infections become deadly after finding sneaky ways of evading powerful drugs. With no new type of antibiotic hitting the market for almost 30 years and bacteria becoming harder to treat by the day, experts have warned medical treatment could soon be dragged back the 19th century. Scroll down for video . Hope: In tests, the new medicine, teixobactin, rapidly cured infections that should have been fatal  Image shows antibiotic drugs being tested for resistance against bacteria . Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, has described an ‘apocalyptic scenario’ in which, in just 20 years’ time, routine operations such as hip replacements become deadly because relatively minor infections can’t be quashed. The new drug, which has been named teixobactin, was discovered after British, German and US scientists went back to basics and studied bacteria from a grassy field in Maine in the US. Many bacteria and fungi naturally make antibiotics to keep themselves safe and kill competitors for food and space and most of the antibiotics we use today have their roots in nature. However, with the easy-to-study microbes well examined and the remaining soil bugs difficult to grow on dishes in the lab, modern scientists have largely abandoned this route of research in favour of more high-tech approaches. Convinced that the soil held more secrets, researchers from Northeastern University in Boston devised a gadget that allowed them to grow and study the bugs in their native earth. Of the 10,000 sorts of bacteria that grew, 25 pumped out substances that could potentially be used as antibiotics. And of these, teixobactin was the most promising. In tests on mice, it killed a wide range of bacteria, including the hospital superbug MRSA. Teixobactin was ‘exceptionally active’ against the deadly C diff stomach bug and ‘exquisitely active’ against germs that damage the heart. TB was also within its grasp, raising the probability the disease could be treated by a single drug, rather than the cocktail of pills that is used today. Importantly, it did all this without producing side-effects. The researchers, including scientists from Essex-based drug company Selcia, are particularly excited about the fact that they couldn’t produce any bacteria that were resistant to the drug, no matter how hard they tried. They say the way teixobactin works will make it exceptionally hard for bacteria to find a way of evading it and predict it will take at least 30 years for resistance to develop. They are refining the recipe and hope to start testing the drug on people in two years. If all goes well, teixobactin, which would be an injection rather than a pill, could be on the market by 2019.

Writing in the journal Nature, researcher Kim Lewis, who has co-founded a company that is developing the drug, said the same technique could be used to find other antibiotic-producing bugs in soil. In an accompanying article, Gerard Wright, a Canadian expert in antibiotic resistance, said that ‘in a field dominated by doom and gloom’ the work ‘offers hope that innovation and creativity can combine to solve the antibiotics crisis’. Professor Mark Woolhouse, of Edinburgh University, said it is a ‘tantalising prospect that this discovery is just the iceberg’. Laura Piddock, professor of microbiology at Birmingham University, said the technique could be a ‘game-changer’ for discovering new antibiotics. Powerful: The 'super-antibiotic', which was found in soil in Maine, U.S., is capable of wiping out everything from MRSA (pictured) to TB, scientists say . However, Mark Enright, leading microbiologist and independent consultant, cautioned that there are still many important infections that the new drug does not tackle. This includes illnesses caused by E coli and klebsiella, a bug that is now sometime simply untreatable. Professor Neil Woodward, of Public Health England, said: ‘The rise in antibiotic resistance is a threat to modern healthcare as we know it so this discovery could potentially help to bridge the ever increasing gap between infections and the medicines we have available to treat them. ‘Taking any potential antibacterial compound from discovery to successful licensing is a long, costly and difficult process. ‘However it is one that needs to be encouraged while we tackle other elements that contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance and seek to preserve the antibiotics we do have.’ Professor Nigel Brown, president of the Society for General Microbiology, said: ‘We desperately need new antibiotics to tackle bacterial infections – this is a very promising development.’","In tests, new medicine rapidly cured infections that should have been fatal .

"An artist has cashed in on the recent vogue for dense facial fuzz and created the Bearded Year calendar in which a scruff appears to get longer with every successive month. Anna Marinenko, from Kiev, Ukraine, has drawn 12 beards in various stages of growth, beginning with January's designer stubble and finally ending in a full woodsman's beard in December. Each stage is printed on transparent paper, making the fuzz seem bushier as the year goes on, and the pages are laid over each other. Scroll down for video . An artist was inspired by the idea of growing facial hair to create her Bearded Year 2015 calendar . Ms Marinenko, who is selling her Bearded Year calendars for £40 on etsy.com, told FEMAIL that she decided to create a minimalistic simple calendar that she could print at home. She said: 'The idea was to illustrate something that could change during the year. A beard fits perfectly for this purpose. 'Beards are really popular, many men grow one and many women like them.' She admits to being a fan of the facial hair herself, adding, 'it's natural and manly' and 'pleasant to touch'. The designer said she didn't expect so much attention on the project and has been overwhelmed by the number of likes and shares online. In 2014 we saw beard baubles and beard sculptures, now men can invest in a beard calendar . Thanks to being layered on transparent paper, the beard in Anna Marinenko's calendar appears to grow . The calendar consists of 12 transparent A4 layers for each month. The beard graphics overlay each other, mimicking the effect of growth over the period of time. For those who hoped 2014 had reached peak beard, this is evidence that we're still obsessed with all things whiskery. In December alone, a series of accessories just for beards were created including beard baubles and icicles designed to nestle among the bristles. A San Francisco-based father, Isaiah Webb, also became famous as Incredibeard - the creator of weird and wonderful sculptures made from his impressive chest-length facial hair.

"14 skydivers have been ripped out of the sky by wild winds, with two victims rushed to hospital and 12 others treated by paramedics after the terrifying crash landings. After a 38-degree sunny day, a fierce storm quickly took hold with the skydivers suddenly facing an intense hail storm and violent winds. Horrified members of the public looked to the sky as skydivers fell at a rapid pace, battered onto St Kilda beach in Melbourne. Scroll down for videos . Many onlookers ran into the sea to rescue one on the victims who slammed into the water, pictured here bringing the man and his equipment to land . Gail force winds forced the skydivers to tumble through the air, crashing into the ground or water . The skydivers fell through the sky with force, with two crashing into the ocean and another 12 landing across the beach and pier, spread over a wide area. Senior Paramedic Team Manager, Jo Wilton, said that it was a chaotic scene when they arrived. During the free fall many were blown across the sky like rag dolls, lucky to escape with only minor injuries. The first two survivors were found on St Kilda Pier just after 3pm and were treated by Metropolitan Fire Brigade marine firefighters . Hail and violent winds battered the victims as they fell from the sky, with onlookers running towards St Kilda beach as the skydivers fell . Two of the survivors were taken to hospital with injuries sustained from their fall, as well as from the hail that battered them during their descent . ‘They were all incredibly lucky. Witnesses say they hit the water or the ground really hard so it could have been a lot worse than what it was,’ Senior Paramedic Team Manager Jo Wilton said. It’s understood that two people were sent to Albert Hospital, whilst others were treated at the scene, administered with pain relief and treated for welts and soreness, primarily caused by the hail storm. ‘It would have been very frightening for those involved, but they were well cared for at the scene and kept calm.’ ‘They were all incredibly lucky.

"A brown snake gave swimmers and sunbathers on a NSW north coast beach a bit of scare when it came slithering out of the surf between the red and yellow flags. When lifeguards started blowing on their whistles to evacuate people out of the water at One Mile, beach goers initially thought the snake was a shark. But as it swam closer to the shore it soon became clear it was a 1.5-metre brown snake, the Great Lakes Advocate reported. Scroll down for video . A brown snake swam between the red and yellow flags on the beach, which animals experts say is unusual . Olivia Moffatt were among those on the sand soaking up the sun on Tuesday. 'The snake travelled out of the water and remained on the shore for a while until waves washed up against it,' she said. 'Raising its head, it headed for shade towards the lifeguard trailer and happily sat there until again moving up along the beach to the bush. 'On the way, as we were leaving, the snake began heading back down towards the sea at a quicker pace, but was not in the ocean as we left.' The incident happened on Tuesday and swimmers had to be evacuated from the water as lifeguards dealt with it . Great Lakes  supervisor for lifeguards Simon Lee told Daily Mail Australia in the 20 years he had been with the Surf Life Saving organisation he had not seen anything like this before. He has been a lifeguard for the last six years. Mr Lee said the snake was just metres from the shore, which was 'very unusual for the snake'. 'I've never seen a snake rock up like that,' he said. 'I've seen penguins, lots of dolphins, turtles and seals, but never a snake before. 'It was a bit of shock... We didn't want to get in its way. '[I heard] some people say they didn't know if it was better or worse that it was a snake instead of a shark.' Swimmers were evacuated out of the water until the snake was off the beach . Mr Smith said it was unusual for snakes to be in the water and he had only ever caught three on a beach in his 15 years living in the area . Mr Lee said the snake, with the assistance of local snake catcher John Smith, eventually retreated to the south of the beach into the bush area. Mr Smith had to instruct lifeguards over the phone because he did not have a vehicle to get out to the beach. 'I told him [the lifesaver] to walk behind it and keep walking, don't panic him... he'll eventually go away,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If it has an escape route, it will sense you behind it and it will just keep going. 'They are more scared of you, if you start harassing a brown snake it will defend itself.' Mr Smith said it was unusual for snakes to be in the water and he had only ever caught a few on a beach in his 15 years living in the area. 'They're not a lover of water, so they don't normally go into water unless they have to,' he said. 'He was probably trying to get away from something… because the lifesaver said he came out of the surf.' A photo of the snake was posted on the Fairfax Media newspaper's Facebook page and it sparked an outpouring of stories from its readers about their own experiences with snakes. One joker made a tongue-in-cheek post with a photo of Tony Abbott in his infamous 'budgie smugglers' and the words: 'Here's another snake at the beach.' According to local resident June Southwell, Tuesday's incident follows another 'a few weeks ago' where a brown snake was spotted just outside One Mile Surf Club. Ms Southwell posted on social media saying: 'The very brave surf livesaver gave it a squirt from the hose and it slithered back to the dune.'","The 1.5-metre brown snake was spotted on a beach at One Mile on Tuesday .

"Confession: Linda Shearsmith, 53, was spared jail for the attack on her partner in their holiday home . A knife-wielding girlfriend threatened to kill her lover and hit him over the head with a bedpan after he wet himself during the night. Linda Shearsmith, 53, flew into a rage and launched the attack while her boyfriend was still sleeping at their holiday home in Whitby, North Yorkshire. Magistrates heard Shearsmith was fed up of his troublesome bladder - adding he 'doesn't shut up' - and yelled 'you trashed mine, (so) I'll trash yours' before damaging items including pictures. Shearsmith, whose partner later said he did not want the case to come to court, admitted assault and criminal damage after the attack on November 3. Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard she was 'extremely angry' at being woken by her partner's accident, and hit him three times over the head with a bedpan. She had previously delivered an ultimatum to the unnamed man, who is also her business partner and who had been in a relationship with her for eight months. He had persistently wet himself after drinking and had a history of 'making a mess', the court heard. But he remained in the bed despite being banished to the sofa, Shearsmith said, which sparked the argument. The court heard when she was arrested, she admitted attacking her partner after failing to wake him up. 'He p***** all over so yeah, I hit him over the head,' Shearsmith, from Brough, East Yorkshire, told officers. The attack left the victim with 'soreness' on the head, the court heard. When questioned about her partner by police, Shearsmith added he 'doesn't shut up'. Magistrates at Scarborough Justice Centre (above) heard Shearsmith only had one previous conviction . However, the man did not want the case to come to court and did not seek compensation. And in his brief mitigation, her solicitor David Camidge said Shearsmith, who had one previous drink driving conviction, has been 'very concerned about the outcome of the case'. Shearsmith thanked magistrates after she was sentenced to 80 hours' unpaid work and told to pay £85 costs and a £60 surcharge. She was also told to complete an alcohol treatment order.","Linda Shearsmith flew into a rage over her partner's troublesome bladder .

Luckily only scorch marks were left on the building following the incident on Monday. Dr Ousterhout smelled smoke and managed to douse the flames himself. He later told arson investigators that he believed a female client was behind the blaze as an 'interaction' had occurred shortly before.

"A police captain in New Jersey has been arrested and charged with trying to run down a Newark city councilman with her car in what police are calling a domestic violence incident. Monique Smith, 43, an officer in nearby Irvington, rammed Newark City Councilman John Sharpe James with her car on Tuesday morning after an argument outside his house, according to Newark police. The attack came just hours after Smith was promoted to police captain at a ceremony at Irvington City Hall on Monday night. Domestic violence: Irvirginton police Captain Monique Smith (left) faces multiple charges after allegedly attacking John Sharpe James, a Newark city councilman . Police have not said what promoted the attack or what Smith's relationship with the councilman is - though investigators are calling it an act of domestic violence. Smith is charged with stalking, criminal mischief, harassment, possession of a weapon, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and aggravated assault. Police say that Smith arrived at James' house at 11am and confronted him outside. James got into his car and drove to the home of his father - former longtime Newark Mayor Sharpe James. During on the drive there, Smith chased him in her persona vehicle and allegedly rammed James' car multiple times. When James and Smith arrived at his father's house, Mayor James was able to intervene and Smith left. She was arrested later at a different location. Irvington Mayor Tony Vauss told the Newark Star-Ledger that Smith has been suspended without pay. However, he defended the decision to promote her. 'She’s been a fine officer for many years in the Irvington Police Department,' he said.","Irvington, New Jersey, police Captain Monique Smith, 43, allegedly attacked Newark City Councilman John Sharpe James .

"The fiancee of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has left a closed-court hearing on a petition to grant her immunity in Hernandez's upcoming murder trial without commenting. Shayanna Jenkins went before the judge Wednesday on a prosecutors' petition to grant her immunity in the case. Jenkins' lawyer, Janice Bassil, refused comment. Scroll down for video . Hearing: Shayanna Jenkins (above in file photo) went before the judge Wednesday on a prosecutors' petition to grant her immunity in the case . Trouble: Jenkins is engaged to former football star Aaron hernandez (above in file photo) who has been charged with murder . The state has also petitioned to grant immunity to a second, unidentified witness. Lawyer E. Peter Parker said outside court he was representing a party in the petition. Leaving the courtroom with the woman, Parker said he would not comment because the matter was under seal. He didn't identify the woman. Parker represented Hernandez's cousin Tanya Singleton. Jenkins is charged with perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury investigating the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was found shot to death in an industrial park near Hernandez and Jenkins' North Attleborough home. This as it was determined on Tuesday that prosecutors won't be permitted to cover up a trophy case in Aaron Hernandez's home when jurors visit it during the former New England Patriots star's murder trial, a judge ruled Tuesday. Assistant District Attorney William McCauley had sought to have the case hidden, saying the defense wanted ""to get the benefit of having the jury be impressed by trophies or medals."" Prosecutors also cited the O.J. Simpson murder trial in arguing that they wanted to avoid what they called 'strategic manipulation' of the home. In the Simpson case, photographs and pictures were placed in the home to portray the defendant as a family man, and a Bible was placed on a table to play to jurors' religious sympathies, prosecutors said in a court filing. Jury selection is set to begin Friday for Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player. Hernandez was a tight end for the Patriots with a $40 million contract when prosecutors say he killed Lloyd in an industrial park near his North Attleborough home in June 2013. Lloyd, 27, was dating the sister of Jenkins. Hernandez also has pleaded not guilty in the fatal shootings of two men in 2012 after an encounter at a Boston nightclub. That case has not yet gone to trial. The judge indicated there may also be another hearing Thursday before jury selection begins. The trial is expected to last six to 10 weeks, and dozens of witnesses could be called, including Patriots coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft.","Shayanna Jenkins went before a judge Wednesday on a petition to grant her immunity in her finance Aaron Hernandez's murder case .

"A life insurance company has asked an Oklahoma judge to decide whether they should be forced to hand over $20,000 to a teen accused of murdering his entire family in order to cash in on the policy. Deeply indebted, self-proclaimed shopaholic Alan Hruby, 19, confessed he gunned down his mother, father and sister in October in the hope of paying off a $3,000 loan shark debt. As Hruby faces a potential death penalty, American Fidelity Assurance Co. this week petitioned a judge to disqualify him from receiving the policy proceeds policy say he was desperate enough to slay his for. Confessed: An insurance company is fighting a life insurance pay-out to Alan Hruby, who confessed in October to shooting dead his mother, father and sister in order to become the sole inheritor of the estate . The company says it can deny Hruby the money because of his alleged role in his family members' death, but needs the judge's approval. The pay out would come from two American Fidelity policies held by Hruby's rural newspaper publisher father, NewsOK reports. His father, John Hruby, named his wife Tinker as the main beneficiary. In the event of her death, the money was to go to Alan and his little sister Katherine Hruby, 17. Authorities say Hruby admitted he murdered his family to become the sole heir after he was cut off by them financially. The insurance company asked Stephens County Associate District Judge Brent Russell to decide whether or not they must pay out the policy. Alan told police he murdered his father, John, 50 (center); mother, Tinker, 48 (right); and his 17-year-old sister Katherine (left) in October . Slain: His father, John Hruby, named his wife Tinker as the main beneficiary. In the event of her death, the money was to go to Alan and his little sister Katherine Hruby, 17. Without the petition, the company says it will be forced to make good on the payment despite Hruby's confession. Prosecutors in Duncan filed three charges of first-degree murder against University of Oklahoma student Alan Hruby, 19, in the killings of his father, John, 50; mother, Tinker, 48; and his sister in October. Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks said Hruby owned money to a loan shark. Hicks did not say why Hruby had so much debt, only that his spending was out of control. 'The reason we were given for the murders was that he was having financial difficulties,' Hicks said at a news conference in Duncan. 'He felt if he murdered (his family) he would be the only heir to the estate.' Hicks said Hruby shot his mother and father twice each and his sister once. He later left the family's house and disposed of the gun and disc from a home security system. Hruby then traveled to Dallas for the weekend, where he stayed at the upscale Ritz-Carlton hotel, Hicks said. Cold: After killing his family, he stayed in a hotel and shared images of him and his friends hanging out . Getaway: The weekend after he killed his parents he stayed at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas (pictured) Hicks said Alan Hruby acted 'very nonchalant' and 'cold and callous' when he arrived at the home where the bodies of his parents were discovered by the family's housekeeper Monday. 'I tend to think this is a very heinous and atrocious crime,' Hicks said. 'This shows the fact there was no remorse; this shows this was an evil person. 'Any tears that were shed (by Alan) were crocodile tears,' he said . John Hruby was the publisher of The Marlow Review, a weekly newspaper with a circulation of about 3,500. His wife also worked at the paper. Hruby was also publisher of The Duncan Banner until 1997, when his family sold that paper, and was vice president of the Oklahoma Newspaper Foundation Board of Trustees, a part of the Oklahoma Press Association. Hruby's social media posts would routinely boast of his expensive lifestyle . He made a hobby out of posing for photos with expensive cars . Hruby also liked to show off his expensive purchases, sometimes in front of international landmarks for a classy touch, like this pic of an Omega watch in front of the Eiffel Tower .","Police say 19-year-old Oklahoma man Alan Hruby shot dead his mother, father and sister October 9 .

"Brian Matthews, pictured appearing at court, is accused of leaving his 96-year-old mother to wallow in her own filth . A son left his 96-year-old mother to wallow in her own filth without heat, light, hot water, a telephone or even a working toilet, a court heard. Brian Matthews, 75, is accused of neglecting his mother Winifred who was found living in squalor at her Essex home. Matthews, who held power of attorney over his mother's financial affairs, also allegedly diverted £18,000 of her pension into his own bank account leaving her in squalor. Retired police officer Jonathan Chapman called 'the worst case he had ever seen'. Mr Chapman, husband of Mrs Matthews' niece Rosalind Reynolds, told the court that the stench coming from Mrs Matthews' home in Cranham, Upminster in Essex, was 'enough to knock you backwards'. She was left in extreme poverty between 2010 and 2013 - despite the fact she was entitled to three pensions. The vulnerable pensioner's toenails had been allowed to grow so long they were curling into the skin of her feet and dirt had become 'ingrained into her skin', the jury heard. Formerly a senior member of the finance department at Barking and Dagenham Council, Mrs Matthews spent her days seated on a hard-backed dining chair by the window, next to a broken portable heater. The court was told she did not even have basic necessities such as heat, light, hot water, a telephone or even a working toilet. Mr Chapman said he was completely unaware of his elderly relative's plight after losing contact with her after his wife broke her back in 1997. Mrs Reynolds later re-established contact with her aunt after a phone call from the defendant's son and alerted social services to her condition. Two daily care visits were then arranged, the court heard. Mr Chapman said: 'I was shocked because I been a regular visitor previously, and the house was always very clean, it was always spick and span, walking into there was heart breaking. 'I've been inside a lot of horrible houses as a police officer, yes, but this was one of the worst I'd ever seen.' He added: 'My wife had warned me what I was going to see and about the smell of urine, but even though my wife had warned me I was still shocked.' Ms Reynolds added: 'The dirt was ingrained into her skin. It wasn't something you could get rid of by running her hands under a tap. Her nails were long and black. 'She had a pair of slippers on, there were tears in them where her toes were poking out. 'Her nails were so long they were curled round and they were curling up the folds of her feet- they were like those witches fingers you could get in a shop.' Mr Chapman told the court that Matthews would usually only make the 100 mile drive from his Suffolk home once a month. He said he always knew when he had been there because he would leave a bottle of Bristol Cream sherry and a glass next to his mother. Mr Chapman and his wife claim they began doing repairs to the house as best they could, including hiring a plumber to fix the hot water and begin clearing the house and garden. He said: 'We didn't initially have the funds to do all the work in one go, we didn't really know where to start so we thought we'd start with the essentials.' Matthews was repeatedly called upon by social services to replace his mother's bedding, her fridge and her boiler, but allegedly failed to do so. He eventually had his power of attorney over his mother revoked by the Court of Protection in April 2013. Mrs Matthews was allegedly left living in squalor without heat, light, hot water, a telephone or even a working toilet at her Cranham home (pictured) in Upminster, Essex . Mrs Matthews, now 98, was moved to a care home in Romford in February 2013. Matthews denied neglecting his mother, and even threatened to take legal action against Ms Reynolds for upsetting Mrs Matthews by 'interfering'. In a police interview he claimed Ms Reynolds was after his mother's money and  had her placed in a care home just to spite him. In her evidence Ms Reynolds said: 'I'm not someone who saves, so I started doing bits here and there when I got my pension each month.' She admitted she had not inherited any money from either of her parents or from her other aunt, but denied she was after Mrs Matthews' cash. She said: 'I inherited things that were far more important - that's how to love my family and how to treat them decently.' Defending for Matthews, Noel Casey asked Ms Reynolds: 'You did a lot in two years, you bought things for the house, you washed all the clothes, you attempted deep cleaning the floors, by 2013 things must have improved considerably.' She replied: 'I wouldn't say things had improved considerably, she still didn't have any heating, I was giving her food but she still wasn't being washed and bathed - things hadn't improved considerably, that was just helping out.' Mr Casey added: 'Despite two years of your involvement, despite two carers coming every day, things still were still hardly better - that's because it's very hard to look after an elderly person in their own home.' Matthews, of Broome, Suffolk, denies one count of fraud for allegedly taking his mother's cash for his own personal use, and one count of neglect of a person who lacks capacity, between January 2010 and July 2013.

"From Givenchy to Chanel, Kim Kardashian showcased some envy-inducing outfits in 2014. While she has the most esteemed designers on speed dial and finally won plaudits in the fashion world - even landing a Vogue cover - the reality TV star has revealed that she's having a style overhaul for the coming year. Writing on her Twitter, the mother-of-one said: 'Up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with Kanye.....I'm so ready for new looks for the New Year! New 2015 vision.' Kim Kardashian, who has recently made a name for herself in the high fashion world, has revealed that she's having a style overhaul for the coming year with the help of husband Kanye West . As she signalled the end of a stylish year, the 34-year-old made sure to credit her favourite outfit of the year. 'This Givenchy look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014,' she captioned a photo of herself wearing the black lace dress and leather jacket at Paris Fashion Week. Of course, her new husband Kanye has played a large part in her style transformation. Kim has spoken on many occasions about the rapper-come-designer's influence on her wardrobe choices. Last year, Kanye introduced his wife to fashion label A.W.A.K.E. - and she loved it so much she wore it twice in four days. Writing on her Twitter, the mother-of-one explained: 'Up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with Kanye.... I'm so ready for new looks for the New Year! New 2015 vision' The 34-year-old made sure to credit her favourite outfit of the year posting a snap on Twitter with the caption: 'This Givenchy look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014' Kim has spoken on many an occasion about the rapper and designer's influence over her wardrobe choices. Left, pictured at the GQ Men Of The Year awards in a daring custom-designed haute couture gunmetal skirt by Ralph & Russo, with an Atsuko Kudo latex bodysuit with Tom Ford heels, and, right, at Paris Fashion Week in Balmain, both in September . The brand, which is actually run by Russian designer and Harper's Bazaar former fashion director, Natalia Alaverdian, was discovered online by Kim's husband, Mr West. 'He researches everything and he loves to find new talent, and he introduced me to her and told me she’s part Armenian, and so am I,' Kim told WWD. 'I’m all about empowering other women to be successful and it’s really important to me to support designers that I believe in and friends that I believe in that are hardworking.' In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kanye is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look. And it seemed his help worked - just less than a year after the ELLE shoot and Kim, who was heavily pregnant with North at the time, showed the first signs of being ingratiated into the fashion world. Kim Kardashian, wearing a Lanvin blazer, and rapper Kanye West attend the Lanvin show as part of the Paris Fashion Week - one of many of the shows at which the power couple sat in the front row . She was asked by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, to cover her CR Fashion book. Kim was photographed for the cover picture by Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld and the shoot was art directed by Ricardo Tisci. It was a controversial choice at the time, but that worked in Kim's favour, as Carine later explained to Time Out. She said: 'She’s controversial, but so was Marilyn Monroe and I always like controversial people.' She went on to praise the reality star, saying: 'She was brave...with Karl Lagerfeld shooting. 'She had one guy for hair, one guy for make-up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked, and she accepted everything. 'I don’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – I’ve never seen her in a Comme des Garcons jumpsuit or a basketball jacket, but she said yes to everything. Kim Kardashian arrives to promote her new fragrance Fleur Fatale in 2014 - and her latex outfit by Atsuko Kudo caused a stir . Pals with Paris: Before she found global fame, Kim worked as Paris Hilton's stylist and personal shopper. She also worked with Lindsay Lohan . 'She was the easiest model we’ve had. And when we put a mask on her face, she didn’t say anything.' It was following North's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular Kim was becoming with the world's biggest fashion houses though, from the flood of designers that sent clothes for her new arrival, all duly documented on Kim's Instagram page. From Givenchy to Celine and Maison Martin Margiela to Alexander Wang, Kim shared photographs of North's adorable new wardrobe, signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her. The biggest coup came in April 2014 though, when she and Kanye landed a joint Vogue cover ahead of their May wedding. The news caused outrage among some of the magazine's subscribers, but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year. That magazine sold 500,000 copies, beating both Beyonce and Michelle Obama's Vogue covers. Not her best: Kim was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits like the gold cocktail dress she wore at the Spike TV awards in 2008, left, and, right, in 2010 at the Lorraine Schwartz jewellery launch . Anna Wintour said of the cover: 'Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it. 'I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T. 'As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue's cover. 'He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn't true.' Since then, Kim has sat from row (with North in tow) at some of the biggest shows at fashion week. She also became part of Olivier Rousteng's Balmain army, later posing as a model for him. Kim and Kanye covered the April 2014 issue of Vogue having won the approval of editor  Anna Wintour . Kim now counts designers like Lagerfeld and Valentino as friends and is regularly pictured on nights out with supermodels like Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne. Kim is most certainly starting the New Year off in style after being announced as the face of the new issue of fashion bible LOVE magazine, complete with edgy bleached brows. This undoubtedly signaled the end of her transformation from super eek to super chic. The metamorphosis has been no mean feat, for while she might now be a firm  favourite with designers, Kim's initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for none other than Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. In fact, a pre-fame, Kim also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and troubled film star. It wasn't just her lack of A-list quality that forced Kim into the fashion doldrums though, despite her day job, back in the mid-noughties, her personal style left a lot to be desired. To say Kim has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent fashion weeks, like here wearing Maison Martin Margiela, she has been front row in Paris, New York, London and Milan . From bright gold dresses to garish satin, she rarely made a 'best-dressed' list in the early part of her career. But fast forward nearly ten years and it's a completely different story. To say Kim has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent fashion weeks she has been front row in Paris, New York, London and Milan. It hasn't been an easy transition though,  for a long time Kim was shunned by the designers who now adore her. Just over two years ago, during a photoshoot for ELLE magazine at the end of 2012, many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star. Nicola Formichetti, artistic director at Diesel, styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high-end samples was a 'challenge.' He said: 'People wouldn’t lend me the clothes. But that’s fashion snobbery.' Nicola, who is now good friends with Kim, revealed that the top designers didn't want their designs featured on a woman who had, 'less-than-model-like-proportions.' However, he rightfully predicted at the time, 'She's not the It Girl yet, but she will be.' It truly seems Formichetti's prediction has come true... Kim has become the ultimate fashion IT girl.","The 34-year-old says husband is helping her curate new wardrobe .

"It started off as a call about a television that was on too loud but led to police deploying 10 cars, officers in riot gear and an ambulance. The issue led to an eight-and-a-half hour siege and four people being arrested after complaints that a television was disrupting neighbours in Clackmannanshire in Scotland. After the stand off was over two police officers were seen carrying the offending widescreen television out of the flat in Alloa. Two police officers were seen removing a television from a block of flats in Clackmannanshire after being involved in an eight hour siege with occupants who allegedly refused to leave following noise complaints . Officers were called to the flat, in a five story block in Pine Grove, Alloa, Clackmannanshire, in response to a noise complaint from neighbours on Monday and arrived at about 1.30am. But the occupants allegedly refused to leave and the situation quickly began to resemble a siege, with officers in riot gear deployed and police locked in an eight-and-a-half hour standoff. One of the accused exited the property around 6.30am voluntarily and finally, at around 9.45am, police entered the flat and arrested the remaining three. They were also able to remove the offending television. In total four people were arrested under Section 38 Criminal Justice and Licensing Act 2010 (threatening or abusive behaviour). Liam Young, 26, Kirsty Taylor, 18, Ryan Kenneth Douglas, 22, and Carla Ann Gruar, 17, will all appear in Alloa Sheriff Court at a later date in connection with the allegations. Mildred Gibson, 45, who lives above the flat where the incident took place and is aunt to Mr Young, said: 'There was no need for all those police officers and ambulances to assist four kids who had the TV up too loud. 'It couldn't have been up that loud because I live directly above the flat and I couldn't hear anything.' She said the noise of the television was not what woke her, but the police outside the flat. She said:  'There was everything outside my front door apart from a helicopter - over 10 police cars and about four ambulances. 'The police even had big Alsatian dogs with them, it was ridiculous.' A photo was posted to Facebook of police outside the flats during the long eight-and-a-half hour siege . Mrs Gibson's sister, Brenda Young, 58, Liam's mother, said she tried to get the noisy tv watchers out of the flat but the police wouldn't let her. She said: 'When I seen all the police cars and ambulances I ran over to see what was going on - it was my son in there. 'I told the police I had a key and I would have the four of them out within two minutes but they wouldn't let me go near for 'safety reasons'. 'They've now removed both my son's TV and his Hi-Fi and I have to pay to get them back.' She said she felt police were acting like it was a hostage situation, rather than a group of noisy youngsters. Other neighbours reported hearing the noise of police and their dogs trying to get into the flat. A Police Scotland spokesperson said the occupants had 'refused to interact' with officers and would not leave the property. The spokesperson added that as a result police 'had to escalate' their efforts to restore order, but 'there was no danger' to the public. One of the accused, Kirsty Taylor, posted a photo on her Facebook page on January 5, showing police officers dressed in riot gear and armed with shields outside the property. Police removed the offending television and other electrical items after a long standoff outside the flat . The post was criticised by people who said it had caused resources to be wasted and caused a disturbance as children went to school. Kirsty Brand wrote: 'This is shocking like! 'Even wasting an ambulance on you lot. 'It would be a shame if someone really needed one and couldn't get it cause it was sat doing f***all waiting on all yous grow up.' Adele Beresford wrote: 'It's a f****** joke. It's gonna be broad daylight soon, people going to work and kids going to school, shameful.' Kirsty Ward wrote: 'Nice to see the the taxpayers' money being well spent. 'Funding all emergency services to sit there all that time.' The property was later made secure and a council employee boarded the door up. Officers were seen taking a number of electronic items including the flat screen TV which led to the noise complaint. A spokesman for TaxPayerScotland said: 'The police are right to investigate a noise complaint, of course, but this does appear to be a remarkably heavy-handed and expensive response. 'You'd think the Force would have better things to do with its time.'

"Just when you thought one of the cheapest wines in Australia can't get any worse - one Australian woman has discovered a clever way to turn casked wine into sparkling 'champagne'. With a Sodastream and a cask of wine – or goon as it's popularly known - it takes just seconds to insert some bubbles into the wine, according to a 'how-to' video published on YouTube. The footage shows an elderly woman filling up a Sodastream bottle with goon as she tells the camera to ‘not waste money’ on expensive champagne while demonstrating how simple the technique is. The woman, believed to be Cheryl Marshall from Perth, can be seen threading the bottle onto the machine and with a push of the button, the wine compresses into fizzy 'champagne' within seconds. Scroll down for video . With a sodastream and a cast of wine - Cheryl Marshall turns goon into champagne within seconds . ‘I think you’ve fizzed it up too much’, a young male voice is heard saying behind the camera. ‘Well there you go – Now I’ve got to wait for it to settle a bit’, the woman said as she pulls out a cleaning towel to stop the ‘overflow’. ‘That’s the overflow – don’t worry that won’t get wasted – I’ll tip it into my glass,’ the woman said. ‘Right, now I have a glass with ice in it and I’ll get one that I made previously, alright? ‘That would wait for that to settle down a little bit. You don’t want it to be exploding everywhere.’ She turns to her fridge and pulls out a bottle that she made previously and pours it over the ice cubes. ‘Now this is one that I made prior,’ she said. ‘Now just look at that – champagne – cost you about $17 dollars for a five litre cask to buy – whether it’d be red or white – ok and you can make yourself litres and litres and litres and litres of champagne [sic].’ She  fills up the bottle with wine before she threads it onto the machine and with a push - it starts compressing . She kisses her finger tips as a gesture that it is perfect and starts embracing her champagne as she sips away before saying: ‘bloody beautiful’. ‘You can put strawberries in it – whatever you want to put in it and you can even put a little bit of cordial in it but I love it as it is,' she said. Marshall says ‘Bon appetit’ as she winks at the screen and ends the video saying: 'Catch ya later! I’ve got drinking to do.’ The video, titled ‘Soda Stream how to make champagne out of wine, This is dedicated to my gorgeous niece’s [sic]’  has received more than 55,000 views and dozens of comments.

"Roy and Julie Woods spent three decades building their version of paradise in the Adelaide Hills, where they raised their five children and created a haven that survived two previous bushfire disasters. But not this time.

Even now it's surreal, I can't quite put into words how it feels.' Over 40 houses have been confirmed lost to the inferno, including the Woods’ property. Roy, 70, and Julie, 60, had lived in their Upper Hermitage property for 30 years, raising five children while living there and pouring countless hours of love into the creation of their perfect home which had survived Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday before it was taken away from them in a matter of minutes. 'We were down at our beach shack at Port Vincent two and half hours away when we found out there were fires up in the Hills. Our neighbours rang us to say they could see flames approaching the house, and we were just glued to the television screen trying to find out information,' Julie told Daily Mail Australia. Happier times: This picture was taken while the couple were on a cruise last year to celebrate their birthdays (70 for Roy and 60 for Julie) Its picturesque garden was one of the main features of the georgeous house . What was once a beautiful garden is now just scorched earth and ashes . 'We knew that the fire was travelling really quickly and the wind changed and was really strong and just blew the fire back which made it rush up the gully towards our house. 'It was in the firing line, the fire came up fast and hot, and the CFS had to pull back, there wasn't anything they could do.' The fire consumed their property, including their custom-built pergola, prized garden, and fish pond, which had been the venue for photo-shoots, weddings, and even television advertisements. Julie's neighbour Paul Howard was the one to break the news to them that the fire had completely destroyed their house, leaving nothing but rubble and ash. 'Paul said it was the hardest phone call he'd ever had to make,' Julie said. 'I've never felt anything like it; it's almost worse than being told someone has died. I lost my dad recently and Roy lost his father, so this is just heartbreaking.' Roy and Julie didn't receive the official notification from authorities until Saturday, but saw footage of their burnt house on the news, which Roy said was a shock. 'I thought, Christ, that's our house. We'd seen photos of what it looked like so had some idea but it's still shocking. It certainly hardened us up a bit, so we're a bit more prepared for what we'll see when we go back,' Roy said. The house, which was built in 1966, survived the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983 and Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 . The fire grew very quickly making the CFS pull back. All they could do then was look on in horror . The couple have still not seen their property, which for the moment sits desolate and amid a suburb of houses that were unbelievably unscathed by the fire. The house, which was built in 1966, survived the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983 and Black Saturday bushfires in 2009, but 'was no so lucky a third time,' said Julie. 'To have to start all over again at 70 is quite daunting. We've worked hard our whole lives, like so many people, and now I'm not sure what we'll do,' she said. ‘We have had many people comment that it was a spiritual place and it had a very special effect on people when they would visit. We will really miss it.’ Julie ran a well-known curtain-making business from her custom built workshop at the back of the property, which made the loss 'a double whammy'. 'I had two lovely ladies working part time for me who now don't have jobs. They relied on that income and now I have to tell them that there's nothing for them to come back to,' Julie said. Roy said that trying to figure out where he and Julie would go was extremely difficult, made all harder by the vulnerability of their situation. 'Regrouping is going to be hard. I'm not a young man anymore, and the uncertainty of it all, and feeling so fragile after working so hard is devastating,' he said. House proud: For three decades the couple made the property in the Adelaide Hills their home . They both said that they've been incredibly blessed by the love and generosity of their friends and family, and even strangers who have heard of their loss. 'We're both quite fiercely independent, so it's been very humbling for people to be so loving when we felt most vulnerable,' Roy said. 'It's been hard to accept it, but we've had offers of accommodation and food and clothing. We've had so many beautiful things happen to us,' said Julie. Roy said that each time he explains what happened to the house he relives finding out about the loss all over again, which has made the ordeal even more emotionally draining. 'We've had so many people concerned about us and wanting to love us, but we find ourselves caught between our own emotions and the needs of other people,' he said. 'This has been an experience which brings you to a level you wouldn't normally go to. When someone dies, you go to a funeral and start the grieving process, but the land is still ours, so that shocking and devastating loss doesn't go away.' But despite this, if anything, the disaster has brought the couple even closer together. 'We are still very much in love, very solid, and this isn't going to change that at all,' Roy said. The Woods are preparing for a walk through of their property on Friday, and are using their beach shack as a 'home base' to start to piece together the details of their life they still have in order. In ruins: all that stands of the house now are badly burned beams and pillars . 'It will be part of the moving on process. It would be amazing if we could find something still left. If I found my pearls that would be a miracle,' said Julie. 'We are luckier than most. We've got some clothes and some other items down here, and it's familiar so we feel somewhat safe. 'We are so fortunate to be living in a country like Australia where we have a government that will look after us. We're very conscious that wouldn't happen in other places and the spirit of community we have experienced has been amazing. 'The region will rebuild of something as awful as this. Out of the ashes a phoenix will rise and there will be good things to come out of something so horrible.' They said that they were so grateful to the firefighters and CFS volunteers who had been battling against the fires in the region, labelling them 'unsung heroes'. 'They are just wonderful. We don't even know their names but all the volunteers and police did the best for people they didn't even know and put their lives at risk to help others,' Julie said. Roy and Julie said that despite the overwhelming devastation of their situation, the experience has taught them about how fragile life is. Julie Woods ran a well-known curtain-making business from her custom built workshop at the back of the property. It also was destroyed . 'Life can change in an instant. You can't take anything in life for granted,' Julie said. 'We enjoyed that house and the garden so much. We got to sit out the back and watch the sun go down with a glass of white wine, and raise our children, and see our six grandchildren at all our family celebrations. 'Some people never get that. We were blessed. No fire or rain can take those memories away from us.' The bushfires that tore across the Adelaide Hills over the last six days have been declared 95 per cent contained, with only two ‘hotspot’ areas of concern remaining. Country Fire Service chief officer Greg Nettleton said interstate firefighters were heading home as the declaration of major emergency for the area had been rescinded.

"A person with a 'history of travel to West Africa' has tested negative for Ebola after being placed in isolation at a Welsh hospital. The person, who has recently returned from an area of West Africa affected by the virus, was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff after developing a fever. Robert Webb, from Public Health Wales, said all precautions had been taken at the hospitals and nurses and doctors had been monitoring the person in full protective clothing. A patient with a suspected case of Ebola is being treated in isolation at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital . A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: 'Public Health Wales can confirm that an individual tested for Ebola earlier today at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital does not have the disease. 'There may be other explanations for their symptoms for which tests are already under way. 'There is no reason to believe that there is any wider public health risk. 'We would once again like to reassure the public that all appropriate precautions have been taken to protect the patient, NHS staff and the wider community. 'We are unable to provide further comment on individual patients and therefore will not be issuing any further press statements on this case. 'It is important to remember that to date, only one case of Ebola has been identified in the UK and there has been none in Wales. 'The infection can be transmitted only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The risk to the public from Ebola remains low.' British Pauline Cafferkey, Britain's latest Ebola victim, remains in a critical condition at London's Royal Free Hospital where she is being treated by doctor Michael Jacobs, right . Miss Cafferkey was diagnosed with Ebola and was seen  walking from an ambulance at Glasgow Airport as she was moved by military aircraft to London last week . Ms Cafferkey left Sierra Leone  on her long journey back to Glasgow via Casablanca and Heathrow . Owen Smith, MP for Pontypridd and shadow Welsh secretary, said earlier today: 'I am being kept informed by the leadership of Royal Glamorgan Hospital of the facts of the situation, as they unfold. 'I know that the people of Pontypridd will be compassionate and understand the risk to public health is extremely limited. 'I would also like to extend my thanks to the hardworking staff of Royal Glamorgan Hospital, who will no doubt be giving their patient the very best care, as they endeavour to do for all patients.' The suspected case came as the condition of British nurse Pauline Cafferkey remains critical at London's Royal Free Hospital. The 39-year-old was diagnosed with Ebola after returning from Sierra Leone in West Africa where she was volunteering with Save the Children last month. She has been given an anti-viral drug and is being transfused with blood plasma from a European Ebola survivor but both treatments are 'not proven to work', her doctor Michael Jacobs said. The decision by Heathrow officials to wave Miss Cafferkey through even though she said she felt ill sparked the search for 203 people who may have had contact with her on two flights . Officials from both Public Health England and Health Protection Scotland are currently reviewing the UK's screening procedures for Ebola, after it emerged Ms Cafferkey had been cleared to fly from London to Glasgow despite her temperature being checked seven times after she landed at Heathrow. The nurse was admitted to an isolation facility at the Brownlee unit in Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, at 8am on December 29. After a blood sample tested positive for Ebola, she was transferred by military plane to the Royal Free Hospital early the following morning. With more health workers due to return to the UK from Sierra Leone in the next two weeks, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged: 'We will keep all of the procedures under review. 'It is important that we learn lessons from the case of Pauline Cafferkey and that we learn lessons from any other case that might arise. 'I hope there are no other cases identified in Scotland or the UK but it is likely we will see other cases, a small number of additional cases, and we need to keep learning from the experience of dealing with them.' Ms Cafferkey had been working with the charity Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, before she became ill. At the Royal Free, where fellow nurse Will Pooley recovered from Ebola this year, she is in a cocooned bed in an isolation ward where medics treat her wearing protective suits. Earlier this week, a Briton who was feared to have the deadly virus tested negative for Ebola at Swindon hospital. The negative case follows two suspected patients last week - in Cornwall and Aberdeen - who were also confirmed not to have the virus. Yesterday it emerged the first safety trial of an experimental preventative Ebola vaccine is under way at a British university. The Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adults by the end of this month. Developers of the drug, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, have now accelerated it due to the continued spread of Ebola in West Africa. Ebola has so far killed 8,153 people and infected 20,656 in the past year, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures.","The patient was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff .

Fears of tears: Broadchurch star Olivia Colman, seen crying in the premiere episode broadcast on Tuesday night, has said she suspects he audience might be getting tired of seeing her in tears . The new series of Broadchurch took off with an emotional episode in court during the trial of Ellie's husband Joe charged with the murder of 11-year-old Danny Lattimer. Colman was seen crying both in and outside of the courtroom, and in an upcoming interview with Vogue she reveals she fears the tears might be the end of her career. 'I have a sneaking suspicion that audiences have seen me crying a little bit too often in the past couple of years,' she told Vogue. 'And if people get really fed up with me, then I won't get more work. And if I can't do what I love, then I will shrivel up and die. 'If something touches me, I cry. That's it. I'm a bit raw, a bit rubbish really. Often a director will say to me, ""I don't think this is a scene where your character cries."" And all I can say is, good luck with that!'

'I have to feel it; it's as simple as that. It's just like if you're watching something moving and you feel yourself welling up. It's the same thing. 'You're just being carried along with the story.

"More than ten years after their deaths, a notorious bank robber  is going to trial for the murder of two people whose bodies were found buried in his yard. Hugo Selenski, 41, gained notoriety in 2003 when authorities found at least five bodies buried on his northeastern Pennsylvania property. Two of those bodies were identified as Michael Kerkowski, a drug-dealing pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett. Selenski allegedly strangled Kerkowski, who had pleaded guilty to selling more than 300,000 doses of painkillers without prescriptions, and his girlfriend, Fassett,  in May 2002. He was charged for their murders when authorities uncovered their bodies more than one year later. Trial: Hugo Selenski, 41, (photographed) is going to trial for the 2002 murder of a Pennsylvania couple more than 10 years after being charged with murder . Charged: Selenski was charged in 2003 for the murders of Michael Kerkowski (left), a drug-dealing pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett (right) and is now going on trial . Bodies: In 2003, police uncovered five bodies buried on Selenski's Pennsylvania property, two of those were identified as Michael Kerkowski, a drug-dealing pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett . 'She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,' Lisa Sands, Fassett's sister, said, happy that her sister's alleged killer will finally stand trial. Authorities say Selenski killed the couple then stole tens of thousands of dollars from Kerkowski. Selenski originally hid the bodies behind a high school, but soon, he and an accomplice, Paul Weakley, moved the bodies and buried them on Selenski's property, Weakley told police. The convict continued to attract attention when he subsequently escaped from prison using bed sheets, turned himself in three days later, and won acquittal on homicide charges for two of the other corpses found on his property, according to The Patriot News. For years, Selenski has managed to avoid trial for the death's of Kerkowski and Fassett. After Selenski was cleared in 2006 of the deaths of two of the other people found in his yard, it was Kerkowski's and Fassett's turn for justice -- at least it was supposed to be. The case has been shelved repeatedly by a slew of appeals, the dismissal and desertion of attorneys, and jurisdiction being transferred to five different judges in the last two years, according to the Standard Speaker. All of these factors have contributed to Selenski's dodging trial -- until now. It seems that even he knew it was only a matter of time before he would be brought to justice. 'A long time coming. A real long time,' Selenski told reporters as sheriff's deputies escorted him through the courthouse Wednesday morning. Bury: Selenski allegedly strangled the couple and his the bodies behind a high school before enlisting the help of an accomplice to bury the bodies on his property . Sentence: Selenski is currently serving an up to 65-year sentence for a 2003 robbery . Lawyers will begin choosing a jury Thursday, but the process is expected to take several days. In fact, jury selection was supposed to begin Monday, according to WNEP, but was held up over arguments about whether to allow prosecutors to use the preliminary hearing testimony of a deceased witness. The issue took most of the morning to resolve, causing court officials to send 150 potential jurors home for the day, telling them to return Thursday, according to the Times-Leader. Selenski is currently serving 32 1/2 to 65  years in state prison for a January 2003 robbery, Weakley, who participated in the robbery, is cooperating with prosecutions against Selenski under a plea agreement, according to the Patriot.","Hugo Selenski, 41, was charged in 2003 with killing a drug-dealing pharmacist and his girlfriend but has avoided trial .

"Phylicia Rashad, Cosby's former television wife, was today attacked by a lawyer for his alleged victims after for defending the star. Rashad was reported as saying: 'Forget these women. What you are seeing is the destruction of a legacy and it's a legacy that is so important to the culture.' But fire-brand lawyer Miss Allred hit out, branded her defense of the 77-year-old star 'pathetic'. 'Phylicia, I vow to you that I will not forget these women, because women matter. They deserve respect and dignity. Phylicia, you should be supporting these women rather than joining Cosby's paid ""attack dogs"" who are trying to undermine them in any way.' She added: 'Predators have no right to prey upon women, to drug them, to sexually assault them, to hurt them and to target them, humiliate them and force them to endure physical and emotional pain.' Rashad played Claire Huxtable, wife of Cosby's Dr Cliff Huxtable, in the Cosby Show. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attack: Attorney Gloria Allred (center) today came out fighting after his on-screen wife, Phylicia Rashad, defended the comedian over allegation after allegation that he drugged and raped women . Phylicia Rashad (pictured with Cosby in 2011) came out to strongly defend her former co-star Bill Cosby against sexual assault allegations, in an interview published on Tuesday . Telling Phylicia that Cosby's legacy 'is destroyed', with no one to blame but himself, she added: 'Phylicia, if anyone did to you or to your daughter, your sister or your mother, what Cosby is alleged to have done to these women, I have no doubt that you would [not] be saying ""Forget these women"". Instead you would be supporting them.' Attorney Gloria Allred today introduced three more alleged victims of comedy legend Bill Cosby and said 'numerous' others have contacted her but choose to remain anonymous. The women – all of whom haven't spoken before – take the number of victims who claim to have been raped or sexually assaulted by Cosby to more than 30. Sitting next to Miss Allred at her LA offices the three women broke down in tears as they told of allegedly being attacked by the star. Two of them claim they were drugged and raped by Cosby while the third said she was drugged and sexually assaulted. Miss Allred said the women were allegedly attacked when they were 'young and extremely vulnerable' and have come forward despite moves by Cosby to discredit previous victims. Even more: Linda Kirkpatrick (second from right) and the two other new victims spoke at the press conference in Los Angeles . Comfort: As Linda Kirkpatrick cries, alleged victim Kacey is comforted by Gloria Allred, the attorney . She said recent reports indicated Cosby has spent thousands of dollars to hire investigators to try ti find ways to discredit some of the alleged victims. But Miss Allred said of her clients: 'The three women who are with me here today have decided that they will not be intimidated by Cosby's money, fame and power and they will have the courage to speak out today about what they believe was the victimization of them.' During the press conference Miss Allred also slammed Phylicia Rashad, Cosby's former television wife, for defending the star. She added: 'Predators have no right to prey upon women, to drug them, to sexually assault them, to hurt them and to target them, humiliate them and force them to endure physical and emotional pain.' Telling Phylicia that Cosby's legacy 'is destroyed', with no one to blame but himself, she added: 'Phylicia, if anyone did to you or to your daughter, your sister or your mother, what Cosby is alleged to have done to these women, I have no doubt that you would [not] be saying ""Forget these women"". Instead you would be supporting them.' Tonight Cosby is expected to take to the stage in Ontario Canada to perform his comedy show. The promoters of Cosby's three performances in Canada announced that they would go ahead with the shows despite the controversy. But women's rights leaders have organized protests outside the venues tonight tomorrow and Friday. Miss Allred said: 'What happened to these women is no joke and I don't think any of this is a laughing matter and I would hope that no one would be in essence subsidizing Bill Cosby's defense by buying tickets to his show.' Miss Allred said that none of the new accusations fall within the statute of limitations for a civil or criminal action against Cosby. But she reiterated that she has told Cosby's representatives that the star could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court. She has previously challenged Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them. Miss Allred even invited Cosby's wife Camille to come to her office to meet with the alleged victims personally adding that more women would 'find their voice' and come forward. She said: 'The end goal is as much justice that is possible under the circumstances.' Before Christmas Miss Allred introduced three other alleged victims of Cosby but when asked how many women she now represents, including those who choose to remain anonymous, she said: 'I've not kept count.' Cosby and co-star Rashad as the Huxtables in the long-running Cosby Show for which she won an Emmy . The three alleged victims Linda Kirkpatrick, Lynn Neal (not her real name), and Kacey (no last name given) all shared strikingly similar stories of their encounters with Cosby. And they all say it was the fear of retaliation that prevented them from speaking out sooner. Blonde Kirkpatrick says she was drugged and assaulted in 1981 when she was 25, after playing in a tennis tournament against Cosby in Las Vegas. The star invited her to his show after the tournament, where he gave her a drink which she said tasted ‘terrible’. ‘I knew something was terribly terribly wrong with whatever I had consumed in the drink he gave me,’ she says. The next thing she recalls was being back in Cosby’s dressing room. ‘I was lying down. Cosby was on top of me kissing me forcefully. I had no interest in sex of any kind with Bill Cosby.’ She added: ‘I recall seeing a silver bracelet with CAMILLE (Cosby’s wife’s name) on it. I remember thinking why is he doing this to me even while wearing his wife’s bracelet.’ Kirkpatrick says Cosby called her the next day to apologize, and that he invited her back to his show. He allegedly assaulted her again that night, using force instead of drugs, since Kirkpatrick says she was careful not to drink anything that time. She said Cosby ‘grabbed’ her from the front, ‘locked me in an aggressive hug, with his arms wrapped around my back and forcefully tried to kiss me. He held so tightly against my body that it was obvious he was sexually aroused. ‘I said “Stop it. No. Let me go”, and managed to get myself out of his grip and pushed him away.’ Lynn Neal, who was wearing a black baseball cap and spectacles, says Cosby assaulted her sometime between 1982 and 1983 when she was in her twenties. She says he drugged and raped her at one of his shows after meeting her at a health club where she worked. She says Cosby took her to dinner and made her down a shot of Stoli vodka before taking her back to his dressing room. The 77-year-old comedian is scheduled to appear at the Centre in the Square in Kitchener, Ontario, (pictured) on Wednesday . Tennis fan: Cosby is a high-profile player of the game. In 1994 he appeared during the US Open for a charity engagement . ‘When we entered the dressing room I sat on the couch and he started taking my pants down. I said what are you doing, stop.

Kacey said she considered Cosby ‘a father figure, or a favorite uncle’ at the time. He invited her to lunch at his suite in the Bel Air hotel in LA one day, where he allegedly forced her to take ‘a large white pill.’ Brunette Kacey says she tried to refuse the pill but Cosby asked her ‘would I give you anything that would hurt you?

She says after consuming the pill she woke up to see him naked in bed beside her. She quit her job shortly after.
