Two mothers driven to distraction by their teething babies have invented a device they believe will make life easier for new mothers everywhere. The Neckerchew not only catches dribble but also helps to soothe the gums of teething infants thanks to a chewable triangular portion at the bottom of a scarf worn around the baby's neck. The brainchild of friends Julie Wilson and Amy Livingstone, the multi-purpose neckerchief cannot be dropped on the ground - saving parents the hassle of constant sanitising. More than 1,000 have been sold in a matter of weeks and the pair, who met at an antenatal class in 2011 prior to birth of their first children, have heard from a number of global firms. Innovative: The Neckerchew, which combines a bib with a teether, has proved popular with parents . Specially made: The teether at the end of the bib is made from a material designed not to annoy tender gums . The success is a world away from the birth of the design, which came about when the two mums chatted about their struggles with the tricky problem of dribbling, teething babies. The 'mumpreneurs' seemed to spend much of their time cleaning dropped teethers. Both were keen to find a solution. Julie, 48, who lives in the Morningside area of Edinburgh with estate agent husband Graeme and their 21-month-old daughter, Grace, said: 'When children start to teethe, they dribble a lot and they want to chew everything they can get their hands on. 'All any of us seemed to do was pick up and re-sanitise teethers, and we felt there had to be an easier way. That's when we thought ""well, what if the teether was somehow attached to the baby?""' Sure that they had spotted a gap in the market, the pair spent the next nine months doing market research. Amy, 35, who lives in Roslin, Midlothian, with husband Alastair, who works for the government, and their 20-month-old son, Dawson, said: 'We started to look into what kind of fabrics would be best and found one that is gentle enough for a baby but also absorbent enough to make sure dribble doesn't soak through. 'For the teething part, we found a material that is safe for babies to chew on, and that wouldn't peel or flake.' Inventors: Mothers Amy Livingstone (left) and Julie Wilson (right) are behind the new teething device . Popular: Julie and Amy have sold 1,100 Neckerchews since February and the device is in demand globally . Amy, who is expecting a second child in June and is using her maternity leave to devote more time to the business, and Julie, an innovation manager at Scottish Enterprise, decided they wanted to keep their budding business in Scotland. Julie said: 'We found a company based in Glasgow called Tot Bots who put together a great prototype, so we're happy to be working with them.' Since the product launched in February, the pair have been astonished by its success. Julie said: 'We've sold over 1,100 already, double our projections for the first year. The feedback has been phenomenal. It's such a simple idea, but people have really responded fantastically to it.' More than 20 independent stockists and four national retailers including JoJo Maman Bebe are set to have the Neckerchews on the shelves by summer. Amy said: 'We've also had interest from distributors in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Japan, Ireland and Australia, so soon they could be taking over the world.' Millionaire businessman Sir Tom Farmer, founder of Kwik-Fit, hailed the 'simple solution' and said he was 'very pleased' to hear of Julie and Amy's success. He added: 'It's wonderful that these two ladies have been inspired to overcome this problem by creating a product that will not only serve them well, but will also be of a benefit to plenty of other parents. Often simple solutions make the best ideas. I wish them the best of luck.' Family affair: Neckerchew founders Amy Livingstone and Julie Wilson with son Dawson and daughter Grace .

When former music promoter and journalist Roger St Pierre rolled up outside his new home in Essex in 2005, he did so with three articulated lorries full of his possessions in tow. The historic house called The Hoods, in the pretty village of Wethersfield near Braintree, had a large double-storey annexe – the perfect space to accommodate the contents of those vast lorries. For inside were 50,000 LPs – mostly by Motown and American R ’n’ B artists – as well as Roger’s collection of 850 beer bottles. Great tales: Roger St Pierre, former PR man for Motown's biggest voices, is selling his four-bedroom historic home in Essex for £495,000 . And although the Grade II listed house has parts dating back to the 16th and 17th Centuries, he was able to move straight in. ‘I hired a surveyor who specialised in old houses and he said the only work that was necessary was to empty some leaves out of a drain,’ he said. ‘This house was obviously built to last – it was here 500 years before I got here and will still be standing 500 years after I’ve left. So I saw no reason to change things.’ But the previous owners made one small but vital alteration before they left. While removing plaster in the living room, they discovered an ornate 16th Century fresco. It’s a picture of Adam and Eve and carries script from the Bible. The fresco was covered up during Cromwell’s time when depictions of figures in the Bible were considered blasphemous. Come to my Hood: The Hoods in Weathersfield, near Braintree in Essex dates back to the 16th century . Open space: The house boasts wooden beams, open fireplaces and exposed brickwork in the large front room . Unique: The ornate 16th Century fresco shows Adam and Eve and carries script from the Bible and is one of 12 remaining frescoes from that period . It has been authenticated by experts from the Victoria and Albert Museum and is one of only 12 frescoes from the period left in Britain. But it’s not the only reminder of the past in this four-bedroom house. Exposed oak beams, brick fireplaces and floorboards leave visitors in no doubt that The Hoods has enjoyed a glorious history. The property, on the market for £495,000, also has plenty to offer gardeners, with a well-established 165ft plot. And of course the annexe has great potential as a granny flat or accommodation for teenagers preparing to fly the nest. Divorcé Roger, 71, moved to Essex from London to be near his daughter, who ran a local pub. She has moved back to London and Roger, who now less mobile, is selling up because he needs a home with no stairs. Most of his record collection has been sold, but what’s left would be the envy of any music fan – a reminder of Roger’s career in the business when he was the publicist on tours for Marvin Gaye, James Brown and David Soul of Starsky And Hutch fame. He recalls with a chuckle: ‘I was there when Marvin famously stood up Princess Margaret. He was performing at the Lakeside Country Club in Surrey and she requested he had dinner with her before the show. ‘He was staying at the Britannia hotel in Mayfair and we just couldn’t get him out of his room, so Princess Margaret was kept waiting at the table. 'We had to ring Berry Gordy, the top guy at Motown, to persuade Marvin to come down, but when we got to the venue, Princess Margaret had gone and Marvin started complaining that she had stood him up!’ Beresfords, 01376 348444;  beresfordsgroup.co.uk .","Four-bedroom home of Motown publicist on the market for £495,000 .

Vice President Joe Biden made quite an entrance when his motorcade pulled up to St. John's Episcopal Church on Monday morning, sporting some Top Gun-style aviators even though the sun had not fully risen. He was accompanied by his wife Dr Jill Biden, who wore a stunning grey silk dress, and several members of his family. Though he appeared cool and collected on Monday morning, Vice President Biden made his latest gaffe just last night as he told supporters that he was 'proud to be the President of the United States'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Too cool for school: Vice President Joe Biden made an impact by wearing aviators and a black scarf . Taking fashion pointers? The aviators that Mr Biden wore to church this morning were made popular by Tom Cruise who played a fighter pilot in the 1986 film Top Gun . Taking the oath: Vice President Joe Biden was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, with his wife Jill holding a family Bible and his children standing alongside him . Joking Joe: Mr Biden shared a laugh with President Obama and Senator Chuck Schumer shortly after arriving on the platform . His statement at the Iowa State Society inauguration ball was greeted at first by silence, before the crowd started to laugh and cheer as he corrected himself. Four years after making history by becoming the first African-American president, Obama was due today to kick off his second term with a scaled-back inauguration to reflect the tempered expectations for his next four years in office. Demure: Dr Jill Biden wore a grey jacket and matching dress . All smiles: Joe and Jill appear very happy as they greet Reverend Luis Leon at the church . The full look: During their walk after the formal ceremony, viewers were able to glimpse at Dr Jill Biden's look . Prepped: She wore her blonde hair loose and dangling pearl earrings . But Biden's gaffe on Saturday could be a premonition for 2016 as he hasn't ruled out the possibility that he will run for office after President Obama finishes his second term. Even though he will be just a few days short of his 74th birthday on the next election day, Biden has hinted he is considering a run for president. Because Iowa is an early battleground in the state-by-state primaries which determine the political parties' candidates for president, any big event thrown by state officials this weekend was likely to draw at least one or two potential contenders for the White House in 2016. Following the slip-up, Biden, corrected himself, and returned to a favorite line from this fall's campaign. Patterned: During the luncheon Joll's dress was fully on view, and unlike Mrs Obama who normally shows her toned arms with sleeveless dresses, Mrs Biden was the one to opt for a cooler cut this time around . Sharing a laugh: Mrs Biden and Mr Obama had a giggle when they attended the luncheon in Statuary Hall . 'I'm proud to be vice president of the United States,' he said, 'but I am prouder to be Barack Obama's, President Barack Obama's, vice president.' Biden's unannounced appearance at the 'First in the Nation' ball in Washington was not too surprising. Aside from any of his own personal . political aspirations, the state was also key to the Obama-Biden team's . victory over Republicans Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the November 6 . election. Looking away but at each other: Mr Biden ran up to many of the waving crowds and shook a few hands but Mrs Biden stayed pretty much on course and waved to admirers . Biden went on to say he had dropped by to thank Iowans for supporting the Democratic ticket in the election. 'I . came to say thank you,' Biden told those gathered at the National . Museum of Women in the Arts, a short walk from the White House. 'Just . simply thank you.' Showing . appreciation to Iowa, an industrial and farm state that is home to 3 . million people, is an expected courtesy in national politics because of . the state's role in separating contenders from pretenders in each . presidential race. Vice President Biden takes the oath of office during the 57th Presidential Inauguration official swearing-in ceremony at the Naval Observatory in Washington on Sunday . Vice President Joe Biden has hinted he could intend to run for president in 2016, when President Barack Obama's second term will come to an end . In early 2008, the results in the Iowa caucuses convinced many Democrats that Obama could win the Democratic nomination over former first lady Hillary Clinton, now Obama's secretary of state. Next to Clinton, Biden is widely seen one of the two top contenders for the Democrats in the next election cycle. Also in the crowd at the Iowa party was Maryland's Democratic governor, Martin O'Malley. Mr O'Malley was a frequent surrogate for Obama in 2012 and is also seen by many Democrats as a potential presidential possibility - meaning he could be spending a lot of time with Iowans during the next three years.

Researchers have made a major breakthrough in the search for treatments for degenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease (file picture posed by models) A major breakthrough has been made by researchers seeking treatments for degenerative illnesses such as Parkinson's Disease. Researchers at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology have detailed how an enzyme in the brain interacts with a drug-like lead compound for Huntington's Disease to inhibit its activity. The team said their findings demonstrate that it can be developed as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, . Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Working with colleagues at the University of Leicester and the University of Lisbon in Portugal, the researchers identified the molecular structure of the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygense (KMO), which is found in the human brain. It took five years for the team to establish the crystal structure of KMO - the first time it's ever been done. The scientists, who published the research in the journal Nature, then studied how the compound UPF 648 binds tightly to the enzyme to act as an inhibitor. Previous studies with animal models of neurodegenerative disease have showed that switching off the enzyme activity through drug binding should be effective in the treatment of brain disorders. Study leader Professor Nigel Scrutton said: 'UPF 648 works very well as an inhibitor of enzyme activity. 'However, in its current form it does not pass into the brain from the blood. 'The search is now on for related compounds that can both inhibit the enzyme and pass into the brain.' The team said their findings demonstrate the enzyme can be developed as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (file picture) He added: 'Our research detailing the molecular structure of the enzyme now enables a search for new KMO inhibitors that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. 'This provides real hope for developing drug therapies to target neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.' Dr Flaviano Giorgini, the team's neurogeneticist from the University of Leicester, said: 'This is a big move forward for the development of new KMO inhibiting drugs. 'Unlocking the crystal structure of KMO is a real boost to our efforts to find treatments for this devastating disease' - Professor Sarah Tabrizi . 'It is hoped that such compounds may ultimately be tested in clinical trials and prove beneficial for patients.' The findings from the research will now be used in the search for more effective treatments for Huntington's Disease. Professor Sarah Tabrizi, head of the Huntington's disease research team at University College London's Institute for Neurology, said: 'Unlocking the crystal structure of KMO is a real boost to our efforts to find treatments for this devastating disease. 'It provides a solid basis for the optimisation of inhibitor drugs like UPF 648 that are being developed by the global Huntington's disease research community. 'KMO is one of our top drug targets, and the crystal structure is a significant step along our roadmap to clinical trials of KMO inhibitors in patients.' Cath Stanley, chief executive of the Huntington's Disease Association, also welcomed the findings. She said: 'This research is a really exciting piece of the jigsaw that enables us to understand a little more and takes us a step closer to being able to provide an effective treatment for Huntington's Disease.'","Researchers discover enzyme in brain inhibits activity of drug-like lead compound for Huntington's Disease .

Police dogs have been fitted with state-of-the-art cameras so they can record themselves apprehending criminals. The technology also allows officers to check out a building from the dogs' perspective to make sure it is safe before they enter it themselves. Police met at the Durham and Cleveland firearms training centre near Darlington to test the new body K9cams on their animals. Scroll down for video . Camera: A police dog with a K9cam mounted on its back beaming images back to officers . Training: An officer puts the camera through its paces at the Durham and Cleveland firearms training centre . Missions: The technology allows police to film inside buildings without putting themselves at risk by entering . The cameras are strapped to the dogs' torsos, and record every moment they are on duty. As well as providing video which can be played back later and used as a record of missions, the devices can beam back live video to officers. Durham Police have been working with manufacturer Tactical Electronics UK since January last year to develop the more practical cameras to help in police searchers and other serious incidents. The result was the ARK, an armed response kit comprising the back-mounted K9cam, a long-pole camera with a 20ft reach, and monitors so handlers and tactical advisors can see the images. Development: The camera and associated devices were invented by Tactical Electronics UK . Handler: An officer poses with his dog wearing the K9cam at the training centre this week . Comfortable: The dogs are accustomed to the back-mounted camera than a head-mounted one . The gear has already been used at a number of firearms and other high-risk incidents in the North-East. PC . Dave Robinson, one of the force's dog handlers, said that the equipment . was a great improvement on the head-mounted cameras they used to put on . the dogs. 'This camera . - as opposed to the last camera - is mounted on the dog's back,' he . said. 'And because dogs when they're tracking or searching normally wear . a harness anyway, they're very, very comfortable with something being . on their back. 'Whereas . a head-mounted unit, although it was very good, it was a big ask of a . dog to wear it for a long period of time without interfering with it.' Perspective: The view from one of the cameras attached to a dog's back in the training facility . Dry run: This video footage is broadcast live to the dog's handler and other officers on standby . Suspect: The police dog apprehending a dummy made to look like a potential criminal . Inspector Russ Robson added: 'This is something that is readily available so it is part of our armed response vehicle, so if there's a firearms job or a high-risk person missing from home, we do not need to have it brought to us. 'It fits on the body of the dog, rather than the headcams we had before, where we had to use quite a mature dog. 'It also means we don't have to put up cordons, empty houses and close of roads. 'We have the public, officers and other emergency services who we must safeguard first and we can send them in and clear the area. 'The dog that we have got have all taken to it and there's been no adverse reactions to it - it's light and on a harness that they wear, so the dogs have seen some benefit.'

Her five-year-old daughter Ava suffers with the rare condition Shwachman Diamond Syndrome (SDS), which compromises her immune system so much that a common cold could kill her. The rare condition, which affects just 60 people in the UK, affects digestion, growth, immune system, bone marrow, teeth and skeletal development. And because a sufferer's bone marrow does not function properly, they possess little or no immune system. Constant risk: For Rebecca Crutchley, each day involves life-and-death decisions, as her five-year-old daughter Ava suffers from a rare condition that compromises her immune system . The disease makes Ava extremely prone to infection and puts her at an increased risk of developing bone marrow failure and septicaemia. Around 30 per cent sufferers also develop acute myeloid leukaemia, one of the deadliest forms of cancer. ‘Ava could be playing outside one day, and fighting for her life the next,’ says Rebecca, 33, from Wigston, Leicestershire. ‘It is worrying that she could develop leukaemia at any time, but she deserves a childhood.’ The disease is so rare that her parents are unsure of what Ava’s life-expectancy will be. SDS is an inherited genetic disorder. Both Rebecca, and Ava's father, Tom, carry one copy of the mutated gene, but were not aware of their genetic defect until Ava was diagnosed aged one. ‘It was a relief when she was diagnosed,' said Mrs Crutchley. 'Although it was hard work at first, now we've got the condition under control and know what symptoms to look for.’ Happy days: Despite her serious condition, which puts her at an increased risk of leukemia, Ava tries to enjoy a normal childhood . Each day Ava must take eight different medications and have an injection to keep the symptoms of the condition at bay. However, the medication means that if Ava did develop leukaemia, it would spread much quicker than in a normal case. As a result she must undergo bone marrow tests every 18 months to check for the first signs of the cancer. ‘We try to go on holiday or travel to see family every year - we've been to Hong Kong to see family and Euro Disney,’ adds Mrs Crutchley. When Ava was younger she suffered with malnutrition, recurrent infection, fatigue and thin hair . ‘I take precautions in having specialised travel insurance and always make sure our doctor is available if we need to call.’ When Ava was a baby her suffered with malnutrition, fatigue, hair loss, extremely dry, fragile skin as well as frequent infections which required hospitalisation. ‘Doctors kept trying to tell me she was just a slow developer, but I knew it was more than that. ‘She was scarily ill - all she would do was scream and sleep. I work as a medical secretary so I was I was working or with Ava, I was constantly  in hospital. I didn't see daylight for days.’ Ava is youngest person with SDS to possess a working pancreas. Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital . (GOSH) started the then three-year-old Ava on a pancreatic supplement . called Creon, but after six months of taking the medicine, Ava's . pancreas started working on its own. Ava's nine-year-old sister Freya is a bone marrow match for her, should she need it . Usually children with the condition don't possess a functioning pancreas until the age of seven, if at all. And because this was so extraordinary, Great Ormond Street contacted the family to ask whether Ava could participate in research to use at the SDS conference in America. ‘Doctors want to trial her off the jab because they don't know the long-term effects [of the medication], but she develops symptoms almost straight away if she misses one,’ explains Mrs Crutchley. ‘It's very worrying but Ava is very brave.' The family know that their nine-year-old daughter Freya is a bone marrow match for Ava, but if Ava underwent the transplant now there would be a higher chance of rejection. ‘She could go into bone marrow failure tomorrow, but we can't keep her wrapped in cotton wool,’ says Rebecca. ‘She needs to get out and be a normal child.' Ava's cousin Isaac Crutchley is running the Greater Manchester Marathon in April for GOSH.

A baby was born on the bathroom floor of his parents’ home just two hours after midwives sent them home from hospital. William Jones had to be delivered by his father after his mother Vanessa was told by maternity unit staff she was 'only in the early stages' of labour. The birth occurred shortly after she and husband Billy were turned away from the delivery suite at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Lancashire - despite Mr Jones making a video of her having her contractions and in obvious pain inside the maternity unit. Mr Jones, 41, a joiner, from Warton, near Preston, said: 'It is amazing and an honour to deliver my baby boy - not every husband gets to do that - but the fact is we do feel let down by the hospital. William Jones was born in his parents' bathroom after his mother Vanessa was told by the hospital she was only in the early stages of labour. His father Billy delivered him . Healthy: 8lb William was born with the umbilical cord around his neck, which his father had to untangle . 'William should have been born the safe environment of a maternity unit - not on my bathroom floor where they were obvious dangers. When he came out he was born with the umbilical cord around his neck and I had to untangle it and obviously I was very worried in case he couldn’t breathe. It was only when he cried that I could breathe a massive sigh of relief. 'I am so annoyed and concerned for other expecting parents visiting that hospital - could you imagine what that experience could do to first-time parents - it would destroy them and could put them off having other children. 'We were in shock a few days after it happened because it all could have gone horribly wrong.' Mrs Jones's waters broke on Wednesday April 2 and when she began suffering contractions, the couple headed to hospital. Mrs Jones, 33, a telesales worker, has two older sons. Mr Jones added: 'Vanessa knew she was going into labour and I thought it was pretty obvious she was too - we’re experienced with pregnancies, especially since she’s already given birth to her two sons and I’ve also got four children from a previous relationship. 'But they sent us away saying the baby wasn’t imminent and told us to go home and get some sleep. 'We were very surprised at the time, but you put your faith in the professionals and we followed their advice from the hospital and they went back home to bed to try and get some sleep. 'I drifted off to sleep but Vanessa was still suffering pain so must have got up. She said she was sat in the bathroom for around an hour and ran herself a bath. But the baby was coming - she yelled and screamed at me, ""the heads here"". 'I woke up and was thrown into the surreal situation. In a panic I phoned the hospital and it took around eight attempts to get hold of the midwife. She advised Vanessa not to go into the bath, so Vanessa got down on her knees on the bathroom floor. 'I screamed ‘Help us the baby is coming’ - she finally realised William was coming then and there.' Billy . said Vanessa’s sons, Jack, 8, and Kyle, 9, along with his 18-year-old . daughter Katie, who lived with them, woke up to the most awful scene. William was born weighing eight pounds. The unexpected birth occurred jut two hours after Mr and Mrs Jones were turned away from the delivery suite at Blackpool Victoria Hospital . He said: 'They woke up to her screaming ""the head’s here"", and I didn’t know what to do. 'We were on the phone to the delivery suite, which sent for an ambulance, but I had the baby in my hands by the time the paramedics got here. 'It was just so surreal how it all happened - Vanessa made me watch One Born Every Minute a few times, but it made me so squeamish. 'had no idea how to deliver a baby so to be put in that position was terrifying. 'We are just so relieved William was . breathing because otherwise, he could have died. It took paramedics . around 25 minutes to arrive after he was born, so anything could have . happened.' Mrs Jones said: . 'I knew I was in labour, but they said I wasn’t.

Staff at Blackpool Royal Infirmary (pictured) said it was not always possible to predict the speed of established labour . 'I could hardly move in the car coming home, and an hour and a half later I was in full blown labour. Luckily William was fine, but it could have been totally different if he came out not breathing. That upsets me more than anything.' Head of midwifery at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Nicola Parry, said: 'We are sorry to hear that Mrs Jones was unhappy with the quality of care she received at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. 'It is normal practice for midwives to encourage patients who are in the early stages of labour to go home, but to keep in touch with the hospital, letting us know if there has been any changes in what they are experiencing, such as their contractions becoming stronger, their waters breaking or if they have any blood loss or concerns. 'They can come back in to the hospital at any time, even if they have just returned home, if they start experiencing the symptoms of active labour. 'We cannot comment on Mrs Jones case because of patient confidentiality, but will meet with her to discuss in full any concerns she and her family have, taking forward any lessons learned from that meeting.'","Vanessa Jones, 33, went to Blackpool Royal Infirmary in labour .

Risky behavior: A new study shows that 27.3per cent of skin cancer survivors in the U.S. never wear sunscreen outdoors . More than one in four people who have had skin cancer do not wear sunscreen, a new study has reported. The survey, undertaken by the American Association for Cancer Research, found that among those who have had melanoma - the fifth deadliest cancer for men and the seventh for women - 27.3per cent said they never use sunscreen. Even more shocking, 2.1per cent admitted that they still use tanning beds, which have been linked to skin cancer in several past studies. The research was based on the results of a 2010 National Health Interview survey involving 27,120 Americans. While 35.4per cent of the general population said they never use sunscreen, over a quarter of skin cancer survivors said the same. And even though survivors were more likely to stay in the shade than those with no history of melanoma, the results were still surprising. Dr Anees Chagpar, an associate professor of surgery at the Yale School of Medicine and the author of the study, was shocked at her findings. 'We expected melanoma survivors to be extraordinarily protective since we know sunlight exposure and tanning increases the risk of a second melanoma,' she told Today.com. On the contrary, 15.4per cent reported that they rarely or never sit in the shade when outdoors for more than in hour. Melanoma cases are on the rise, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, which reported that incidences increased 800per cent among young women in the period from 1970 to 2009. The Foundation also estimates that 76,690 new cases will be diagnosed, and 9,480 Americans will die of melanoma this year alone. The growing number of cases is due to . many factors - one of which, says Dr Jack Jacoub, medical oncologist at . Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California, is . society's perception that a tan is a sign of health and attractiveness. 'There is a fairly large emphasis on . beauty in this country,' he told the news website. 'Tanning is a . reflection of good health, too - the California lifestyle, you wonder if . people know the dangers but choose to ignore them.' Dr. Ali Hendi, a clinical assistant professor at Georgetown University . Medical Center, agrees with this standpoint, noting that statistics seem . to point to the fact that people are not being informed of the risks . involved in unprotected sunbathing. 'We know that sunlight exposure and tanning increases the risk of a second melanoma' 'We need to do a better job of educating . people,' said Dr Hendi, explaining that if melanoma is caught early, it . is 'essentially curable'. He believes that people who continue to . tan even after a skin cancer diagnosis are perhaps addicted to sunshine. 'People can be hooked on tanning,' he explained. 'Sunshine can have a . euphoric effect on the brain like other addictive substances.' Indeed, Dr Chagpar notes that in a . similar vein, some lung cancer survivors continue to smoke even after . diagnosis since they are addicted to the nicotine. On the other hand, perennial sunbathers could also be . satisfying an instinctive desire for vitamin D, says Dr David Fisher, . head of dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital. But according Dr Tony Farrenkopf, a clinical psychologist and chairman of psychology at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon, the reason behind this phenomenon is that people who have been diagnosed with skin cancer experience a sense of resignation. 'They say: ""I already got it, what other harm can it do?""' he explains - an untrue notion, since a person with a melanoma is nine times more likely to develop a second skin cancer. In any case, the findings are certainly disturbing. 'They say something about American society, and you wonder if patients have been properly counseled,' said Dr Jacoub.","According to a new study, 27.3per cent of people who have had the skin cancer say they never use sunscreen when outdoors for more than an hour .

"PUBLISHED: . 06:16 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:27 EST, 11 April 2013 . A year and a half ago Kerry Maletroit was so ill that she was unable to move or breathe for herself. With just 12 per cent lung capacity, she was in constant, excruciating pain and doctors had warned her she may not survive much longer. But now the Jersey born 30-year-old is fighting fit, saying she has never felt better and that she enjoys dancing the night away and taking her dog, Disney, for a walk on the beach. This dramatic turnaround is all thanks to the double lung transplant that Kerry underwent in November 2011. Kerry with her husband Philip and pet dog, Disney, just six months after her transplant . She is just one of thousands of Britons who have benefited from the 50 per cent increase in organ donation over the past five years, according to new figures released by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT). There are currently 7,300 patients on the transplant waiting list and 6,000 of those are waiting for new kidneys. Nearly every donor can provide at least one kidney and usually they will be able to provide two. Each day three Britons die waiting for an organ. Kerry suffers with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a genetic condition that affects collagen production. It causes tissue, blood vessels and joints in the body to be stretchy and fragile. For most people, the condition isn't life-threatening, but if teamed with other conditions, symptoms can be more serious. Kerry suffered with asthma as a child and suffered bouts of pneumonia as a teenager which severely damaged her already fragile lung tissue. Fragile: Kerry pictured six months before her double lung transplant . Road to recovery: Kerry pictured nine weeks after her organ transplant . ‘The last bout was when I was 18 and I was left very wheezy,’ says Kerry, a former administrator. ‘I found exercise harder than most but I was able to function and with an asthma pump. Life was pretty normal.’ However, over the course of her twenties, Kerry’s health deteriorated rapidly. Doctors regularly tested her lung function and tried to manage her breathlessness but they were unable to stop the steady decline in her ability to breathe. ‘It was terrible – imagine pinching your nose and breathing through a straw,’ says Kerry. ‘That was how life was, day in, day out. It is really terrifying because your body is starved of oxygen and there’s nothing you can do.’ As her body became increasingly weak, she became prone to infection and developed severe and debilitating panic attacks that left her frightened to leave her house. The couple married before Kerry's transplant because they were unsure of what the outcome would be . As Kerry (pictured with husband Philip) became more ill, her weight plummeted to just over five stone . Her skin turned an ashen grey, her weight plummeted to just over five stone and she was eventually fed intravenously in a desperate bid to get her to put on weight so she could grow new lung tissue. ‘I was so weak I had to catch a bus to work even though it was only a 15 minute walk away,’ she says. ‘Eventually it got to the point where I couldn’t even brush my teeth without getting out of breath.’ By age 25, doctors were keen for Kerry to have a transplant, although she was reluctant to have such a major operation, admitting she was in denial about her grave situation:  ‘You never imagine it will be you and, at the time, I couldn’t quite cope with the situation. It was entirely overwhelming.’ In July 2010 Kerry was put on the organ donor list but had to wait a further 16 months until a suitable pair of lungs – one that matched her size and blood type – came up. During this time she became critically ill. Throughout this period, she hospitalised at the Royal Brompton Hospital in north west London. Finally she was placed permanently in intensive care because she repeatedly went into full respiratory arrest and could not breathe without the aid of a lung bypass machine. ‘Doctors told my family they were not sure how long I would last so my husband Philip called my family and they flew over from Jersey to spend as much time as possible with me before time ran out,’ she says. ‘But by the end of their visit I went into such a severe respiratory arrest I was sedated and put in an artificial coma.’ Miraculously, during this time a pair of donor lungs that matched Kerry’s criteria came up and a week later Kerry woke up with new lungs. New lease of life: Kerry with husband Philip before her operation (left) and after, as a bridesmaid in 2012 (right) 'My family were so frightened that I might give up the fight that as I slowly came round they kept whispering in my ear “Kerry, you’ve got new lungs. It’s all going to be okay, you’re going to get better!”,’ she remembers. ‘I was very confused because I was on so many drugs but I could hear them.’ Within hours of the transplant at the Harefield Hospital, Kerry’s family were astonished by the visible difference in her health. She was still incredibly weak but they couldn’t help but be shocked by her suddenly rosy cheeks. ‘It took me two days until I could even touch my nose because I was so exhausted, but within three weeks I was taken off a ventilator and able to breathe for myself,’ explains Kerry. ‘I couldn’t believe I’d made it – I was ecstatic.’ Kerry hasn’t met her donor’s family but she knows that her lungs came from a 47-year-old female. She has written to the family and says that every day is a reminder of how she is indebted to the anonymous woman who took the time to put herself on the register. ‘My lung function is now 90 per cent and I appreciate every single moment, every single thing. I just want to do the woman who helped me proud. I want to make sure I make the most of the extra time I’ve been given.’ Kerry continues to take anti-rejection drugs, steroids and a number of other medications to ensure her new lungs function properly for as long as possible. She says she is optimistic about the future. ‘I can honestly say I’ve never felt better in my life – I’ve booked a holiday to Australia with my husband and I’ve even applied for a job. Normal life has never felt so good.’ To register for organ donation visit NHSBT Donation . To read more about Kerry’s story visit her blog Transplant Tales . The sharp rise in organ donation is largely due to the creation of a network of specialist nurses who support bereaved families and discuss the possibility of organ donation with them. Specialist nurses are one of a number of recommendations made in 2008 by the Organ Donation Taskforce, following a decade of almost no increase in the number of donated organs. The taskforce also pushed for the creation of specialist organ retrieval teams and wider promotion and campaigning around the importance of organ donation. Giving and taking: The number of organs being donated is at an all time high . These recommendations have led to a sharp increase in organ donors across the UK – a rise of 49 per cent rise in England, of 16 per cent in Wales, of 74 per cent increase in Scotland and an astounding 82 per cent increase in Northern Ireland. Consequently there has been a 31 per cent boost in the number of people receiving a life-saving or enhancing organ transplant since 2008. ‘This is an outstanding achievement that few thought possible at the time this ambition was set,’ said Bill Fullagar, chairman of NHSBT. ‘It is the result of the hard work and dedication of staff in hospitals and communities across the country. ‘We must also share our heartfelt thanks with every family who, at a great time of sadness, supported their loves one's wish to donate their organs and transform the lives of up to nine other people.’ Despite the increase in organ donors, the numbers of families refusing to grant consent remains among the highest in Europe, and NHSBT is calling for more to be done. In addition to this, lack of organ donation awareness amongst the black and Asian community particularly needs to targeted, according to the NHSBT. Despite being three times more likely to need a transplant, only three per cent of this section of the population is on the organ donation register.","In 2011 Kerry Maltroit, 30, was close to death because her lungs failed .

A woman who was given a pioneering six-organ transplant has died 15 months after surgery. Dawn Carter underwent the 17-hour procedure in December 2011 to give her a new stomach, liver, kidney, colon, pancreas and small intestine. She was only the third to have have had such a operation. The first survivor, Stephen Hyett, received a new liver, kidney, stomach, duodenum, pancreas and small bowel in 1994. Ms Carter, 53, from Northallerton, Yorkshire, had worked as an intensive care nurse, and needed the drastic transplant after being diagnosed with end-stage liver disease in 2011. But in February this year, just after . telling her story to the Mail on Sunday, she was diagnosed with partial . rejection of two organs. Last month she suffered an infection that . triggered the first of several strokes which left her brain dead. Her partner, Martin Burch, spent the last seven weeks of Ms Carter's life by her side at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. When it was clear she was not going to recover, her mother Dorothy and her brother Larry also joined the bedside vigil. Mr Burch said: ‘They saw her for the last time and they switched the ventilator off and she died on Thursday, March 28.’ Ms Carter's health problems began when she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel complaint, at 19. A decade later, she underwent an operation to remove a section of her colon at Leeds General Infirmary. Her digestive health continued to deteriorate, leading to several more operations, which eventually left her with just five per cent of her intestine. This led to her receiving all her nutrition via fluids intravenously. In 2011, Ms Carter was told that her liquid diet had damaged her liver and she had end-stage liver disease. Referred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, her only chance of survival was a multi-organ transplant. Following the death of a female donor in her twenties, a 12-strong team of medics - composed of four surgeons, two anaesthetists, two operating department practitioners, two theatre nurses and two theatre staff - transplanted all the organs in an operation that finished on Christmas Eve in 2011. Only 30 out of 88,0000 transplants undertaken in Britain have involved three or more organs being implanted at once. Shortly after the operation, Ms Carter admitted she had been scared at the prospect of the rare procedure, but said she had gone ahead knowing she had ‘no choices left’. ‘I didn’t hold any fear about the operation,’ said Ms Carter. ‘In the anaesthetic room I thought, “This might be the last time I am alive”. But I felt fortunate I was getting this chance.’ Afterwards Ms Carter spent nine weeks on a ventilator in intensive care. During this time, she underwent a further 12 operations to treat complications, which included bleeding from her new liver and pancreas. She also required a 17-pint blood transfusion. The remarkable procedure was carried out by four surgeons, two anaesthetists, two operating department practitioners, two theatre nurses and two theatre staff . ‘I wasn’t well enough to read and I . had no other patients to talk to,’ Ms Carter told the Mail on Sunday. 'I hadn’t expected to . feel so ill for so long. I lost my hair and nails because all my blood . flow was going to my new organs to help them. But I got some wigs and . make-up.’ In total, she spent six months in hospital and had to learn to walk again. She . also had to take 18 tablets a day – immunosuppressant drugs, . antibiotics, enzymes and multivitamins. Her brother said she was beginning to enjoy better health by autumn last year and briefly returned to her work with Northallerton and District Voluntary Service Association. ‘She was getting back to a kind of normality and enjoyed the Christmas we promised we’d have together,’ he said. ‘She had made plans to return to work in January, which she did briefly, but a series of infections saw her return to Cambridge for treatment.’","Dawn Carter had a new stomach, liver, kidney, colon, pancreas and intestine .

Prasquier, speaking by mobile phone, said two other rabbis would temporarily fill the post of Grand Rabbi of France, which Rabbi Bernheim will leave for at least six months. Talks about whether he might return at all will take place in the coming months, he said. He said many people in France's 500,000-strong Jewish community have been shaken over the case. Rabbi Bernheim faced accusations by a French academic who tracks suspected plagiarism that parts of his 2011 book Forty Jewish Meditations and part of a text he wrote about gay marriage, same-sex parenting and adoption were lifted from others. That text, written autumn, was cited in the Christmas address of Pope Benedict XVI last year. Asked about the claims on Tuesday, Rabbi Bernheim confirmed having carried out ""borrowings ... what others might call plagiarism"" from others.

A furious husband has criticised the new NHS 111 phone service after his wife was left for 14 hours awaiting medical help - and is now fighting for her life in intensive care. Geoffrey Peace, 80, rang the new phone service at 8am on March 31 when his wife Sheila fell ill, and was told that a doctor could be with him within four hours. But it wasn't until 10pm that night that a doctor finally turned up - calling an ambulance and rushing 78-year-old Mrs Peace to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where she was put on dialysis suffering from kidney failure. Mr Peace has now hit out at the new service, telling how he rang four times between his first call at 8am and the doctor's arrival - only to be infuriated by a machine message telling him his call was in a queue. Angry: Geoffrey Peace is furious after he called the new NHS 111 helpline when his wife Sheila fell ill - and it took doctors 14 hours to respond. Mrs Peace is now fighting for her life after suffering kidney failure . Retired building inspector Geoffrey, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'I was very worried about Sheila but every time I rang this new service it was a machine talking at you, you couldn't say anything back. The grandfather-of-six added: 'It told me I was in a queue of ten callers, so I wasn't going to wait around because I could have been on the phone for hours. 'You put your trust in the medical profession, so you don't want to argue against them, but I think this new system is flawed. 'My wife was very ill when she got to hospital. When I went to see her, I thought she was gone. It was heartbreaking.' The new 111 advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for NHS Direct - . with non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance . on whether they should visit their GP or attend a hospital. The idea is the new service combines the long-running NHS Direct helpline with local emergency out-of-hours services. NHS bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out-of-hours . telephone services for GP surgeries will make it easier for patients to . get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends. Late diagnosis: When a doctor finally arrived at 10pm that night, Mrs Peace was rushed to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where she was put on dialysis, suffering from kidney failure . Mr Peace explained . he had originally been told that a doctor could be with him within four . hours - and if no-one had appeared, he was to phone back. Despite repeated attempts, he could not get through, nor could his daughter. He said: 'We were obviously getting more and more concerned throughout the day. I could have called an ambulance myself but I thought the doctors knew best, and I thought we'd be stuck waiting in A&E for hours. 'At about 10pm the doctor turned up, he examined Sheila and told me he would stabilise her but then told me her blood sugar level was low so he called an ambulance to rush her to hospital. 'Her kidneys have failed and she's now on dialysis.' Mrs Peace, a retired van driver, suffers from diabetes. She is said to be improving but is still attached to drips. The new 111 advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for NHS Direct - with non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance on whether they should visit their GP or attend a hospital . Mr Peace added: 'It makes people very unsure about what's the best thing to do. It's very frustrating and I think they really ought to change things back to the old system. 'I know Sheila's not the first person to be left like this for hours.' Colne Valley MP Jason McCartney said he had written to the NHS after receiving other complaints about the service. He said: ""It's unacceptable - I've been through it myself when calling [the previous system] NHS Direct for my own children and it's terribly worrying. 'It's clear there's been problems with the number of calls coming in and patients deserve better.' A spokeswoman for Yorkshire Ambulance Service, which runs 111 in partnership with Local Care Direct, said: 'We would like to apologise for the distress caused to Mrs Peace and her family following their call to NHS 111.'

Already in operation in 22 NHS regions, 111 is due to ‘go live’ in various areas of the county this month. Critics say those taking the calls do not need to be medically trained at all, and instead work through computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms . But organisations such as the British Medical Association have vehemently opposed the new helpline, arguing that those taking the calls do . not need to be medically trained at all, and instead work through . computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms. They may then be referred to speak on the phone with nurses or doctors if necessary. NHS Direct was launched in 1998 to provide medical advice round the . clock in an attempt to reduce the number of patients needlessly turning . up in A&E. NHS bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out-of-hours . telephone services for GP surgeries will make it easier for patients to . get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends. With 111, callers will be put through to a call centre worker who will decide if they . need to go to A&E, a GP clinic, a chemist or can get by with . over-the-phone advice. The operator can potentially send out an ambulance, put someone straight . through to a nurse, book an out-of-hours GP appointment, or direct the . caller to a pharmacist or dentist. In some areas of the country the new service will be run by private . firms while in others it will be overseen by NHS ambulance service. As well as claims of potentially fatal conditions being missed, there . have already been reports of ambulances being sent to people with . hiccups. Some patients using limited 111pilot schemes are already waiting . several hours for urgent medical advice, while others have been told to . phone back the following day because there is no one available to talk . to them.","Geoffrey Peace rang the new phone service at 8am when wife Sheila fell ill .

Three women from the same family are to undergo drastic surgery after they were all diagnosed with a mutated gene that puts them at an exceptionally high risk of developing cancer. Cath Gilroy, her daughter Clare Shaw and her sister Elaine Price will all have their breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in a pre-emptive strike against the disease. Doctors discovered the faulty BRACA2 in Mrs Gilroy, 53, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, after she was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. Cath Gilroy, her daughter Clare Shaw and her sister Elaine Price (l-r) all have a mutated gene that puts them at an exceptionally high risk of developing cancer. But their relative Jo Johnson (far right), has tested negative . After she tested positive, Mrs Gilroy discovered there was a 50 per cent chance her daughter and sisters could also have the gene. Testing revealed that her daughter Clare, 36, and her sister Elaine, 44, and both possessed the mutation – giving them up to an 85 per cent chance of developing the disease. While having the gene tests, Ms Price was given the devastating news that she also had the early stages of cervical cancer. Thankfully, Mrs Gilroy's other sister, 49-year-old Joanne Johnson, tested negative. Studies have shown that undergoing a mastectomy can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by up to 90 per cent. Removing the ovaries reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 85 per cent. Ms Shaw has already had her ovaries . and tubes removed and said that despite the trauma of the operation - and . the fact it brought on the menopause - the decision had been a ‘no . brainer’. The . mother-of-one said: ‘It was a choice between an 85 per cent risk or the . surgery. 'It was something I decided I needed to do for myself and for my . son. Coincidence or genetic? Both Mrs Gilroy's grandmother (left) and mother (right) suffered with breast cancer . Functioning BRACA1 and BRACA2 genes are very important in preventing tumour growth. A faulty BRACA 2 gene is very rare, affecting less than one in 500 people. It puts women at a higher risk of developing breast, ovarian and fallopian cancer. Men with with a faulty BRACA2 gene are also at a higher risk of breast cancer. Most women's lifetime chance of developing breast cancer is 10 per cent, but this goes up to 85 per cent if you possess a mutated BRACA2 gene. Not all people who possess a faulty BRACA gene will go on to develop cancer. Surgery is not always necessary if a person tests positive. Surveillance and drugs taken as a preventative measure are options. ‘The test has . also identified my aunt's cervical cancer -  she wouldn't have known if she . hadn't been tested, so it has ultimately saved her life.’ Ms Price, who was diagnosed with cervical cancer three weeks ago, said she was ‘quite confident’ about her prognosis and that she had ‘no doubt’ that without the tests, the cancer would not have been discovered. The 44-year-old said testing positive for the gene had come as no surprise to her as there was ‘too much cancer in our family’. Mrs Gilroy asked to be genetically tested as both her mother and grandmother had suffered from breast cancer and her brother had died from stomach cancer aged 52. She said her grandmother, May Leach, had . a mastectomy and lived for 20 years after she was diagnosed with breast . cancer aged 70. Her mother, Clare Price, did not have a mastectomy, . and died in 1992 from breast cancer, aged 60. Despite this, she says she had to . demand the genetic test from doctors. She was  told she did not have enough . family history to be tested on the NHS and would have to pay £600. She said: ‘I dread to think what would have happened if I had walked away.’ She has since found out her 15-year-old grandson has a 50 per cent chance of having the gene and will be tested when he is 18. Former pop star Michelle Heaton had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with the faulty BRACA2 gene . Despite her risk of cancer, Mrs Gilroy has been waiting for 10 months to have the operation at Wythenshawe Hospital. She said she is not seen as priority because it is a 'preventative' operation. She now wants to make other people aware of . the gene and urge them to get tested as it could save their lives. She . does not believe there is enough information and support available. She added: ‘I would urge people that if they think there is a link, to get tested.' Former pop star Michelle Heaton had a double mastectomy last year, aged 33, after she discovered she carried the faulty BRCA2 gene. The Liberty X star has raised the profile of genetically-linked cancer and filmed a documentary about her story. Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Women with a strong family history of breast cancer can speak to their GP, who can refer them to a specialist breast clinic for a genetic test. ‘If you're worried about your risk or have any questions about cancer, you can call Cancer Research UK's nurses on freephone 0808 800 4040.’","Elaine Price, Clare Shaw and Cath Gilroy all have the faulty BRACA2 gene .

"PUBLISHED: . 08:20 EST, 10 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:35 EST, 11 April 2013 . A teenager died during a routine operation when a surgeon allegedly pierced a major vein after using the wrong instrument, an inquest heard. Ryan Senior, 16, suffered multiple organ failure during what was supposed to be a ‘low-risk’ 40-minute procedure at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. An inquest jury was told the Redditch teenager died after a surgeon allegedly used a sharp surgical instrument called a trochar instead of a blunt one, during minor keyhole surgery. Ryan Senior suffered multiple organ failure during what was supposed to be a 'low-risk' 40-minute procedure at Birmingham Children¿s Hospital . A trochar is a medical instrument with a sharply pointed end used to introduce devices such as drains and tubes inside the abdomen. The jury heard the details of the fateful day from a report read out by Birmingham and Solihull coroner Aidan Cotter. The report comprised minutes of a meeting between the hospital and Ryan's relatives, following an investigation by the hospital. The jury heard how the trochar pierced a major vein which led to a fatal gas embolism. This occurs when air bubbles block blood flow in a major artery, causing massive blood loss and cardiac arrest, the court heard. Ryan’s mother Sarah was given the devastating news her only son had died as she waited by his bedside. She was later sent home with his bagged-up clothes and bereavement leaflets. The teenager had hopes of becoming a mechanic before his death in February 2010 . The teenager, who dreamed of being a mechanic, had been suffering from an undisclosed minor health complaint and was otherwise healthy when he went into the hospital on February 16, 2010. He was due to undergo a laparoscopy, a low-risk procedure that allows a surgeon to access the . inside of the abdomen and pelvis with a tiny camera. Pictures are then flashed back to medics as carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the stomach to increase space. But a hospital report after Ryan’s death is said to have claimed the operation took a tragic twist when Dr Harish Chandran allegedly used a sharp trochar instead of a blunter implement. A tear was made in a major vein and gas escaped into the blood stream, resulting in an embolism which led to cardiac arrest and organ failure. The jury inquest, sitting at Sutton Coldfield Town Hall, was told medics battled for more than two hours to resuscitate Ryan, administering 31 pints of blood in a bid to stem the bleeding. The operation was led by Dr Chandran, the hospital’s clinical director for surgery, and assisted by Dr Harriet Corbett. Giving evidence today, Dr Chandran . claimed he performed the surgery with a piece of equipment he was not . comfortable with due to 'great pressure' put on him to to reduce delays . at the hospital. He also admitted to the hearing that he made the fatal incision, which killed Ryan. Dr Chandran told the jury: 'Before . the surgery I was informed that the reusable blunt trocar I had . requested was not available but that a disposable plastic blunt trocar . was. 'There is great pressure to reduce . delays at Birmingham Children's Hospital and I felt under pressure not . to delay the operation so said I would go ahead as long as they made . sure it was a blunt trocar rather than a sharp one.' Choking back tears, Dr Chandran went on to describe the moment Ryan died on the operating table. He added: 'I noticed after I had . inserted the trocar that it was not blunt so I removed it and continued . with surgery. On inspection there was no sign of blood so we continued. 'But on inserting the camera I realised not enough CO2 had gone in - so the pressure was increased. 'Almost immediately the patient went into cardiac arrest. 'External cardiac massage was begun and it was suggested a gas embolism may have formed to stop the heart beating. 'On extracting the equipment blood . came out. I packed the area with gauze to stop the bleeding and Dr Tim . Jones, a cardiac specialist was called.' Dr Chandran told the inquest that Dr . Jones had succeeded in stopping the bleeding using a special treatment . that involved cooling the body to 35 degrees. But after two hours and 20 minutes of trying to save Ryan he was pronounced dead. Ryan’s aunt Tracy Hunt had driven him and his mother Sarah to the hospital. They sensed something was wrong when they were still waiting beside his bed after an hour and 20 minutes. The tragic death of 16-year old Ryan occurred at Birmingham Children's Hospital . 'A man in a suit and a nurse came out . and closed the curtains around the cubicle and told us they had been . fighting to save his life for the last hour,' Mrs Hunt said in a . statement. The sisters were later taken into a . room and given the heartbreaking news that Ryan had died. Tracy said her . devastated sister was handed some leaflets on bereavement along with a . carrier bag with her son’s clothes inside. She added: 'We loved Ryan dearly and cannot express the pain we have suffered since his death. 'Sarah’s world was turned upside down when he died. He was her only son and her best friend. 'She has left his room untouched since he died and goes in twice a day to say good morning and good night.' The jury was told a post-mortem examination conducted by Dr Adrian Warfield also revealed an unexplained second small wound, near Ryan’s belly button and where the first incision had been made. The inquest also heard yesterday from several nurses, including Anna Fitzgerald, who phoned Dr Chandran before the operation to say there was a problem with the equipment. The camera that he preferred to use was not available, she said. The doctor was later shown three separate boxes of equipment and she said he said he did not mind which one he used. The one selected for use contained the sharp trochar. When it was pulled from his body, he started bleeding, which was not expected. The inquest continues.","Ryan Senior died of multiple organ failure during routine abdominal surgery .

Kobe Bryant's 17th NBA season likely ended on an innocent move past a defender toward the hoop. He felt a pop as he pushed off his left foot. The pain made him think somebody kicked him, causing him to tumble to the floor. The Los Angeles Lakers are all but certain Bryant tore his Achilles tendon Friday night, likely taking him out for the rest of the season and facing the five-time NBA champion with months of rehab. Some even wonder whether this was the injury that could be the end to his extraordinary career. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Game time: Bryant, a five-time NBA champion seen center before his injury on Friday, has played more than 38 minutes per game, more than any teammate and more than any player in the league over 30 . VIDEO: WATCH KOBE BRYANT'S TUMBLE HERE . 'I made a move that I've made a million times, and it just popped,' he said while appearing to bite back tears as he leaned on crutches in the Lakers' locker room after a 118-116 win over Golden State. The fourth-leading scorer in NBA history probably will miss the postseason for just the second time, even if Los Angeles hangs on to the eighth spot in the Western Conference playoff race without him. The 34-year-old who has spent half his life in a Lakers uniform realizes everybody will wonder if his career will ever be the same. Bryant called it the most disappointing injury of his career 'by far.' Moments after he went down, Bryant vowed to get back up. 'I know I can do this,' said Bryant, who's averaging 27.3 points, 5.6 rebounds and 6.0 assists. 'It's fueling me. It's fueling me. I can feel it already.' Still wearing his gold game uniform, Bryant solemnly took questions while thinking about the upcoming final days of the Lakers' tumultuous season.

Support: Teammates Pau Gasol (second left), Jodie Meeks (left), and Steve Blake (right) stand around Bryant before helping him walk off the court . Comforted: Teammate Pau Gasol comforts Bryant as they head court side together after his traumatic injury . After a terrible start and numerous missteps along the way, Los Angeles (42-37) is one game ahead of the Utah Jazz, who hold the tiebreaker, for the final playoff spot in the West with two games to play. Asked how he was immediately feeling, he said both angry and sad. 'We worked so hard to put ourselves in position and control our fate,' he said. 'I certainly have done a lot of work to prepare myself. It's just bad luck.' Bryant, who scored 34 points despite hyperextending his left knee early in the second half, hit two free throws after apparently tearing his tendon with 3:08 to play, tying the game before hobbling to the locker room. His teammates then rallied past the wilting Warriors, with Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard getting big baskets down the stretch before Steve Blake's go-ahead free throws in the final minutes. Hopeful: Lakers forward Metta World Peace, right rubs Kobe's shoulders as head coach Mike D'Antoni looks on . Benched: Bryant puts his head in his hands as head coach Mike D'Antoni leans over him . The win kept the Lakers in control of their playoff destiny, still in the running for the franchise's 16th postseason trip during Bryant's career, they'll probably have to do it without the five-time NBA champion in uniform, assuming an MRI on Saturday confirms the Lakers' diagnosis of a torn tendon. 'I'm going to be there still,' Bryant said. 'I can't be with them out there on the floor, but I can use my intellect to try to break down film and help them see things they might not see.' But after playing heavy minutes all season while fighting several minor injuries, one of the most durable stars in NBA history finally incurred an injury even he couldn't play through. 'I can't walk,' he said, with only a trace of a smirk. 'I tried to maybe just put pressure on my heel, see if I could do it that way, but there was just nothing there.' Achilles' tendon injuries can require many months of rehabilitation and recovery, depending on their severity, and the 34-year-old Bryant has enormous mileage on his legs. The NBA's No. 3 scorer this season has played more than 38 minutes per game, more than any teammate and more than any player in the league over 30. Emotional: Kobe appeared quite emotional while describing himself in a press conference after as both angry and sad . Determined: Bryant tweeted this message early Saturday morning expressing his determination to recover, while jokingly noting his alleged use of the painkiller, Vicodin . While others' thoughts immediately went past the Lakers' immediate future to Bryant's career, he swiftly shot down any notion he might be finished. Bryant was already thinking about rehabilitation from an injury that typically requires several months of recovery. 'I've never had to deal with something like this,' he said. 'It is a new experience for me. Obviously, there have been a bunch of players that have had the same injury. All I can do is look at them, see what they've done, and see who had more success coming back quicker and healthier. See what they did, and try to improve on that.' Bryant said his teammates must 'just continue to play. We've been dealing with injuries all year. I'll do what I can, watching film and communicating to the guys the best form of attacking certain teams, and go from there.' The Lakers' future is tied up in Bryant's health even beyond his vaunted scoring and leadership: He will make nearly $30.5 million next season in the final year of his deal. Los Angeles' uncertain offseason just got even weirder, with Howard's impending unrestricted free agency still looming largest in the mix. Painful reality: Bryant, seen shooting a free throw during the first half of the game, later said he knew something was terribly wrong being unable to walk without crutches . Million dollar contract: Kobe is to make nearly $30.5 million next season in the final year of his deal with the Lakers . Bryant has been ferociously competitive while trying to keep the Lakers' playoff hopes afloat. While Gasol and Steve Nash have missed long stretches of play with injuries, and while Howard struggled to get to full strength after last year's back surgery, Bryant played through a sprained ankle and countless minor woes, missing only two games with injuries that could sideline other players for weeks. After playing all 48 minutes while scoring 47 points in Portland on Wednesday, Bryant pushed the Lakers relentlessly forward on one good leg against the playoff-bound Warriors. Golden State got 47 points from Stephen Curry in a dynamic performance, but Bryant led a 9-0 run by hitting consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 107 with 3:47 left. 'I hate it for Kobe,' said first-year Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni, who has marveled at Bryant's toughness while discounting suggestions Bryant was playing too much. 'I hate it for us. I hate it for L.A., but you have to close ranks. There's no going back now. ... He's just an unbelievable player with a heart, and it is unbelievable.' Bryant didn't know whether his heavy workload contributed to the injury. 'Who knows? It was all necessary,' he said. 'It's just a freak situation, I guess.' Bryant's teammates had little to say to him in the locker room, many still in disbelief over the latest injury woe to befall this high-priced roster. 'He's the greatest competitor, and he's been that all season long, all through his career,' said Gasol, who had 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in his sixth career triple-double. 'He's been an example for us throughout all this. He showed character. He showed heart, and that's what we're going to need from now on.'","Bryant, 34, emotionally called Friday night's injury his most disappointing 'by far'

The iconic Louvre in Paris was forced to close its doors to the public today after staff staged a walk out in protest at the increasing number of pickpocket thefts by Romanian immigrant children at the museum. Hundreds of staff refused to work because of the increasing number of thieves targeting tourists at the city's famous landmark, which normally attracts up to 30,000 visitors a day. Many of the thieves are said to be the children of Romanian immigrants who get into the museum for free and then start asking tourists for money. Walkout: Staff at the iconic Louvre museum in Paris have staged a walk out in protest at the number of pickpocket thefts taking place . They usually ask their victims whether they speak English before surrounding them and taking money and other possessions. Although the problem of pickpocketing is said to be a widespread problem throughout the city, the Louvre seems to have become a particularly popular target for thieves. The museum had asked for extra help from the police at the end of last year, but the problem has persisted. One member of staff, who did not wish to be named, said: 'The children are tough and very well organised. Treasures: The Mona Lisa is one of the most famous works of art on display at the Louvre . 'They stop at nothing to get what they want, and work in gangs. 'We can only do so much, but arrests are usually impossible because of their young age. 'If they are kicked out, they return the next day. They are very aggressive towards staff, putting people in danger of attack.' Members of museum staff trade unions visited the Ministry of Culture following today's walk-out to demand action. Two years ago, France's then Interior Minister said that the vast majority of street robberies in Paris were being carried out by the children of Romanian immigrants. Claude Gueant said the notoriously poor and corrupt eastern European state was responsible for exporting some of the most notorious sneak thieves in the world. Many operated in gangs around the Gare du Nord Eurostar station, preying on British travellers as they arrived by high-speed train from London. France has shut down illegal Roma camps full of Romanian immigrants which have sprung up around the French capital, but Romanian crime remains a huge problem. Romania joined the EU in 2007 but faced restrictions on immigration which are set to be lifted next year, leading to an expected influx into countries like Britain. Around eight million people a year visit the Louvre, which is full of artistic treasures including the Mona Lisa.

North Korea has a nuclear warhead that it could mount on a missile, US intelligence officials revealed yesterday. The warning came as preparations continued in the reclusive Communist country for the possible test launch this weekend of two missiles which it has moved closer to its border with South Korea. However, the weapons would have a ‘low reliability’, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) said. Kim's children: The youth movement ceremony yesterday . It is the first time Washington has admitted that Kim Jong-un’s fanatical regime has a probable nuclear capability. The warning further increased tensions in the region ahead of celebrations in North Korea this weekend to mark the birthday of founding father Kim Il-sung. US Secretary of State John Kerry told Kim Jong-un he would be making a ‘huge mistake’ if he went ahead with a test launch. South Korea says Pyongyang repeatedly moved two ballistic missiles – believed to have a range of 2,100 miles and capable of reaching the US territory of Guam as well as Japan – on a mobile launcher along its east coast. North Korea often uses military shows of strength to mark important anniversaries and the fear is that at least one missile will be fired in the lead-up to Monday’s 101st anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-un’s grandfather. Ahead of those celebrations, thousands of schoolchildren were inducted yesterday into the Korean Children’s Union, a political organisation compared to the Hitler Youth. The warning from the DIA – the spy arm of the Pentagon – was contained in an apparently classified document handed to US politicians and revealed at a public hearing by Republican Congressman Doug Lamborn. Speaking in the South Korean capital Seoul yesterday, Mr Kerry dismissed as ‘unacceptable by any standard’ weeks of bellicose warnings of impending nuclear war by North Korea and said Washington would never accept the rogue state becoming a nuclear power. Dolly steps into dictatorship: A ceremony to induct North Korean children into the Korean Children's Union . ‘If Kim Jong-un decides to launch a missile, whether it’s across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing wilfully to ignore the entire international community,’ Mr Kerry said. ‘And it will be a provocation and unwanted act that will raise people’s temperatures. It will further isolate his country and further isolate his people who are desperate for food and not missile launches.’ In Pyongyang, the ruling Workers’ Party vowed North Korea would not abandon its nuclear weapons, made necessary by the ‘invariable ambition of the US to militarily invade’. While the US, Japan and South Korea have all moved anti-missile systems to protect key areas, China – Pyongyang’s closest ally – has carried out emergency civilian evacuation drills near its border. Tears of tyranny: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un surrounded by weeping and adoring KCU children on a visit he made to them last year . Mr Kerry will travel to China today and said he would ask Beijing to use its influence. US and South Korean officials played down the DIA assessment and, asked if war was imminent, one US specialist said: ‘Not at all.’ Washington’s greatest concern, the official said, was the possibility of unexpected developments linked to the inexperience of the 30-year-old leader. ‘Our greatest concern is a miscalculation and where that may lead,’ said the official. North Korean officials have not announced plans to launch a missile, but have warned that a nuclear war is imminent. The threat is largely seen as rhetoric and an attempt to boost Kim’s military credentials.","The warning is the first from Washington that Kim Jong-Un may have nuclear capabilities .

She is remembered as a profligate shrew who drove her husband to drink before going insane, but according to a new book, that is not an accurate portrait of Zelda Fitzgerald. In fact, it's a 'persistent, damning mischaracterisation that needs undoing' says author, Therese Anne Fowler, who argues that not only was the spoiled wife of Great Gatsby author, F. Scott Fitzgerald sane, she was also devoted to her husband. Fowler, who began Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald wondering whether she really wanted to spend a year in the company of a 'hyperactive madwoman', says she soon discovered that almost everything she'd ever heard about the socialite was wrong. Outrageous: Both Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald achieved fame and fortune young but burned out quickly . Diagnosed with schizophrenia in her 30s, . Zelda spent her twilight years in a number of mental institutions, . eventually dying in a North Carolina asylum aged just 48. But was she really insane? Not so, . says Fowler, who argues that in the 1930s, 'schizophrenia' was a . catch-all term applied to a range of emotional difficulties. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, she adds: 'It was often applied to women who suffered from depression or exhaustion brought on by impossible circumstances. 'Zelda did suffer from some mental health crises - depression, primarily - and was an uninhibited, uncensored woman who didn't always think before she acted but she wasn't crazy. 'Unwise? Sometimes. Insane? No.' Fowler also goes on to rubbish the myth that The Great Gatsby's Daisy Buchanan is synonymous with Zelda, instead arguing that although there are some commonalities and F. Scott borrowed heavily from Zelda's diaries, the two were not the same. Tragic: Both Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald died young, although their daughter had a long, happy life . Fame: The Great Gatsby painted a decadent picture of 1920s New York and made F. Scott Fitzgerald's name . Born in 1900, Zelda was the youngest daughter of Alabama Supreme Court Justice, Anthony Sayre and his wife, Minnie Machen Sayre. She met her future husband at a dance in 1918 but was told not to get involved with him by her parents who thought the young F. Scott Fitzgerald entirely unsuitable. Defying her parents, Zelda continued to see F. Scott and the couple married just before her 20th birthday. The pair left to live in New York, the setting for many of Fitzgerald's most famous novels, and at the beginning of the Roaring Twenties, a glitteringly decadent place to be. The 1920s was the beginning of a social revolution, which saw women emerge from the home and join men in bars and nightclubs unchaperoned and unfettered by the mores of the Victorian era. Women smoking and drinking became a common sight, as did seeing them dance with abandon and engaging in casual relationships. Even skirts got shorter, with the austere full length skirts and high necked blouses of wartime giving way to sparkling, beaded flapper dresses. The older generation were scandalised but for Zelda and her new husband, it was just what the doctor ordered. Decadent: The glittering world of The Great Gatsby will be brought back to life in Baz Lurhman's 2013 film . Scandalous: The behaviour of young flappers such as these was viewed with horror by the older generation . They quickly became doyennes of the New York social scene but it wasn't enough for Fitzgerald, who didn't just want to be famous, but rich and brilliant as well. For her part, says Fowler, Zelda was desperate for him to succeed in every way. After their daughter, Scottie, was born in 1921, the pair moved to France, so Fitzgerald could concentrate on his writing. But although the pair enjoyed some success during this period, the Fitzgeralds' peripatetic lifestyle and passionate marriage began to take its toll. By this point, Zelda had begun her own literary career, penning a semi-autobiographical novel called Save Me the Waltz, which lifted the lid on her rocky marriage. F. Scott was furious, saying their life together was 'his material'. He was also drinking heavily, which led to increasingly violent rows. It was now, says Therese, that both their lives began to spiral inexorably out of control. Estranged through the later years of their marriage, F. Scott spent his twilight years in Hollywood attempting to forge a career in screen writing and pursuing an affair with movie columnist, Sheilah Graham. He died, aged 44, of a heart attack in 1940. He hadn't seen his wife, who outlived him by eight years, for more than 18 months. Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler is published on the 11th April by Hodder & Stoughton.","Zelda is the victim of a 'persistent, damning mischaracterisation'

A lesbian businesswoman is helping homosexual learner drivers dodge old-school driving instructors by opening Britain's first ‘gay driving school.’ Karis Smith, 27, started Gay Driving School Manchester after friends complained about jokes being made by instructors about their sexuality when having lessons. She said stories of instructors referring to pupils as ‘faggots’ or grilling transgender youngsters on whether they are a boy or a girl had left her horrified. Karis Smith, who works as a driving instructor for the AA, runs 'The Gay Driving School', aimed at making the experience of learning to drive easier for the LGBT community . And she said some gay leaner drivers pretended to be heterosexual because they felt uncomfortable revealing their homosexuality to a stranger. Now Miss Smith's solo business is creating a stir amongst Manchester's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community with her promise to make pupils feel ‘comfortable’ over their sexuality when behind the wheel of her Ford Focus. On her website Miss Smith says: ‘Gay? Lesbian? Bisexual? TG/TS/TV? Looking for driving lessons with a friendly driving instructor in a comfortable learning environment? Then look no further! I am a young, female, gay driving instructor. ‘Learning to drive can be a daunting experience enough, without worrying about getting on with your instructor. ‘You will learn much better if you are relaxed, comfortable and most importantly yourself! I am fully committed to teaching you to be a safe, conscientious driver whilst achieving that all important pink driving license!’ Today Miss Smith, from Fallowfield, Manchester said: ‘The response I've had so far has been very positive. The gay friendly service was launched in response to complaints to members of the LGBT community that other instructors had made them feel uncomfortable . ‘I have heard a lot of horror stories about people's experiences with driving instructors, where they have had to explain their sexuality. ‘There have even been stories about transgender learners who have had to put up with jokes about their gender or questions about their looks. ‘As a pupil you'll spend 40 to 50 hours learning to drive in very close proximity to a total stranger. ‘Part of feeling at ease during your lessons is building a good rapport with your instructor - this is much easier when you can just be yourself. ‘A lot of gay people told me that they had strange experiences and it quickly became apparent that many of them said they'd never felt that comfortable with their instructors. ‘I've had a pupil come to me halfway through her training as her previous instructor shared many of his far-right political beliefs and extreme views on race, immigration and sexuality during conversations in the lessons that made her very uncomfortable. ‘I don't think we should live in a world where all LGBT people should only use services from other LGBT providers - but I do think it's important for people to have that option should they wish. ‘With this venture there is no need to explain yourself and its a lot more relaxed. You won't be met with a barrage of questions about your personal life. Karis Smith's website offers a 'comfortable learning environment' for people who are gay, bisexual, transgender, transexual or transvestite . ‘I think the people who have appreciated it the most are those who are transgender. Getting behind the wheel for the first time is daunting enough without having to worry about how a driving instructor will treat you.’ The driving school, which is gay friendly and not gay only, is set up as an AA franchise and Karis said the fact that the Ford Focus car she uses looks discreet is a positive factor for pupils. The former Manchester University student said all of her pupils, more than 50 so far, have passed their driving tests in three attempts or less. Some of the complaints made to Karis were issues such as constantly having to use ‘non-gender’ pronouns when chatting with their instructor, mentioning their 'partner' rather than girlfriend or boyfriend. Another complaint was having to lie about what they did for a living rather than admitting they worked in a bar in Manchester's Canal Street gay district. Sarah McNally, from the Lesbian and Gay Foundation Manchester, said: ‘Unfortunately some people still face discrimination and homophobia in society today, so you should be able to feel more comfortable accessing LGBT specific spaces or services.’","Learners complained about having to lie to previous instructors .

It was also claimed that at least one high-profile player linked to now-closed Biogenesis of America in Florida bought documents from a former employee in order to destroy them. Two unidentified people briefed on the matter also told The New York Times that other baseball stars made efforts to buy potentially incriminating documents to keep them out of the hands of the sport's governing body. Denials: New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, pictured in October 2012, has denied all claims that he received injections of PEDs from Miami anti-ageing clinic Biogenesis of America . The Miami New Times, an alternative weekly newspaper, in January reported that New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez was among the big leaguers listed in Biogenesis of America's records. The New Times said it obtained records detailing purchases by Rodriguez, 2012 All-Star game MVP Melky Cabrera, 2005 AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colon and 2011 AL championship series MVP Nelson Cruz. Its exposé claimed the baseball star received cocktails including Human Growth Hormones (HGH) and testosterone creams on a fairly regular basis, according to handwritten notes viewed by someone familiar with the clinic. Rodriguez's name appears in handwritten notes, reportedly kept by Bosch's clinic, that indicate he received various substances from 2009 up until 2012. 'There was his name, over and over again, logged as either 'Alex Rodriguez', 'Alex Rod', or his nickname at the clinic, 'Cacique,' a pre-Columbian Caribbean chief. Rodriguez’s name appears 16 times throughout,' according to the article. Rodriguez has denied the claims. 'I have nothing to hide': Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers is also being investigated for his links to the Florida clinic which is now closed. He has said his name appears in records because of a payment dispute . Other baseball players the newspaper said appeared in the records include Gio Gonzalez and Yasmani Grandal. Later, Yahoo Sports reported that 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun's name also appeared in the records. Braun subsequently issued a statement . saying: 'I have nothing to hide.'

Lawsuit: Anthony Bosch faces a claim for unspecified damages after he was accused of doling out banned substances at his Miami clinic . The Times said the payments by the commissioner's office did not exceed more than 'several thousand dollars.' MLB officials decided to take the unusual step of paying for the documents because, with no subpoena power, its investigators would likely have no access to the material if it wound up in the players' hands, the paper reported. Last month, Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis, and its operators, accusing them of scheming to provide banned performance-enhancing drugs to players in violation of their contracts. The lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks unspecified damages from Biogenesis and its operator, Anthony Bosch. Several other Bosch associates are named in the lawsuit. Among the banned drugs supplied, the lawsuit said, are testosterone, human growth hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin. Baseball officials also unsuccessfully lobbied New Times editors to share the documents that formed the basis of their story.","New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez among those claimed to be involved with the now-defunct Biogenesis clinic in Miami .

It is certainly the most powerful ever produced by Bentley. And, for those who can afford the £140,900 price tag, their children can surf the internet in the back thanks to its built-in wi-fi. Four-wheel drive: The Flying Spur has a six-litre twin turbo W12 engine which develops 616 brake horse power . The car is due to make its world debut at the Geneva Motor Show on March 5 before going on sale here in early summer. It is powered by a six-litre twin-turbo W12 engine which develops 616 brake horse-power – the equivalent of six Ford Fiestas. This is coupled to an eight-speed automatic gearbox, enabling the Flying Spur to accelerate from rest to 60mph in only 4.3 seconds. Length: 17ft/4.5inches . Weight: 3 tons . Seats: 4 or 5 (depending on configuration) Engine: 6-litre twin turbo-charged W12 (equivalent to six Ford Fiestas) Gears: 8-speed automatic with F1-stylw manual paddle-shifts . Top speed: 200mph . 0-60mph: 4.3sec . Fuel consumption: Averages 19.2mpg . Price: £140,900 . It will hit 100mph in  9.5 seconds – a time that would not disgrace many mainstream cars accelerating to 60mph. The Crewe-built super-cruiser features four-wheel drive for extra grip and stability and, as it reaches its top speed, the ride height is automatically lowered by its air suspension to make it more aerodynamic and rooted to the road. But deep pockets will be needed for the fuel bills. The new Bentley averages just 19.2mpg, dropping to just 12.6mpg around town but rising to 27.8mpg when cruising.

Elly, 24, lost control of the vehicle as he sped down Compstall Road, Romiley, Minshull Street Crown Court heard. Nobody was injured in the smash. Former Stockport Grammar School pupil Elly has been spared jail but banned from the road in a court case which heard he could 'spend the rest of his life' trying to pay for the damage he caused. He admitted charges of aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving and driving without insurance at an earlier hearing. The court heard that Elly, a British Gas complaints advisor, had been left the keys to his mother's Audi TT when she went away to London. The vehicle was left in the car park of the Forrester's Arms in Romiley, but Elly decided to move it when he learned the pub was to host a function. But, by the time he got behind the wheel on the evening of August 5 last year, the court heard, he had been drinking and rowing with his girlfriend. Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: 'The man working behind the counter heard the car speeding towards the petrol station and then a loud crash - the car left the floor and embedded itself into the side of the petrol station shop.' Elly suffered minor injuries and was found to be below the drink-drive limit at the time of the crash. Gwyn Lewis, defending, said Elly had 'good intentions' when he got behind the wheel. 'He decided to move the car to a suitable place. It was a pleasant afternoon and I suspect in addition the opportunity to drive an Audi TT was something he was tempted by. Elly walked away uninjured from the crash which caused £190,000 of damage . The Audi TT came to a halt in front of a shocked cashier . The damage to the petrol station after the crash in August last year . 'Clearly he did not think clearly enough at the time about what he was doing - he says he wants to make a genuine attempt to pay for the damage.' Sentencing Elly, who has no previous convictions, to a 10-month jail sentence suspended for two years, Judge Maurice Greene said he accepted that the incident was 'completely out of character', and that he did not believe he would come back before the court. 'I have come to the conclusion, with much hesitation, that I do not need to send you immediately to prison - even though there was a considerable amount of damage and people's lives were put in danger,' the judge added. Ellis is banned from driving for 12 months, must pay £25 costs, do 250 hours of unpaid work, and attend a Probation Service 'New Direction Activity Requirement'.","David Elly, 24, narrowly missed another motorist and the shop cashier .

A passenger who was still inside the Focus was treated at the scene for minor injuries. A spokesman Surrey Police, which is appealing for witnesses, said no one had been arrested in connection with the crash. He added: 'The collision occurred in a section of the motorway where there are currently road works in place. 'Initial reports suggest that a blue Ford Focus had stopped in one of the . live lanes with the lights off and that one of the occupants had left . the vehicle and was walking along the hard shoulder. 'The collision has . then occurred with a white Renault lorry colliding with the stationary . Ford Focus and further colliding with the pedestrian.' The motorway was closed for hours at junction 6, causing huge rush hour tailback as motorists were diverted off the motorway. Police said the man had broken down in the roadworks of the M25 at Godstone, Surrey . The fatal crash caused eight mile long tailbacks today . The Highways Agency said traffic was backed up for eight miles and reached Junction 4. In Burnley, the teenage woman was walking along the eastbound carriageway of the M65 at about 4am when she was hit by a white sprinter van. The 48-year-old local driver of the van was treated at the scene for shock. The carriageway was closed for three hours for accident investigation work.

Graham Hughes, director of strategy and development at the council, said: 'There are clear and prominent signs on all the entry points.' 'To be honest, we do struggle to understand how this driver, in broad daylight, managed to get on to the busway.'

Kayla Wolfe just never imagined what it would take to pick one. First, there was what felt like a million questions. 'What kind of dress was I looking for? What size am I? What kind of color? Long or short?' said the 15-year-old freshman at Mount Edgecumbe High School, a state-run boarding school in Sitka, Alaska. Her answers gave her passage into a room stocked full of dresses – a bounty that Kayla, or most students, in rural Alaska have never seen. Scroll down for video . Fairy godmother: A stylist fixes the hair of Mount Edgecumbe High School student Kaitlyn Love, as part of the Prom Princess program supporting teens who go through the rite of passage without family support . The dresses were brought to the school by the Seattle-based Prom Princess program, which brings the prom experience to Mount Edgecumbe, where many students don't have the resources or the help from their far-off families to get party dresses, tuxedos and makeup for their big night. 'All of these people are here helping them (the students) out and doing all this stuff, and suddenly they realize they're a lot more important than they ever thought they were,' said Ivy Lanthier, project director for the school's dorms. 'That's the big thing.' In its fifth year of helping students at the school, the program arranges for donations of the dresses, discounted tuxes, and hair and makeup artists. Mount Edgecumbe, which sits in the shadow of a dormant volcano, is the only state-run boarding school in Alaska. It has nearly 400 students, and about 80 percent this year are Alaska Native. Many, like Kayla, hail from small . communities well off the state's limited road system. Many schools in . these rural villages don't have proms, and ones that do aren't at Mount . Edgecumbe's level. Ready to party: Students from Mount Edgecumbe High School dance in their new formal dresses at prom . Program founder Terri Bogren said she and other volunteers, mainly her co-workers at the Seattle-based Alaska Airlines, are proud of the teenagers for leaving their families and villages to get a better education, and this is a way to show their admiration. 'They don't have the family support to . help them do this. So we're kind of like fairy godmothers here to help . them make sure they can look as good as they want to go to their prom,' she said. 'I know lots of people buy expensive . dresses and only wear them once. So I figured this would be a . good opportunity to ask for donations' Bogren got the idea for the program when she lived in Sitka and helped a niece, who was attending the school, get ready for the prom. That's when she realized other girls weren't going to the dance because they didn't have a dress. Bogren moved to Seattle after she got a job as an account specialist with the airline, which had just celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2007. She decided to see if anyone would be willing to donate her party dress from the anniversary ball for the girls at Mount Edgecumbe. 'I know lots of people buy expensive . dresses and only wear them once,' she said. 'So I figured this would be a . good opportunity to ask for donations.' Finishing touches: One student gets some elaborate nail art to complete her prom night look . The perfect fit: Volunteers Janet Warner (left) and Mandy Odenheimer do last minute alterations hours before the prom, so each girl's dress looks like it was made for her . That first year, 30 dresses were donated. That number has increased to about 130 this year, and the girls get to keep the frocks they pick. The main booster for the program, Bogren solicits donations while talking to people on airplanes, in airports, at work. The program has a signature identifier: During the prom, all the volunteers wear tiaras, but Bogren sports one throughout the year to attract attention to her program. Inspired idea: Terri Bogren, seen having her make-up applied, is the brains behind the Prom Princess program . The number of volunteers also has grown, from Bogren and five others the first year to about 40 this year. The volunteers are Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air employees, and their family and friends from across the Pacific Northwest. The volunteers include professional hairdressers, nail artists, even a master tailor. Last Saturday, they gave the girls up-dos, fancy nails, took prom photos and made flower decorations. Like many students, sophomore Jessica Mute was appreciative for the help. She spent the day primping for the all-school prom, but also found time to make her boyfriend a boutonniere. Mute said it was especially nice since the boarding students 'have no parents or moms' there to help them. For many, Saturday's prom was the first time they have dressed formally for a dance, had clothes altered, had their nails and hair done, got tanning, even wore jewelry. 'It's something that many of them have seen on TV,' Lanthier said. 'They know other people do it, and now they're doing it.' Kellie Oester, a Portland, Ore.-based flight attendant who was in Sitka for the second year, said the freshman girls 'touched my heart.' 'I have a daughter that is 17. I think, ""Oh, it would be hard for her to be away from home."" So I think they kind of get the nurturing from us,' said Oester, who described her duty as 'glam fairy,' spraying girls with glitter. And for the record, Kayla picked a dress that was black on the top with white frilly ruffles on the bottom. She planned to wear it when she and friends went to a pizzeria before the dance. 'I'm just going to be extra careful' not to drop any food on it, she laughed.","Girls at Mount Edgecumbe High School, a state-run boarding school in Sitka, Alaska, don't have family support to help them buy an outfit and get ready.

Autonomous cars can make roads safer, free commuters from the drudgery of driving, reduce congestion and provide transport to people who can't drive themselves, such as the blind, disabled, elderly and intoxicated, he claimed. 'I expect that self-driving cars will be far safer than human-driven cars,' he added. But Mr Brin's confidence had not infected Mrs Wojcicki by the time this video was shot. She is just one of three passengers aboard for the unsettling ride, which saw the modified Toyota Prius reach 40mph. Cue much nervous laughter and obscene language as the vehicle hurtled around the sets of bollards set up to mark out the sun-soaked course - with its 'driver's' hands nowhere near the steering wheel.

They are collaborating with Toyota, but their competitors include Audi, BMW, Ford and Volvo . Don't worry, your mother is safe: Sergey Brin with his wife Anne . But, after gathering themselves, the three passengers experiencing what many believe is the future of road transport are eventually ready for more. 'Can we take another spin?' one asks. Another feebly reassures the rest: 'I've seen a video of other people doing it. We're going to be just fine.' The nervous laughter reaches fever pitch this time as the car - with no outside interference - takes hairpin turns at speeds a real driver would be nervous to attempt. Narrowly missing bollards and planters holding palm trees, it steers around the course to a chorus of expletives. And when it finally finishes, the passengers respond with sighs of relief and an exclamation of the highest praise that can be awarded by California's geek set: 'That rocks.'","Esther Wojcicki gets fright of her life in her first ride in one of the cars .

A motorist who knocked down and killed a schoolboy has been jailed for five and a half years.

Harsh was on a crossing at the time of the collision but the lights were not working and he was thrown 10ft into the air as a result of the impact. Asghar had previously crashed his car just yards from where he hit Harsh and also had convictions for using a bus lane and speeding. Before hitting Harsh, Asghar was seen weaving in and out of traffic while prosecutor Alan Blake said he was driving in the high 40s in a 30mph zone. Today Asghar was also banned from driving for five years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving on February 21 last year. Mr Blake said: ‘The decision to drive in the bus lane . and to drive in the high 40s, as opposed to the speed limit of 30mph, . must have been a deliberate decision to ignore the rules of the road,’ said Alan Blake, prosecuting. Oscar . del Fabro, mitigating, told the court that young father Asghar was . ‘responsible’, and that the impact that the death of Harsh had on him . was ‘enormous.’ ‘He has displayed genuine remorse regarding the circumstances of his actions,’ he said.

Bearded Asghar, who wore a blue suit, held his head in his hands as Judge John told him that he would be going to prison. ‘By the jury's verdict there was one cause and one alone which accounted for this accident,’ said Judge John. ‘It was the heedless way in which you drove. ‘Going into the bus lane was not, as you claimed, so as to avoid inconveniencing other drivers: it was simply selfish.

For example, while Slumdog Millionaire star Freida Pinto was crowned 'Hottest Indian Chick', there is no mention of Beyonce's African-American heritage, Mila Kunis' Ukranian roots of Kim Kardashian's Armenian ancestry.

'But by calling out certain women's ethnicity and not others, what they're implying is that these women are not beautiful simply because they're beautiful; they're only attractive within the context of their own ethnicity.

With her bold wardrobe choices, singer Rihanna is almost as famous for what she wears as for her music so nobody was surprised when she announced a collaboration with River Island back in July. But now the singer has gone one better and has revealed that not only did she design the 50 piece collection herself, she also intends to present it to the world on the London Fashion Week catwalk. The invitation-only show will take place on the 16th February and will be styled by the pop princess in person and followed by a huge after show party in the capital. Behind the scenes: Rihanna has dropped a few hints about the contents of the collection via Instagram . 'Launching at London Fashion Week is a dream come true for me,' the Barbadian singer revealed. 'I have wanted to design my own collection for a long time and to present my collection for River Island alongside all of the other great design talent at LFW is a real privilege. 'I can't wait to see the reaction from my fans and the fashion press!' Rihanna's foray into the fashion world, if she pulls it off as planned, won't be the first time a singer has successfully made the leap from music to fashion design. Former Spice Girl, Victoria Beckham, has proved to be an enormously talented designer and has produced a string of critically acclaimed collections. Justin Timberlake's William Rast line has also confounded expectations and has achieved mainstream success, particularly in the US. Fashion challenge: Rihanna's collection will make its debut in front of the cream of the style world, including US Vogue editor, Anna Wintour . Avant-garde: Rihanna is famed for her fierce sense of style and her own collection is expected to follow suit. Her self-designed River Island jumpsuit (right) certainly fits the bill . But not all have done so well. Beyonce's House of Dereon was panned for being poorly designed and looking cheap, although husband, Jay-Z's Rocawear line is believed to sell well. One collection unlikely to appeal to most Rihanna fans is the 'Black Pyramid' clothing line, which was launched by the singer's violent on/off boyfriend, Chris Brown, last November. According to Brown, who designed the 'artwork' splashed across the front of the t-shirts in the range, the line reflect an 'unknown' part of him. 'We really haven’t mastered the art of making a pyramid ourselves, like the ancient ones,' he waffled. 'The black pyramid label is basically an unknown art. So I think my painting, my designs, whatever I do fashion wise is unknown to a lot of people.' Although Rihanna's collection is . likely to be considerably more stylish - and certainly less bizarrely . described -  fashion fans will have to wait until March to get their . hands on the pieces. What form they will take is still . shrouded in mystery although Rihanna has let slip the odd hint via . Twitter, and was pictured wearing a blue boilersuit from the collection . in November. Needless to say, if they're anything . like the singer's own colourful style, summer on the streets of the UK . looks set to be very bright indeed - whatever the weather does!

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has joined CBS News - and the one-time diplomat  wasted no time taking her first snipe as a journalist at Democratic President Barack Obama. Rice, who also served as National Security Adviser to Republican President George W. Bush, will work for the network as a 'contributor,' according to a statement circulated by CBS and obtained by The Huffington Post. The political science professor got started Sunday, making her 'first CBS appearance in her new role on the 'Face the Nation.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Newly-minted journalist: Condoleezza Rice made her first CBS appearance in her new role on 'Face the Nation' on Sunday . Condi: Rice served as National Security Adviser during George W. Bush's first term, and then as Secretary of State in the second . In response to a question, the one-time diplomat dilated on the partisan politics hampering the creation of new legislation on Capitol Hill, taking a not-so-subtle shot at President Barack Obama's style of governing. 'Obviously, relations with Congress are, on one side of the aisle, pretty poisoned right now,' she told  host Bob Schieffer. 'But also out in the country, the American people don't want to see this divisiveness. 'They want to see the President say, 'I won the election, and now here's where we are going, but we are going together. I recognize that we have differences that may be even deep, but first and foremost we are Americans.'' CBS did not reveal the specifics of Rice's assignment going forward. New role: Rice embraced her new role Sunday, smiling broadly at host Bob Schieffer's introduction...and then, for good measure, sniping at the president . Professor Condi: Rice returned to Stanford University after Bush left office, and is now a faculty member at its business school . The network only reportedly said in a widely-circulated statement that the Stanford University professor will 'use her insight and vast experience to explore issues facing America at home and abroad.' 'Everybody knows Condoleezza Rice was President Bush’s Secretary of State but I'm very pleased to announce she has a new job as of today,' host Bob Schieffer said in introducing Rice as a guest on his round-table panel discussion on Sunday. 'As of today, she's joining CBS News as a contributor,' Scheiffer added. 'We're honored to have you.' Rice, who wore a red dress on the show, smiled broadly as Schieffer introduced her new role, and then seemed to chuckle as he turned the conversation over to her. Undefined: Rice will reportedly be a 'contributor' for the network, but her duties at CBS were not specifically explained in a widely-circulated statement . 'Well, frankly, the first one is a lot more exciting than the second,' Rice said of George W. Bush's first versus his second presidential inauguration. 'I remember being completely taken with the moment (during the first one, but) by the second one, I thought, 'Ya' know I really need to get to work.' Rice served as National Security Adviser during Bush's first term, and then succeeded Colin Powel as Secretary of State during the 43rd president's final four years in office. Rice then joked on 'Face the Nation' about the redundancy of officials performing not one - but two - background checks on her at the beginning of both the first and second Bush terms in the White House. Mixing it up: Rice seemed well at ease on 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, smiling often and broadly and even joking about the redundancy of the background checks performed on her before both Bush's first and second terms . 'I remember thinking - because they were actually going out and talking to my neighbors again - and I remember thinking, didn't we just do this four years ago?' she told Schieffer on the show. 'You know what I've been doing for the last four years.' In March of 2009, Rice reportedly returned to Stanford University -  where she taught prior to joining Bush's White House - as a political science professor. As of late 2010, she had become a full faculty member of Stanford's business school. WATCH VIDEO HERE .","Rice returned to academia after serving in George W. Bush's cabinet .

Astronomers have watched as a black hole woke up from a decades-long slumber to feed on a nearby giant planet. The discovery in galaxy NGC 4845, 47 million light-years away, was made by ESA's INTEGRAL space observatory. A similar feeding event, albeit on a . gas cloud, will soon happen at the black hole at the centre of our own . Milky Way Galaxy, astronomers say. Scroll down for video . Astronomers were able to capture a black hole waking up from a decades-long slumber to feed on a low-mass object - either a brown dwarf or a giant planet - that strayed too close. The flaring event in NGC 4845 can . be seen as a warm-up act for a similar event expected in the . supermassive black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way Galaxy, . perhaps even this year. While . there are no brown dwarfs or planets on the menu this time, a compact . cloud of gas amounting to just a few Earth masses has been seen . spiralling towards the black hole and is predicted to meet its fate . soon. 'The observation was completely . unexpected, from a galaxy that has been quiet for at least 20–30 years,' says Marek Nikolajuk of the University of Bialystok, Poland, lead . author of the paper in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Astronomers were using INTEGRAL to study . a different galaxy when they noticed a bright X-ray flare coming from . another location in the same wide field-of-view. Using XMM-Newton, the . origin was confirmed as NGC 4845, a galaxy never before detected at high . energies.Along with . Swift and MAXI, the emission was traced from its maximum in January . 2011, when the galaxy brightened by a factor of a thousand, and then as . it subsided over the course of the year. By analysing the characteristics of . the flare, the astronomers could determine that the emission came from a . halo of material around the galaxy's central black hole as it tore . apart and fed on an object of 14–30 Jupiter masses. This size range corresponds to brown . dwarfs, substellar objects that are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen . in their core and ignite as stars. However, . the authors note that it could have had an even lower mass, just a few . times that of Jupiter, placing it in the range of gas-giant planets.

The family of a filmmaker linked to an anti-Islamic movie has left their California home in the middle of the night to join the man in hiding. A . spokesman with the LA County Sheriff's Department said that Nakoula . Basseley Nakoula's relatives, each with his or her face covered, left their Cerritos home about 3:45am on . Monday. Deputies gave them a ride and they were reunited with Nakoula, . then taken to an undisclosed location. Family ties: The family of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula covered their faces as they were led out of his Cerritos, California, home early on Monday morning . Not under arrest: Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is escorted from his home by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers in Cerritos, California on Saturday morning . Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County Sheriff's Department, told ABC News: 'They decided they would be safer where they could move about and live a normal life. 'All we did was pick them up and reunite them with Mr. Nakoula.' He would not say when or if Nakoula and his family were planning to return - if ever. He told ABC: 'What we do know and what they told me is that for the time now and for the immediate future, for the weeks and months to come, they will not be returning to this address.' Nakoula . wore heavy apparel to disguise his appearance when he left his home . over the weekend. His family was no different, keeping their faces covered as they were led away by deputies. Meanwhile, as fresh protests broke out in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi issued an stark message directed at Nakoula. Condemnation: Iran's Vice President Mohammad . Reza Rahimi (left) called for the filmmakers to be punished . while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (right) called on the West to take action . 'The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns... this inappropriate and offensive action,' Mr Rahimi said. 'Certainly it will search for, track and pursue this guilty person who... has insulted 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.' Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also issued a statement, calling on the West to show it respects Islam by blocking the film. Casualty: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was one of four Americans killed in the Benghazi attack . 'They must prove they were not 'accomplices' in a 'big crime', he said. Nakoula was interviewed by federal probation officers, who . are reviewing a 2010 case in which he was convicted of bank fraud. Federal . authorities have identified Nakoula, a self-described Coptic Christian,  as the key figure behind 'Innocence . of Muslims,' a film denigrating Islam that ignited violence against . U.S. embassies in the Middle East. Nakoula later admitted that he produced the film with the help of his 21-year-old son, Abanob Basseley. The 14-minute clip on YouTube has sparked violence across the Muslim world. Violence began Tuesday when . mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S. Embassy walls in the . Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the American flag from a pole in . the courtyard. Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to . Libya, also was killed on Tuesday along with three other Americans, as . violent protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated . Press on Thursday that authorities had connected Nakoula to a man using . the pseudonym of Sam Bacile who claimed earlier to be writer and . director of the film. Nakoula pleaded no contest in 2010 to . federal bank fraud charges in California and was ordered to pay more . than $790,000 in restitution. The man behind it all: Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is escorted out of his home by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers in Cerritos, California . He was also sentenced to 21 months in . federal prison and was ordered not to use computers or the Internet for . five years without approval from his probation officer. His attorney cited Nakoula's poor . health in a bid for leniency and home detention, stating his client . suffered from Hepatitis C, diabetes that require twice-daily insulin . shots, and other ailments that required more than 10 medications a day, . according to a transcript of the sentencing obtained by the AP. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies stand down the street from the suburban Los Angeles home of filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula . Many records in case remain sealed, . but prosecutors sought a longer prison term and noted that he misused . some of his own relatives' identities to open 600 fraudulent credit . accounts. Nakoula apologized during the proceedings and his attorney . James D. Henderson Sr. said Nakoula had learned his lesson. 'He's clearly gotten the message,' Henderson said. 'I can't imagine him doing anything stupider than what . he did here, but what's done is done.' Henderson said during the hearing that . his client had been enlisted by another man to open the accounts and . had only received $60,000 to $70,000 from the fraudulent transactions. Criminal record: Nakoula, also known as Sam Bacile, is pictured on the set of the controversial film 'Innocence Of Muslims' He got involved in the scheme after losing his job in the gas station . industry and had been forced to work for a few dollars a weekend at swap . meets to try to support his children and an ailing father, Henderson . said, according to the transcript. It could be difficult to establish a . probation violation case against Nakoula. In the federal court system, . the conditions of supervised release are geared toward the offense for . which a defendant was found guilty and imprisoned. In Nakoula's case, the offense was . bank fraud. His no contest plea was to charges of setting up fraudulent . bank accounts using stolen identities and Social Security numbers, . depositing checks from those accounts into other phony accounts and then . withdrawing the illicit funds from ATM machines. While it was unclear what might have . provoked authorities' interest, the filmmaker's use of a false identity . and his access to the Internet through computers could be at issue, . according to experts in cyber law and the federal probation system. Nakoula, who told the AP that he was logistics manager for the film, was . under requirements to provide authorities with records of all his bank . and business accounts. The probation order authorized in June . 2010 warned Nakoula against using false identities. Nakoula was told . not to 'use, for any purpose or in any manner, any name other than . his/her true legal name or names without the prior written approval of . the Probation Officer.' Federal prosecutors had charged that . Nakoula used multiple false identities in creating his fraudulent . accounts. Several, Nicola Bacily and Erwin Salameh, were similar to the . Sam Bacile pseudonym used to set up the YouTube account for the . anti-Islamic film. Other pseudonyms used in the accounts ranged from . Ahmed Hamdy to P.J. Tobacco. Media microphones are pictured outside the home of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula yesterday in anticipation of a statement from the filmmaker . Nakoula was also told he could not . have any access to the Internet 'without the prior approval of the . probation officer.' Nakoula was ordered to detail any online devices and . cellphones to authorities and was told his devices would be monitored . and subject to searches. Jennifer Granick, a criminal defense . lawyer who specializes in online crimes, said authorities might not have . been aware of Nakoula's online activity even if monitoring devices were . placed on his computers. 'That may be very hard for a probation officer . to catch ahead of time.' Granick also noted that Nakoula's . conviction for financial crimes might provide a basis for probation . officials to review bank and other monetary records. 'Somebody charged . with a financial crime might receive some supervision categories where . they might re-offend,' she said. Nakoula was arrested in June 2009, . pleaded no contest to the bank fraud charges a year later and was . released from federal prison in June 2011 after serving a 21-month . prison term, according to federal records.","Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55 was escorted to the sheriff's station in Cerritos for interview over alleged probation violation .

The newlywed husband who secretly stole £18,000 from his bride's family remarried while on bail for his crimes. Yesterday the Daily Mail told how Charlie Astrand, 25, found out her new husband Huw Jones, 31, had been stealing from the family business when her father told her at the airport as the pair arrived back from their honeymoon. And today it has been revealed that two weeks ago Jones remarried, just days before he appeared in Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court where he admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft. Second time lucky:  Huw Jones, 31, left, with his first wife Charlie Astrand, 25, whose family business he stole from.  And right with his new wife Neely Jones who he wed just days before he appeared in court . Nuptials: Jones's second bride was also married in white and with a tiara when she walked down the aisle at Easter . Miss Astrand has told how she was left 'in pieces' at her new husband's betrayal - but Jones moved on in his life 'without a care'. Jones was still married to Miss Astrand when he met mother-of-two Neely Davies, 27, and got her pregnant months later. Jones's second bride was also married in white and with a tiara when she walked down the aisle at Easter. Embarrassed Jones yesterday refused to talk about how he stole from Miss Astrand's father's car dealership in Aberdare, South Wales. His policeman father Carl, 50, said he did not wish to talk about his new life without Miss Astrand  - and with his second wife. Moved on: Jones was still married to Miss Astrand when he met mother-of-two Neely Davies, 27 left, and got her pregnant months later . Perfect wedding: Charlie Astrand, 25, with her new husband Huw Jones, . 31, on their wedding day. Charlie's father Graham is pictured left, and . her mother Alison is right. But when she returned from honeymoon, the primary school teacher's dream turned into a nightmare . But a family friend said: 'Huw has moved on in his life - he regrets what happened but he's not one to wallow in it. 'He feels it was all a big mistake and that he was under a lot of pressure. He needed a fresh start. 'He met Neely after everything went wrong with him and Charlie - he felt it was right to move on. 'I'm not sure if the baby was planned but he's enjoying becoming a dad and Neely's two kids think the world of him.' Yesterday Miss Astrand, said her 'world came crashing in' when she learned that the man she had married was a fraud. Anguish: Charlie, 25, with her father Graham who broke the news to her that her new husband had been stealing from the family home as he drove her back from the airport . She and Jones had been away for only two days when Mr Astrand discovered his new son-in-law had fiddled the books. He went to the police but was advised to let the couple finish their honeymoon before confronting his employee. After paying for the white wedding and . contributing towards the two-week honeymoon on the island of Aruba, Mr . Astrand waited at the airport arrivals lounge armed with proof of . Jones's crimes. Miss Astrand, whose marriage collapsed at that point, . said: 'It was the worst moment of my life – I had just had the most . blissful honeymoon with the man I loved.

Picture perfect: Charlie's parents paid £20,000 for her wedding and contributed towards their two-week luxury honeymoon on the Caribbean island of Aruba . Wedding joy: Charlie, right, had no idea that Huw Jones was defrauding her father's company during her four-year relationship - until the news was broken to her after her honeymoon . Prosecutor Heath Edwards said: 'Jones . had forged signatures, manipulated the accounts and sweetened deals. He . forged documents and upped the amount of money in loan applications, . unbeknown to customers. 'He did it to impress his fiancée and her family – and to up his sales figures for commission.' The court heard Jones cunningly hid . his dodgy dealings during his two-year engagement to his boss's . daughter, leading up to their marriage in July 2010. Mr Edwards said: 'Mr Astrand was waiting at the airport to confront his new son-in-law when he stepped off the plane.' Laurence Jones, defending, said: . 'Jones had taken on responsibilities he could not cope with in an . overwhelming desire to impress his future father-in-law.' Happy couple: Charlie with her new boyfriend Chris Heneman who is an accountant . He added that Jones had 'learned a . very long, hard salutary lesson and is remorseful for his actions'. Judge Dan Williams gave Jones a nine-month suspended jail sentence, . telling him: 'I have given you a chance even though I am not convinced . you deserve it. Please don't blow it.'

A ginormous 400-foot deep sinkhole in Louisiana is expanding and today swallowed a boat. Two clean-up workers who were in the boat had to be rescued before they too disappeared into the watery mass, which today grew by another 50ft, authorities said. The vessel was tied to a tree on the south west side of the site as the workers cleaned up diesel in the sinkhole. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sinkhole: A ginormous 400-foot deep sinkhole, pictured on August 16, swallowed another 50-feet of land today as well as a boat . The piece of land where the tree was standing sunk into the growing pool of water, pulling the boat in with it. The workers were rescued by air boat and did not suffer any injuries but all clean up operations at the site have now been suspended until further notice due to concerns over safety. 'Early this morning they started the clean up operation of the diesel,' said John Boudreaux, director of Office of Emergency Preparedness for Assumption Parish. 'Two of the workers were in a small John's boat and had a rope skimmer. The boat was tied to trees but that edge slouched and basically the boat started to go in with it. There was an air boat nearby and they were rescued as the trees went in and took the boat in too.' The gaping hole now measures about 526-feet from northeast to southwest and 640-feet from northwest to southeast. Sunken: A boat similar to the one pictured disappeared into the growing sinkhole this morning but its two crew were rescued . Governor's Office of Emergency . Preparedness spokesman Christina Stevens said scientists who looked at . the site had anticipated the sinkhole to grow and believe its maximum . size would get to 1400-ft across. 'We haven't got there yet but even at that size it would not be a threat to any homes,' she said. Officials still fear possible explosions from nearby gas-filled caverns. Last week, the massive sinkhole in . the Louisiana bayou swallowed all of the 100-foot trees in the . surrounding area and led to mandatory evacuations. About 150 people were ordered to . leave their residences after the gaping hole opened in Assumption Parish . amid fears of potential radiation leaks and natural gas explosions. Growing: The boat was tied to a tree on the southwest side of the site, pictured today . But . despite the authorities enacting the mandatory evacuation, most people . chose to stay following allegations of a cover-up and industrial . mismanagement from the owners of a nearby salt cavern. As state scientists monitored the toxicity of naturally occurring radiation at a slurry hole in Assumption Parish, residents said last Thursday they were furious with their public state officials because they think they have been withholding information. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality said the slurry hole near Bayou Corne is near areas that have been used for oil and gas exploration. Low levels of radioactivity may be remaining from the work, though not at harmful levels, officials say. 'Out of abundance of caution and . because of the ongoing incident, I have decided to further enhance our . monitoring efforts,' DEQ Secretary Peggy Hatch said in a statement. Officials . said the first set of 15 samples from the area show that there are no . detectable levels of naturally occurring radioactive material on the . surface of the sinkhole and Hatch said they're confident residents . aren't at risk of exposure. Evacuated: Residents remain evacuated from the area . Department . spokesman Rodney Mallett said such material tends to accumulate in low . levels on equipment used to drill for oil and gas. Gas bubbles have been erupting in the . area for weeks. Residents have been especially alarmed at the . possibility of a natural gas explosion after 28 residents in Grand Bayou . had to evacuate their homes on Christmas 2003 because natural gas was . seeping from a salt dome storage cavern and bubbling up into water . wells. Residents have . also been reporting earthquakes but despite a battery of tests conducted . by federal, parish and local officials, no one has been able to figure . out the source of the tremors. Randy . Rousseau, who lives in Grand Bayou and owns a body shop in Belle Rose, . said he'd noticed tremors for years. He eventually moved out of his . house because he didn't feel safe and has been unable to sell it because . the property value plummeted after several small sinkholes opened up in . his yard. Before: The sinkhole was much smaller last Thursday, pictured . Scientists said at a community . meeting last Tuesday the sinkhole might be related to a brine cavern . owned by Houston-based Texas Brine Co. contained within an underground . salt dome. It has been reported that local . officials at Texas Brine have known since at least January 2011 that . there have been problems with the structural integrity of a brine cavern . that was plugged in June 2010. Officials did not mention those issues . at the meeting. 'It's . what I've been saying all along, that they've been hiding things,' Rousseau said. 'I think our local officials are trying to do the best . they can, but I think they're being hindered by the higher-ups hiding . things.' Rousseau said he was especially . worried after a parish official had him fill out a form asking him to . list his next of kin last Thursday morning. 'That's . a little disturbing to me. They said it's in case they can't reach us . to evacuate. But I mean, come on. They can reach everyone,' he said. Rep. Joe Harrison, R-Napoleonville, said he wanted more transparency and . answers from the Office of Conservation. He said he had no idea about . structural issues within the brine cavern until he read about them in . the paper. 'There is a serious lack of competence now in the state, and we knew nothing. Nothing. Why did they close the mine? We didn't get any answers. It's a real lack of competence now,' Harrison said. Some residents in the area said that they had been experiencing tremors for years before the enormous sinkhole opened up . Sonny Cranch, spokesman for Texas Brine, said they were continuing to monitor the area for any changes. 'We've installed booms around the . perimeter of the sinkhole to contain any floating contaminants, the . diesel, anything else,' Cranch said. Dr. Madhurendu Kumar, director of the . state Department of Natural Resources' oil and gas division, said the . sinkhole could have been caused by structural problems within the salt . dome that sits underneath it. The wall of salt between the brine cavern and the salt dome might be thinner than experts were led to believe, he said. He said this sinkhole was unusual because it sits on the edge of the dome, when sinkholes normally sit right on top. The owners of four natural gas pipelines nearby were asked to depressurize and vent off their pipelines as a precaution after the slurry area bent a 400-foot-long section of pipeline. Governor Bobby Jindal declared a . state of emergency Friday in Assumption Parish and ordered an immediate . evacuation of 150 homes and several businesses. The evacuation remains . in effect. Low levels of radioactivity may be emanating, though not at harmful levels, officials said . Officials said last Friday that it will be at . least 40 days before they get definitive answers about an enormous . sinkhole that opened up in Assumption Parish. Mark Cartwright, president of United Brine Services, a subsidiary of . Texas Brine Co., said the company spent the last week 'intensely . focused' on an emergency response as they try to figure out the cause . behind a sinkhole near Bayou Corne. Cartwright said they'll be drilling a relief well to investigate a . brine cavern they own, which is housed within the Napoleonville salt . dome. It will take at least 40 days to drill the well, and scientists . have speculated that the sinkhole might . be related to structural problems within the cavern. 'Our efforts are going to be more focused on diagnostics, and looking . into what caused this event,' Cartwright said at a press conference in . Gonzales. Commissioner of Conservation Jim Welsh ordered the company last Thursday . to drill a well and investigate the salt cavern and 'further evaluate . potential causes of the subsidence near its well site,' as well as . obtain samples of cavern content. Cartwright said the company was just as shocked as anyone else when . the sinkhole erupted two weeks ago, swallowing up an acre of bald cypress . trees and leaving diesel fumes and slurry water in its wake.","Huge 400-foot deep hole swallows another 50-feet of land today .

Trepanning: Heather Perry, 41, took a Black and Decker to her skull because she believed it would relieve pressure on her brain and help treat her chronic fatigue syndrome . A woman who drilled a hole in her head in an attempt to cure her health problems has died – ten years later. Heather Perry, 41, was filmed for US television as she performed the ancient practice known as trepanning, an inquest heard yesterday. She believed it would relieve pressure on her brain, but the attempt ended with her being taken to hospital because she drilled too deeply. Miss Perry survived and returned home to Newent, Gloucestershire, but turned to drugs. The inquest heard she had been arrested on suspicion of supplying drugs two days before her death, in April this year. After the hearing, her brother Keith said: ‘She thought the trepanning would be the answer to all her problems but obviously it wasn’t. ‘I do wonder whether it actually had an effect on her brain and led to what happened later, but we shall never know. ‘There was medical help on offer but she just kept on going back to the same people and to drugs.’ Miss Perry claimed in an interview with science blog Neurophilosophy in 2008 that she was inspired to go through with the procedure after hearing John Lennon had wanted to do it. By her 20s she had begun to suffer headaches brought on by taking ‘a lot of acid, which kind of mashed up my brain a bit’. Dangerous? Watched by an American film crew, Ms Perry performed the ancient surgical technique on herself with an electric drill in 2000 - while standing in front of a mirror . Like a hole in the head: Trepanning is thought to be one of the oldest surgical procedures, believed to cure epileptic seizures, headaches and mental disorders. Left is a 14th century drawing of the procedure and right is a scull with a series of bore holes, probably made with a stone or rudimentary drill . 'Higher state of consciousness': One of the most famous 'trepanners' was Amanda Feilding, now 69, who achieved notoriety at the age of 23 when she was recorded drilling a hole in her head with a drill, while her then boyfriend shot the operation for the film Heartbeat in the Brain . Trepanning involves the removal of a piece of bone from the skull, and it has been performed since prehistoric times. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, headaches and mental disorders. The oldest samples of skulls with bore holes drilled into them were found in a burial site in France dating back to 6,500BC. But it was also used by the Ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, Romans, Greeks and the early Mesoamerican civilizations. Even the 'father of medicine' Hippocrates (pictured) advocated the process in his 400BC tome 'On Injuries of the Head'. Modern exponents say it increases blood flow in the brain, increasing lucidity and heightening brain function. So at 29 she travelled to America, . where the practice is legal in some states, enlisting the help of Peter . Halvorson, a self-styled expert who had performed trepanation on himself . in the 1970s. In an interview given after the . procedure, Miss Perry said she had ‘no regrets’ and  had experienced a . ‘definite improvement’ in her health. ‘I know what I’ve done sounds totally horrific and I know most people will think it is extremely dangerous,’ she said. ‘I’m the first to admit it sounds . totally ridiculous and I can understand the reaction I’ve provoked. 'But . I felt something radical needed to be done.’ Deputy Gloucestershire coroner Katy Skerrett recorded that Miss Perry died as a result of drug dependency. One of the most famous people to . undergo trepanning is Amanda Feilding, now 69, the Countess of Wemyss . and March, wife of the landowning 13th Earl, and a friend of the Royal . Family.

"By . Vincent Graff . PUBLISHED: . 14:01 EST, 10 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 10 April 2013 . Gwen Trickett, a  no-nonsense 77-year-old great-grandmother with a Yorkshire accent as thick as porridge, is musing on the shortcomings of society. ‘The young ones now, they’re not like our generation, are they?’ she says. ‘People have too much money. They won’t get things mended. They’d sooner throw ’em away and get a new one.’ Chucking stuff is not Gwen’s style. A real sucker: Vince tests out the 56-year-old Hoover as Gwen looks on . I hope she won’t mind me saying, but I’ve not really come to her house — a semi with a neat front garden on the outskirts of Barnsley — to meet her. I’m here to look at one of Gwen’s household appliances: her 56-year-old Hoover. Her vacuum cleaner is a bit of a celebrity. Gwen’s local paper ran a piece about someone who has a 38-year-old freezer. The newspaper asked whether any other readers could boast of a longer-lived household appliance. Well, Gwen could and she got in touch. She bought her Hoover Junior in 1957. And five decades on it is still in full active service, week in, week out, on her blue and red floral carpets (which are, I can report, spotless). So what is her Hoover like? As she ushers me in through her front door, it’s on the carpet facing me — standing bolt upright, like a soldier on parade. Old faithful: Gwen did get a new vacuum ten years ago but doesn't use it as she prefers her Hoover . True, it is scratched and scuffed — wouldn’t you be if you’d been shoved under the couch and the sideboard thousands of times? But the only parts that have ever been replaced are the wire flex (once), cloth dustbag (once) and belt (a handful of times). To get some idea of her Hoover’s longevity, you need to transport yourself back to April 1957. Lonnie Donegan, Elvis Presley and Tommy Steele were dominating the hit parade; Peter Cushing as Young Frankenstein was at the cinema; and prime minister Harold Macmillan was a few weeks away from announcing that we’d ‘never had it so good’. And Gwen — along with her husband Derek, now 84, whom she’d married a month earlier — had gone shopping for a vacuum cleaner in Barnsley town centre. ‘Back then, if you got married before the start of the tax year, you’d get a rebate from the taxman. I can’t remember how much money we got, but it felt like a lot. We decided we’d spend the money on a vacuum cleaner.’ In the late Fifties, there were rival models by Goblin and Electrolux, but in that era Hoover dominated the market and she knew that’s what she’d end up with. Stood the test of time: It might be a little battered but the Hoover still works . Little realising at the time the future significance of her purchase, Gwen remembers very little about the shopping trip. She’s sure she bought the Hoover in Barnsley, but is not clear whether she went to Curry’s (which started as a bicycle business in 1884) or a local store. And she doesn’t remember how much she paid. Luckily, the company — now known as Hoover-Candy, since the British branch of the American firm was bought by an Italian company in the Nineties — is able to help out. A spokeswoman says Gwen’s Hoover Junior sold for around £20 in 1957. That’s the equivalent of nearly £420 in today’s money, four times the price of a basic Hoover model now. I do a quick calculation. Gwen says she has used her Hoover two or three times a week. If each session lasted, say, 20 minutes that equates to 2,400 hours of use. That’s 100 solid days and nights of continuous Hoovering. With one Hoover. That’s pretty incredible, I tell Gwen. Have your other domestic appliances held out as well? She shakes her head. During her married life, she’s been through five ovens, four washing machines, as many toasters and up to 20 kettles. ‘They don’t last long, do they?’ she says. It’s time to put the beast into service. Can I have a go with your Hoover, I ask. Value for money: The appliance cost £20 when it was bought in 1957 after Gwen got married . Gwen happily consents. After all, husband Derek — who normally does the vacuuming these days — is sitting with his feet up in the conservatory, enjoying an afternoon snooze. (Incidentally, Gwen says Derek isn’t enjoying all this fuss about their Hoover.) So how do I use it? ‘It’s got one button. On and off. That’s enough for me.’ I press it. The big cloth dustbag puffs itself up like an over-proud set of bagpipes at Hogmanay. And, as with bagpipes, a din envelopes the room. This old technology may be reliable, but it’s certainly noisier than its modern equivalent. There’s no question, however, that the suction is every bit as good as my Miele vacuum cleaner at home. And the Hoover is surprisingly nimble. Moving it back and forth over Gwen’s short-pile carpet, I find it light to manoeuvre and easy to swivel into corners (though, to be fair, I should add that its strong suction makes it rather less easy to use on Gwen’s big, fluffy rug). Then Gwen reveals a surprising secret. Hers is not a one-vacuum household. Tucked away upstairs is a second cleaner, one she sheepishly refers to as the ‘new one’. In fact, it’s not new at all: it’s ten years old. It’s a plastic thing that doesn’t suck up the dirt nearly as well as her 1957 Hoover Junior. They never use it. Why did they get a second vacuum cleaner? ‘It was my husband who decided to buy it,’ says Gwen. ‘He got it because we’d had our other one so long he thought we should have a new one. ‘But the new one simply doesn’t do what I want it to do. It doesn’t pick up the same as my old one.’Aha! A rogue purchase by a rogue of a husband. She points towards the conservatory, where Derek is still snoozing.

Tests later revealed that he died from a heroin overdose and his parents were arrested in December.

The child’s father, Simon Jones, 29, denied the same charge as he stood alongside her in the dock during the short hearing. Emma Bradburn, mother of 23-month-old Daniel Jones, has admitted her part in his death from a heroin overdose. His father Simon Jones denies the same charge . A picture from his father's Facebook page shows Daniel Jones smiling in his car seat . Both defendants pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of manslaughter in the case. They will stand trial later this year. Paramedics were called to the couple’s house in Penn at 6.15am on May 29 last year. After Daniel’s death it emerged an inquiry would be held by Wolverhampton social services, police and the Probation Service. The Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children Board is carrying out the serious case review. Concerns have been raised about how organisations or professionals worked together to protect Daniel. Neighbours speaking when the news broke said Daniel’s death had been ‘devastating’. At the time, Anthony Baker, 67, and daughter Natalie, 38, who lived next door, described Daniel as an 'ordinary child'. Mr Baker added: 'I used to have a laugh with him over the fence.' Tests showed that Daniel died of a heroin overdose and his parents Emma Bradburn and Simon Jones were arrested in December . Miss Baker said: 'He was a normal happy child.' Pictures from Jones' Facebook page showed a smiling Daniel in a car seat and the couple posing with him as a baby on a bed. Previously, Penn ward councillor Martin Waite, who lives nearby, said: 'I’m massively surprised to hear that something like this has happened here.

In contrast, 81 per cent of residents in Belfast don't own any authentic art at all. Britons tend to purchase mass produced prints from high-street stores (41 per cent) rather than opting for a one-of-a-kind piece (33 per cent).

Scientists hope the Handivote system will lead to higher turn-outs among younger people who are used to texting their votes for reality TV shows (file photo) In order to take part households would receive hand-delivered four-digit identification codes and PIN numbers in sealed envelopes. The scheme was tested in a vote asking whether houses should be built in North Kelvin Meadow, in Glasgow. Researchers received 483 responses to the question 'Build' or 'Don't Build' before the poll closed on Sunday. In total, 451 - or 93 per cent - answered 'Don't Build' while 32 were in favour. Two abstained and nine responses were invalid. Dr Paul Cockshott, one of the academics behind the system, said: 'This was the first time we had tried the system on such a scale, and the first public use of it. 'The system works by nobody but the recipient knowing what the voting card number is, and they send the code in the SMS to prove they are the recipient of the card."" Douglas Peacock, chairman of the North Kelvin Meadow Campaign, said: 'The technology is very interesting. When you think that someone has to use their mobile at their own cost to respond, that is pretty good.' Dr Cockshott hopes the method will be used by local authorities and the Scottish Government in the future. He added: 'We designed it with the view of being used in national votes as we think it will increase turnout especially with young people. 'I think it would be cheaper. All you need is to print out the voting cards. You don't need to pay the staff at the polling booths.' Dr Cockshott said the system would be cheaper than paying staff to man polling stations . Dr Cockshott said in future an 'abstain' option would be added, and that letters would be sent to people on the electoral roll rather than being hand-delivered. A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The Scottish Government is interested in any research and development of new technologies to make it easier for people to vote. 'However, we would need to make sure that any new mechanisms for voting are tried and tested and approved by the necessary organisations before they are used in any election.

Their entrance with a difference was made for their reception at Gilsland Spa, east of Brampton. Luckily, the bride's 'carriage' was brand new, so there was no danger of her dress getting dirty or damaged. Heidi said she was not nervous about the novel entrance and when it was first suggested she thought it was a good idea.

A group of RAF pilots have become the first to be awarded their wings for flying unmanned aircraft. The four airmen, who are the first to be trained specifically for the role, will now have the ability to bomb sites and carry out intelligence missions by remotely flying the 11-metre long Reaper MQ-9 aircraft from their desks. The RAF has created a specialist flying branch for those in charge of Remotely Piloted Air Systems, training the first cohort in the United States because the machines cannot be flown in the UK under current aviation laws. The four unnamed airmen, pictured with deputy commander-in-chief Air Marshal Richard Garwood, centre, will now have the ability to fly the 11-metre long Reaper MQ-9 aircraft from their desks . The 11-metre long Reaper MQ-9 drone can be used in bombing or intelligence missions thousands of miles away from the pilots' base . The pilots trained at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada and will work from the base on operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan, 7,500 miles away. RAF crew in Afghanistan have initial . control of the aircraft for take-off and once in the air, a satellite . link-up transfers control over to the RPAS squadron in their offices. The RPAS pilots then carry out the operation with control passed back to the RAF in Afghanistan for landing. All the pilots had undergone basic training for 'real' aircrafts before specialising in drone flights. RPAS pilots get a dedicated wings badge which has blue laurel leaves rather than brown to show their specialisation. Air Marshal Richard Garwood, the RAF's deputy commander-in-chief-operations, awarded the wings to the four pilots, who are not yet being named for security purposes. The wings badges for the drone squadron have blue laurel leaves instead of the usual brown to distinguish them from pilots flying manned aircraft . Deputy Commander-in-Chief Operations, Air Marshal Richard Garwood addressing the audience at the pilots' graduation ceremony at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada . He said: 'This first graduation of RPAS pilots makes clear not only the RAF's commitment to this pivotal technology but the associated need to produce highly qualified pilots devoted to fully exploiting RPAS capabilities now and in the future.' There are two RPAS Squadrons; 39 Squadron which is currently based at Creech, and 13 Squadron, which is based at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. Eventually, 39 Squadron will relocate to Waddington once facilities there are completed. Wing commander Thomas Burke, from 39 Squadron, described the RPAS pilots as an 'essential part' of the RAF, which turned 95 this week. RAF teams in Afghanistan will take care of take-offs and landings while the RPAS team in Nevada controls the operation . He said: 'RPAS are an essential part of the Royal Air Force's force mix now and in the future; today marks the establishment of a sub-specialisation that will ensure the Royal Air Force can continue to lead the way in providing this essential and burgeoning battle-winning capability.' The £25million Reaper is manufactured by General Atomics and went into service in 2007. They are used primarily for surveillance by the RAF but they are also equipped with two GBU-12 500lb laser guided bombs and four AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. The US armed forces have been heavily criticised by opponents for their use of drones, which are thought to have killed more than 3,000 civilians in Pakistan since 2004.","39 Squadron trained at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada .

The NHS should remove more tonsils to avoid repeated cases of severely sore throats, according to British doctors. About 200,000 children a year had the surgery in the 1950s but it is now considered old-fashioned and expensive, with only 29,000 carried out in 2010/11. But a Finnish study of patients with recurring sore throats found that only four per cent of those who had their tonsils taken out visited their doctor with another sore throat five months after the procedure, compared with 43 per cent of those who had not had it done. The NHS should carry out more tonsillectomies, say British doctors after a Finnish study showed the surgery reduced cases of sore throats . Consultant surgeon Andrew McCombe, spokesman for ENT UK, the British association of ear, nose and throat specialists, told the Daily Telegraph that the NHS should return to carrying out tonsillectomies instead of cost-cutting by claiming the surgery is ineffective. He said: 'They are trying to pretend that this is about quality of care, saying there is no evidence of [tonsillectomy's] value and calling it a ""procedure of limited effectiveness"". That is a lie and it is a disingenuous use of information.' The study at the University of Oulu in Finland looked at 86 patients with recurring pharyngitis over a five-month period. The patients were randomly sorted into a group of 40 awaiting a tonsillectomy and 46 who had the procedure. Only two (four per cent) of those who had their tonsils out needed to go to the doctor with another severe bout of pharyngitis during the following five months, compared with 17 (43 per cent) out of the 40 who did not have the surgery. In the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the academics reported: 'These reductions resulted in fewer medical visits and fewer absences from school or work. Patients who underwent surgery also felt that their quality of life improved.' The tonsils are lymphoid tissue and produce antibodies and white blood cells to fight off infections . Last year, Mr McCombe told the Mail: 'There’s been a 40 per cent increase in emergency admissions directly related to tonsillitis over the past ten years. 'It is a good, effective operation that does what it says on the tin: if you have the operation, you won’t get tonsillitis again.’ The tonsils are lymphoid tissue and produce antibodies and white blood cells to fight off infections before young children develop other ways to fight germs. They are prone to inflammation, or tonsillitis,  because of infections caused by viruses such as colds and flu. In a third of cases, it is caused by bacterial infection. 'Tonsillectomy is a good operation and this is a study that shows its value and worth, and perhaps suggests we ought to be doing more of these operations,' Mr McCombe told the Telegraph.","Finnish study finds tonsillectomies reduce pharyngitis .

MPs have complained that rules around dinner expenses are not generous enough, they do not get as big a meal allowance as soldiers and that they cannot claim for 'a large lunch at lunchtime'. Labour MP Thomas Docherty said it is 'ludicrous' that MPs from outside of London have to wait until 7.30pm to claim for an evening meal when they are required to be at the House of Commons for late sittings. At a House of Commons administration committee hearing, Kevan Jones, a shadow Labour defence minister and MP for North Durham, said that MPs are only given £15 a night towards their evening meals while civil servants get about £24. Tory MP Sir Alan Haselhurst, left, and Labour MP Thomas Docherty, right, brought up the cost of MPs meals at a House of Commons administration committee hearing . He claimed a colleague told him that serving soldiers receive a £29 allowance, but the Ministry of Defence told the Daily Telegraph that soldiers get £25 to cover all three meals if they are away from their base on a course. MPs earn at least £65,738, with extra money for ministerial roles. Mr Docherty, MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, asked the Independent Parliamentary Standards Committee's policy director John Sills to consider letting MPs have a subsistence allowance. Mr Jones said he 'might choose to have a large lunch at lunchtime', but he is not allowed to claim it back. He said: 'I never claim the £15 full amount, but what you have now stopped doing, which I cannot quite understand, is if, for example, I choose at lunchtime to have a meal and then have a snack in the evening, you will not pay for the one at lunchtime. 'You will perhaps pay for the snack in the evening, even if it all comes to less than £15.' Administration committee chair Sir Alan Haselhurst, the Tory MP for Saffron Walden, said: 'Some declared in their election manifestos that they would not claim for the overnight cost of eating when they were away. Mr Docherty said it was 'ludicrous' that MPs that are not from London have to wait until after 7.30pm for an evening meal if they are to claim it back when the House of Commons sits late . 'If you are a businessman away you would normally get remunerated for the actual costs. For those that have come down from distant places, they are here for three nights probably, in which case they eat more than one meal a day. 'It would be helpful to some new aspiring Members not to find themselves trapped into declarations, which then, when they get here, they find are very uncomfortable.' Mr Docherty told the Daily Telegraph: 'I have no problem with the receipts or with the figure of £15. My point is that it’s ludicrous that the test that is applied is the House of Commons Chamber sitting at 7.31pm. That in itself is not the only measure of what MPs are doing.' Mr Jones told the newspaper: 'Things like the subsistence allowance seem very arbitrary in the way they are being implemented. What we need to do is simplify the system to make it less bureaucratic for claiming and cheaper for the taxpayer.'","'Ludicrous' that non-London MPs must wait until 7.30pm to claim a meal .

Mrs Justice Davies said plans to close a children's heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary were unfair and legally flawed . A High Court judge has derailed controversial plans to close a children’s heart surgery unit because of the ‘secretive’ approach of NHS chiefs. There were scenes of jubilation after the decision to move heart surgery for children from the centre at Leeds General ruled Infirmary as part of a national reorganisation was unfair and legally flawed. The NHS announced last July it wanted to close three units and keep seven open, with some patients in Yorkshire being forced to travel to Liverpool or Newcastle for treatment. But Mrs Justice Davies backed claims by the Save Our Surgery (SOS) group that the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals were kept secret. The judge will announce crucial decisions about what happens next at a further court hearing later this month. Sharon Cheng from SOS said despite winning the case ‘on every point’, the ruling did not necessarily mean the Leeds heart unit was saved. There is huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the region and nearly 600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit. ‘The campaign started small, like David and Goliath, then grew and grew out of all proportions,’ she said. The group spokeswoman slammed the review process conducted by the Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts (JCPCT) as being ‘secretive.’ Miss Cheng said: ‘It was important the process had transparency and openness and they failed in our opinion. Winning this case in the High Court proves once and for all that the supposed consultation was a rubber-stamping exercise conducted with an outcome in mind, with clinicians, MPs and patients fooled into feeling they had influence. ‘This action was taken by parents and . clinicians who simply could not stand by and watch a clear injustice . being done.’ During the national review each hospital unit was visited . by a panel of experts and given a performance mark. The panel produced ‘sub-scores’ which . gave marks for a wide range of criteria, but these weren’t disclosed to . the hospital units lobbying to stay open until after the final decision . was made. Philip . Havers, QC, for SOS, successfully argued the centres were ‘shooting in . the dark’ during the consultation process as they had no idea of how . they were being viewed. Health bosses wanted to close the unit at Leeds General Infirmary (pictured), meaning patients in Yorkshire would be forced to travel to Liverpool or Newcastle for treatment . The JCPCT also ended up ‘assessing in the dark’ as it refused to look at the sub-scores when making its decision and only took account of the total mark. Mrs Justice Davies said in her ruling: ‘As the scores were relevant to the assessment, the breakdown of the scoring should have been disclosed to the centres whether or not the JCPCT proposed to look at it.’ JCPCT chairman Sir Neil McKay said later he hoped the court would not quash the NHS review ‘in its entirety.’ He said: ‘The pressing need to reform children’s heart services is long overdue and experts have cautioned that further delay in achieving the necessary change would be a major setback in improving outcomes for children with heart disease. ‘The judgment focuses on a single matter of process, but the case for the reconfiguration of children’s heart surgical services remains strong.’ Sir Neil McKay CB, Chair of the Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts said: “I am very disappointed with the Court’s decision. The pressing need to reform children’s heart services is long overdue and experts have cautioned that further delay in achieving the necessary change would be a major setback in improving outcomes for children with heart disease. 'The judgment focuses on a single matter of process, but the case for the reconfiguration of children’s heart surgical services remains strong. There is a rare consensus on the need for change right across the board – NHS staff, medical royal colleges, professional associations and national charities all support the case for fewer larger surgical centres, new national quality standards and stronger networks of care.' Professor Terence Stephenson, Chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: 'The Academy recognised that the Safe and Sustainable review concluded that fewer larger surgical centres and the development of local networks of care will improve cardiac services for children based on the evidence of their review of the evidence linking volume of cases to outcomes. Change remains a matter of urgency – it is 12 years since the report of the Bristol Inquiry was published and patients have waited too long for improvements to be made.' Following a series of reviews over the past decade NHS chiefs decided to concentrate the specialist services in fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for child heart patients. The sites currently chosen to stay open are at Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton and two London centres. Facing closure are the Leeds site and units at Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital and London’s Royal Brompton. The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, yesterday welcomed the ruling and said earmarking the Leeds unit for closure was ‘utterly unjustified and unethical.’ He said the evidence must be looked at properly: ‘We cannot afford to rush and make a bodge job of this.’","Decision to close centre at Leeds General Infirmary ruled as 'legally flawed'

A man went berserk and stabbed his fiancée because of the stress of trying to win a £25,000 ‘dream wedding’ contest, a court heard yesterday. Lee Rowlands and Madelaine Moir, both 37, were one of five couples in the competition final who were attempting to win the prize by raising the most money for charity in a week. They were working 20 hours a day to try to raise the money when Rowlands suffered a ‘psychotic episode.’ He allegedly began hearing voices and attacked Miss Moir with two kitchen knives as she cowered on the floor. Strain: Lee Rowlands, right, and his fiancée Madelaine Moir, he he attacked with two kitchen knives during a psychotic episode while desperately trying to win a radio competition for a 'Dream Wedding' She was wounded on her breast, arm, fingers and knee and he ran into the street believing he had killed her, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Yesterday Rowlands was jailed for 28 months after admitting unlawful wounding. He will be released in a few weeks because he has been in custody for 13 months and would have been automatically freed at the halfway point of his sentence. Miss Moir is said to have stood by him and they still hope to get married. The couple had been together for two years before the attack on March 14 last year. They entered the competition run by Sheffield-based independent radio station Hallam FM in the hope of winning the £25,000 wedding package, including a honeymoon in Sri Lanka, venue hire, dress, flowers and photographer. In her application Miss Moir wrote: ‘We wish we had met years ago, we love each other and want to shout it to the world.’ Stand by your man: Miss Moir arrives at Sheffield Crown Court to see Rowlands sentenced. The pair still hope to marry one day . Alison Dorrell, prosecuting, said the couple had a happy relationship and Rowlands had become the father figure to the divorcee’s two children. But Miss Moir had noticed her partner’s heart beating irregularly and he began to speak about hearing voices. He also threatened to jump out of the window and harm himself. During the 25-minute ‘episode’ Rowlands attacked his fiancée with two kitchen knives at their home in Armthorpe, Doncaster. He then ran outside in his boxer shorts ‘saying he had killed her’. Rowlands was found by police sobbing in the street. Miss Dorrell said: ‘He was making no sense at all.’ Miss Moir needed hospital treatment and later had surgery on a finger injury. She said later she didn’t recognise the man who attacked her.  ‘He wasn’t himself and she was of the view that he didn’t want to hurt her and he wasn’t thinking rationally,’ said Miss Dorrell. Miss Moir wrote in her victim statement: ‘We never argued. This is why I can’t say what happened. It is as if somebody else had taken over his body.’ The court heard she had helped turn Rowlands’ life around. He had served time in jail, and they entered the wedding contest because he was desperate to prove himself. Richard Barradell, defending, said the couple aimed to raise £2,000 each a day to win the wedding prize. However, it became clear ‘things were getting to Lee Rowlands’. Mr Barradell said ‘something snapped’ and Rowlands had a ‘psychotic mental breakdown of rapid onset’. ‘He is desperately sorry for what he did. He can’t explain it.’ Judge Robert Moore said Rowlands had been receiving mental health treatment and his release in a few weeks under licence would enable him to continue his rehabilitation.

Letter: The Duke of Devonshire has evicted a farmer from his Chatsworth House estate because the rent was a day late . For almost two centuries his family has run a farm on the Duke of Devonshire’s famous Chatsworth estate. Edward Hill himself was born on Game Lea Farm, and has spent his life working hard to earn a living there – the seventh generation of his family to do so. But now the farmer has been evicted from his Peak District home – all because of a rent payment that was one day late . Mr Hill, 63, suffers from Parkinson’s disease and blames his condition for forgetting to pay around £2,000 in overdue rent. The day after the final payment date, officials from the estate visited the farm to serve Mr Hill and his wife Elizabeth, 61, with a ‘notice to quit’. The farmer immediately paid up the arrears, insisting he had simply been forgetful – but the estate terminated the tenancy anyway. After prolonged negotiations, and despite pleas for sympathy to the Duke himself, the family were forced to sell their animals and hand over the farmland to a neighbour. They have been told they must be out of their home by Monday. The Hills have been shocked by their treatment. Mr Hill said: ‘I was not ready to hang my clogs up. They have not got a shred of humanity or sympathy in them. It has ripped my life apart.’ The couple and their 17-year-old daughter Alicia have already found another home to rent eight miles away, leaving other members of the family at Game Lea Farm for the time being. But Mrs Hill’s son Dorian Madin, 32, his partner Georgina Parker and their children Josephine, seven, Harriet, five, and Philippa, 15 months, fear being left homeless. They are preparing to leave too and hope to be given a council house soon. Mr Hill claimed the estate had also been similarly ‘ruthless’ in their dealings with other farmers. John Hill founded the farm back in 1830 when he developed it from moorland. The farm was passed from one generation to the next through the centuries as Chatsworth House was also passed to successive Dukes. Chatsworth House: Mr Hill's family have run a farm on the Duke of Devonshire's estate for 183 years . Mr Hill’s father Joe, 89, ran the farm under four different Dukes of Devonshire before retiring. He wrote to the current 12th Duke appealing to let his son stay. But that letter, along with one written by Mr Hill himself, was never acknowledged.  ‘The Duke has shown us no respect at all,’ said Mr Hill. ‘The way we have been treated is absolutely outrageous.’ Shocked: Parkinson's sufferer Edward Hill and his wife Elizabeth . The farmer had been in the second generation of a ‘three generation’ long-term tenancy deal at the 200-acre farm. Mr Hill said he had hoped to negotiate a new five-year business tenancy with the estate, but in October 2011 discussions were brought to an end and they were given 18 months’ notice to leave. But that agreement was ended when he failed to pay his six-monthly rent on time. It had previously been run as a dairy farm, but the family diversified in recent years and ran a charity helping people with learning disabilities and problem children by allowing them to visit the farm, complete with its cattle, sheep and poultry. Mr Hill said: ‘They were saying the land was not tidy and the hedges and walls were not in place and things like that. They were also not happy about us running the charity from here.’ His wife added: ‘We have been appallingly treated, but we are not the first farmers to be forced out.’ The couple hope to continue running the charity from their new home, which comes with a smallholding. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association who was involved in negotiating with the estate, said the Duke of Devonshire’s estate has been ‘quite benevolent’ in the past and is now ‘more commercial in its approach’ and ‘more aggressive’ in its rate reviews with farmers. A spokesman for the Chatsworth estate said: ‘It is a very complicated and difficult situation and due to the circumstances we cannot discuss any details for legal reasons.’ He said the land was now being farmed by neighbouring tenants who were ‘slowly bringing the land back into condition’.

A professor with a hatred of 4x4 cars scratched graffiti on vehicles in his upmarket neighbourhood, a court heard yesterday. Stephen Graham, 48, used a screwdriver to write words such as ‘arbitrary’, ‘wrong’ and ‘very silly’ on the paintwork while dressed in only underpants and a jacket. His night-time vandalism, while still wearing a sleeping mask on his forehead, left 27 cars damaged and has landed the professor with a £28,000 compensation bill. Police were called after a resident heard scratching outside and spotted a figure crouching on the ground. Officers arrested the academic in a nearby street. Graham blamed the bizarre bank holiday rampage last August on his reaction to a combination of gin and medication. He was said to be ‘very remorseful and apologetic’ in his police interview. The professor was sentenced to a nine-month suspended jail term at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday. He had previously admitted four charges of criminal damage and asked for 23 similar offences to be taken into consideration. The professor, who specialises in teaching about ‘cities and society’, was said to dislike people living in urban areas who drive ‘Chelsea tractors’ or 4x4s. Prosecutor Stuart Michie told the court: ‘He said he had a problem with 4x4 vehicles, he thinks they are too large for a town.’ But instead of mindless scratches or foul-mouthed slogans, the well-educated vandal scratched a higher class of graffiti on neighbours’ cars in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, using his screwdriver. Hated of four-wheel drives: The court heard a total of 10 of the cars damaged were 4x4s . Messages: Rather than the usual swear words, Graham chose to scratch mild insults into the cars . Mr Michie said: ‘They all had similar . words such as arbitrary, wrong and silly scratched onto them. The . defendant said he had a vague memory of walking down the street in a . dream-like state and damaging one or two cars by scratching words.’ Graham had taken antibiotics for an . infection after he had a tooth removed, and was also taking medication . for a depressive illness. Mindless vandalism: A screwdriver was used to etch words into the . bodywork . Scene: Graham was dressed in just underpants and a dress jacket when he went berserk around his plush neighbourhood of Jesmond in Newcastle . He told police that he had also drunk three quarters of a bottle of gin and, having been unable to sleep, must have gone out. Judge Guy Whiturn QC said he accepted the behaviour was out of character but ordered Graham to pay the full £28,000 cost. A spokesman for Newcastle University refused to comment on whether the professor could lose his job.","Stephen Graham, 47, went on half-naked rampage after downing gin .

Pictured: David Hockney, 75, painted a portrait of his assistant Dominic Elliott, 23, in 2008 . A police spokesman said: ‘This is a . sudden death and we will have to speak to people who worked or lived . with the person who died, whether a world famous artist or a next door . neighbour.’ Mr Elliott, who worked full-time for . the artist and had even featured in a portrait painted by him, was a . keen rugby player and described as ‘big, strong and fit’. But his GP father died of a heart . attack in 2001 aged only 42 and Mr Elliott had in the past complained of . chest pains. Doctors had warned him to curb his drinking over fears he . may have the same heart condition as his father, a friend said. Police said there were no signs of . violence at Mr Hockney’s house. Mr Fitzherbert, who is in his early 60s, . is reported to have driven Mr Elliott 20 miles to Scarborough General . Hospital. He was said to have been  ‘vomiting’ and seriously ill  when he arrived at casualty at 6am on Sunday. He died . shortly afterwards and hospital staff contacted Humberside Police. Officers spent several hours at the house on Sunday morning and are . understood to have spoken to Mr Hockney, 75, though he was not available . for comment yesterday. A police spokesman said they were ‘undertaking . enquiries to establish events leading to the death’. Mr Elliott, who had known Mr Hockney . since childhood, began working for him as a full-time general studio . assistant about two years ago after quitting his university course. Outgoing: Mr Elliott played hockey and rugby and was said to have been in the East Riding Young Farmers Club . Sportsman: Mr Elliott (right) is pictured playing for Bridlington Rugby Club against Heath last November . Mr Hockney’s spokesman Erica Bolton . said the artist was ‘incredibly upset’, adding: ‘He is, like everyone . else, in a state of shock.’ She said Mr Elliott was ‘a very important . person’ to Mr Hockney. Mr Elliott lived in a shared flat in . Bridlington and his solicitor mother Karen Kent lives in a bungalow on . the outskirts of the town. He had two sisters – Beth, 25, and Poppy, 21 – . and a 13-year-old brother, Max. Outside the house: Visitors were pictured arriving today at David Hockney's home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire . Talented: This 2004 painting Four Roads and Cornfields is a prime example of Hockney's much-loved artwork . Bradford-born David Hockney's colourful paintings often showcase landscape of his native Yorkshire or his adopted home in California. Hockney was an important . contributor to the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and one of the most . influential British artists of the 20th century. He was the subject of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy in London last year with an exhibition of his large scale landscapes. The artist is famous for artworks such as A Bigger Splash, a vivid depiction of a Los Angeles swimming pool, and the portrait Mr And Mrs Clark And Percy. In recent years he has been exploring the possibilities of using an iPad for his artworks. His print from 2008 of 'Dominic Elliott' (seen above) shows his ginger-haired assistant dressed in blue trousers and short sleeve top sat on a chair, staring straight ahead. His grandmother Betty Kent, 84, from . Boston, Lincolnshire, said Mr Elliott had been out with ‘arty types’ on . Saturday night. She said: ‘He’d been to his mother’s in the afternoon as . his washing machine was broken and he needed his clothes as he was . going out with his mates.’ Mr Elliott’s grandfather Walter Elliott, 83, said: ‘I don’t know what happened. My suspicion is he had too much to drink.’ Mr Elliott was a trusted assistant who had keys to Mr Hockney’s house as much of the artist’s work was based from there. ‘He didn’t live with David but he was . there a lot and often stayed over,’ said the grandfather. ‘I think David . very much looked on Dominic as a son. ‘I’ve been told Dominic was at a party . the night before he was taken ill. I don’t know whether the party was . at David’s house or somewhere else.’ Mr Hockney is widely regarded as . Britain’s greatest living artist. His exhibition last year at  the Royal . Academy of Arts in London attracted more than 500,000 visitors. Art gallery boss and painter Alan . Stuttle, 74, who attended the Royal College of Art in London with Mr .

Craftsman Stuart Hughes created a 24-carat gold smartphone with an Apple logo encrusted with 53 sparkling jewells. The phone is now worth £10million. This one of a kind solid gold, black diamond encrusted iPhone 5 is said to be the most expensive in the world . Mr Hughes, who develops 'exclusive, elite gadgets', was approached by a mysterious businessman from Hong Kong who he refers to as 'Joe'. The unidentified millionaire travelled to Liverpool to meet the niche designer with a rare 26 carat black diamond that forms the centrepiece. The hand-crafted iPhone 5 is encrusted with a jaw-dropping 600 white diamonds and the sapphire glass screen contains 135 grams of 24-carat gold. But without the black diamond the phone would be worth a meagre £150,000 . Mr Hughes said: 'The most difficult part of building the phone was the solid gold chassis. A normal iPhone 5 smartphone handset which retails at around £550 . 'At first we found that the 3G didn't work as well due to the amount of gold we added. But we soon perfected the processes which is why ""Joe"" approached us.' The 43 year-old is no stranger to crafting expensive phones. He has created a solid gold handset for Australian football team owner and gold magnate Tony Sage. The designer laughed: 'Luckily with Mr Sage we had absolutely no problem getting hold of gold as he's involved in the gold extraction business.' The black diamond iPhone 5 has beaten the previous record set by Mr Hughes in 2009 with a £1.92million iPhone 3GS Supreme.","The 24-carat gold smartphone is encrusted with 53 sparkling jewells .

Counter-terror teams are foiling a plot as big as the July 7 attacks every year, a senior police officer has revealed. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne also said the threats against the UK are constantly changing and Islamic extremists are now planning in smaller groups in a bid to avoid detection. He said: 'On average we've probably had about one potential attack planned with an intent to create something similar to July 7 every year. Armed police officers guarding buildings in Westminster. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne has said counter-terror teams regularly foil plots . 'The UK threat as we stand today remains at substantial, which means that a terrorist attack remains a strong possibility and could occur without warning.' This came as new figures revealed the number of terror arrests had risen by 60 per cent in the year to September 2012. A total of 245 people were held on . suspicion of terrorism-related offences in the period, compared with 153 . in the previous 12 months, the Home Office said. Mr Osborne, who is senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism, said extremists are returning from abroad wanting to mastermind plots in small groups. This follows the foiling of large scale plans such as the plot to blow up passenger jets with bombs disguised as soft drinks in 2006, and more recently a plan led by three men from Birmingham to set off up to eight ruck sack bombs in crowded areas. Mr Osborne said: 'Some who have been trained actually are becoming quite self-motivated, they are beginning to plan in small groups which are hard to detect,' he said.

'There is no doubt that the big sophisticated 9/11 or 7/7 type plots are much harder to organise, they did need a lot of overseas direction, and some of the al Qaida leadership have said that's good if you can do it, but if not any attack whatever you can do at whatever size is useful. 'We are seeing more small groups getting together at shorter notice and more people wanting to do things without that broader command and control.' Al Qaida remains the greatest terror threat to Britain, he said, and the most recent trend is for would-be jihadists to travel to Syria for training and to get involved in fighting. Domestically, there is also a concern that terrorists will learn 'criminal tradecraft', again making their activities harder to detect.","DAC Stuart Osborne said threats against UK are constantly changing .

A jilted lover murdered his former girlfriend by battering her with a rolling pin while their baby lay asleep in the house, a court heard. Adam Singer, 29, killed Sally Harrison, 24, because they had split and she planned to leave him and take the 21-month-old girl, it was said. The couple had broken up and were still living together and Miss Harrison was set to move out with their daughter, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Sally Harrison, 24, from Plymouth, Devon, was found dead at the home she shared with the father of her child Adam Singer . But Singer was so angry he took a rolling pin from his catering firm job and battered her to death at their home in Plymouth, Devon, on April 4, the court was told. He had already 'joked' to colleagues about murdering someone with a rolling pin - and killed her with a series of blows to the skull, the court heard. Singer, of Salisbury, Wiltshire, has pleaded not guilty to the murder but prosecutor Simon Laws described it as 'pre-meditated and brutal'. He said: 'On the 4th of April last year, this defendant killed a young woman called Sally Ann Harrison who he was in a relationship with. 'It was a pre-meditated and brutal murder. He attacked her in such a way that she would not survive. He used a commercial rolling pin that he had taken from his place of work. 'His motive was this - he and Sally were separating and he wanted their young daughter to live with him. He knew this was unlikely and he took the law into his own hands with fatal consequences.' The court was told Miss Harrison and Singer had split and she planned to leave him and take the 21-month-old girl . The court heard how the pair met in 2006 before moving into a flat together in Devonport, Devon, in May 2010. They had their child Isabella, also known as Izzy, in July 2010 and it is believed they split in February. Mr Laws said Singer had even 'joked' with friends about murdering Miss Harrison with colleagues where he worked, ESS catering firm at HMS Drake naval base in Plymouth. He added: 'Despite the relationship coming to an end, they continued to live together at the flat. But they both began to see other people - he had a new girlfriend and she had a new boyfriend. 'It then became clear that it could not go on and Sally was to move out, she intended to take Izzy with her. However, he wanted the child and took a very uncompromising view on the subject and spoke to his colleagues about it. 'At some point his mind turned to a disgusting and shocking solution, he was to bring the custody hearing to an end by killing Sally and on April 4 he did just that, battering her with an instrument at home.' Mr Laws told the court that Singer desperately attempted to fool the police by leaving the home after the murder and returning at around 3am to 'find' her dead. He said Singer had spoke to friends about killing Miss Harrison and also killing himself, although he told police he was joking. Mr Laws told the court of a conversation he had at work with colleague Keith Johnson. He said: 'In the galley with Keith Johnson, he was holding one of the four rolling pins and was waving it around. 'He caught Mr Johnson’s peak of his cap and it gave him a shock, he asked Mr Johnson if he thought it would kill someone, to which he replied that it would. 'He then asked how he might hit someone with it, to the top of the head or to the side, to which Mr Johnson replied that he did not know and walked away. 'The fact is, whoever killed Sally Harrison did so by striking her with blows with a rolling pin from HMS Drake and that person did so to the side and to the top of the head.' Mr Laws said that Singer first denied to police he had taken the rolling pin, before saying he did take it 'to do some baking' with Miss Harrison and their daughter. The jury were shown images of the scene of the crime and told that their daughter was in the home at the time of the murder, although slept through the ordeal. At Plymouth Crown Court, Singer, of Salisbury, Wiltshire, has pleaded not guilty to murder . It was also said that Singer told close friend Simon Gotham that he was 'stood at the end of her bed with the rolling pin in his hands but he didn’t have the balls'. The court heard that Mr Gotham did not take this seriously, and a day later, Miss Harrison was dead. Mr Laws described Miss Harrison, from Plymouth, Devon, as a well liked and popular young woman. He added that from the night of her killing two items were never recovered, the rolling pin and her mobile phone. The trial, which is expected to last three to four weeks, continues.

But in a stunt aimed at inspiring Chelsea supporters, kit makers Adidas want to show fans that the club's galaxy of stars really are true blue. The ‘It’s Blue, What Else Matters’ campaign sees players covered in blue liquid in a bid to get fans of the Stamford Bridge club to buy the new kit before they even see it. Scroll down for videos . Blue is the colour: Chelsea striker Fernando Torres shows his true colours as he takes part in an impressive launch stunt for the club's new Adidas home kit . Number 1: Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech even dipped his trademark head guard into the dye for the impressive launch campaign .

True blue: Chelsea and England defenders Gary Cahill, left, and John Terry, right, show their passion for their club colours at the shoot . The film and accompanying images, which feature some of the reigning European Champions' top stars including captain John Terry, Belgian midfielder Eden Hazard and striker Fernando Torres, are meant to show the lengths that the players will go to for their club. It is based on the idea that the club is not just a team but something much more emotive than that. An Adidas spokesman said: 'The campaign was created based on the insight that Chelsea can clearly own blue as a colour. 'Not only do they sing about it, but they are the only club in the English Premier League that call themselves The Blues. 'Seeing the players take part and show their commitment to the colour and the lengths that they will go to will inspire the fans and show the club as they have never been seen before.'

The players who took part spent more than two hours on set to create the campaign. And while being doused in blue paint is a bit of a contrast to the normal daily training routine, the shoot was a welcome change for the players involved. Brazilian defender David Luiz said: 'I have really enjoyed being part of this day, I would do anything for this club and to show my passion for being a Blue means everything to me.'

Emily Singleton's body was found dead in a trough between the tracks at Canal Street station hours after she had been out drinking with friends. Miss Singleton, a graduate from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, was in New York 'doing what she really wanted to do in life', according to her grandmother.

But when the unusual attire is removed, the figure below the suit is not a human but a specially designed robot capable of carrying out some unsettlingly lifelike moves. Known as PETMAN, this startling realistic robot has been created by Boston Dynamics to test out hazmat suits and a variety of military equipment. Scroll down for video . Lifelike: It's almost impossible to believe that there is not a human inside this suit - it is an ultra realistic robot .

Testing: The robot, created by Boston Dynamics, balances on its own and is able to complete a number of lifelike movements simulating bending, walking and running . The state-of-the-art robot is an anthropomorphic creation designed to simulate how a soldier stresses protective clothing under realistic conditions. Unlike previous suit testers that had a limited repertoire of motion and had to be supported mechanically, PETMAN can walk, bend and complete a variety of suit-stressing movements during exposure to chemical warfare agents. It may look like it is attached to the treadmill - but the wires coming from it are merely to supply power - PETMAN balances itself and moves all on its own. It also simulates human physiology within the protective suit by controlling temperature, humidity and sweating, all to provide realistic test conditions. Let's dance: More akin to the terminator than your average member of staff, PETMAN can simulate human physiology inside military clothing . Amazing: The company announced the production of the robot in 2008 but many doubted that such realistic humanoid technology could be created . The company already wowed the world three years earlier when it produced its quadraped BigDog robot for the US military. Billed as ‘the most advanced quadruped robot on Earth’, BigDog was devised to support American troops by carrying up to four packs of equipment on awkward terrain unsuitable for wheeled vehicles. It announced the PETMAN project back in 2008 but many doubted that such realistic humanoid technology could be achieved. The startlinglingly realistic robot is now at a testing facility where it is being put through its paces. The next step is to put the robot into an exposure temperature where it will be tested against the likes of sarin and mustard gas.

When you're partnered with the President, being constantly followed by cameras and reporters becomes a part of every day life. But when he has been in office less than a year, the press attention might still come as something of an unwanted novelty. French President Francois Hollande's long-term partner Valérie Trierweiler was caught on camera losing her composure with a cameraman while on a walkabout on Saturday. Tense: Valérie Trierweiler (right) is pictured on a walkabout of Tulle in the Corrèze area of the Limousin area of central France with her partner Francois Hollande on Saturday . Drastic action: In the press melee that accompanied the President and his girlfriend, Ms Trierweiler was seen grabbing hold of a cameraman's hood . A clip, shown on Canal Plus programme Petit Journal, shows Mr Hollande and the first lady on a walkabout tour of Tulle in the Corrèze area of the Limousin area of central France. The footage shows the pair surrounded by camera men and reporters and Mr Hollande is shown on at least one occasion telling the group to calm down. But as Mr Hollande stops to speak to reporters, an increasingly agitated Ms Trierweiler becomes separated from the President who is by now surrounded by the press pack. Standing behind one television cameraman and unable to get by, Ms Trierweiler decides that rather than leave the situation to the pair's team of minders she will take matters into her own hands. The footage shows Ms Trierweiler grab hold of the cameraman's hood and pull him back as hard as she possibly can. Move it: She uses the cameraman's hood to pull him out of the way and get past the press pack . The cameraman soon moves out of the way and 48-year-old Ms Trierweiler is back at her husband's side. After the footage was aired on french television on Monday night, Patrice Biancone, Ms Trierweiler's chief of staff, took to Twitter to defend her actions. He claimed that Ms Trierweiler had been 'shaken' by the group of cameramen several times and that she hadn't been treated with 'courtesy'. Mr Hollande's presidency has been somewhat blighted by the massive unpopularity of his girlfriend Ms Trierweiler, who has been accused in some quarters of abandoning her socialist principles for a life of 'luxury and frivolity'.

Jailed: Bogus charity collector Thomas Richards was jailed for a year after spending £2,000 collected for Help for Heroes instead of donating it to the organisation . A bogus charity collector who stole £2,000 of donations meant for injured soldiers and spent it on a drinking and gambling spree has been jailed for 12 months. Thomas Richards signed up as a street collector for the Help for Heroes charity and collected from donors in Oxford town centre for two months. But instead of passing the money onto the charity, Richards spent the cash himself, using some of it to fund nights at a luxury four star hotel. He was only caught when a police officer who was aware of Richards's criminal past saw him with a donation tin and became suspicious. Judge Mary Jane Mowat said that the 27-year-old, who had 45 previous convictions, should never have been allowed to collect for Help for Heroes and questioned the charity's 'ramshackle' process for vetting volunteers. She said: 'The truth of the matter is that you have been a life-long offender, somebody who should never have been let loose with a collection tin.' Although the judge did criticise the process of recruiting volunteers, with more than 400 people signing up to help the charity every week she conceded that she understood why proper vetting was not possible. Oxford Crown Court heard that Richards signed up as a street collector in January 2011. He even raised money for a charity bike ride from Cape Wrath in Scotland to Land's End, a task described by the judge as 'fanciful' and spent more than £1,000 on a new bicycle and accessories. He is also said to have lied to a member of the public that he was on compassionate leave from the Army after serving in 'the Far East'. He was caught out when Police constable Steven Higa saw him collecting in Cornmarket Street, Oxford and became suspicious because he knew his record. PC Higa said: 'The vast majority of the collectors are trustworthy and pass the money on, it is just a very small minority who take advantage of the goodwill and generosity of the public. Criticism: Judge Mary Jane Mowat questioned the process for vetting volunteers who sign up to collect funds for Help for Heroes at Oxford Crown Court, pictured . Richard Lister, defending, said Richards was not 'somebody who thinks through the consequences of his actions' and was now disgusted with what he had done. Speaking after the sentence Corporal Tom Neathway, who lost both legs and an arm in a Taliban bomb blast, said: 'It is totally disrespectful. Help for Heroes was set up to help wounded soldiers. 'He has not shown respect for us, fighting for our country.' Help for Heroes spokesman David Fraser added: 'It is unforgivable that someone might attempt to gain personally from donations given generously by the public to support the wounded. 'Anyone authorised by Help for Heroes to do a street collection must carry their fundraising certificate and each collection is followed up by our dedicated team. Supportive: Richards registered to collect funds for the charity which helps injured soldiers in January 2011 . 'Our rigorous processes ensure that if someone attempts to defraud that charity, we catch them, report them to the police and push for prosecution. 'This one incident undermines the thousands of generous and committed fundraisers across the UK.' Help for Heroes was launched in 2007 to raise money for British servicemen and women wounded in the line of duty. It tries to pay for better facilities and support services to help those injured and their families, as well as supporting other charities.","Thomas Richards was jailed for 12 months at Oxford Crown Court .

The 43-year-old woman from Madison, Winsconsin, admitted one count of first degree reckless endangering safety and one count of causing mental harm to a child at the beginning of her trial in Dane County. As part of a deal with prosecutors, four other charges against the unidentified woman, who faces up to 25 years in jail, were dropped but read into the record. Guilty plea: A 43-year-old woman from Madison, Wisconsin (pictured) is accused of abusing her teenage step-daughter (file picture) Her victim, a 15-year-old girl, was found barefoot and thinly clothed by a neighbour after running away from home in February last year. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the girl suffered years of abuse at the hands of her stepmother, father and stepbrother. Criminal charges filed allege that the girl was beaten, starved and sexually abused. She was allegedly also forced to eat her own excrement. Officials at various agencies had reportedly missed several opportunities to rescue the girl from her plight. Accused: The woman struck a deal with prosecutors at the start of her trial at Dane County Courthouse, pictured . A passing motorist had called police in January 2011 after trying to talk to the girl who seemed fragile and whose bare feet were purple. But when police called at the girl's home no one answered and officers left. In 2007 allegations were made that the girl had been molested, but those allegations were not corroborated by the girl herself. According to records obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, police visited the girl's home 10 times in total.But most of the reports that brought them to the family home centered on the girl's stepbrother. After she ran away in 2012, she was examined by specialist doctors who said that the girl had been subjected to 'serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation.' Her father was found guilty of felony child neglect last month, but no verdict was reached on four other charges.

A judge has said he will take 30 days to decide whether the rights to Casey Anthony's life story can be sold by her trustee to pay off debt as part of her bankruptcy proceedings. Miss Anthony, who was acquitted almost two years ago of killing her daughter Caylee, filed for bankruptcy in January and appeared in court last month, claiming that she has debts of almost $800,000. Tampa-based bankruptcy trustee Stephen Meininger wants to sell off the rights to Miss Anthony's story claiming that it is her best bet for paying back the estimated $792,000 she owes. Delayed decision: A judge will take 30 days to decide whether Casey Anthony's bankruptcy trustee can sell her story to pay off some of her debts . Most of Miss Anthony's debts are owed to her defence lawyers, with the original bankruptcy petition claiming that she owns a little over $1,000 in assets. But Miss Anthony does not want to sell her story and her attorneys strongly disagree with Mr Meininger's proposed unprecedented legal move. Judge K. Rodney May will announce his decision whether to allow the worldwide exclusive rights to her life story to be auctioned off to the highest bidder in 30 days, but admits that he is 'sceptical' about the controversial proposal. One bidder, a Texan attorney named James Schober, has reportedly put in an offer of $10,000 dollars on the condition that Anthony's story never sees the light of day and that she makes no profit from it. Mr Meininger says that one other offer has been tabled so far for $12,000 from a New York man who intends to use the story for 'entertainment value'. Others are said to have expressed an interest. Offers: Miss Anthony's bankruptcy trustee claims that two bids have already been tabled for her story with others expressing an interest . Lifestyle: Since Anthony's release from the Orange County Jail in July of 2011, seen here, she says she's been living with friends and with the help of gifts from strangers . Miss Anthony's lawyers have described the proposal to sell off something that only exists in their client's memory as 'Orwellian'. According to NBCNews.com, their filing argues: 'By allowing property that can only be created by post-petition labor to be sold as part of the bankruptcy estate, a debtor would never be able to achieve a ""fresh start"". 'Perhaps more troubling, the Order sought by the Trustee would result in the judicial invasion and taking of thoughts and memories that have not been memorialized but are contained solely within the debtor’s mind.' Notorious: Anthony became nationally notorious after she was accused of murdering Caylee, whose body was found six months after she went missing in June 2008. The pair are pictured together here . Their case also argues that a ruling in favour of the sale could damage Miss Anthony's personal relationships as she would be unable to even discuss her memories with family members over email or any 'social media' under the terms of Mr Schober's offer. Her listed debts include $500,000 for attorney fees and costs for her criminal defense lawyer during the trial, Jose Baez; $145,660 for the Orange County Sheriff's office for a judgment covering investigative fees and costs related to the case; $68,540 for the Internal Revenue Service for back taxes, interest and penalties; and $61,505 for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for court costs. Anthony became nationally notorious after she was accused of murdering Caylee, whose body was found six months after she went missing in June 2008. Suspicion fell on the girl's mother because she did not report her daughter missing for a month and was seen at the time partying. She was arrested and put on trial for Caylee's murder, but in July 2011 was acquitted of the killing. A new hearing will be heard in 30 days.

Leaked documents detailing that a wealthy property developer embroiled in a bitter divorce battle apparently transferred millions of pounds to an offshore bank account have been revealed. A leak of bank records from the British Virgin Islands reportedly show that Scot Young, who was jailed in January for failing to disclose to his estranged wife where his vast wealth had gone, transferred large sums to six companies on the Caribbean island. According to the Evening Standard, the documents show that transactions were made to move the money to another tax haven island. Bitter battle: Scot Young, pictured (left) with his fashion designer girlfriend Noelle Reno, is embroiled in a High Court divorce case with estranged wife Michelle, right. The funds are said to include around £65million meant for a Moscow property development. The tycoon had claimed that he had lost his vast wealth - estimated at around £400million at one stage - after the Moscow development did not come off. But the leak will raise question marks over that claim when a High Court divorce battle with estranged wife Michelle resumes later this year. Mrs Young has claimed that her estranged husband's failure to pay court ordered maintenance of £27,500 a month has left her broke. Meanwhile, the 48-year-old also claims that her former husband has £2billion in assets stashed overseas and continued to live a lifestyle of 'considerable wealth' despite apparently having been left penniless. But Mr Young, whose girlfriend is fashion designer Noelle Reno, 29, was jailed for six months after he failed to provide proof to the High Court that his wealth had diminished. Tax haven: The Marina at Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. Scot Young is alleged to have transferred some of his wealth to six different companies on the Caribbean island . Mrs Young told the Evening Standard after today's revelations: 'This is proof, if it were even needed, that he has no respect for the law whatsoever, this is the proof he has been lying all along. 'People like Scot, people with wealth and power, believe that the rules do not apply to them.' Information disclosed by the Guardian and US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists details the financial dealings of a number of high profile businessmen and politicians.

With patience and painstaking precision French artist Jeremy Laffon built the complex geometrical structure, which stood at  almost two metres and was nearly three metres long. The sticks were stacked, piled and assembled with care, but Laffon deliberately melted a few so that the towers would eventually fall down. Minty metropolis: The chewing gum sculpture took almost three months to build . Art in progress: French artist Jeremy Laffon from Marseilles undertook the painstaking work, inspired by house of cards constructions, as something to entertain his art class . Laffon, from Marseilles, explained that he wanted the towers to begin disintegrating, despite all his months of hard work. 'It represents a sculpture of frustration and that's why I chose to knock it down by melting a few crucial pieces. 'After melting a few sticks, the work fell down and collapsed slowly.' The 34-year-old said that it started as a way to interest his art class: 'I was invited to teach a room full of art students and I had to find something that would occupy so many people. 'I was inspired by the system of matchitecture, where thousands of matches are used to create a sculpture. 'I've always been fascinated by the . construction of a house of cards and decided to create a sculpture with a . material that hasn't been used before.' Spectacular sculpture: The chewing gum artwork started off held together by saliva, but eventually needed glue to help it stay upright . As a contemporary artist, Laffon was looking for an original material that would prove to be challenging to work with. He added: 'I wanted to use something that was challenging and the characteristics of chewing gum seemed perfect. 'Chewing gum is unstable and I thought that it would be tough to create a huge sculpture out of this material.' The scaffolding-like structures were made into fragile twisting towers and Laffon artist had to adapt his methods to make sure the sculpture could start off properly upright. He said: 'I tried to complete the design by just using saliva, but . that wasn't strong enough, so I had to use glue to make it secure.' Inspiration: Laffon used the principle of geometrical stacking as his starting point . All in the detail: The chewing gum sticks were delicately balanced and stacked to make the structure strong enough to stand up . Elaborate: The complex work of art stood at almost two metres and nearly three metres long . 'Then, the sculpture was constructed much like a house of cards.' The sculptures had a strong resemblance to a city skyline - but Laffon did not have a particular place in mind. He added: 'Inevitably, the sculpture makes people think of a city because of the geometrical construction.' Laffon bought the gum from a French supermarket, before Cadbury France stepped in to supply him with the rest. Falling down: Jeremy melted a few chewing gum pieces so that the city skyline would gradually crumble to the ground . Deliberate disintegration: Laffon wanted the skyline to collapse slowly . The end: The city towers ended up totally disintegrating, replicating a town that had turned to rubble .","Chewing gum sculpture took almost three months to build and 4,000 sticks of gum .

Defence: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has attacked Labour for trying to 'pull the wool over people's eyes' about sweeping tax changes that came into effect today . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has attacked Labour for trying to 'pull the wool over people's eyes' about sweeping tax changes that came into effect today. As the new financial year began, Labour launched a campaign highlighting the impact of reforms, which includes a cut in the top rate of income tax, launching a poster with the tagline 'Who Wants to Bung a Millionaire? Dave Does'. Labour said that 'millions are paying more while millionaires pay less' and claimed a one earner family with children will be £4,000 worse off on average in the next 12 months as a result of changes introduced since the coalition took power. Reducing the 50p top rate of tax to 45p will save 13,000 people with an income of more than £1 million an average of £100,000, it added. But Mr Clegg insisted ministers had fixed a 'gross unfairness' in the system left by the previous government that allowed the rich to pay less tax than the poor. In a letter he told Lib Dem supporters: 'Of course, the new 45p upper tax rate - down from 50p - is also coming into effect. 'But don't let Labour pull the wool over people's eyes. They may complain now, but of the 13 years they were in power, the 50p rate was in place for just 36 days. 'In fact, for most of the time their top tax rate was 40p. Not 50p. Not 45p. But 40p - 5p less than now. 'And under Labour a cleaner would pay a higher rate of tax on their wages than a hedge fund manager selling their shares - a gross unfairness we have fixed.' Among a raft of changes that came in today is the largest rise in the personal allowance, which means that no one pays any tax until they earn more than £9,440. Prime Minister David Cameron took to Twitter to highlight change. He wrote: 'From today 24 million people will be paying £600 less income tax than in 2010.' But shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the personal allowance increase was effectively swept away by the coalition's other benefit and tax reforms. Attack: Labour's poster hitting out at the coalition financial reforms . 'Families with children are being hit hardest of all,' he said. 'For example, a one earner family with children will be a staggering £4,000 worse off on average this year because of tax and benefit changes since 2010. 'And this is on top of the income squeeze we have seen over the last three years as a flatlining economy has seen prices rise faster than wages. 'These figures show the full picture David Cameron and George Osborne do not want you to see. 'They reveal that any gains ministers boast about from the rise in the personal allowance are swamped by higher VAT, cuts to tax credits and child benefit. 'People in work, people looking for work, stay at home mums and pensioners hit by the granny tax are all being squeezed like never before. Millions are paying more while millionaires pay less.' Criticism: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is pictured unveiling Labour's poster campaign today . Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said: 'Millionaires will be raising a glass of champagne to George Osborne this weekend as he slashes the incomes of people struggling to get by to give handouts to the rich. 'But ordinary people - taxpayers - will be furious that George Osborne has chosen to give away £1 billion to the super-rich while their fuel and food costs rise and wages are falling.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Cutting taxes for the richest in our society is a huge slap in the face for the millions of hard-working families struggling to make ends meet. 'This move, which will lead to the loss of vital revenues, comes at a time when low-income households are seeing a huge range of vital benefits and tax credits mercilessly cut back. 'It says a lot about this government's priorities that it is forever coming up with new ways to take money away from those at the bottom, whilst handing out tax breaks to those at the top.'","Labour launched a campaign hitting out at financial reforms .

But police had to rescue a man after concerned motorists spotted him travelling along the 70mph A27 and A23 near Brighton, Sussex, on his 8mph scooter. The 62-year-old is thought to have travelled at least five miles on the battery-powered machine before he was found by police slowly heading north on the main carriageway of the A23 towards Gatwick Airport with the scooter battery almost dead. Officers reached him just before 11am today as he was trying to get across the carriageway with traffic speeding towards him. Police said that the man was cold and very distressed but physically unhurt. They gave him a lift back to the Brighton hotel he is staying at.

Mr Cameron has said there were 'some pretty odd people' when asked about his previous comments of UKIP supporters . David Cameron renewed his attack on UKIP yesterday, saying it contains some ‘pretty odd people’. He spoke as a poll suggested that the anti-Brussels party is enjoying record support, at 16 per cent, taking third place from the Lib Dems. A Survation survey for the Mail on Sunday put Labour on 38 per cent, the Tories on 29, UKIP on 16 and the Lib Dems on 11. Translated into votes at the  next General Election, that would cost the Conservatives 51 seats and present Labour with a thumping victory and an overall majority of 94. There is an increasing expectation that UKIP will beat the Conservatives in next year’s European elections, having come second last time. Asked yesterday on the BBC about his previous description of UKIP supporters as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’, Mr Cameron said: ‘There are some pretty odd people.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Prime Minister’s remarks meant there was no chance of any electoral pact between his party and the Conservatives. This was suggested by Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant, who said the Tories should offer an in/out referendum on UK membership of the EU if UKIP promises not to stand against Tory candidates in 2015. The idea was rejected by Tory high command. Yesterday Mr Farage, who has seen his party’s support soar from 3 per cent in 2010, said he would not worry about Mr Cameron’s remarks. ‘If he wants to go on being rude about me and rude about UKIP, well let him do it. We won’t lose any sleep over it,’ Mr Farage said. ‘I don’t think there is any prospect of any deal with the Conservative Party all the while that man leads it, given the way he has behaved and his attitude towards us. ‘Look, I would do a deal with the devil if it got us what we need, which is a free and fair referendum so that we in this country can decide who governs us.’ Conservative MP Stewart Jackson also criticised the Prime Minister’s attack on UKIP. ‘Cameron should rise above being rude about people whose votes he’ll need to get an overall majority, but he can’t help himself,’ he said. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, left, has said he won't be losing any sleep over Mr Cameron's remarks, while Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps, right, has said the party's rise in polls was a mid-term protest . ‘He will win back Conservatives flirting with UKIP if he respects their views and articulates an authentic Conservative message.’ Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party chairman, suggested UKIP’s rise in the opinion polls was a mid-term protest that would normally have boosted the Lib Dems. ‘We’re mid-Parliament: people often during mid-Parliament look to protest somewhere,’ he said. ‘In the past that’s been to the Liberal Democrats – they’re in government of course now – but I think that come the  next election, another two to two-and-a-half years’ time, people will be able to have a look at the full track record, which will include having dealt with a large amount of the  deficit, some of the really big issues that are facing this country; some of the really difficult decisions we’ve had to make to get this country back on track. ‘One thing I know about UKIP supporters is it’s not just Europe that will concern them, and that’s why you have to have a very full range of policies in order to attract people. ‘Realistically, UKIP don’t have any Members of Parliament, and we’re going to set out our programme based on what we’d like to do.’ Anthony Wells, of the UK Polling Report, said telephone polls were currently averaging around 7 per cent for UKIP, while online polls put them on an average of 11 per cent.","Prime Minister made comment as poll suggests UKIP seeing record support .

"By . Samantha Brick . PUBLISHED: . 03:19 EST, 19 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:14 EST, 19 October 2012 . Earlier this week – an unsociable Sunday evening as it happens - I agreed to a request I'd received to be interviewed by an Australian radio show, The Kyle And Jackie O Show. Its producers were doggedly persistent in pursuing me for over a month, insisting that their hosts were dying to have me on their show. I'm currently finishing my first book and as a result refusing all media requests. Nonetheless the producers' persistence paid off and I agreed to talk to the show hosts on Wednesday morning (Australian time). Scroll down to listen... When Samantha Brick, left, and former Spice Girl Mel B, right, both appeared on Australia's Kyle And Jackie O show, it was not quite the meeting of minds Brick had hoped for . The time difference meant that I stayed up until 11.30pm Tuesday evening in order for the interview to be conducted live on their Sydney-based show. No one told me that former Spice Girl and Australian X Factor judge Mel B would also be part of the interview. I, like most British women, have always been a massive Spice Girls fan – naively assuming they were pro-women. All I can say about my encounter with Mel B is this: so much for Girl Power. On hearing I was about to join her on the show, she immediately snapped: 'Have you seen her though? She's not as attractive as she thinks she is.' On learning she'd be talking to me live, she immediately halted what I can only assume was the start of a negative diatribe - aimed squarely at me. 'On learning my husband and I maintain a healthy weight by getting on the scales each week, Mel declared my marriage was crap' Throughout the interview, I had difficulty hearing the host - Jackie O. When I later listened to the show on the internet, I found her comments to be genuine, warm and friendly, which is more than can be said for twice-married mum of three Mel. It's only on the playback that I've realised what the viewers heard. Astonishingly the former Spice Girl couldn't get past the fact that she thought I assumed I was beautiful. Never one to back down, Mel - whose three daughters each have different fathers -  repeatedly asked me if this was genuinely the case. Or, demonstrating that she considered me wholly unattractive, whether I'd said it just to cause a stir. Despite plugging her Jenny Craig contract and, I'd imagine, promoting her judging role on X Factor, she incredulously asked why I had appeared on Channel Five's recent Celebrity Big Brother series. Now that I've listened to her patronising posturing I can respond to her directly: the same reasons as you take part in the shows you appear on Mel, to pay the bills. Fortunately, Australian listeners rallied round, taking Mel to task and criticising her for repeatedly asking me if I was beautiful. Two out of the three callers whose views were broadcast live on air were 100 per cent on my side – which is more than can be said for Mel. For it's fair to say that Mel didn’t take a shine to me – and things only got worse between us. On learning that my husband and I maintain a healthy weight by both getting on the scales each week, Mel declared that my marriage was 'crap'. Her microphone was turned up, ensuring her views took centre stage, and her venom spewed forth all over me. I was flabbergasted by her vitriolic . response. Weight however, is clearly a sensitive issue for Mel. According to a report in The Sun this week, she has also slapped Simon . Cowell for labelling her fat. It is fair to say that Mel didn’t take a shine to Samantha from the start of the conversation live on air ... and things only got worse . I'd . like to think I had the last laugh, for however confident Mel is about . 'for better or for worse' and her husband loving her for her curves, . later on that day she was photographed ‘'unawares' with her personal . trainer. I had always . assumed that a female role model with her global profile - and a . straight-talking working class girl, just like me – would be the first . to applaud me. Sadly Melanie Brown is far from the Girl Power role model I thought she was. LISTEN HERE!

The international Sand Sculpture Festival starts on Monday and has turned the Black Rock site in Brighton into a sand village of the world's biggest music stars.

Fake vicar: George Gordon arriving at Liverpool Crown Court today to face charges of fraud and deception after being on the run for three years . A professional conman who tricked charities out of over £90,000 by masquerading as a vicar was jailed for five years today. George Christopher Gordon, 52,  fraudulently applied for £90,000 worth of grants from the Merseyside Disability Foundation (MDF) by falsely representing existing community groups and inventing others. Gordon also conned several other charities into paying him for projects such as outreach work, support groups and training social workers, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The 'Reverend' George Gordon, who ordered his clerical title from an American website, admitted nine counts of . obtaining money by deception and 11 counts of fraud. Gordon went on the run for three years . after his lies were uncovered in 2008, but he was tracked down in Durham . after a nationwide appeal. The professional con artist, who in . 1999 was jailed for four years for a £21,000 fraud, was so highly respected as a vicar that he became a member of an MDF funding panel, eventually taking decisions on his own fraudulent applications. He gained the trust of volunteers at the MDF by falsely claiming he had cancer . and manic depression. He then successfully applied repeatedly for their maximum grant of £5,000, which he deposited in his personal bank account. He used part of the stolen money to buy himself a flat in Chancellor Court, Toxteth, Liverpool. As part of his audacious scam, Gordon also siphoned European grant funding when he was working for the MDF between February 2005 and October 2007. Gordon showed no emotion today as the judge sentenced him to five years in prison. Passing sentence, Judge Stephen Everett said: 'You pleaded guilty to a callous set of offences of dishonesty, the audacity of which takes a person’s breath away.' 'You used that veneer of respectability to dupe a number of honest, decent and vulnerable persons to achieve your dishonest aims.' Prosecuting lawyer, Rowena Goode told the court that a police officer had sent off for the same 'ordination' certificate as Gordon. 'To investigate this matter the arresting officer applied himself and so is now, also, a ‘reverend’,' she said, showing how easily the fraud had taken place. Unrepentant: George Gordon, who was sentenced to 5 years jail, showed no emotion in court as the Judge called him 'cold-hearted' and 'cunning' Listing his many elaborate offences, Goode told the court Gordon set up an organisation called the Somewhere Else Mental Health Project. Jailed: George Gordon was told by the judge: 'You pleaded guilty to a callous set of offences, the audacity of which takes a person¿s breath away' In October 2004 the project obtained £5,000 to 'train social workers'. Then in December 2005, the same group was awarded a further £5,000 to 'teach individuals how to use computers and give an introduction to word processing'. This was just one of a number of fronts for Gordon's deception. He also involved himself in a legitimate organisation, the Manic Depression Fellowship, where he portrayed himself as a Reverend and a graduate of Cambridge and Lampeter Universities. Using this organisation, Gordon set up the Liverpool University Self Help Group, and obtained £4,800 to purchase a laptop and fund cognitive behaviour therapy. Gordon helped to set up the Blue Skies Project, which claimed to help people with depression and which was also awarded £5,000, and the Surviving Suicide Merseyside Group which received £10,000 from the MDF. The exposure of his elaborate scam . forced the Bi-Polar Organisation’s Merseyside branch to close down after . his criminal activities came to light. Goode said: 'The sadness of this case is that most of the people who were duped were themselves suffering from genuine mental health problems.' He also conned the bi-polar Karonga Garden Project, the Borderline Personality Disorder, Liverpool University Disability Fellowship and Adlam Accessible Allotments. Detective Sergeant Richie Jones from . Sefton CID said: 'George Gordon is a selfish and cunning man who . defrauded charities created to help some of the most vulnerable people . in our communities.' The judge told Gordon, who sat throughout the hearing with a fixed smile, that he was 'cold-hearted' and 'cunning'. He said: 'You have no idea what it is like to be part of a group or loving family because you don’t care about anybody but yourself.'","Conman posed as a priest using an 'ordination' certificate from the internet .

A social worker who lied that six of her relatives had died in two years to get paid time off has been struck off. Rachael Miles claimed that her father, mother, aunt, uncle, brother and ex-husband had all died while working at Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council, getting her 66 days off work. The Health and Care Professions Council heard that just two weeks after starting in February 2010 Miles claimed that her father had been involved in a car accident, and she went home. Faking it: Rachael Miles pretended to be bereaved six times to get off work, including the 'deaths' of her aunt and uncle a week apart and her ex-husband's 'suicide' (file photo) A few days later she reported he had died, getting her a week’s compassionate leave. Then she told the council that her mother had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act to get the day off. She then had two days' leave when she said her mother had attempted to harm herself, followed by 10 days when she lied that her mother had died during surgery. Then in February 2011 she received five days for the 'death' of her brother. A few months later in May she feigned a telephone call at work telling her that ex-husband had hanged himself and claimed that she was asked to identify the body. In November 15 she was given six days in lieu because her uncle had apparently died, and a week later her aunt also died. Duped: Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council granted Rachael Miles 66 days of leave for the six deaths . By August 2012 a disciplinary hearing decided she should move to a suitable alternative position, but she resigned instead. She did not attend today's hearing but she wrote in to say that she has no recollection of telling the council about her six bereavements. The hearing found that she had provided 'misleading information' for a number of absences and that she retained her payments for compassionate leave. Panel chairman Alexander Yule said that she had shown 'little remorse'. He said her fraud was particularly damaging because as a social worker she was supposed to be helping 'vulnerable individuals'.","Worker said parents, aunt, uncle, brother and ex-husband had all died .

The video was uploaded by YouTube user ‘Crazybreakingnews’, who commented: ‘It looks a little bit strange and not really similar to the other videos.

In a moving ceremony in the East Room of the White House, the president awarded the nation’s highest military award to a nephew of Capt. Emil Kapaun, who died in captivity more than 60 years ago, saying that the Kansas native was ‘an American soldier who didn’t fire a gun, but who (carried) the mightiest weapon of all: the love for his brothers so powerful that he was willing to die so that they might live.’ The Roman Catholic priest, who even in a North Korean POW camp cut up his blanket to make socks for his fellow prisoners, died in captivity in 1951 at the age of 35 at the prison camp in Pyoktong, near the Chinese border.

Remembering the fallen: President Obama on Thursday awards the Medal of Honor posthumously to Ray Kapaun, the nephew of U.S. Army Chaplain Emil Kapaun, for heroism during the Korean War .

In the throes of war: Father Emil Kapaun, left, seen helping a wounded soldier; he served both in the Korean War and World War II . He had been a prisoner for six months. According to the Washington Free Beacon, three or four prisoners would die every night at the prison camp. The unfortunate prisoners of Pyoktong were fed less than 500 grams of millet each day. Honored: The Roman Catholic Army chaplain died in captivity at a North Korean POW camp in 1951 at the age of 35 . The fallen hero was recognized for helping to carry an injured American for miles as Chinese captors led them on a death march, and for risking his life to drag the wounded to safety while dodging explosions and gunfire. In November 1950, after Chinese soldiers overran U.S. troops near Unsan, Kapaun defied orders to evacuate, knowing it meant he would most certainly be captured. He pleaded with an injured Chinese officer to call out to his fellow Chinese to stop shooting, an act that spared the lives of wounded Americans. As Kapaun was being led away, he came across another wounded American in a ditch and an enemy soldier standing over Sgt. Herbert Miller, ready to shoot. Kapaun pushed the enemy aside and helped Miller as they were taken captive. They arrived days later, by foot, at the village in Pyoktong, where a POW camp eventually was established. 'I can't imagine a better example for all of us, whether in uniform or not in uniform, a better example to follow,' Mr Obama said after presenting the award to Capt. Kapaun’s nephew, Ray Kapaun, adding that they were marking the Roman Catholic priest’s valor. At the camp, Kapaun cleaned others' wounds, convinced them to share scarce food, offered them his own clothes and provided spiritual aid and comfort. On Easter in 1951, he defied his communist captors by conducting Mass with a makeshift crucifix.

Heroism: 'I can't imagine a better example for all of us, whether in uniform or not in uniform, a better example to follow,' Mr Obama said . Presentation: The ceremony took place in the East Room of the White House . The president said Kapaun showed that a touch of the divine exists even in hellish situations. 'Father Kapaun's life, I think, is a testimony to the human spirit, the power of faith, and reminds us of the good that we can do each and every day regardless of the most difficult of circumstances,' Mr Obama said. The chaplain's nephew, Ray Kapaun accepted the medal from Mr Obama on his uncle's behalf. Emil Kapaun's parents and his only sibling, a brother, are deceased.

A woman who has battled three types of cancer since the age of 11 has shared a topless picture of herself on Facebook, bravely revealing the tattoo she had inked on her chest following a double mastectomy. After having her breasts removed to treat her cancer, Kelly Davidson, 34, decided reconstructive surgery was not for her, opting instead to get a fairy tale-inspired tattoo on her chest. 'It's my badge of honor and strength,' the Ontario, Canada resident explained to the Toronto Star. 'It reminds me every day of the battles that I've overcome. I've won this war and hopefully I've beat it completely.' Showing her ink: 34-year-old Kelly Davidson, who has defeated three types of cancer since age 11, proudly bares her chest to reveal the tattoo she got following a double mastectomy . Inspirational snap: The photo she posted on Why We Ink's Facebook page (pictured) has already received over 700,000 'likes' and has been shared more than 95,000 times . Now Ms Davidson's photo - which was . posted on Why We Ink's Facebook page on April 4 - has received over 700,000 'likes', and her story has . become an inspiration to other cancer sufferers and survivors. Ms Davidson was forced to undergo a double mastectomy when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 28. She defeated the disease, but the surgical removal of her breasts was nonetheless traumatic. 'Obviously it's devastating for anyone to lose their breasts, because it defines us as feminine and female,' she told the Ottowa Sun as she posed for a photo shoot for the website. 'But for me, I embraced it.' Rather than undergoing reconstructive surgery, she decided to accept her new body and proudly commemorate her battle by getting a tattoo where . her breasts used to be. 'The tattoo represents a metamorphosis, kind of like my new body' 'It represents how I kicked cancer's ass, and how breasts don't define who I am as a person or a woman,' she wrote below her picture. . The tattoo depicts a fairy in front of a flowing waterfall, with butterflies fluttering in the background. Ms Davidson explained the symbolism it holds for her: 'The fairy to some degree depicts me, . and the butterflies that are flying away are representing the cancer . that has left my body,' she said. 'It's a metamorphosis, like a . transformation, kind of like my new body,' she added. Embracing it: Rather than having reconstructive surgery, she decided to commemorate her triumph over the disease by getting a tattoo where her breasts used to be .

Fearless: By posing topless, Ms Davidson sent a message of confidence to other women who have had mastectomies. 'I'm still me, I'm still beautiful,' she told the Ottowa Sun. 'I don't need breasts to feel that way' But breast cancer isn't the only obstacle Ms Davidson has had to overcome in her life. At the age of 11, she was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma, which she subsequently conquered. And in 2011, she had her thyroid removed after discovering she had papillary thyroid cancer. 'I'm still me, I'm still beautiful. I don't need breasts to feel that way or to portray that to other people' Despite all her suffering, the optimistic survivor refuses to let it get her down. 'I'm still me, I'm still beautiful,' she said. 'I don't need breasts to feel that way or to portray that to other people.' To help others in her same situation, Ms Davidson worked at a mastectomy boutique for years, where she offered advice to other women, helping them them adjust to their new bodies and fitting them with prosthetic breasts. Overcoming obstacles: The 34-year-old has defeated three cancers in her life - Hodgkins lymphoma at age 11, breast cancer at 28, and papillary thyroid cancer in 2011 . Optimistic: Despite her suffering, she tries to remain positive. 'I'm living and loving life,' she told the Toronto Star. 'I'm not going to let cancer get me down' She and her fiance Doug Strudwick are . now looking forward to their wedding this summer, and even in hard times . they try to concentrate on the positive. 'I'm living and loving life. I'm not going to let cancer get me down' 'I'm living and loving life. I’m not going to let cancer get me down,' she told the Toronto Star, adding: 'If it does come back, I'm just going to keep beating it like I have before.' Why We Ink, which has garnered over 9,000 'likes', was created for those with memorial or survivor tattoos for cancer to share their body art with others. Kelly Davidson is just one of the thousands who have turned to social media as an outlet for dealing with the illness. 'It's like a family,' she said of the cancer community. 'It's a club just for us.'","Kelly Davidson of Ontario, Canada, told the Ottowa Sun: 'I'm still me, I'm still beautiful. I don't need breasts to feel that way'

A billboard celebrating the ‘remarkable women’ at a Canadian university appeared to forget one crucial element – pictures of the women in question that they were celebrating. The advert is part of a larger campaign at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and shows three men in suits and ties standing below text that reads: ‘We celebrate remarkable women on the Riva Spatz Women’s Wall of Honour. Join us.’ The commercial was intended to raise awareness of the Wall of Honor, but many are saying that it completely missed its mark, not only for its questionable design but because of its content. A man's world: This billboard in downtown Halifax advertises the 'remarkable women' of Mount Saint Vincent University's Riva Spatz Women's Wall of Honour - but pictures three men . Kelly Gallant, the university’s associate vice-president of communications and marketing, told MailOnline on Thursday that no offense was meant. 'Up to this point, most of the people who have been donating have been those with a direct connection to the university, and mostly women,' she explained. 'It’s a localized campaign and has the full support of our leadership team at our university. We were looking to reach men and women.' Asked what she thought of those who are perhaps puzzled by the conspicuous lack of women on the billboard, she responded: 'If it raises attention to people in terms of what we want to do for honouring women, then I think that’s a good thing,' adding that there are additional parts of the campaign on their website featuring women. The billboard, which is located in downtown Halifax on Barrington St, has caused plenty of raised eyebrows after it was first reported by CBC News. Twitter user Kathryn Walsh tweeted earlier this week: ‘I see their billboard on Barrington every morning on the way to HFX and I always think “what? Why would they do that?”’ Digital presence: The website for the advertising campaign features the same image of the three men, but also includes some of the women honored . Small campus: Mount Saint Vincent University has around 4,000 undergraduate students studying at its Halifax campus and was founded in 1873 . And women’s blog Feministe not only criticized the content itself, but the design, writing: ‘It’s plug-ugly. I mean, hello to some art direction,’ adding that the text-heavy advert could cause problems to those driving by. They added: ‘There are no women on (the billboard). It’s a “women’s wall” ad with three dudes and not a single woman anywhere.’ The university’s campaign to honor women seeks $1,200 donations that ensure a woman’s name is included in the wall, which is scheduled to be erected outside of the Margaret Norrie McCain Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Research. And for a donation of $250,000 and up, an honoree’s name and image will be embroidered on a banner that will be displayed in the building’s atrium. The complex is slated to open in winter of 2014. According to the Chronicle Herald, the billboard shows Rob Batherson, senior vice president of public affairs at advertising company Colour, as well as Paul Kent, president and CEO of the Greater Halifax Partnership, and former provincial Liberal leader Danny Graham.

The revelations come as the Government looks to clamp down on companies who are using unpaid interns long term. Exposed: Premier League football clubs Reading and Wigan are advertising long internships which pay no salary, it has emerged. Wigan's stadium is pictured . Cheap: The role at Reading is described as a performance analyst but as well as being unpaid it does not pay travel expenses . Both clubs are advertising the positions on the UK Sport website.

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 04:25 EST, 1 December 2011 . Portable EEG headsets allow companies to analyse, second by second, which adverts are causing viewers to feel pleasure . Many of us scoff 'adverts don't work on me' - even when that John Lewis one can reduce us to tears. But this year, a British company is to monitor the effects of advertising in a more detailed way than ever before - using EEG brain monitors to 'watch' the pleasure centres of viewers as they sit through Britain's most expensive advertising slots in the X Factor final. Viewers will watch the ad breaks wearing an EEG headset - rather like a swimming cap, but monitoring brain waves, particularly in the brain's pleasure centres. The company, SimpleUsability, will also use eye-tracking monitors to work out which advert is most effective. Such 'neuromarketing' monitoring techniques are an extremely new idea - and headsets portable enough to use them are very new indeed. Advertising slots in the slot before the X Factor results are announced cost £8,000 per second - so advertisers use high technology to ensure their adverts are 'working' on the audience . Such tools are becoming essential for television advertising companies to compete with the 'accountability' of internet advertising, where advertisers can see immediately whether their audience have clicked. American television company Nielsen, which pioneered much of the monitoring technology we take for granted today, is now testing EEG headsets as a way of monitoring audience reaction. Neurosense, a division of Nielsen, says, 'Our innovative neurological research, combined with The Nielsen Company’s deep expertise on what consumers watch and buy, will provide unmatched knowledge.' Typically, television adverts use much lower tech methods such as surveys conducted after the event. Advances in electro-encephalography have allowed scientists to scan the brain in a huge amount more detail. X Factor presenter Gary Barlow: This year, EEG 'skull caps' will be used to assess the pleasure caused by adverts in the advertising slots within the show . The fact that data can be stored and analysed against the running time of the video can pinpoint moments in an advert that 'work' in terms of delivering pleasure. Combined with an eye-tracker, it allows advertisers to 'design' - or re-cut - adverts to work better. 'The break before the winner is announced on Sunday, December 11th’s live final is the most expensive in the UK with slots selling for £8k per second,' says the research company SimpleUsability. 'By using innovative testing technologies that track eye movement and monitor subliminal, emotional responses, we will be recording how each advert rates in terms of excitement, interest and, emotional engagement amongst X Factor viewers.' The company will announce which advert has been most 'effective' just after the competition.","Brain scanning 'skull caps' used to monitor pleasure .

The so-called 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough refused to put on clothes during a court appearance today telling the judge being nude gives him 'freedom.' The 53-year-old, from Eastleigh in Hampshire, earned the nickname by walking unclothed from Land’s End to John O’Groats after quitting his job as a lorry driver. Appearing at . Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court ahead of his trial later this month, he told Sheriff Richard McFarlane that he would 'absolutely not' put . clothes on as he was 'dressed appropriately' wearing nothing at all. Staying true to his beliefs: The former Royal Marine, 53, appeared naked at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court ahead of his trial later this month, following his arrest on July 20th in Townhill, Dunfermline . The former Royal Marine was charged with breach of the peace, . with prosecutors claiming he refused to put on clothing or move away . from a children’s play park in Townhill, Dunfermline last month. Gough entered the court naked, apart from . brown walking boots and a pair of white socks, and was lead to the dock . where he sat down on a white bath towel. Sheriff McFarlane said to Gough: 'You appear unclothed. Is there a reason for that? Can you tell me what that might be?' Gough replied: 'Freedom.' The . Sheriff said: 'That’s not appropriate in a court of law, there are . standards that need to be adhered to and that does not meet those. He told Gough that he could be charged with  a contempt of court, but the naked ramber insisted 'I think I am dressed appropriately.' Naked and proud: Gough, from Eastleigh in Hampshire, who made his name by walking nude from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2003 . To which the Sheriff replied: 'You’re not dressed at all.' But Gough insisted: 'And I think that is appropriate.' When Sheriff . McFarlane asked Gough to reconsider his decision to stand in court naked, Gough refused to change his stance, adding: 'I will not put clothes on, absolutely not.' Depute fiscal Brian Robertson said . that he would not take action in the contempt matter, leaving the matter . to the Sheriff instead. But told the court that the crown was prepared for trial. Sheriff McFarlane asked Gough if he would like to see a lawyer, in light of the contempt matters. But the rambler insisted he didn’t need to see a lawyer, and was sticking to his plea of not guilty. It . is alleged that in July this year,  Gough committed a breach of the peace by conducting himself in . a disorderly manner and walking naked in a public place. It . is claimed that he was close to a children’s play park at the time, and . refused to put on clothing or move away from the park. In trouble with the law: Gough went on to be arrested and jailed on a number of occasions for walking naked, and refusing to get dressed in court . Gough, who has received 17 convictions in 10 years, came to notoriety during his naked walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats in 2003. He went on to be arrested and jailed on a number of occasions for walking naked, and refusing to get dressed in court. He was released from Perth Prison in July  having spent the past six years in the Scottish jail, but was arrested three days later. Previousky he was arrested within 60 seconds of his release and fully expected the police to do so again.But, in an apparent shift in attitude, the rambler had been allowed to go on his way. On a flight to Scotland in May 2006 he was detained for a breach of the peace after he went to the toilet and removed his clothes. He had been in prison ever since - although he has spent minutes at a time out of custody before being re-arrested for being naked - until his release last Tuesday. His former partner, Alison Ward, 47, who lived with Gough and their two children, Yarin, 14, and Kiana, 16, in Vancouver, said at the weekend she was 'amazed' that he had been arrested again, saying 'he’s a fanatic about nudism.' Ms Ward, said that it was 'really disappointing' for her and the children that they wouldn’t be able to see him. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Stephen Gough, 53, is charged with breach of the peace after he walked naked near a children play area and refusing to put clothes on .

The DNA traces in a single shot glass are enough to identify not only the species living around a lake - but how many of each animal there are. It works for anything from otters to dragonflies . Up until now, 'monitoring' animals has relied on fairly low-tech methods - finding the creatures and counting them. It's a method that's changed little in the last hundred years, even if biologists have added GPS tagging and computer monitoring once they've found the beasts. But a Danish research team has found an incredible short-cut  – a lake water sample the size of a shot-glass can contain evidence of an entire lake fauna. It's so effective in counting not only which creatures are present, but how many, that the researchers think that in future it may even be used to count fishing quotas. Researchers at the Natural History Museum of Denmark found that rare and threatened animal species could be monitored simply by taking note of the DNA traces in fresh water environments. 'In the water samples we found DNA from animals as different as an otter and a dragonfly,' says Philip Francis Thomsen. 'We have shown that the DNA detection method works on a wide range of different rare species living in fresh water - they all leave DNA traces in their environment which can be detected in even very small water samples from their habitat. By studying the fauna of one hundred different lakes and streams in Europe with both conventional methods - counting individuals - and the new DNA-based method the research team documents that DNA detection is effective even in populations where the animals are extremely rare. The study also shows that there is a clear correlation between the amount of DNA in the environment and the density of individuals meaning that the DNA detection method can even be used to estimate population sizes. A single shot glass of water from a lake was sufficient to count animals such as otters (pictured) as reliably as a manual head count . This is crucial in the monitoring of rare animals, where one often wants to know whether the population is large or small.'The UN has agreed to halt the decline of biodiversity - but we need to properly document the status of threatened species. 'Our new approach is a huge step forward making it cheaper and faster to monitor the endangered species, and thus prioritise efforts to the benefit of biodiversity at a broad scale,' says Jos Kielgast.The researchers say that the method is so effective that fishing quotas may in the future be based on DNA traces rather than fish catches.","Lets biologists 'count' animals - not just number of species .

Biologists still currently use 'manual' head counts .

The fugitive gay-porn star suspected of being a cannibal harboured murderous fantasies towards people and animals one of his transsexual lovers has revealed. Luka Magnotta, 29, dated Nina Arsenault for a short time a decade ago, but left an indelible impression on the 38-year-old prostitute and journalist. 'I'm afraid that when you look into my eyes...that you'll see that there's nothing inside of me,' said Magnotta to Arsenault after they first met when he worked as a stripper in Toronto. Nina Arsenault was the lover of Luka Magnotta around a decade ago and has revealed the porn star and suspected cannibal was deeply disturbed even then . Speaking to CityTV as a trans-Atlantic manhunt closed in on her former lover, Arsenault described the suspected murderer as a 'manipulative pathological liar - one f****d-up kid.' Having filmed himself chopping up his current lover before posting body parts to politicians in Canada, Magnotta is now being hunted in Europe after French police admitted he landed in Paris and could even now be on the run in London. He fled after the torso of a man identified as Chinese student Lin Jun was found outside his Montreal apartment and a video was recovered from the scene. It allegedly showed Magnotta killing Jun with an ice pick, cutting him up, sexually abusing him and then eating him with a knife and fork. Nina Arsenault spoke in a television interview in Toronto after the manhunt for Magnotta moved to France . Meeting Magnotta at a strip club around ten years ago, Arsenault said that the suspected murderer and cannibal pursued her as a lover . In the interview, Arsenault spoke of how Magnotta would start fights on the street with strangers and punch himself in the head while taking a shower . Transsexual Arsenault, who has spent up to $150,000 Canadian dollars on sex change operations, met Magnotta when he was 18. 'I first met him as Angel, but then he told me his real name is Luka — and he also referred to himself as Rocco,' said Arsenault. 'He was my very first lover after I started living as a transsexual. 'He would joke about killing animals. 'He would joke about killing people — that he wanted to kill his family.'

The victim has been . identified as Jun Lin, right . The freelance writer also admitted that Magnotta would get high on mind-bending drugs and was obsessed with Madonna and James Dean and woud do 'anything' to be famous himself. She described odd behaviour from Magnotta, such as punching himself in the head while he was in the shower and posessing a temper and 'if it went on it was terrifying.' 'He hated his dad. He hated his family and said they didn't understand him and he had to get away from him,' added Arsenault. As Magnotta evaded police in Canada and France, the Montreal police chief Ian Lafreniere predicted that Magnotta's addiction to celebrity will cause him to make a mistake. With the ability to disguise himself as a woman, Luka Magnotta has evaded arrest by police in Canada and France for almost a week . 'What will hinder him the most is what he used to glorify himself on the web, with all the photos we have of him,' said Lafreniere. The chief added, 'Magnotta is someone who can disguise himself - he can change into a woman, wear a wig.' Because of this, police released a sketch that showed how he would look as a woman with long dark hair and sporting a fringe. As police scoured the apartment that Magnotta lived in, police chief Lafreniere confirmed that he had left Montreal by air on Saturday and arrived in Paris the next day. 'We’re not going to give you his final destination because we believe he could be anywhere at this point,' said Lafreniere. 'We’re engaged in a worldwide search — more than 190 countries are helping us.' French detectives have told the Mail that Magnotta took a flight to Paris on Saturday. Luka Magnotta is wanted in connection with the gruesome murder of gay Chinese student Jun Lin . 'He’s obsessed with the Eiffel Tower and the Moulin Rouge and is confident that he can lie low in a country he loves. All efforts are being made to arrest him.' Luka Magnotta, who is suspected of cannibalism, flew from Canada to France a day after placing gruesome footage of the murder on the internet. Police fear the gay porn star may now have slipped into Britain. Six months ago, he was living in a £40-a-night room above the Fusilier Inn in Wembley, North London, while sightseeing in the capital. Magnotta told Nina Arsenault that he was interested in the idea of killing animals and people . While in the UK, he was confronted by . journalists after posting internet film showing a live kitten being fed . to a snake. In an email to The Sun in December he supposedly said: ‘You . will be hearing from me again. This time, however, the victims won’t be . small animals.’ He sent a similar warning to the BBC. As 190 countries joined in . an Interpol manhunt for  Magnotta, his victim was identified as Lin Jun, . a Chinese student who was studying in Montreal.

He also warned that the fugitive . is ‘someone who can disguise himself; he can change into a woman, wear a . wig.’ Hazardous material: A police officer carries a yellow bag with the bloody package that contains the festering foot mailed to Conservative Party headquarters on Tuesday . Police say Mr Lin had been in Montreal since July last year and was studying at Concordia University. His family lost contact with him on May 24. Days later a janitor found his . limbless body in a suitcase near Magnotta’s apartment in the city. Other . body parts were found in the  flat.

Lenient: Gill Holland, who was duped by taxi driver Shafak Hussain, said she did not expect his punishment to be 'so lenient' and talked of her 'upset' at the incident . A blind woman thought her taxi driver was being a kindly soul when he offered to help her withdraw the fare from a cash machine. But, far from being a Good Samaritan, he plundered her bank account and pocketed almost 20 times the cost of the fare. Yesterday, a smirking Shafak Hussain escaped a jail sentence after being convicted of theft. But magistrates were told he has been shunned by his community, friends and former colleagues, and sacked from his job. The incident happened last August when Gill Holland, who was returning from a hospital appointment, realised she was short of money so asked Hussain to stop at a machine so she could withdraw the fare. The court was told she was able to type in her PIN without assistance but asked Hussain to help her, by typing in £30. With Miss Holland standing next to him, Hussain withdrew £300, pocketing £270 whilst handing over the rest – so she could pay the fare. Miss Holland, who was with her guide dog Glen, handed over £14 and gave him a £4 tip, to which he said ‘Are you sure?’ Miss Holland’s bank later contacted her about her balance and she was shocked to learn that £300 had been withdrawn. The 52-year-old contacted the manager of Motown taxis to tell him about the incident and he confronted Hussain, who was later arrested. The court heard Hussain, of Oldham, had previous convictions for theft, fraud and forgery. He was given a suspended jail sentence, ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and pay back his victim. Guilty: Shafak Hussain, who cheated Gill Holland out of £300 when she asked for help at a cash machine, even thanked his victim for a £4 tip at the end of the journey . Last night, she condemned the sentence . and said Hussain had intended to steal from her the moment she stepped . into the taxi. ‘I have an account with that taxi company and as soon as I . got in the car he said: “This isn’t on account, is it?” He knew in one . way or another he was going to do something. ‘This wasn’t about the money, it was . just about getting justice and to let other people know and make them . more aware there are people like that out there. ‘I just wish the sentence hadn’t been so lenient. ‘Going to court was a harrowing . experience for me but I was worried this man would try and do it again . to someone else who was vulnerable. ‘I do believe 99.9 per cent of people are good and just want to help but he has upset me. ‘It’s just so awful. It’s not the taxi . firm’s fault, their drivers are usually excellent – unfortunately they . can’t help it if they get one rogue person working for them.’ Pick-up: Mrs Holland had been picked up by the taxi driver at Manchester Royal Infirmary after she was taken ill . Dominic Geelan, prosecuting, said: . ‘The defendant withdrew, without her knowledge, £300, giving her £30 and . keeping the rest.’ Peter Eatherall, defending, said Hussain, a . father-of-two, had been shunned by all his friends and acquaintances. He . added: ‘He has lost all of his friends. ‘He’s been shunned by people who knew . him and by fellow taxi drivers, who obviously feel strongly about the . repugnant element of this matter – this defendant’s life has changed for . the worse significantly.’ District Judge Paul Richardson told him: ‘This was a very mean offence. She relied on you and you betrayed her. ‘The victim was totally blind and a lady who had just emerged from hospital having been unwell during the day. ‘I am glad to say you will never work again as a taxi driver.’ Taxi driver Shafak Hussain was given a four month suspended prison sentence at Oldham Magistrates Court after being found guilty of stealing the money .","Shafak Hussain, 36, took advantage of regular passenger Gill Holland .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:05 EST, 7 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:14 EST, 8 May 2012 . Fears are growing that Al Qaeda's thwarted underpants bomb plot is just one of a number of terrorist plans to bring down aeroplanes. A senior law enforcement source said other devices, similar to the 'undetectable' one discovered this month in Yemen, could be ready to be deployed by other would-be bombers. He told the New York Times: 'If they built one, they probably built more. That's the scary part.' The startling admission comes as U.S. counter-terrorism officials said they thought the mastermind of the latest underpants bomb plot was killed during a CIA drone attack in Yemen on Sunday. Dear: Was senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, behind the updated underpants bomb plot . Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso, one of . America's Most Wanted terrorists, wanted to bring down a U.S.-bound . jetliner with a new and improved 'undetectable' version of the underwear . bomb that failed to detonate aboard a jetliner over Detroit in . Christmas 2009. The explosion was to be carried out, reports suggest, to mark the one year anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden. But the Yemen-based terrorist was killed by a missile fired by an unmanned CIA drone as he stepped out of a vehicle in a remote valley in the south of Yemen. Two counter-terrorism officials told the New York Daily News they believed 37-year-old al-Quso, who had a $5million bounty on his head, was the key militant behind the plans. New terror alert: Al Qaeda reportedly planned to strike on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death . Al-Quso was indicted in the U.S. for his . role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in the harbour of Aden, Yemen, . in which 17 American sailors were killed and 39 injured. He was later believed to have replaced Anwar al-Awlaki as the Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula's head of . external operations when the latter was killed in a U.S. airstrike last year. The FBI is now examining the latest bomb to see whether it could have passed through airport security and brought down an aeroplane. The device did not contain metal, . meaning it probably could have passed through an airport metal detector. But it was not clear whether new body scanners used in many airports . would have detected it. Senator . Dianne Feinstein, of California, who heads the Senate Intelligence . Committee, said yesterday she had been briefed about an 'undetectable' device that was 'going to be on a U.S.-bound airliner.' There . were no immediate plans to change security procedures at U.S. airports. But there are reports, in the U.S. media, that last week the plot led the U.S. to order scores of air marshals to Europe to protect U.S.-bound aircraft. Flights out of Gatwick Airport, in England, reportedly received 100 percent coverage, according to U.S. sources. The would-be suicide bomber, based in Yemen and believed to be working for al-Quso, had not yet picked a target or bought his plane tickets when the CIA stepped in and seized the bomb, officials said. New York Congressman Peter King, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said counter-terrorism officials had said of the wannabe bomber: 'We don’t have to worry about him any more.' He is alive, officials added, but they would not give any further details. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said President Obama learned about the plot in April and was assured the device posed no threat to the public. Notified: The White House said President Obama was told about the terror plot back in April, despite his administration's claim over the last few weeks that there was no 'credible threat' 'The president thanks all intelligence and counter-terrorism professionals involved for their outstanding work and for serving with the extraordinary skill and commitment that their enormous responsibilities demand,' Hayden said. The first: Underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, is pictured in his 2009 mugshot after his failed Christmas Day bomb attempt . The operation unfolded even as the White House and Department of Homeland Security assured the American public that they knew of no Al Qaeda plots against the U.S. around the anniversary of bin Laden's death. 'We have no credible information that . terrorist organisations, including Al Qaeda, are plotting attacks in . the U.S. to coincide with the anniversary of bin Laden's death,' White . House press secretary Jay Carney said on April 26. On . May 1, the Department of Homeland Security said, 'We have no indication . of any specific, credible threats or plots against the U.S. tied to the . one-year anniversary of bin Laden's death.' The Associated Press learned about the thwarted plot . last week but agreed to White House and CIA requests not to publish it . immediately because the sensitive intelligence operation was still under . way. Once officials said those concerns were . allayed, the Associated Press decided to disclose the plot despite requests . from the Obama administration to wait for an official announcement. The decision to delay the announcement has led to some speculation that Obama was 'electioneering'. But this has been dismissed by his camp. U.S. officials, who were briefed on . the operation, insisted on anonymity to discuss the case, which the U.S. has never officially acknowledged. Old bomb: Pictured here is the slightly charred and singed underwear which housed the explosives used by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab . It's . not clear who built the bomb, but, because of its sophistication and . its similarity to the Christmas bomb, authorities suspected it was the . work of master bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri. Al-Asiri constructed the first underwear bomb and two others that Al Qaeda built into printer cartridges and shipped to the U.S. on cargo planes in 2010. Suspect: Authorities believe the updated underwear bomb was the work of master bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri . Both of those bombs used a powerful industrial explosive. Both were nearly successful. Al-Asiri, of Saudi Arabia, was believed killed in a drone strike last year, but Yemeni officials quickly denied his death. The operation is an intelligence victory for the United States and a reminder of Al Qaeda's ambitions, despite the death of bin Laden and other senior leaders. Since the death of bin Laden in a daring U.S. Navy SEAL raid on his Pakistan compound, the terror group is believed to have shifted its interests from Afghanistan to Yemen. The terror group has taken advantage of Yemen's political turmoil in the past year, gaining territory and strength. It has set up terrorist camps and, in some areas, even operates as a de facto government. Yesterday, Al Qaeda militants staged a surprise attack on a Yemeni army base in the south, killing 22 soldiers and capturing at least 25. The militants managed to reach the base both from the sea and by land, gunning down troops and making away with weapons and other military hardware after the blitz attack, Yemeni military officials said. But along with the gains there also have . been losses. The group has suffered significant setbacks as the CIA and . the U.S. military focus more on Yemen. The new Yemeni president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, has promised improved cooperation with the U.S. to combat the militants. On Saturday, he said the fight against Al Qaeda was in its early stages. Hadi took over in February from longtime authoritarian leader Ali Abdullah Saleh. Since the terror attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda has put different types of plans into action in numerous Jihad plots. While none of the plots have been successful, they have brought change to airport screenings and other security measures.","Bomb plot mastermind believed to be killed in CIA drone attack on Sunday .

Given that she has just marked 60 years on the throne and attended countless ceremonial occasions, it is probably something of an occupational hazard. But the Queen, who celebrates her 87th birthday on Sunday, displayed impressive reflexes as she narrowly escaped a collision with a ceremonial sword today. The monarch, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, had just arrived at St Paul’s Cathedral to make an historic appearance at Baroness Thatcher’s funeral. Scroll down for video . Near miss: The Queen (left) speaks to Lord Mayor of London Roger Gifford (right) whose ceremonial sword nearly hit the monarch on the steps of St Paul's cathedral today . Greeting: As the Lord Mayor finishes greeting the Queen, he turns to lead her inside . Danger: But the Lord Mayor's ceremonial sword swings up and nearly strikes the monarch . Close call: Fortunately the sword swings past the Queen as she recoils and doesn't make contact . As she began to walk up the steps she was greeted by the Lord Mayor of London, Alderman Roger Gifford, resplendent in his ceremonial dress with the Mourning Sword last used at Sir Winston Churchill’s state funeral at his side. After proffering a formal greeting, merchant banker Mr Gifford turned smartly on his heel to lead the royal couple up towards the Great West Door where the Archbishop of Canterbury was waiting. But as he swung round, the large black steel sword swung wildly towards the sovereign, just missing her face. The Queen can clearly be seen recoiling backwards before turning towards her laughing husband and making what appeared to be a jokey remark about her near miss. Fortunately Mr Gifford, 57, a father-of-six from Scotland, was blissfully unaware of the incident and continued with the rest of his duties unabashed. The Lord Mayor is elected on an annual basis and is an unpaid, non-political position. The role is, nowadays, primarily to act as an ambassador for all UK-based financial and professional services in the City of London. One is amused: Luckily the Queen and Prince Philip both saw the funny side of the incident . No harm done: The Queen and Prince Philip were greeted on the steps of the cathedral by the Lord Mayor of London and were to follow him inside when the incident happened, but the Queen appeared unfazed and smiled with her husband about the near miss in the seconds that followed . The Monarch and her husband made their way into St Paul's to take their seats after being greeted by the Lord Mayor of London . A spokesman for Mr Gifford declined to comment. The Queen’s appearance at her eighth and longest-serving prime minister’s funeral yesterday was unprecedented and taken to be a mark of respect for a woman with whom she did not always see eye to eye. As a rule, the Queen rarely attends funerals for anyone outside her immediate family. While she did choose to attend Churchill’s public commemoration in 1965, it was an official state event for a man who had stood shoulder to shoulder with her own beloved father, George V1, during the Second World War. Although Buckingham Palace had been consulted about the plans for yesterday’s event as far back as 2008, the decision for her to attend was not made until the day after Lady Thatcher’s death when Buckingham Palace was informed that the government intended for it to become a state occasion in all but name. Safe distance: The Queen is pictured a little further away from the ceremonial sword with her head bowed during the service . Friendly: The Queen shakes hands warmly with Mr Gifford at the end of the ceremony forgetting the earlier mishap . For the Queen and her aides, it now wasn’t just an issue of whether she should attend such a ‘unique’ occasion, but how it would look to the public if she didn’t - particularly given talk of their occasionally less than easy relationship. As usual, the Queen conducted herself faultlessly and while she chose not to arrive before Lady Thatcher’s family as a mark of respect as she did for Churchill - protocol normally dictates the Queen is the last to arrive and the first to leave - she did choose to show her esteem in a different way. There was a small, almost imperceptible, nod as her former prime minister’s coffin passed following the service. Then the monarch quietly, and without fanfare, waited for the Baroness’s immediate family to make their way down the cathedral steps and watch in quiet contemplation as the coffin was re-loaded onto the waiting hearse. Royal sympathies: The Queen also spoke with Baroness Thatcher's family including her children Sir Mark and Carol after the ceremony . Only then did she follow them, stopping for a minute on the steps to chat and proffer her condolences with a warm and friendly smile. She clearly greeted each member of the family group - son, Sir Mark, and daughter Carole, who were accompanied by their respective partners, as well as her grand-children Michael and Amanda - personally. Amanda, who less than an hour earlier had set the scene for the event with a reading that showed a dignity beyond her years, offered a particularly elegant curtsy. No other member of the Royal Family was present for the simple reason that there was no requirement for them to do so (which for Prince Charles, who is currently holidaying in Scotland, was no doubt something of a blessed relief as he disagreed inherently with much she had to say). Indeed the only other guest with strong royal links was - somewhat incongruously - Sarah, Duchess of York, whose ex-husband, Prince Andrew, served in the Falklands War.","Alderman Roger Gifford greeted the Queen and Prince Philip at St Paul's .

Cuddling up to lions, stalking zebras and tormenting a elephant by pouncing at its tail, it's rather different from attacking mice in the back garden. Every cat owner knows its pet will do whatever it wishes, so it may be unsurprising to see a house cat fearlessly roaming around a game reserve and daring to get close to big predators. But if you thought the friendly feline was in danger from the bigger cats, think again.

A domestic house cat cuddles up to the king of the jungle - or does he? There are some digital tricks at work in this Whiskas campaign . This tabby cat looks like it's squaring up to a herd of zebras in South Africa, a long way from home . Pounce! Photographer George Logan and digital retoucher Tony Swinney made it look like this tabby had found a new toy in an elephant's tail .

India is going to have to wait a little longer for its first Playboy bunnies after authorities stopped promoters opening the country's first Playboy club. The government in Goa has, after a month of heated debate, refused permission for the club which had been planned to open in a 22,000 sq/ft open-air site on upmarket Candolim beach. Women's groups and conservative politicians had attacked the proposed club, with Michael Lobo, a legislator from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party saying it was 'tantamount to promoting prostitution.' Waitresses pose inside the Playboy Club at the Sands Casino in Macau: The government in the tourist hotspot of Goa yesterday refused permission for promoters to open the country's first Playboy club . But in the end local officials stopped the club from opening in one of India's best-known party locations on technical grounds. Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar told the state assembly yesterday that licenses to run so-called beach shacks - even ones as large as the proposed Playboy club - could not be granted to companies, only individuals. 'We cannot give them a license to operate a beach shack,' Mr Parrikar said of the application by Mumbai-based PD Lifestyle, which last year got hold of an exclusive license to market the Playboy brand in India. The company had planned to start with the club in Goa and then expand to the southern city of Hyderabad. Natural beauty: Candolim Beach, Goa, where the club was planned to open in a 22,000 sq/ft open-air site . PB Lifestyle chief executive Sanjay Gupta said last year he was working to recast Playboy into an aspirational lifestyle brand, distancing his firm from nudity and toning down the traditional, body-hugging bunny costume. Goa's decision does not bar the opening of a conventional Playboy club in in the state, just the beach shack. But Mr Lobo has called on the government to prevent Playboy from setting up shop in any form in the state. 'It is not just a question of permitting Playboy in Candolim. It should be banned across Goa, because Goa should be veered away from international chains which promote vulgarity,' he said. Cheerleaders from the Indian Premier League team the Chennai Super Kings: The bunny costumes planned for the club would have been 'more sober' than these, said Agnelo Fernandes, owner of the site . Agnelo Fernandes, a local Congress politician on whose land the beach club was to be located, called the government's decision 'unfortunate.' He has been acting as a de facto spokesman for the project during the controversy. 'It would have been great for Goa to have an international lifestyle brand. There is no question of vulgarity. Our bunny costumes which we had designed were more sober than the one's worn by the cheerleaders at the IPL (Indian Premier League),' Mr Fernandes said, referring to a raucous Indian cricket league. Mr Gupta did not immediately respond to a message left at his office, the Associated Press reported.","Club had been planned for open-air site on the upmarket Candolim beach .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:30 EST, 16 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:46 EST, 16 April 2012 . An Austrian millionaire who claimed he had given everything he owned to the poor because it never made him happy, has been exposed as a conman who simply wanted to get publicity to sell his house and cover his debts. Media around the world rushed to cover the story of Karl Rabeder when he revealed how he had liquidated everything and had invested the money in a bank to provide micro-financing to people in developing countries. He said he realised money did not make him happy and added: 'I was dying through consumerism. My cars and my plane have already gone – the rest will follow soon.' Conman: Austrian Millionaire Karl Rabeder claimed to have given his entire fortune to the poor but an investigation by a leading German magazine claims it is a scam . He had moved into a small alpine hut and planned to live on just a few hundred pounds a month. A Google search on his name comes up with 500,000 hits. But now a special investigation by respected German magazine Stern has revealed how the 49-year-old had actually hired three top public relations agencies to get his message of philanthropy around the world. Rabeder has since travelled the world for two years preaching his message of philanthropy as a guest on talkshows and other media - even writing a book with the title 'Only People with Nothing Have Everything to Give'. The magazine claimed that his promises have not been kept and in reality the whole scheme was a PR stunt designed to allow the financially struggling businessmen to sell off his Austrian property via a lottery so he could pay his debts. The public relations material sent out in March 2009 from the PR firms had the headline 'Win a Dream Villa and at the Same Time Do Something Good.' Property experts say the luxury Tyrol villa was probably not worth over 500,000, but by selling tickets and the massive exposure the plan attracted he had managed to sell 21,999 tickets for €99 each raising 1.78 million pounds. The winner – a woman from Bavaria – was announced in August 2010 and handed the keys. The magazine said that the money certainly gone to good use – but not for good causes. It said that in fact the only confirmed payment to a good cause had been a payment of  €14,886.20  that have been paid to the Austrian charity Light in Darkness and S.O.S. Kinderdorf – representing just 0.7 percent of the total raised. The PR companies that organised the . stunt as well as lawyers pocketed €643,000 while another €745,000 went . to pay off the mortgage. The . property also has a debt tied into the deeds of another €890,000 . from the part share he still had in his firm. This was also cleared. The . magazine said Rabeder had earlier run up massive debts 'living a . champagne lifestyle' on the money that he got from the partial share in . 2004 of his company selling living room accessories. At . the time he was 42 years old and had regarded himself as officially in . early retirement, and had purchased a second house in the South of . France - and speculated on the stock exchange. Scam: The raffle to sell the stunning home raised £1.78 million but the . investigation by Stern magazine found only €14,886.20,  0.7 . per cent, was paid to the Austrian charity Light in Darkness and S.O.S. Kinderdorf . But with the crash in 2007 Rabeder lost vast amounts of money and tried at that time without success to sell his villa in Tyrol. Desperate for money – he had been forced to sell his villa in the South of France at a substantial loss. By September 2010 after the successful sale of the Tyrol villa on the backs of massive publicity he had been able to avoid the insolvency of the remainder of his firm that he had not sold by coming to an arrangement with creditor banks to personally take over €510,000 of debt. Contacted by Stern and asked if money from the sale of the house had been used for creditors he said no. Asked where the money then come from he said: 'I had a few savings elsewhere.' When pushed he failed to provide any documents. Today he makes his money from seminars and talkshows, cashing in on his fame as a philanthropist. Media travelled to interview him, photograph and film him at the wooden hut he supposedly lives in on an alpine meadow – but when Stern visited the property they found no sign of him. They said that the hut was not usable . in the winter and had clearly not been lived in over winter. They also . found evidence that the property had occasionally been rented out in the . summer when he was supposed to have been living there as well. Also . under Austrian law – all residents in the country have to register . their address. But he is not registered anywhere in the country – and in . fact his last recorded contact address was a post box at the Vienna . Millennium Tower, a 202 metre high tower block in the centre of the . Austrian capital. Asked how . true his statement had been of investing everything he owned in . micro-credits in Third World countries he refused to put an amount down . on the table. He said: 'I don't want to state a sum. I will simply refer . you to my original statement that I have given everything that I have.' But . Stern pointed out that this could be nothing. His association . MyMicroCredit (MMC) still exists, but no proof that any money has gone . there. His online Internet . platform has been in existence for two years (www.mymicrocredit.org) and . has been gathering investment from private 'social investors' offering . interest-free miniature loans. Stern . said that many private investors and also invested large sums of money . with no strings attached including the publishing house that had printed . his book. The magazine adds . however that accounts which even an amateur football club has to . prepare in Austria have never been filed for the company. Austrian tax . expert Professor Erich Pummer from the University of Innsbruck said that . failing to file accounts was not an offence. When . questioned by the magazine he said he had never added it all together . because he had too little time. But he admitted there were thousands of . social investors that had probably invested a few hundred thousand Euro. Discrepancies: Although the house wasn't valued at more than €500,000, . the PR companies and lawyers that organised the raffle pocketed €643,000 . while another €745,000 went to pay off Rabeder's mortgage . But the magazine said that the information it had showed very little of the money from the social investors had gone to the preferred end Third World countries where it had been promised. MMC Partner in El Salvdaor, the microcredit company 'Apoyo Integral' said that they hadn't seen any money from him for a long time. They said that they had forwarded on 541 applications for loans from people in El Salvador and that of these 423 had appeared on the MMC page as being approved. But in reality only 278 applications totalling $98,106 had actually been transferred up until June 2010. After that Rabeder stopped making payments even though he continued to collect money at least until the end of last year for the social projects he was claiming to promote. The company said it had tried in vain up until April last year to get at least the remaining $46,000 that had been promised but with out any result. He simply had not paid, claiming to have had problems with German civil servants. He said he needed to change the legal form the company had in order to get round the legal issues that had been raised but when questioned German officials rejected that there had been any difficulties. Apoyo said that the payment difficulties have meant that they had cancelled their working relationship with Rabeder in July last year. A member of the board of Apoyo told Stern: 'We had grave doubts about the way he was operating financial organisation.'","'Struggling businessman' Karl Rabeder, 49, said he invested £3m to help people in developing countries .

A family whose 13-year-old daughter was fatally hit by a car as she crossed the road to her school bus four years ago has been awarded $90 million in a wrongful death suit. Ashley Davis was hit by a car as she crossed Brinkley Road in Prince George's County, Maryland on September 1, 2009 - as her classmates looked on - and died in hospital two weeks later. Her parents claimed the school system failed to provide a bus stop on her side of the road, forcing her to cross the street - and failing to fulfill their promise to provide safe transportation to school. Loss: Ashley Davis, 13, was killed as she walked across the road to catch the school bus in 2009 . After hitting Ashley, the car, a Lincoln Continental, struck a minivan and a 17-year-old boy, who was hospitalized but survived. John Costello, a lawyer for the family, told NBC Washington that the Prince George's County . School Board was 'negligent' towards Ashley. 'They had adopted a policy to . provide for safe transportation,' he explained. 'The policy was they were going to pick . up Ashley on her own side of the street. They never did. They forced her . to cross the street. She got killed crossing the street.' Her mother, Nycole Davis, spoke about her enduring grief. 'She was on her way,' she said. 'She was doing the right thing. She was going to . school. She was a good girl. She didn’t deserve this. If she didn't have to cross the street... she’d be graduating this year. She'd be going to prom this year.' Loss: Ashley, a high school freshman, suffered serious injuries in the crash and died two weeks later . Scene: She died as she was crossing this road outside her home; her family argued that the school had failed to pick her up on the correct side of the road - thus failing to safely transport her to school . Ashley was forced to walk over the . road to her bus after an original bus repeatedly failed to stop at the . right place, Costello said. The school board failed to provide a . safe bus stop for students who lived on the north side of the road, . according to court documents. At the end of the civil trial, the jury awarded the family $90 million plus medical expenses and funeral costs - one of the largest the county has ever seen, the Washington Post reported. 'The jury was upset that [the school board's] policy was not followed . for a full week and a little girl in her first year of high school ended . up suffering the consequences,' Costello said of the verdict. But lawyers warned the battle was not yet over. Ruling: A George's County Circuit Court jury awarded the family $90m but it will likely be appealed . NBC reported that often a verdict is capped around $100,000 when there is a lawsuit against a municipality . or school system, and Costello expected the board will appeal the verdict. Prince George's County Public Schools said: 'No judgment has been entered in this case. It is still under litigation.' But Ashley's mother said she did not care for the money. 'I didn't ask anyone to give me any money or anything like that,' she said. 'I just want someone held responsible for what happened to my daughter.' She added that her daughter was outgoing and popular, and enjoyed shopping, dancing and writing poetry.","Ashley Davis hit by a car as she crossed the road in September 2009 .

State police have found no note but the garage door handle had been knocked off ‘which suggested that the husband went in there and did not intend to be disturbed or rescued,’ Heckler said. Deadly intentions: Police say Gary Reitnauer broke a latch on the garage door (pictured) to prevent anyone from getting in a stopping his suicide . He said the circumstances also indicate that the wife went to the garage and broke the window of another door in an attempt to rescue him, but was apparently overcome by the deadly fumes and was found inside. The family's 16-year-old daughter, Kimberly, became concerned that her parents had not . come back and went to check up on them. She was found dead in the kitchen adjacent to the garage. Heckler said her 10-year-old sister, Jamie, was talking to friends during the ordeal, . and they had advised her to call 911, but her mother had told her not to alert . police, PhillyBurbs.com reported.. At some point, the girl also went . over to the second property . to look for her parents and sister. When paramedics arrived, the child . was found in the kitchen next to her sister's body still clinging to . live, but she too later died. Autopsies will be performed on the victims Wednesday to determine the exact cause of death. PhillyBurbs.com . reported that the family of four living in a house at the rear of . Mayer's Well Drilling company consisted of the couple and two daughters . adopted from Asia. Police . officers responded to the home on Kumry Road after getting a request to . check up on the welfare of residents living there. Sources tell ABC Action News that Gary Reitnauer's body was inside a car with the motor running and the garage door closed. Loving family: Neighbors said the Reitnauers lived on the property in Milford Township for about 15 years and appeared to be a happy, close-knit family . Quakertown Community School District . Superintendent Lisa Andrejko posted a message to the school district's . website informing parents and students about the tragic incident and . asking the community to pray for the family. The school district made arrangements to bring in counselors to help students and staff cope with the loss. The . site said Kimberly, a junior, was a gifted student, receiving the . highest possible score on the advanced placement calculus exam at the . end of her sophomore year. ‘She was just the sweetest soul, the one taking care of . everyone else,’ high school math teacher MaryAnn Byatt said on the website. ‘She . was beautiful inside and out,' Byatt added. She also sang in the chorus and played in the jazz band, and was set to compete at a band festival in Erie. Her . sister was a fifth grader at Trumbauersville Elementary School and took . part in her school's Reading Olympics Team. Like her sister, she played . in the school band and sang in the chorus. She wanted to become a . veterinarian, the site said. The children were adopted from China, according to Maggie Chambers, a neighbor. She said they were ‘just the sweetest family.’ Like other neighbors and friends, the deaths stunned her. ‘It's . not that kind of family,’ she said. ‘For me to even think for a minute . that this was a deliberate thing, it's just not them. It's not.’ Six . of Kimberly's high school classmates placed flowers on the family's . mailbox Tuesday afternoon, then formed a circle, clasped hands and . prayed. Afterward, . they remembered their friend as a highly intelligent student near the . top of her class, and as a talented musician who played piano and . trumpet. She was happy, kind and humble, they said. Terrible discovery: Police officers arrived at the house for a welfare check, only to find a man, his wife and one of the children dead in the garage, and their other daughter dead inside the house . Close-knit clan: The family lived in the five-bedroom house for about 15 years, and the kids' grandmother resided on the property in a trailer . ‘Everyone here loved her. She always had a smile on her face. Her whole family did. They were just the happiest people, and they made everyone else feel the same way,’ said Aislinn Strohecker, 17, a close friend and neighbor. Neighbors said there was no inkling of trouble in the Reitnauer home. Mrs Reitnauer gave Christmas cookies every year to a well-drilling company down the gravel road, and would fetch the company's mail when she got her own, according to Gloria Mayberry, a secretary at the firm. Reitnauer's 59-year-old husband, known as ‘Ozzy,’ would use the bucket on his John Deere tractor to take his trash can to the end of the drive, a cigar usually hanging from his mouth, she recalled. Mayer's manager Paul Moser described the victims as a nice family who appeared loving. Speaking of the husband, Moser said Gary Reitnauer always appeared happy and laughing in the office. The family lived in the five-bedroom house for about 15 years. The kids' grandmother, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, lives on the property in a trailer. Police say it was she who called 911 when no one came to take care of her.","Police officers were making a welfare check when they discovered the family dead .

A Minnesota hospital has offered its ‘deep apologies’ to the family of a stillborn baby boy whose body was found by employees at an industrial laundry company. The body of the baby, which was stillborn at 22 weeks, horrified workers at the Crothall Laundry in Red Wing when it fell out of a bed sheet on Tuesday afternoon. Regions Hospital in St. Paul has described the incident as ‘an unfortunate event’ and claims the remains had been wrapped in linens in its morgue and were mistaken for laundry sent out for cleaning. Chris Boese, chief nursing officer at Regions Hospital makes a public apologize after a dead infant was found in laundry sent to be cleaned . The Regions Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota has offered its 'deep apologies' to the family of a stillborn baby boy whose body was found in sheets delivered to an industrial laundry company . The boy, who was stillborn late in the second trimester nearly two weeks ago, still had a tag on its ankle and was wearing a diaper. Chris Boese, Regions’ chief nursing officer, told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the hospital had procedures to prevent such a mishandling, but that they had failed for some reason. ‘We are working to identify the gap in our system, and to make sure this does not happen again,’ said Boese. The hospital is 'working to' notify the . infant's family, but Boese said on Wednesday morning that the message had . not yet been delivered. In addition, Regions has also offered to provide support and counseling to the employees of the linen service.

This is the first time infant . remains have been lost, said Boese. A family member of a laundry worker said the discovery occurred earlier on Tuesday morning. Staff were told not to say anything until the hospital was alerted. By the time local police were called to the scene, hospital workers had already removed the body and linens from the laundry before officers arrived. The hospital statement said that the immediate collection and securing of the remains was conducted 'according to proper procedures.' It is not unusual for remains to stay in the morgue for an extended . period of time depending on how the family wishes for the remains to . treated. The baby's body was found in hospital sheets delivered to the Crothall Laundry in Red Wing, Minnesota . Red Wing Police Chief Roger Pohlman said officers were shown a photo of the body and have interviewed witnesses at the laundry. There is no indication of foul play in connection with the incident. ‘What . we have is that when they were preparing the laundry, a baby had fallen . out of a sheet, and that they had called the hospital where the laundry . had come from, and that they immediately sent people down to pick it . up,’ said Pohlman. ‘It was after this had taken place that we received a call.’ Pohlman said his detectives have . contacted St. Paul police to open a joint investigation.

Ancient: The three huts will be built at the Stonehenge visitor centre around 1.5 miles to the west of the monument early next year . The prehistoric monument of Stonehenge is one of the most famous sites in the world. The circular earth bank and ditch which surrounds the site is believed to be the earliest part of the monument, dating back to about 3100BC. Evidence found by archeologists indicated that Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings. Cremated human remains have been found on the site. The site has always been a place of religious significance, particularly by Neo-druids. There are many conspiracy theories and mysteries surrounding Stonehenge. This includes that the monument was constructed by the wizard Merlin. Historically, many believed that the rocks at Stonehenge were healing rocks, brought from Africa by Giants. English Heritage said the site was probably a large temporary 'construction camp' for the monument. The . extremely rare remains of ten houses were excavated between 2006-7, . revealing the size and layout of the floors and the stakeholes where the . walls once stood. Radiocarbon . tests dated the buildings from around the same time that the sarsen . stones were being put up at Stonehenge, about 2,500 BC.

Beyoncé, Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian were also exposed by the site - although it is unclear  how the information was . obtained or why these individuals were selected.

There has so far been little comment . from representatives of the public figures targeted in the cyber attacks . as to the accuracy of the information revealed. A Secret Service spokesman told MailOnline that the agency is looking into the matter but will not comment further due to the ongoing investigation. The site, which bore an internet . suffix originating in the Soviet Union, remained active on Tuesday and . bears a quote from the TV show Dexter as the tagline: 'If you believe . that God makes miracles, you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his . sleeve.'

Michelle Obama's on the other hand is . largely positive featuring an 'I Love Michelle' sign and the message: . 'Blame your husband, we still love you, Michelle. <3' The existence of the hacker's website was first reported on Monday by TMZ.

'People get mad at us, go on the Internet and try to find information about us, and post it all on one site,' Smith said. 'The best word I can use to describe it is creepy,' he said about the practice. 'It's a creepy thing to do.'

The site's page on LAPD chief Charlie Beck includes a taunting reference to former officer Christopher Dorner, pictured. The hacker group Anonymous had threatened a cyber-attack in retaliation to Dorner's death last month. While government officials often have to disclose details on their finances - and celebrity divorces sometimes feature public financial data - the information posted online exceeds those disclosures. Social Security numbers are rarely included in public records anymore because they can be used for identity theft. In December, a man who hacked email accounts belonging to A-listers including Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Christina Aguilera was sent to prison for a decade. Christopher Chaney, 36, pleaded guilty to nine felony counts earlier this year - including identity theft, wiretapping, and unauthorized access - after he leaked nude and revealing photos of the women online. Chaney, of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested in 2011 as part of a year-long investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi'. The depth of his hacking - which kept the unemployed Chaney glued to his computer screen for days at a time - enabled him to witness exchanges between celebrities, their family members and their doctors. In all he was accused of illegally accessing the private information of around 50 stars with virtually no technical computer training. The 36-year-old also admitted to being privy to information about male stars who were hiding the fact they were gay for the sake of their careers. Prosecutors said Chaney illegally accessed the email accounts between November 2010 and October 2011. Nude photos Johansson had taken of herself were later posted on the Internet. Johansson told Vanity Fair that the photos were meant for Ryan Reynolds, her ex-husband who is now married to Blake Lively.","Officials targeted included Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, FBI Director Robert Mueller and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck .

In the days leading up to his death Nigel Hardy was said to have been ‘despondent’ after being suspended for getting into a fight with another pupil at Hillview Middle School in Palmdale. The fight, which occurred last Friday, was related to Hardy’s involvement with the AV Dynasty All-Stars, an extracurricular cheerleading club. Nigel Hardy, 13, had been subjected to bullying at school for being part of a cheerleading club prior to his death .

Carbon monoxide has apparently killed a family of four, among them two children, in an eastern Pennsylvania home where police found a car running in the garage. State police Lt. Vincent D'Angelo says authorities haven't yet determined whether the car was left running intentionally as part of a murder-suicide plot, or whether it was an accident. Police were called to the Reitnauer family's 1525 Kumry Road in Milford Township at 11.20pm Monday, and found it filled with carbon monoxide coming from the attached garage. Scene of tragedy: Carbon monoxide from a car left running in the garage apparently killed a family of four inside this Milford Township, Pa. home . The fire department also responded and discovered the victims. Paramedics on the scene attempted to revive the family, but it was too late. D'Angelo says police are not looking for a suspect, and that there is no danger to the public. The victims have been identified as 59-year-old Gary Reitnauer, his wife, Michele, 58, and their two adopted daughters, 16-year-old Yun Jiao 'Kimberly' Cao and Jamie Hongfan Reitnauer, 10, according to The Morning Call. Autopsies will be performed on the victims to determine the exact cause of death, but as of Tuesday afternoon, a representative of the Bucks County Coroner's Office told MailOnline the procedures have yet to be scheduled. PhillyBurbs.com reported that the family of four living in a house at the rear of Mayer's Well Drilling company consisted of the couple and two daughters adopted from Asia. Police officers responded to the home on Kumry Road after getting a request to check up on the welfare of residents living there. Sources tell ABC Action News that Gary Reitnauer's body was inside a car with the motor running and the garage door closed. Terrible discovery: Police officers arrived at the house for a welfare check, only to find a man, his wife and one of the children dead in the garage, and their other daughter dead inside the house . Close-knit clan: The family lived in the five-bedroom house for about 15 years, and the kids' grandmother resided on the property in a trailer . Michelle Reitnauer and one of their children were also found dead inside the garage. Another girl was discovered inside the house. Rob Zere, who identified himself as Mr Reitnauer's nephew, told CBS Philly: 'the family was trying to save each other, and it didn't work out.' Quakertown Community School District Superintendent Lisa Andrejko posted the following message to the school district's website informing parents and students about the tragic incident and asking the community to pray for the family. The school district made arrangements to bring in counselors to help students and staff cope with the loss. Mayer's manager Paul Moser described the victims as a nice family who appeared loving. Speaking of the husband, Moser said Gary Reitnauer always appeared happy and laughing in the office. The family lived in the five-bedroom house for about 15 years.

A seven-year-old girl who became Beijing’s first human case of the new strain of bird flu has been discharged from hospital today. A daughter of poultry traders, she was the first confirmed case of H7N9 virus in the Chinese capital, but has made a full recovery, state authorities said. The new strain of avian flu has claimed 16 lives since the outbreak two weeks ago, with the 78th human case of H7N9 virus confirmed in China today. Bye, bye birdie: The unnamed seven year old girl who was the first confirmed human case of H7N9 bird flu in Beijing is discharged from hospital . The seven-year-old waved at the cameras in what appears to have been an attempt by health officials to calm the bird flu panic spreading across eastern China. Both the girl and her parents, who have been in quarantine with her, wore face masks at Wednesday’s press conference, something which health officials claim was a measure taken to protect their identities. The seven-year-old told press she feels ‘much better’, and added that: ‘I miss home. I want to go back and play,' The Australian reported. Her remarkable recovery was marred by the news that two more people have died from a new strain of avian influenza, bringing the death toll to 16. The latest victims were from the . commercial capital of Shanghai, where the majority of the 78 cases have . been found, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The exact source of infection remains unknown and no human-to-human spread of the virus has been confirmed. Samples have tested positive in some birds in poultry markets that remain the focus of investigations by China and the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ‘Because the source of the infection has . not been effectively controlled, it is possible that the number of cases . of infections could continue to rise,’ Xinhua said, quoting a risk . assessment of the virus by the National Health and Family Planning . Commission. Zeng Guang, the chief scientist in charge of epidemiology at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre (CDPCC), said about 40 per cent of the victims have no clear history of poultry exposure, the Beijing News newspaper reported on Wednesday. ‘How did these people get infected? It's a mystery,’ Zeng said. Deadly virus: The new strain of bird flu has claimed 16 lives in China in the past two weeks . An analysis on Tuesday confirmed only ten out of the then 77 victims had . contact with poultry. The latest outbreak of bird flu has had dire consequences for the country’s poultry industry. The term Typhoid Mary refers to Mary Mallon, the first confirmed asymptomatic, or healthy, carrier of typhoid fever in the US. She is presumed to have infected more than 50 people between 1900 and 1907 when she worked as a cook in New York, and between quarantines later in life. She was quarantined three times before she died in 1938, not from typhoid, but pneumonia.

Brighton and Hove could become the first city in the country to offer safe, clean havens for addicts to use illegal drugs . Drug consumption rooms should be considered in a city once dubbed the drugs death capital of the UK to help cut the number of fatalities from substance misuse, according to a report. Brighton and Hove could become the first city in the country to offer safe, clean havens for addicts to use illegal drugs under professional supervision without fear of prosecution if the proposal moves forward. As part of a series of measures aimed at cutting the harm drugs cause in the East Sussex city, public health leaders have also recommended that more people should be trained to administer a life-saving overdose antidote. And drug services for young people should be separated from those for adults to avoid younger users mixing with older, more experienced addicts, the report published today adds. The report, from the Independent Drugs Commission for Brighton and Hove, follows an investigation which examined how services can reduce the devastation caused by drugs. A 10-strong panel of experts from the commission has been looking at the challenges thrown up by illegal drug markets, drug use and the effectiveness of the responses to them. Real-time data on supply routes and drug-taking trends should be collected so that education, treatment and enforcement can be applied more rapidly, the report also suggests. Mike Trace, the commission's vice chairman, said: 'This has been a thorough investigation involving drug users themselves, other people affected by drugs, key agencies and leading experts in Brighton and Hove to try to come up with ideas to minimise the harm that drugs cause the city.' Although Brighton and Hove has shed its crown as the UK's drugs death capital, substance misuse in the city remains stubbornly high. In 2000, 67 residents died a drug-related death, with the figure now standing at around 20. The commission said that more than 2,000 people are considered problem heroin and cocaine users and that more than 60,000 people in the city have used illegal drugs. Rob Jarrett, chairman of the city council's adult care and health committee, said: 'Brighton and Hove has had a problem with drug abuse for decades and we're determined to do something about it so we take these recommendations very seriously.' Although Brighton and Hove has shed its crown as the UK's drugs death capital, substance misuse in the city remains high . Tom Scanlon, Brighton and Hove's director of public health, said: 'We have a relatively high number of drug users in the city, and in the past we have had high numbers of drug-related deaths. 'So we welcome these recommendations and will work closely with key partners to make sure that the ideas in the report complement our work on helping people fully recover. 'We have come a long way from the peak in 2000 when 67 Brighton and Hove residents died from drug use. While this has fallen to 20 deaths, each of these still represents a personal tragedy for the person concerned and for families and friends.' More than 90 drug consumption rooms have been set up worldwide since the mid 1980s, including in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Norway and Canada. They are professionally supervised healthcare facilities where drug users can use substances in safe and hygienic conditions. They aim to establish contact with difficult-to-reach users, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. But they have proved controversial, with concerns that they may encourage drug use, delay treatment entry and aggravate problems among local drug markets. The commission's report will be considered by the Safe in the City Partnership Board on April 30.","Report carried by Independent Drugs Commission for Brighton and Hove .

Nick Clegg might have power as Deputy Prime Minister but it seems being a self-confessed 'major devotee' of Marks and Spencer was not enough to prevent a fresh slump in clothing sales at the high street retailer. The Lib Dem leader surprised listeners to his radio phone-in when he revealed he buys his underpants and socks from M&S during a discussion about another poor set of sales figures. But he also gave an indication of why the firm might be in trouble when he asked on air: 'Do you go to M&S for fashion?' Scroll down for video . Sales slunmp: Marks & Spencer said sales in its clothing and homeware division fell for the seventh straight quarter. M&S today posted its . seventh straight quarterly fall in non-food sales today, as the group . failed to show any improvement in its range of clothing and homewares. Asked about the figures on LBC 97.3, Mr Clegg gave a bit too much away: 'Oh I am a major devotee of Marks & Spencer’s clothing, particularly some articles which I normally wouldn’t talk about on a family radio programme. 'No I was thinking to myself I’m going to go out and buy some extra pairs of socks.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg ssaid he did not think people went to M&S for fashion . However, he also cast doubt on whether M&S's fortunes can be revived with a focus on high-end fashion. 'Well I think it’s a great store.  I heard on the radio this morning them saying that they’re not doing well with fashion items, but I’ve never thought of… do you go to M&S for fashion?  You go to M&S for sort of value for money clothing and I’m not the greatest fashion commercial.' The 129 year-old retailer, which has . become the subject of takeover speculation in recent months, said sales . at its non-food division at stores open over a year fell 3.8 per cent in . the 13 weeks to March 30, its fiscal fourth quarter. The figures were slightly . better than expected. But . M&S, which serves 21million customers a week from over 700 British . stores, had to again rely on strong food sales to support overall . growth. Chief executive Marc Bolland is under pressure to recover M&S's clothing performance after a poor 2012 and disappointing Christmas sales. He has previously warned a new general . merchandise management team led by John Dixon, the former boss of food, . will not make a major impact on sales until M&S launches its . autumn/winter collections in July. But the 3.8 per cent fall in non-food sales was still better than many in the City had expected. Most City analysts had forecast a fall of 4.6 per cent and a revised fall of 3.8 per cent in the third quarter as M&S moved to protect its profit margins by offering fewer discounts in the run up to Christmas. M&S shares were trading 3.6 per cent higher at 397.6p in London following the release of the results. They closed yesterday at 384p, valuing the business at £6.1 billion. Last month M&S shares hit a 28-month high after a newspaper report that the Gulf state of Qatar was planning a bid. A source close to state-owned Qatar Holding denied the report, but speculation of possible private equity interest has persisted. ‘The fourth quarter wasn't as bad as some had expected,’ said James McGregor, director of the retail consultants, Retail Remedy. 'General merchandise is clearly still struggling but these numbers will buy Marc Bolland a few more months. Judgement Day for Marc Bolland will come later this year.’ The trading update also encouraged Sheridan Admans, investment research manager at The Share Centre to rate M&S shares as a ‘buy’. ‘The turnaround of its clothing operation is key to the chief executive keeping his job and we believe that it is tackling the problems in its women’s wear and general merchandise operations. In response to investors, the chief executive has drawn a line in the sand with the expectation of delivering better performance by the autumn, as the retailer prepares to re-vitalise its clothing ranges, Mr Admans said. ‘Investors may be encouraged to see Marks & Spencer post the fastest quarterly sales growth in almost two years.’ Food sales on the same basis rose 4 per cent versus analyst forecasts of an increase of 1.9-3.5 per cent and a third quarter rise of 0.3 per cent. Total UK like-for-like sales rose 0.6 per cent. ‘We are working hard on improving our performance in general merchandise and, despite difficult trading conditions, we made progress in our operational execution,’ Bolland said. ‘In January we said we expect the pressure on consumers' disposable incomes to continue throughout 2013. As a result we were cautious about the outlook for the year ahead and this view remains unchanged.’ British retailers are facing difficult times as consumers has been curtailed by worries over job security and a squeeze on incomes. About two-thirds of Britain’s economic growth comes from consumer spending. M&S’s trading update reflected sentiment elsewhere on the high street. A survey earlier this week  said growth in underlying British retail sales slowed last month despite a boost from an early Easter, as unseasonably cold weather hurt demand for summer clothes and shoes. Last month, Next reported slower trading conditions since the beginning of February. Department store Debenhams issued a profit warning, blaming January snow.","Deputy Prime Minister gives unnecessary insight into his shopping habits .

A man was able to use his Native American roots to secure custody of a two-year-old child he had fathered but signed away all custody rights to, despite the fact the child had been living with her adopted parents since birth. Baby Veronica had been adopted at birth by South Carolina couple Matt and Melanie Capobianco, with Matt even cutting biological mom Christina Maldonado’s umbilical cord. But Dusten Brown, a member of the . Cherokee Nation, claimed the baby's mother . had given the child up without his consent. 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . When . Brown challenged the Capobiancos' adoption, his lawyers cited  the Indian Child Welfare Act, a federal law that gives tribes and . relatives a say in decisions affecting children with Native American . heritage. It was passed in 1978 because of the high . number of Indian children being removed from their homes by public and . private agencies. A South Carolina court . favored his argument that federal law favored the girl living with him . and growing up learning tribal traditions and the child was handed over to him after a court battle in December 2011. Since then the Capobiancos have been fighting to regain custody of their adopted . daughter Veronica, now age 3, and on Tuesday they took their fight to the highest court in the land. Happy family: Matt and Melanie Capobianco were in the delivery room when Veronica was born in Oklahoma in September 2009 . The future of Veronica Brown is being discussed at the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday . September 2009: Baby Veronica is born in Oklahoma, with the Capobiancos present at the birth . January 2010: Dustin Brown signs away his custody rights but days later files an appeal . December 2011: Veronica is handed over to her biological father after a family court in South Carolina grants him custody . July 2012: South Carolina Supreme Court upholds the custody decision . April 2013: U.S. Supreme Court hears an appeal from the Capobiancos . Attorneys on both sides agree that the . Supreme Court, which is hearing the case on Tuesday - although a verdict . isn't expected until the Summer - is unlikely to send Veronica back to . live with the Capobiancos. One . possible outcome is that the court might send the case back to South . Carolina to be reconsidered, which would leave the ultimate outcome . uncertain and mean that Veronica continues to live in Oklahoma. Alternatively the court might . reaffirm the decision to give custody to Brown and effectively end the . Capobianco's chances of regaining the young girl they so dearly love. The Capobiancos appealed to the state Supreme Court last July, claiming they had bonded with Veronica and arguing that removing Veronica was detrimental to her development. But . justices sided with Brown, saying in an emotional opinion that, while . the Capobiancos were ‘ideal parents,’ federal law requires that . custodial preference be given to the child's Native American parent. Meanwhile Brown claims his daughter no longer even . recognizes the family who raised her for the first two years of her . life. She was handed over to him on New Year's Eve 2011 and he says the bonding process was instantaneous. Brown claims Veronica had started to call him ‘Daddy’ within minutes of them meeting and a week after moving to his home in Nowata, Oklahoma, she had also started to call his wife Robin Brown ‘Mommy’. Hopeful: The couple are hoping that the U.S. Supreme Court will allow them to be reunited with their daughter . Sixteen months later, Brown says that he and his wife are 'the only family she has ever know.' 'I know that I'm doing just fine raising my daughter and supporting my wife,' he told Tulsa World. 'I'm always going to be her Daddy, no matter what.' Brown also revealed that the Capobiancos have sent gifts to Veronica with their photos hidden inside. 'When she finds them,' he said, 'she'll always ask us, ""Who are these people?"" She doesn't remember.' In . January the Capobiancos claimed that they have had just one phone call . with Veronica since she left in December 2011 and that they told her . they love her. 'We remain hopeful that our daughter . will finally be able to come home and to have a life where she can be . surrounded by everyone who loves her,' they said in a statement.

More than a dozen states and 23 current and former members of Congress have filed briefs supporting the law ahead of Tuesday's Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl hearing. In addition, the federal government has filed an amicus brief backing the law, as have more than a dozen child welfare organizations. State courts have been at odds on the law's application. The American Association of Adoption Attorneys hopes the matter will be clarified by the high court. The group has filed a brief supporting the Capobiancos' case. It says the court previously has ruled . on the rights of mothers and unwed fathers - rights that, a past . president of the group said, federal law hasn't defined, at least for . Native American children. The Indian Child Welfare Act gives tribes and relatives a say in decisions affecting children with Native American heritage . ‘Those cases clearly state that unwed fathers do not have an automatic fully protected right to participate in decisions about the child,’ Seattle adoption attorney Mark Demaray said last week during a conference call with reporters. Case law aside, Demaray said, the emotional aspects of the case are hard to ignore. 'We often refer to cases like this one before the Supreme Court as a tragic situation we all want to avoid,' Demaray said.

Chemist Direct claims that sales of products such as Slimfast and BioBurn have risen by 46 per cent . If you are frantically trying to get in shape for the summer after a failed New Year diet, you are not alone. An online pharmacy has reported that demand for slimming products has soared in the last month. Chemist Direct claims that sales of such products were 46 per cent higher in March than they were in January. Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist at Chemist Direct, said: ‘These are boomerang dieters who with the best intentions started dieting in January, but gave up after a few weeks. 'With summer around the corner, they are now having another go.’ The figures come after a survey by weight loss firm XLS-Medical revealed that the vast majority of people fail to stick to their diets for more than five days a week. It also found that 20 per cent of dieters admit to having their first diet relapse just four days into their diet. Most reported that hunger was the main reason for their diet failure. Chemist Direct believes that the rise in demand for slimming products such as Slimfast, Alli and Bioburn may have been caused by people wanting to get in shape for beach holidays in the May half term. Easter may also have played a part, with people returning to the fattening foods they had given up for Lent. Mr El-Gohary explained that overindulgence at Easter is likely to be a cause as Chemist Direct has also seen a surge in sales of indigestion treatments such as Alka-Seltzer and Rennie. The company says many of these people are 'boomerang dieters' who started dieting in January with the best intentions, but gave up after a few weeks . He said: ‘Indigestion causes pain or . discomfort in the stomach and chest after eating and other symptoms . include nausea, heartburn and feeling bloated. ‘We saw a rise in the number of customers contacting us for advice on treating indigestion, and many admitted they had overindulged on rich foods and were suffering as a result.’ Based on orders, Chemist Direct has compiled a top ten of indigestion hotspots in the UK, with the top place going to Liverpool, closely followed by London and Brighton. Also making the top ten were Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Coventry, Stirling, Wigan and Blackburn.","Sales of diet products up 46%, says online pharmacy .

For arthritis sufferers who have pain in their hands, everyday tasks such as tying shoelaces or picking up a kettle can be a struggle. But for patients whose condition cannot be eased with steroid injections, doctors are offering a radical alternative – finger or thumb-joint replacements. Although less common than hip or knee-replacement surgery, it can bring the same benefits of pain relief and, potentially, increased mobility. ‘ . The most common cause of stiffness in the hand joints is osteoarthritis and this can be very painful,’ says Mr Mike Hayton, a consultant orthopaedic hand surgeon at the Wrightington Hospital in Wigan. Pure magic: Richard Smith was performing again three months after his thumb operation . ‘In patients for whom other treatments such as steroid injections have been ineffective, surgery is a real option.’ Osteoarthritis is a condition where the cartilage – a smooth substance that coats the ends of a joint and allows sliding movements – becomes worn away so that bare bone rubs on bare bone, causing stiffness and pain. It affects about eight million Britons. One NHS patient who has benefited from a new thumb joint is professional magician Richard Smith. Although the 58-year-old from Kirkby, Merseyside, does not have arthritis, he was left unable to move his left thumb after a DIY accident with a power drill. ‘Mr Smith’s interphalangeal joint – the one just below the nail – fused,’ explains Mr Hayton, who performed the operation. ‘The bone grew across the joint, so there was no movement. For most people that wouldn’t be a problem, but for Mr Smith, it meant that he was unable to perform his intricate tricks. To regain movement, his only option was a thumb-joint replacement.’ The procedure is the same as that for finger joints. First, the ends of two bones are removed with a small surgical saw, via a 3cm incision in the back of the thumb. A cavity is then made inside the bone canal – the honeycomb-like inner – for the stem of the implant to sit in. This shaft is created with a reamer, a serrated metal instrument the same size as the implant stem. A trial implant is inserted first in order to assess movement range, alignment and joint stability. Once the fit feels right, the trial implant is removed and a sterilised joint replacement is inserted instead. Mr Smith has a one-piece implant – ‘basically it’s a silicone hinge that bends when the thumb is flexed and straightens when the thumb is extended’, says Mr Hayton. ‘These implants are generally very safe.’ Two-piece components made from metal and plastic can also be used but they are technically more difficult to fit, and cannot be used where there has been a lot of damage to the joint or bones as they may dislocate. The procedure can be done under general or local anaesthetic and takes about 20 minutes. Mr Hayton prefers to use a local anaesthetic. ‘That way I can ask the patient to move their finger or thumb and ensure there’s enough movement and stability,’ he says. Following surgery, a patient sees a specialist hand physiotherapist to begin a rehabilitation programme, and can usually resume normal activities within six to eight weeks. ‘The operation is effective for pain relief and may improve movement, but based on patient data we don’t promise increased movement,’ says Mr Hayton. ‘Joint-replacement often preserves rather than improves motion. Relieving pain is the greatest motivation for this kind of operation as pain makes people miserable and can restrict their activities.’ Richard, who underwent his procedure in November 2011, was performing again just three months later. He can flex his thumb without pain and is delighted with the results. ‘My first thought when the joint fused was how I could do my card and coin tricks,’ he says. ‘During the operation, I felt like crying when I saw the joint moving again. Now I’m just so happy.’ mikehayton.com .","Professional magician Richard Smith back at his old tricks thanks to op .

It was a day when old friends reunited and bitter enemies were urged to put aside their battles. But there were probably few attending Baroness Thatcher's funeral who found this request more difficult than Cherie Blair and Gordon Brown. The two have had a notoriously tricky relationship in private - and often in public - for much of the past 15 years, and their rare meetings are still fraught with tension. But when they met at St Paul's Cathedral today the pair managed to greet each other with impeccable grace, as Brown placed his hand on her arm and leaned in to kiss his arch-rival's wife on the cheek.

Tony Blair greets Samantha Cameron, the wife of Prime Minister David Cameron, at today's funeral . Mr Brown and Mrs Blair's spat stretches back more than a decade. In her candid autobiography Speaking For Myself, released in 2008, Cherie Blair accused Gordon Brown, then Chancellor, of trying to drive her husband Tony Blair out of Number 10 since as far back as April 2004, and it was publicly known that she didn't want him to succeed her husband. Cherie claimed then that Brown had been 'rattling the keys' above Tony Blair's head, but that even as Mr Blair considered stepping down, Mr Brown refused to back his plans on city academies, foundation hospitals and pension reforms. She added: 'Tony would have stood down, there is no question. Instead of which Tony felt he had no option but to stay on and fight for the things he believed in. When Brown then took the stage at Labour's 2006 annual conference in Manchester to claim he felt privileged to have worked with Blair, the premier's wife Cherie was reputedly overheard saying 'well, that's a lie', by Carolin Lotter, a TV producer with the American news agency Bloomberg. Both Downing Street and Mrs Blair denied the story, with Cherie telling reporters: 'Honestly, guys, I hate to spoil your story, but I didn't say it and I don't believe it either.' But the incident caused further rifts in an already fragile relationship between the Browns and the Blairs.

"By . Conrad Black . PUBLISHED: . 16:27 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:08 EST, 28 October 2012 . My friendly acquaintance of many years, Jeremy Paxman, was arraigning me on the litany of false charges still cherished by much of the British press, partly from malice, but mainly from simple ignorance of the distant and prolonged disintegration of the US government’s case against me. I had returned to Britain, after an absence of seven years, four hours before. Familiar and unfounded though his allegations were, the jut-jawed righteousness with which he called me a criminal, the head-boy pieties, and this crusader of truth’s imperturbable innocence of the profound corruption of the American legal system, stirred me from the fatigue of overnight air travel. He should have known better, but there is no reason why his viewers, or The Mail on Sunday’s readers, should. The 17 criminal charges against me were all abandoned, rejected by jurors, or unanimously vacated by the Supreme Court of the United States. I won: Jeremy Paxman's accusations were unfounded and ignorant and Ian Hislop is a banana, says former owner of the Daily Telegraph Conrad Black . The authors of the allegations that led to the criminal charges have agreed to pay me $6 million (£3.7 million), almost four times the largest previous libel settlement in Canadian history. The US Supreme Court remanded back to an appeals judge it had excoriated the vacated counts for assessment of his own errors, to see if any part of the prosecution should survive. The unchastened lower court judge retrieved the two least counts, putting a fig-leaf on the failed prosecution. I had been sent to prison for three years, where I was a tutor and was able to help more than 100 students. And, with access to emails, I was able to build an American and Canadian weekly readership of my magazine and newspaper columns of about four million. I made the most of a bad hand. The pitiful vestiges of the case against me are again under appeal, and here I was, wearily listening to the wide-faced priggishness of good old Jeremy. I played my part and recited the facts, somewhat histrionically. My inquisitor fell back to, ‘But you were convicted.’ More facts, tedious and inconvenient, were called for. In American prosecutions, 97 per cent of cases result in guilty pleas and avoid trials. And 85 per cent of the three per cent that are tried result in convictions and sentences four times as severe as the sentences of those who waive their constitutional right to a trial. Inquisitor: Jeremy Paxman interviewed Conrad Black about his time in prison in the U.S. The procedural rules are terribly uneven in favour of the prosecutors, who speak last to the jury, which relies entirely on its memory, even in a complicated four-month commercial trial like that of my co-defendants and myself. The great majority of American judges are ex-prosecutors. The conviction rate in the US is 150 per cent that of Canada and almost twice that of the UK, and the prosecutors of both those countries would be disbarred for the plea bargaining-extortion and subornation that is the core of the American system. In our case, convictions were only produced on the basis of the Honest Services Statute, which was designed to deal with bribes, and was unanimously struck down by the high court as unconstitutional and inapplicable on the facts. The United States is being milked by an avaricious legal cartel that drains away ten per cent of the annual GDP and terrorised by a lawless prosecutocracy that tore down a six-term US Senator, Ted Stevens, who was subsequently proved to have been framed on the basis of false evidence. This scandalous official corruption and hypocrisy, which strikes to the heart of America’s claim to be a society of laws and respect for individual liberties, is becoming a matter of journalistic concern in the United States. But none of my interviewers in this busy press week in London seemed to have the least awareness of it. No contest: Conrad Black disagrees that Ian Hislop got the better of him on Have I Got News For You on Friday . These were the odds I faced in the American courts, 99.5 to one, and this was what I faced in the London media as I promoted my book, A Matter Of Principle. The book recounts the events and the daunting correlation of forces between my legal and journalistic accusers and myself. This latest trip into the lion’s den began when The Sunday Times cancelled my planned interview with the admirable Eleanor Mills, and sent the notorious Camilla Long in her place to Toronto to write the hit job published there last week. Armed with a box of chocolates and fine photographs of my wife and her dogs, she caused me to agree to the very fair interview in The Mail on Sunday with Elizabeth Sanderson, published on the same day. Ms Long acted in conformity with the inexplicable Murdoch policy of assailing me at every opportunity since the problem arose (apart from The Wall Street Journal’s magnanimous apology in its leading editorial when I was upheld in the US Supreme Court). So did Sky’s Adam Boulton, the day after the Paxman encounter, with similarly pyrotechnic results, although time, if not taste or fairness, prevented him from dredging up the Murdochian myth that I had been driven by a spendthrift and overbearing wife (who has in fact been magnificent beyond praise) to prodigies of extravagance. Boulton could do with a lengthy term in charm school, despite having somehow attracted the lovely Anji Hunter. Love is blind, I guess. I am grateful for, and accept as an olive branch, Rupert Murdoch’s tweet this week commending my performance at The Daily Telegraph and ascribing my legal travails, accurately, to the betrayal of a former associate. The rest of the week has been quite civil, although I write without having seen Have I Got News For You. My captain, Paul Merton, and the chairman, Alexander Armstrong, were very gracious, though Ian Hislop, as I suggested to him, has not progressed much beyond his days as editor of Passing Wind. I will deal with Tom Bower, exhumed briefly by Newsnight, in the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto. The book has been well launched and the London media have been updated. And I am truly grateful to many British friends for their solidarity through these difficult years since I was last here, especially those who visited and emailed me in prison, and for their hospitality this week. Barbara and I will be back in the New Year, and look forward to it. Since his return to Britain, Conrad Black has been busy, including appearing on BBC1’s Have I Got News For You on Friday. The first of his combative altercations with team captain and Private Eye editor Ian Hislop arose from a debate about George Osborne travelling first-class. Host Alexander Armstrong turned this into a discussion about Black’s fortune. AA: I think I read in Vanity Fair that you said that despite everything you are still worth about $80 million. Is that right?CB: . No, I had said I had lost 80 per cent of my money fighting this . oppression from the United States government.

The main battle, however, took place after Black was asked to answer a question about David Cameron’s speech on crime . . .AA: Also this week, what has David Cameron been saying about criminals . . . um . . . Conrad?CB: That in this great United Kingdom those officially so designated may actually have broken the law and that this  is a departure from some transatlantic customs.IH: He didn’t really make a decision that innocent people should not go to jail, did he?CB: Does this require the  truth, Alexander?IH: I know you’re not used to that, Conrad.CB: Not used to hearing it, certainly.IH: What about from the jury?CB: Nine acquittals and they sort of ran out of steam but the Supreme Court made up for it unanimously.IH: No, you didn’t run out of steam, you ran into jail. They found you guilty didn’t they? The jury?CB: Nine acquittals complemented by a unanimous vacation of the four guilty verdicts by the Supreme Court of the US.IH: But two stuck didn’t they? One for fraud and one for obstruction of justice.CB: No, no, oh Ian, please . . .IH: Oh, stop reciting the verdict as though it was true. CB: A little respect for due process, Ian. You’re a banana. [Earlier, Black referred to the Private Eye editor’s famous quote, after losing a libel action: ‘If that’s justice, then I’m a banana.’] IH: I do respect it. I am not  a banana. All I am saying is that you were found guilty.  Of two counts. Which stood. You went to jail. You’ve come back. You would like to be rehabilitated.CB: No, I have been rehabilitated and  I am proud to have been cleared by the Supreme Court unanimously, and I have come here . . . IH: You weren’t cleared! You have come here to say you’re innocent, which is sweet but not true.Panellists were then shown a clip from Jeremy Paxman’s Newsnight interview with Black, in which the peer said he was proud he had endured the tense exchange without ‘getting up and smashing your face in’.AA: Did that feel good?CB: Not as good as doing it .  .  .  No .  .  .

A major earthquake on the Iran border killed at least 35 people in neighbouring Pakistan yesterday. Pakistani officials said hundreds of houses had been destroyed, while Iran appeared to have emerged relatively unscathed with reports that just 27 people were injured. The epicentre of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake was measured at 51 miles below ground, which was the likely reason for the relatively low level of damage in Iran. However, a number of remote Pakistani villages took the brunt of the shockwave, with many reporting rising death tolls. People evacuate buildings bringing traffic to a halt in Karachi, Pakistan, the city nearest the border with Iran where a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck . Early reports suggest that 40 have so far died but there is no information on damage. Pictured here is the aftermath in Karachi in Pakistan, which was also shaken . The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at 10.44 GMT at a depth of 9.4 miles. People in the city of Zahedan poured into the streets when the earthquake struck, Iran's Fars news agency reported. All communications in the area have been cut, the Iranian Red Crescent's Mahmoud Mozaffar told state television. Rescue teams have been dispatched to the affected area, he said. 'In the aftermath of this earthquake five evaluation teams from the Khash and Saravan branches were sent to the area to assess damage,' Mozaffar said. The epicenter was in southeast Iran in an area of mountains and desert, 125 miles south-east of Zahedan and 2155 miles north-west of Turbat in Pakistan, USGS said. On April 9, a powerful 6.3 magnitude quake struck close to Iran's only nuclear power station, killing 37 people, injuring 850 and devastating two villages.

American Airlines is trying to recover from a public relations nightmare after a massive technology glitch meant that its entire fleet was grounded yesterday, stranding tens of thousands of angry passengers. Though the nation's third-biggest airline has promised to be nearly operational today, the hangover from yesterday's online reservation system meant that many travelers are still stuck in airports. The company has employed the use of social media - especially Twitter - to do damage control, informing irate passengers on when they might expect to make it to their final destinations.

Grounded: A passenger talks to an AA ticket agent in Atlanta after all flights were cancelled . On Tuesday, American and sister . airline American Eagle canceled 970 flights and delayed at least 1,068 . more by early evening, according to flight-tracking service . FlightAware.com. That means . American and Eagle canceled or delayed nearly two-thirds of their . scheduled flights after they lost access to a computer system that's . used for everything from issuing boarding passes to determining how much . fuel to pump into the plane. Passengers took to social media sites to . criticize the airline, which for hours could only apologize and say that . it was trying to fix the problem. The man who will lead American in a . few months, US Airways CEO Doug Parker, has said he would prefer to . convert his planes and employees to American's computer system rather . than the other way around. US Airways declined to comment on whether Tuesday's breakdown would cause Parker to rethink his plans. The computer outage began snarling . operations around midmorning. Eventually the Federal Aviation . Administration issued a so-called ground stop for American Airlines jets . around the country. Flights already in the air were . allowed to continue to their destinations, but planes on the ground from . coast to coast could not take off. And travelers could do little to get . back in the air until the computer system was restored. By late afternoon, American resumed . international flights and those from its major hub airports. It . scrambled during the evening to put planes and crews in position to get . off to a good start on Wednesday morning. Issues: Security checks passengers bags at the American airlines terminal at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday . 'Despite the magnitude of today's . disruption, we are pleased to report that we expect our operation to run . normally with only a small number of flight cancellations' on . Wednesday, said Andrea Huguely, a spokeswoman for American. She said . American would add flights to accommodate stranded passengers. American blamed the outage on a loss . of access to computer networks that are used for flight reservations and . many other functions. Airlines commonly rely on such . systems to track passengers and bags, monitor who boards planes, and . update flight schedules and gate assignments. The computers are also . used to file flight plans and tell employees which seats should be . filled to ensure that the plane is properly balanced. American's system is hosted by Sabre . Holdings, a one-time division of American that was spun off into a . separate travel-reservations technology company. American said the . outage wasn't Sabre's fault, and other airlines that use Sabre didn't . experience problems. At airports, customers whose flights . were canceled couldn't rebook on a later flight. Passengers already at . the airport were stuck in long lines or killed time in gate areas. 'Tensions are high. A lot of people . are getting mad. I've seen several yelling at the American agents,' said . Julie Burch, a business-meeting speaker who was stuck at Dallas-Fort . Worth International Airport waiting for a flight to Denver. 'Nobody can . tell us anything.' Terry Anzur, a TV news consultant . from Los Angeles who was also stranded in Dallas, said American Airlines . gate employees were doing everything the old-fashioned, manual way . because their computers were useless. 'No one at the counter can do anything. They can't check people in,' Anzur said. 'The airline is at a dead halt.' Theoretically, an airline could do . the same work as the reservation system manually for any one flight. But . doing it for hundreds of flights isn't practical. American and Eagle . operate about 3,300 flights a day. Now, if the reservations systems go . down, 'most airlines would be pretty much without the ability to fly . more than a very limited number of flights,' said Scott Nason, . American's former technology chief and now a consultant. Chaos: Passengers at the American Airlines counter wait for checking in to their flights at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday . Nason said airlines find and fix the . problem, but the next time something else causes an outage. One time, a . possum chewed through a cable in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bringing down the . whole system. Another time, a worker in the airline's data center used a . metal tool instead of an insulated, rubber-coated one - a short-circuit . crashed much of the system, he said. Brent Bowen, a professor of aviation . technology at Purdue University, said massive system failures are . inevitable as airlines grow increasingly reliant on technology. 'As those systems get bigger and more . complex, at some point you're going to have a systemic failure,' Bowen . said. He added that financially strapped airlines may have underinvested . in technology during the past decade, making the computer systems more . vulnerable.

Convicted rapist: Max Factor heir Andrew Luster was sentenced to 50 years in jail yesterday after his 124-year prison term was thrown out . Andrew Luster, an heir to the Max Factor fortune who was convicted of drugging and raping three women, was resentenced Tuesday to a reduced 50-year term by a judge who earlier threw out an original sentence of 124 years. After the hearing yesterday, . 49-year-old Luster, who has been in prison for a decade, cried in the . courtroom and said he was 'incredibly grateful' for Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz' resentencing. 'I did some really stupid things without thinking,' said Luster. 'It's caused so much damage to so many people. There is more to me than this salacious and lurid story.' Attorneys for Luster had said they would ask the judge to give him a sentence . of 25 years or less. Under the new sentence, he will be eligible for parole in 15 years, prosecutors said. Luster's lawyers Jay Leiderman and J. David Nick said in court documents filed last month that Luster is not a . sexual predator and has had a 'stellar performance' in prison, the . Ventura County Star reported. Prosecutors argued in a sentencing . memorandum filed last week that Luster's sentence was appropriate, but . the original court's reasoning needed to be explained. 'The original sentence was not . erroneous – only the record needed to be corrected,' Deputy District . Attorney Michelle Contois wrote. It was not clear whether Stoltz would hand down the new sentence at Monday's hearing or sometime afterward. Last month the judge refused a . request to throw out Luster's conviction, but granted him a resentencing . hearing, writing in her ruling that the court 'failed to state specific . reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' as the law requires. Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor, was arrested in 2000 and . charged with giving three women the drug GHB and raping them at his . beachfront home while they were unconscious. He was convicted in 2003 in absentia . of 86 counts including rape of an intoxicated person, rape of an . unconscious person and sexual battery. He fled to Mexico during the . trial. He was captured the same year in Mexico by . reality TV bounty hunter Duane 'Dog' Chapman in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta. New hearing: Luster, left, is led out of the U.S. Customs building at LAX by FBI agents a day after being captured by Dog the Bounty Hunter in Mexico in June 2003 . Last month Chapman revealed that he got a vital tip-off about the fugitive's hiding place from Luster's own attorney, the late Richard Sherman. The . make-up heir ultimately sought a new sentencing hearing, and Stoltz ruled last month that the . judge who sent him to prison for 124 years 'failed to state specific . reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' rather than having them . run concurrently. 'The . previously imposed sentence is vacated and a new sentencing hearing . will be held,' Stoltz wrote in her 28-page opinion that also denied him a . new trial. The judge set an April 4 sentencing hearing for Luster. Attorneys . for the Max Factor heir had argued he deserved one, in part because his . original attorneys presented weak defenses at trial and that one . lawyer, Richard Sherman, gave him ill-conceived advice to flee to . Mexico. Bounty hunter and TV star, Chapman told Radar Online that Sherman gave him very useful clues as to Luster's location. Reality TV star: Dog the Bounty Hunter, pictured, caught Luster while he was on the run in 2003. Last month, he revealed that he was tipped off about Luster's location by the fugitives own attorney . As Radar Online reports, Sherman passed away in April 2011. The lawyer had always refuted the idea that he had given away his client's hiding place. But according to 'Dog' the attorney did give him the information, in a very subtle way. 'Sherman became very nice to me,' Chapman explained to Radar. 'We used to tease each other. And at one point he said to me, ""I’m going to tell you something Dog, so don’t be so dumb."" And then he said, ""The guy (Luster) speaks Spanish. Do you get it?""' The bounty hunter immediately understood. 'I had leads that pointed to Thailand and Mexico,' he said. 'Right then I dropped all my leads on Thailand and focused on Mexico.' Chapman captured Luster in June 2003 and was briefly jailed himself as bounty hunting is illegal in Mexico. Judge Kathryne Stoltz ruled last month that the judge who sent Luster to prison for 124 years 'failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' rather than having them run concurrently . On Monday, Stoltz wrote that Luster's attorneys did not fail him at trial, and she rejected his current lawyers' arguments that Luster was manipulated into fleeing. 'Although several witnesses did describe Luster as 'childlike,' it appears that this was primarily because he did not have to work at a regular job due to the fact that he had a trust fund, and he lived the life of a carefree 'beach bum,' Stoltz wrote. She added that Luster, who spent much of his time surfing, described himself as being involved in real estate and stock trading, and that he did not appear to have a low IQ. Luster was found guilty of giving three women the date rape drug GHB and raping them while they were unconscious or intoxicated. Video tape Luster took of his sexual acts with the women was presented against him at trial.","Andrew Luster, great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor, was resentenced on Tuesday to a reduced term of 50 years for 86 counts of rape .

Kate McCann has revealed she would now be able to forgive whoever abducted her missing daughter Madeleine. The 45-year-old, of Rothley, Leicestershire, whose daughter was snatched from Praia da Luz in Portugal six years ago in May, said she spent years despising the person who took her. But practising Catholic Mrs McCann, who is also mother to eight-year-old twins Sean and Amelie, insisted she no longer has to understand the motive behind the abduction to offer forgiveness. She told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I think I could probably forgive Madeleine’s abductor whatever the circumstances. I don’t know whether it’s simply because I’m stronger or because there’s no benefit in not forgiving someone. 'I can’t change anything and I don’t want to be eaten up by hatred and bitterness. 'And maybe there is an element of pity - what kind of person could do something like this? Of course, forgiveness will always be easier if there is remorse.’ Mrs McCann also said she recently stopped at a petrol station and left her children in the back seat of the car, while still in view as she went to pay - the first time she had done this in six years.

Three sisters who brought their 80-year-old mother into A&E after a fall and watched her condition deteriorate over one week have spoken about the trauma of watching a parent pass away, whatever their age. Rose Watson was admitted to King's College Hospital after she'd had a fall in her south-east London home and, unable to get up, had lain on the floor alone for six hours. Rose finally managed to contact a doctor, who visited, checked her over and sat her back in bed, but when Rose's three daughters Debbie, Sandra and Christine arrived they were horrified at how unwell their mother looked, immediately phoning an ambulance to take her to A&E. The 'Three Sisters' episode of 24 Hours in A&E features siblings Debbie, Sandra and Christine . Speaking to MailOnline, Debbie said: 'She was very ill since the October before the February in 2012 when she went in. She had bad lungs, a hip replacement, two valves in her heart, pneumonia twice, skin complaints, a hameatoma in her leg, chest infections... there were lots of issues. 'She hated going in to hospitals, though, because she didn't want to be a burden! She always found some way of getting out of going in, and if she was in she'd lie in order to escape. 'But when we saw her after her fall we knew she was deteriorating. She looked awful. We knew immediately, in our heart of hearts, that something was very wrong.' Rose, whose story has been documented in 24 Hours In A&E which airs tonight on Channel 4, was admitted to hospital and her daughters were told that if her condition worsened she would not be put on a ventilator or resuscitated since there was nothing that could be done - it would only prolong the inevitable. 'It was only when they said that, that we knew she wasn't going to make it. It was awful. You take people to hospital to get them better, so when the doctors - who were all absolute angels - say they're not going to save someone, it's a big punch. 'Trying to contemplate how you're going to live without your mum. It's hard at any age. It was over a year ago but I could still cry about it now. 'It's strange, but our dad died eight years before, and when you lose both you really do feel like an orphan. You still feel that loss.' The sisters took their mother into A&E after a fall and watched her condition deteriorate over one week . Rose's three daughters and her son Michael chose not to tell their mother how ill she was, instead telling her everything was fine in order not to make her anxious. 'We were devastated not to be able to properly say goodbye and that we loved her one last time, but we didn't want to all start saying it because then she would have known something bad was happening. 'It must be awful to know you're dying but that there's nothing you can do about it. I'd hate to be told that, and the thought of putting my children through what we went through with mum kills me. 'But it would have been selfish to tell her what was really happening to her. The way we did it she wasn't anxious or worried: we stayed with her in the family room all week, and we were all having the same old funny family banter we always had and doing the crossword together right up until the end! 'In the show it looks like we were having a party round her bed, but really we just wanted her to know that we were happy and all OK and that we were there for her. We had to hide our crying from her to keep her calm.' In the end, the sisters think Rose had made peace with what was happening. Debbie said: 'There were telltale signs. She held my sister's hand and patted it in an unusual way, like she was trying to make us feel better, and she told us she loved us. She seemed peaceful, like she wasn't fighting it. I hope that afterwards she met my dad up there and they're having a good time together.' Rose's three daughters and her son Michael chose not to tell their mother how ill she was and she spent her last hours doing a crossword . Speaking about her mother as a young woman, Debbie said: 'She was just the best mum in the world: wonderful, unselfish, always put everyone else first. 'We were her life. She didn't go out . dancing, she always stayed in and looked after us in our east London home. She was very homely, all her . money went on us, buying clothes for us and cooking all the cockney recipes and telling us tales of the east end. 'The funny thing is, our mum is the last person in the world who would ever have signed up for anything like a TV show. When we came into the hospital and the staff said she'd agreed to filming we thought she must have been delirious with medication and high on oxygen. 'But she just said, ""Tell the kids to eat their hearts out with X-Factor, I'm going to be on telly before they will"", and she was right! We still have no idea why she did it, but with all the spin-offs and media attention and interesting people we've met... it's like her way of staying with us and keeping the family together. 'The people who worked on the programme, like the hospital staff, were amazing. So kind and lovely and respectful. Everyone has gone above and beyond the call of duty. 'The thing is, Mum's life was always about helping others, and now this is her time.

Distraught: Driver Shannon McGarrigle told an inquest of the moment schoolboy Sam Belcher stepped out in front of her . A teenage driver has told of the moment a suicidal schoolboy sprinted into the path of her car with arms outstretched 'like Superman'. Shannon McGarrigle wept as she told an inquest how Sam Belcher, 15, had been running along the side of a road in the village of Pamber Heath, near Tadley, Hampshire, when he dashed in front of her Ford KA. 'He started jogging away from me, he kept turning and looking at me,' Miss McGarrigle, told Alton Magistrates Court. 'He was metres away when he ran out in front of my car with his arms out in front of him, like Superman. He pretty much ran out in front. I went to swerve while he kept jogging. 'I stopped straight away.' Sam suffered multiple injuries in the accident which happened at around 2.30am just four days before Christmas last year. Miss McGarrigle told the court she dialled 999 and stayed with Sam until paramedics arrived at the scene, describing the wait as the 'loneliest 10 minutes' of her life. 'I kept talking to him throughout,' she told North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley. ""The lady on the phone said 'keep talking to him to see if you can get a response'. 'I don't know whether he was conscious.' The hearing at Alton Magistrates' Court was told that Sam would have been unconscious from the moment of impact. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, he was pronounced dead shortly after the collision. His cause of death was given as severe head injuries. Police investigators agreed there was nothing that Miss McGarrigle could have done to avoid colliding with Sam as he ran into Silchester Road, less than a mile from his home. Sam Belcher ran into the path of the Ford Ka on Silchester Road in Pamber Heath, Hampshire, just a mile from his home . 'The driver was confronted with a pedestrian in the road who she was unable to avoid and tragically the pedestrian suffered fatal injuries,' said PC Andrew McDonald. The inquest heard that Sam had complained of feeling low in the months before his death and had been referred to mental health professionals by both his GP and his school, Hurst Community College in Tadley. Sam's headteacher, Malcolm Christian, told the hearing that Sam was a 'pleasant pupil, who always appeared bubbly and happy.' He said that Sam had a good academic record but that his attendance had slipped in the two months before his death. Mr Christain said that school support staff had flagged up their concerns about Sam and that his mother Claire had also kept him up to date with what the boy was going through - as did Sam himself. Dr Suzanne Gray, a psychologist, had been working with Sam and his mother and said that while Mrs Belcher had put his low mood down to a prior experience of bullying, the teenager had not agreed. 'Mrs Belcher related it to an experience of bullying but Sam did not equate with that,' she said. 'In the last few months he had an increasingly low mood. He said 'I can't find joy in life any more', and 'I wake up thinking this day is not going to go my way'.' The inquest heard Sam had come to the end of his sessions with Dr Gray, by mutual consent, and that when he was re-referred to her team in November 2012 he had to join the back of a waiting list and was not seen again prior to his death on December 21. Mr Bradley said that Sam had sought help and raised concerns that Sam was not seen sooner on his re-referral. 'He's effectively been taken off the conveyor belt and his re-referral puts him back at the beginning of the conveyor belt,' he said. 'I find this incomprehensible and it is certainly something that bears examination because the situation for Sam is clearly one of plummetting downhill and he is not handling whatever is causing him trouble.'

Researchers have revealed further 'concrete hints' of the elusive material called dark matter at an underground laboratory in the US. Though it is believed to make up a quarter of our universe, dark matter has never been directly observed. However, US researchers working deep inside a mine in Minnesota using an experiment called  CDMS - which stands for . Cryogenic Dark Matter Search - say they now have promising results. Researchers at the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search deep inside a mine in Minnesota . Dark matter accounts for most of the mass in the Universe. It surrounds galaxies . across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It . cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be . out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we . can see. Galaxies, for . example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without . the presence of dark matter, researchers say. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' The experiment is designed to catch rare interactions . when dark matter particles 'bump into' the nuclei of atoms in a detector . that is held at temperatures near that of deep space. Scientists at the American Physical Society reported a WIMP, or weakly interacting massive particle, signal at a level known as 3-sigma level, . which indicates a 99.8 percent chance they have found dark matter. The mysterious substance is believed to hold the . cosmos together but to date has never been directly observed. 'In high-energy physics, a discovery is only claimed at 5-sigma or . better,' Texas A&M high-energy physicist . Rupak Mahapatra said. 'So this is certainly very exciting, but not . fully convincing by the standards. 'We just need more data to be sure. 'For now, we have to live with this tantalizing hint of one of the . biggest puzzles of our time.' Notoriously elusive, WIMPs rarely interact with normal matter and . therefore are difficult to detect. Scientists believe they occasionally . bounce off atomic nuclei, leaving . behind a small amount of energy capable of being tracked by detectors . deep underground, particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider . at CERN and even instruments in space like the Alpha Magnetic . Spectrometer (AMS) mounted on the International Space Station (ISS). The CDMS experiment, located a half-mile underground at the Soudan . mine in northern Minnesota and managed by the United States Department . of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has been searching . for dark matter since 2003. The experiment uses very sophisticated detector technology and . advanced analysis techniques to enable cryogenically cooled (almost . absolute zero temperature at -460 degrees F) germanium and silicon . targets to search for the rare recoil of dark matter particles. The experiment is designed to catch rare interactions when dark matter particles 'bump into' the nuclei of atoms in a detector that is held at temperatures near that of deep space . In the field of particle physics, there is a scale range which is used to determine whether or not a discovery has been made: The five-sigma level of certainty. The level relates to the probability that an experiment's results are down to chance. In other words, how likely it is that the scientists were correct, rather than just lucky. 1-sigma means a 68.3 percent likelihood the results are genuine. 2-sigma means 99.449 percent, 3-sigma means 99.73 percent, 4-sigma 99.993 percent, 5-sigma 99.999 percent. At 5-sigma, findings are accepted as discoveries. However, researchers admit they have more work to do. 'We are only 99.8 percent sure, and we want to be 99.9999 percent sure,' Mahapatra said. 'At 3-sigma, you have a hint of something. At 4-sigma, . you have evidence. At 5-sigma, you have a discovery. 'In medicine, you can say you are curing 99.8 percent of the cases, and . that's OK. 'When you say you've made a fundamental discovery in . high-energy physics, you can't be wrong. 'Given the money involved -- $30 . million in this case -- it has to be extremely precise. 'With a 99.8 . percent chance, that means if you repeated the same experiment a few . hundred times, there is one chance it can go wrong. 'We want one out of a . million instead.' The AMS - a kind of particle accelerator and nicknamed the 'space LHC' in reference to the Large Hadron Collider here on Earth. The first results from the instrument on the International Space Station have found a 'glimpse' of what could be dark matter . Researchers say the different experiments being carried out around the world - and on the International Space Station - are slowly revealing more about dark matter. 'We're actually in a good situation in the whole of the field,' said Bernard Sadoulet of the University of California Berkeley, referring to the four types of experiments being used around the world - and within it and below it - to finally track dark matter down. 'These four ways… we can rely on to help us work through these hints,' he told the meeting. The new 'recipe for the universe': Planck's high-precision cosmic microwave background map has allowed scientists to extract the most refined values yet of the Universe's ingredients.","Discovery made in lab deep inside a US mine in Minnesota .

A frightened mother is demanding a new home for her and her young family - because she is convinced their terraced house is haunted by the ghost of a man called Nigel. Housing association tenant Stacey McGill claims a spiritual presence flicks lights on and off, tampers with electrical appliances, moves posters around the walls and causes the floorboards to creak at the property in Loughborough. The 29-year-old, who moved into the house last December with her partner Carl, 25, and their 18-month-old daughter Chelsey, said a medium she hired to investigate the property confirmed a 'male energy' at their home. Spooked: Stacey McGill, 29, is convinced the family home in School Street, Loughborough, is haunted . Paranormal: The mother-of-one claims a 'presence' in the house has flicked lights on and off, moved posters around the walls, and caused the floorboards to creak . Paranormal investigator Dave Vickers said he felt a ghost run through his body at Ms McGill's home, and told how he allowed the spirit to communicate with the mother-of-one via a scrawled message on a piece of paper. He described sensing the presence of a man aged in his late 30s whose name was Nigel. Ms McGill said: 'We came back from the shops yesterday and as I went to get some cereal the light went on without anyone touching the switch. It's so unnerving. 'I noticed that something was there . when I moved in straight away. I just felt cobwebs all over my skin. I . knew it wasn't right. Then Carl said that he had felt the same. 'Next the microwave started going on and off by itself and posters have moved around the walls. 'One . morning we were woken at 3am by the sound of maintenance works. It was . so loud. But there were no work men, it was the ghost.' Ms McGill eventually contacted Mr Vickers, who has since made two visits to her home with infrared night vision camcorders, EMF metres to measure electrical magnetic frequency, and digital cameras.' 'He confirmed that there is a presence here,' Ms McGill said. 'We . were in a flat around the corner before. We didn't have any problems . there. I just want the housing association to find me somewhere to live . that isn't haunted. 'The . last tenant did not experience anything. But some people are more . susceptible to ghosts than others.

Mr Vickers, from TSL Holistic Centre, twice visited Ms McGill's home with Carly Adams from the Female Paranormal Investigation team to examine her claims. 'On entering the house I was immediately aware of energy at the end of the hall way, the energy presented itself as a male, and kept saying ""I am at the back"",' said Mr Vickers. 'A lot of the activity occurred to the back of the property, mainly the rear bedroom. Going up the stairs the male energy made his presence more known, cold spots were experienced. 'I picked up on a man in his late thirties, however his mental age was a lot lower, he was a recluse and was kept hidden away during his younger days by his parents. 'They were embarrassed due to his mental disability. 'I picked up on the name ""Nigel"". He eventually turned to drink to forget his own fears of life. 'This spirit energy means no harm to anyone and will not harm anyone. Further investigations into the haunting may be needed,' Mr Vickers concluded. Eerie: Ms McGill described feeling 'cobwebs' all over her skin when she first moved into the house in School Street, Loughborough . 'Ghost writing': Medium Dave Vickers said he held a pen and paper and allowed the spirit to communicate with Ms McGill through him . It was during the medium's second visit that he sensed that the spirit wanted to communicate, he said. 'I allowed the spirit to use me as a medium and give any messages through writing. This was carried out in the dark. I sat with paper on my lap and pen in hand in the dark while turning into spirit. Medium: Dave Vickers sensed the presence of a man in his late 30s named Nigel at Ms McGill's Loughborough home . 'I pictured Nigel in my mind and my hand started moving the pen. 'Although when we examined the writings things are hard to make out, both Carly and I felt he meant no harm. 'I conveyed love and light to him and told him that he had nothing to fear and that he was free of those hurtful feelings.' Mr Vickers found that the posters and creaking floor boards could be explained by natural occurrences. Graeme Stewardson, head of housing at East Midlands Housing Association, said: 'We are aware of the unusual activities reported by Ms McGill and have listened to her concerns in a sensitive manner. 'We understand that she has previously sought advice from specialists in this field. We will continue to offer Ms McGill our support and advice as a landlord. 'There have been only three tenants, including Ms McGill, in the property in the last 13 years, and we have not had any reports of this nature before.

"Applying for £600,000 lottery fund to put village on 'Shakespeare map' By . Amanda Williams . PUBLISHED: . 02:45 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:39 EST, 8 April 2013 . William Shakespeare could have worked as a humble schoolmaster during his 'lost years', historians claimed today. For more than 400 years, Stratford-upon-Avon has held the unrivalled crown as the playwright's home. Now devotees of the Bard in Titchfield, Hampshire, have laid claim to their part of the nation's literary heritage. Kevin Fraser, chairman of Titchfield Festival Theatre believes Shakespeare spent three years working as a schoolmaster at the Grammar School there between 1589 and 1592 . They believe Shakespeare spent three years working as a schoolmaster at the Grammar School there between 1589 and 1592. The theory matches Shakespeare's friendship with his patron Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, who owned Titchfield Abbey, later known as Place House. Locals have pointed to the fact that Shakespeare wrote just two dedications in his life and they were both dedicated to Wriothesley. Members have launched a bid to rival Stratford's tourist status, including a Shakespeare Trail complete with characters guiding visitors around . Titchfield Festival Theatre group claim the area's surroundings may have inspired his plays Henry V and Love's Labour's Lost. They believe his works would have been produced and performed by locals. Members have launched a bid to rival Stratford's tourist status, . including a Shakespeare Trail complete with characters guiding visitors . around. Kevin Fraser, chairman of Titchfield Festival Theatre, said: 'We should be on the Shakespeare map, there's no two ways about it. 'It should really be Stratford, London and Titchfield. 'Here we have Shakespeare potentially working and living in Titchfield. We're not saying this is the only idea but we have a lot of evidence - we believe we have the buildings. 'There is as much evidence if you like of Shakespeare being here as he is in Stratford. 'I think it's a fantastic story and it needs to be told to a wider world.' The players need £600,000 pounds from a Heritage Lottery grant to fund . the trail, small Elizabethan theatre, audio guide and interactive . exhibition. Retired physicist Ken Groves, is a Titchfield History Society committee . member and has lived in the Old Grammar School since 1969. Tests on the one-bedroom house's beams reveal it dates back to 1447 and . it is referred to as the school house in records from 1542. Mr Groves said: 'It's well known that William Shakespeare 'disappeared' for a number of years and was a school master in the countryside. 'Because of his well-documented close relationship with the 3rd Earl of . Southampton, we think it's a strong possibility he lived and taught . here. 'It's such an interesting story. 'Upstairs the house is in a similar condition to 400 years ago, so . sometimes when I'm lying in bed I look up and think how marvellous it is . to see the same beams as Shakespeare.' The theatre group point out landscapes and locations in Love's Labour's Lost that fit with those in Titchfield. The theory draws on Shakespeare's friendship with his patron Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, who owned Titchfield Abbey, later known as Place House . The group believe the character Holofernes satirises the Earl's tutor, John Floriot. And Henry V stayed in Titchfield Abbey before war in France, plus Henry VI was married in the Abbey. William Shakespeare was a 'ruthless businessman' and tax dodger, researchers have claimed. Researchers at Aberystwyth University carried out an academic study . looking into Shakespeare's 'other life' as one of Warwickshire's biggest . landowners and have uncovered the less than savoury side to Britain's . greatest playwright. Archived documents show the playwright was actually a wealthy landowner repeatedly dragged before the courts and fined for illegally stockpiling food and threatened with jail for evading taxes. He 'stored grain, malt and barley for resale at inflated prices to neighbours and local tradesmen' at a time when Europe was suffering famines, the academics said, and channelled the profits into land purchases.They added that Shakespeare did all he could to 'avoid taxes, maximise profits at others' expense and exploit the vulnerable – while writing plays about their plight'. The trail will include a walk around the Abbey, an old mill site dating . back 1,000 years, and the Saxon church where the Wriothesley family are . buried. But Professor Michael Dobson, the Director of the Shakespeare Institute, . based in Stratford, warned that Titchfield should think twice before . trying to steal Stratford's crown. Prof Dobson, a lecturer at Birmingham University, said: 'People have . speculated since the 19th century whether Shakespeare spent any time as a . guest of the Earl of Southampton. 'But when Shakespeare pops up in London in 1592, he's already an up and coming playwright. 'I think it's highly unlikely he spent all that time in the countryside. 'If tourists want to be close to Shakespeare they should come to Stratford instead.' After his twins were born in 1583, the Bard 'disappeared' according to history books until he was mentioned again as part of the London theatre scene in1592. This period is often referred to as his 'lost years'. Many historians have published theories on where he spent the so called missing years, including Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer. He believed the playwright went to London to escape prosecution for deer hunting. Other theories see him looking after the horses of theatre patrons in London, ahead of his theatrical career.","Historians in Titchfield, Hampshire, claim he spent three years there .

According to its creator, this thing is the closest a human being can get to skydiving without actually leaping from a plane. From where I’m dangling, I’d say it’s closer to being Superman - with a hefty dose of Eddie the Eagle. It involves flying face-down, head-first, for a mile or so at up to 100mph down a mountain - eeek! - and then - yeeeurrrgh! - straight over a cliff, out across a lake and finally - thwack! - crashing into a powerful shock absorber a few feet above the ground. Scroll down for video . Impressive views: I braved Britain's scariest new tourist attraction - a carefully calibrated, 1,600 yards, £600,000 washing line strung out over a spectacular corner of North Wales . To be honest, it requires zero talent; even a sack of potatoes could do it. But the exhilaration when I step back on terra firma is intoxicating. This is the newest, fastest and, arguably, the most dramatic zip wire in the world. It’s also the longest in Europe. And this carefully calibrated, 1,600 yards, £600,000 washing line is not attached to an Alp or stretched across a fjord. Zip World is strung out over a spectacular corner of North Wales within sight of Prince William’s RAF search and rescue base. It happens to be in the record books already for being the world’s largest slate quarry and the site of the longest industrial dispute in British history. Now a well-established part of the . extreme sports repertoire, a zip wire involves hanging from a pulley . that runs down a cable from A to B. That, . at least, is the idea. When Boris Johnson strapped himself on to an . Olympic zip wire last summer, he famously ground to a halt halfway down, . an unforgettable display of human bunting. Looking down: This is the newest, fastest and, arguably, the most dramatic zip wire in the world . In recent years, zip wires have become increasingly ambitious, though they are restricted by a simple law of physics: there is only so far you can stretch any cable between two points before it snaps beneath its own weight. The two longest in the world, around the 2,000-yard mark, are in Peru and South Africa. But now there is Zip World at Penrhyn Quarry on the edge of Snowdonia National Park. At the top, it feels like waiting for a rocket launch . It has clocked speeds in excess of 100mph and it’s in a breath-taking spot more than 1,000ft up with views across the Menai Straits and Anglesey. Dreamed up by Sean Taylor, a former . Royal Marine skydiver and jungle warfare instructor who grew up there, . Zip World is so exposed that the authorities have designated it as an . official flying hazard. No . sooner did it start operating just before Easter than it closed again . due to the freak easterly winds created by our current alien weather . pattern. The official grand opening is still on hold. So . when I get a teatime call from Sean predicting a break in the weather . by morning, I jump on an evening train to Snowdonia. Mount Snowdon looks . dazzling in the dawn sunshine as I head for the quarry outside the old . mining town of Bethesda. All is set fair. A dozen people - from a pensioner to a ten-year-old girl - are in the visitors’ centre, having booked online days ago. Astonishing: It's in a breath-taking spot more than 1,000ft up with views across the Menai Straits and Anglesey . Everyone is put on a set of scales and handed a Guantanamo Bay-style jumpsuit and complicated harness. The staff check every strap and buckle. There is a training session down a . shorter course and then it is time for the Big One. It is a 20-minute . drive up a dirt track to the summit. Along . the way, Sean, 48, takes us through the history of the 200-year-old . quarry. ‘That was the first hospital to use anaesthetic,’ he says, as we . bump past some old ruins. A sudden wind hits me, peeling off my goggles . He then points out the distant Penrhyn Castle, built by the quarry’s Victorian owner. ‘They . say that one man died for every brick in that castle,’ he says. Life . was so grim that in 1900, 2,000 slate miners downed tools and began a . record-breaking strike for the next three years. As we near the start, the snow is too deep for Sean’s Land Rover and we have to walk the last quarter of a mile. There’s . a glacial breeze howling and the riders are advised to wait in a little . shelter for their turn - but that is full of snow, too. Down: Zip World shows what you can do with bold thinking, strong leadership and disused industrial space . The wind is blowing straight in our faces, which means that lighter riders may not get to the end. The last third of the run is uphill to slow down participants and bring them over the finish line at 40 mph. But if the wind is too strong, then people will stop short and slide back down the wire, grinding to a halt over the lake - rather like Boris Johnson. ‘We just lower down an instructor on a trolley and tow you back in,’ says Sean cheerfully. In these wind conditions, every rider needs to be at least 12½ stone to get to the finish. So, lighter riders will need added weight. When I tell the ‘loadmaster’ my weight, he gives me a knowing smile that says: ‘You’ve got quite enough ballast, mate.’ I nervously asked Sean if there was a . maximum weight for riding the wire. ‘It’s got a breaking strength of 27 . tons,’ he replied. ‘It won’t even feel you.’ We . are so far from ground level that it’s impossible to make out the . finish. I can see yellow dots moving around - enormous quarry lorries - . but it’s much like being in a plane. And all of a sudden, I am the . plane. Safety: Everyone was put on a set of scales and handed a Guantanamo Bay-style jumpsuit and complicated harness. The staff checked every strap and buckle . Swaying gently on the launch pad, body straight and arms locked firmly behind my back, I wait for the countdown above the crackle of the wind. With all the radio traffic, it feels like a rocket launch. ‘Wrexham, we have a problem,’ I joke. No one’s laughing. ‘Base . to top,’ comes a voice over the radio. ‘Yes. Yes. Good to go.’ The . numbers are counted down, the last safety catch is yanked and, in no . time, I am accelerating faster than any car I’ve owned. Idea: Zip World was dreamed up by Sean Taylor, a former Royal Marine skydiver and jungle warfare instructor . The rocks seem to be getting closer and closer as they flash past under my nose. Suddenly, at 86.7mph (according to my on-board GPS chip), I hurtle over a cliff, the floor vanishes and the din of the wheels fades. I’m out in the open with just an almighty void between me and the impossibly blue lake 500ft below. A sudden sidewind hits me and starts peeling off my goggles and glasses. I can’t see a thing. When I bring one arm forward to grab the goggles, it throws the aerodynamics completely and I start to swing. I get the goggles back on in time to see what looks like grass getting bigger and bigger. It turns out to be trees. The ground is rushing up towards me. Thanks to my tangle with the goggles, though, I have slowed down so much I hit the huge, magnetic shock absorber at 29mph. One of the crew grabs my hand and an elevating platform rises up to meet me. The whole thing has lasted around a minute. I feel elated. Zip World shows what you can do with bold thinking, strong leadership and disused industrial space. When the weather improves and the . installation of the second main wire is complete, this operation will be . handling 20 riders per hour at £50 a time (children are cheaper). When . he left the Royal Marines after 22 years, Sean followed many comrades . into the lucrative but dangerous world of private security in places . like Afghanistan. ‘In the end, I realised I was going to end up the richest man in the graveyard,’ he says. Precautions: Zip World is so exposed that the authorities have designated it as an official flying hazard . So he came home to Wales and created a thriving adventure centre in 2007. Prince William is among those spotted on his ‘high ropes’ course through Snowdonia trees, though Sean is too discreet to discuss it. Then he had the brainwave of a zip wire over the quarry. With his own money, co-investors and a redevelopment grant, Zip World was born. Sean regards the Armed Forces as his extended family — even if he can be rather rude about the Paras and RAF. So he has already issued one edict to the ticket office: ‘This is one extreme sport where it makes no difference whether you’re able-bodied or disabled. So, any injured serviceman can ride for free.’ The Paras and RAF as well? ‘Of course. It’s not their fault they have to dress like bus conductors.’ His other unusual plan is for an ambitious race down the mountain. Marines vs Paras? ‘No - human versus hawk.’","ROBERT HARDMAN tests Zip World at Penrhyn Quarry in North Wales .

Ratcheting up pressure for Congress to limit access to guns, President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that recent steps by Colorado to tighten its gun laws show 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting Second Amendment rights to gun ownership. 'I believe there doesn't have to be a conflict in reconciling these realities,' Obama said in Denver, where he stepped up his call for background checks for all gun purchases and renewed his demand that Congress at least vote on banning assault weapons and limiting access to large-capacity ammunition magazines. 'There doesn't have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights,' he said. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama speaks at the Denver Police Academy in Denver, today to ratchet up the pressure for Congress to limit access to guns . Obama noted that more than 100 days have passed since the shooting rampage that killed 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., and reignited the national debate over access to guns. 'Every day that we wait to do something about it even more of our fellow citizens are stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. Now the good news is Colorado has already chosen to do something about it,' he said. In danger of losing congressional momentum on the issue, Obama went to Colorado - which has a deep-rooted hunting tradition and where gun ownership is a cherished right - to use its example and public pressure to prod Congress to act. Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine high school in 1999 and at a movie theater in Aurora last year. It recently expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines. President Barack Obama speaks to promote gun control measures on a nationwide basis today in Denver . U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about tightening gun regulations during a visit to the Denver Police Academy in Denver, Colorado today . Prospects for passage of similar measures by Congress appear bleak, largely because of concerns by conservative Republicans and moderate Democrats who come down more on the side of gun rights. Obama said there is a middle ground. 'Colorado has shown that practical progress is possible,' he said. 'We've seen enacted tougher background checks that won't infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners, but will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.' Obama met with 19 law enforcement officers, activists and elected officials at the Denver Police Academy, not far from Aurora, where 12 people were killed in the movie theater shooting. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for James Holmes, the accused shooter. Among those participating in the discussion with Obama was Sandy Phillips, whose 24-year-old daughter, Jessica Redfield Ghawi, died in the Aurora shooting. She conceded that gun control is a difficult issue, and said she has spoken to numerous lawmakers in Washington who 'want to do the right thing without it costing their jobs.' Ratcheting up pressure for Congress to limit access to guns, Obama said that steps taken recently by Colorado to tighten its gun laws show ""there doesn't have to be a conflict"" between keeping citizens safe and protecting Second Amendment rights . Phillips said she is counting on Obama to press the issue. 'We need to have universal background checks for every sale, that's a minimum,' she said in an interview before the meeting. 'I hope he keeps pushing for the assault weapons ban and I hope he keeps pushing for magazine restrictions.' In his remarks, Obama pushed Congress to vote on banning assault weapons, limiting access to high-capacity ammunition magazines and other measures. 'I don't believe that weapons designed for theaters of war have a place in movie theaters,' Obama said to applause. With Congress due to return to Washington on Monday after a two-week break, Obama has been scheduling high-profile events on gun legislation to push lawmakers and sustain a drive for action more than three months after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. U.S. President Barack Obama passes a vintage police car as he arrives to speak about tightening gun regulations during a visit to the Denver Police Academy in Denver . President Barack Obama has been very vocal about the need for gun control reform since the Sandy Hook massacre in December . Last week, he called for legislation while flanked by 21 mothers who lost children to gun violence. 'I haven't forgotten those kids,' he declared then. The Senate could begin debating gun control legislation next week. On Monday, Obama was visiting Hartford, Conn., where state lawmakers have announced a bipartisan agreement on gun legislation in response to Newtown. White House press secretary Jay Carney said the efforts by Colorado and Connecticut 'represent important progress on these issues and are useful models to look at as we undertake efforts in Washington.' He said the White House was working with members of Congress and staff from both parties on how to find the necessary votes for passage. Obama's visit showcased a state with a long centrist tradition that prizes its Western frontier heritage. But an influx of young coastal transplants and growing Hispanic voter clout have helped Democrats win a string of victories in the state. Even before the Sandy Hook massacre energized gun control proponents, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper said he was open to new gun control measures. Colorado Republicans fought the new legislation, contending that Democrats overreached and will be punished by voters in November. Police officers wait for the arrival of US President Barack Obama at the Denver Police Academy in Denver, Colorado today . Democrats contend that the measures are generally popular, especially among the suburban women who decide Colorado elections. Several county sheriffs have vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. More than a dozen of them gathered a mile from Obama's appearance Wednesday to slam the new regulations as ineffective and unconstitutional. Justin Smith, the sheriff of Larimer County, dismissed the visit as 'a victory lap' and 'a slap in the face to all Coloradans.' The Colorado Sheriffs Association vocally opposed the gun control package, while the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police supported it. Sheriffs are elected in Colorado and generally are Republican. President Barack Obama shakes hands with area police officers at the Denver Police Academy following his speech .

The American Federation of Teachers denounced the proposal. There were signs that sweeping congressional efforts to address gun violence have flagged. Key senators have been unable to reach a bipartisan compromise that would require federal background checks for gun transactions between private individuals.

Mechanical diggers are being used to excavate part of a busy airport in Burma as archaeologists step up their search for a lost squadron of World War II Spitfires. The machines were spotted working by the side of a runway at Yangon (Rangoon) International Airport, with tents erected nearby. The 21-strong team of archaeologists, led by Lincolnshire farmer David Cundall , is searching for rare Marx XIV Spitfires that were believed to have been buried in crates in August 1945.

Earlier this month the team found a wooden crate believed to contain one of the planes, but it was full of muddy water.

As . many as 140 Spitfires - three to four times the number of airworthy . models known to exist - are believed to have been buried in . near-pristine condition in Myanmar by American engineers as the war drew . to a close. The . single-seater Spitfire, which helped Britain beat back waves of German . bombers during the war more than six decades ago, remains the most . famous British combat aircraft.

Blessing: Mr Cundall speaks with a Buddhist monk who was brought to bless the site before digging began . Technology: Mr Cundall (left) looks at ground scans with two of his team of British archeologists. The group are using sophisticated techniques to try to locate the Spitfires . Site: the Burmese Government has given Mr Cundall's team permission to dig for the planes at Yangon (Rangoon) International Airport . The wooden crate located in northern Burma was found in Myitkyina in Kachin state during a dig that began last month. Mr Cundall said the search team in Kachin state inserted a camera into the crate and found it was full of water. It was unclear what was inside the crate, he said, but the water will be pumped out during an operation that could take weeks, he said. The go-ahead for excavation came in October when Myanmar's government signed an agreement with Mr Cundall and his local partner.

DJC, a private company headed by Mr . Cundall, will get 30 percent of the total and the Myanmar partner . company Shwe Taung Paw, headed by Htoo Htoo Zaw, will get 20 percent. During the project's first phase, . searchers hope to recover 60 planes: 36 planes in Mingaladon, near . Yangon's international airport; six in Meikthila in central Myanmar; and . 18 in Myitkyina. Others are to be recovered in a second phase. Critics have said it's . possible all they might find is a mass of corroded metal and rusty . aircraft parts. But the search team say the Spitfires are believed to be in good condition because they were waxed, wrapped in greased paper and had their joints tarred by RAF crews. Mr Cundall, 62, from Scunthorpe, started his treasure hunt in 1996 after hearing a throwaway remark from a group of US veterans who said they once buried Spitfires in Burma. He tracked down an eyewitness who led him to the area where the aircraft were buried. He eventually located the buried planes using ground-penetrating radar equipment. His team dug a borehole and sent down a camera to look at the crates, which were said to be in ‘really good condition’. Mr Cundall said the practice of burying aircraft, tanks and jeeps was common after the war. 'Basically . nobody had got any orders to take these airplanes back to (the) UK. They were just surplus ... (and) one way of disposing them was to bury . them,' Mr Cundall said. 'The war was over, everybody wanted to go home, . nobody wanted anything, so you just buried it and went home. That was . it.'

The same goes for thousands of others who had expected to be the only remnants of today’s scheduled termination of the human race. Like Bast, a well-known ‘survivalist’ and online prophet of doom, they have been leaving nothing to chance. But it’s always the same with this blasted Armageddon business. You take all the right precautions, you abandon your job and go to an enormous amount of trouble to set yourself apart from the common herd in the confident expectation that you are a Chosen One. Bubble wrap: American Phil Burns is selling air-purifying masks amid predictions the world will end . And then, well, you end up looking a prize twit the following morning. Those blasé neighbours who never bothered to stockpile so much as a box of matches give you a patronising wave as they set off to work as usual. What’s more, you’ve got a garage full of baked beans, bottled water, spare batteries and duct tape. Oh well. You can usually console yourself with the thought there’ll be another catalclysmic prophesy along soon. Better have another flick through the works of Nostradamus . . . Today’s end of the world comes courtesy of the ancient Mayans (or ‘Maya’ as the BBC likes to call them). For almost 2,000 years before Christ, they ruled much of what is now Mexico, Belize and Honduras. And they followed a calendar which had been carefully mapped out from 3114BC to December 21, 2012. Now, the Mayans did not get into hours and minutes and so did not spell out our precise closing time. Perhaps, it may come to pass later today, in which case I will be the one feasting on humble pie (posthumously, of course). But if you’re reading this, the chances are that we have not been vaporised or consumed by some omnivorous intergalactic black hole. Floating Dutchman: Pieter van der Meer prepares the old Norwegian lifeboat he keeps in his back garden in Kootwijkerbroek, Holland . Close encounters of the French kind: One local in Bugarach is hoping to make any invading aliens who emerge from the nearby mountain feel at home . Pod almighty: Liu Qiyuan with one of his steel and fibreglass balls which, he says, can enable 14 people to escape any sort of apocalypse . I have yet to fathom quite why we should be so alarmed by the navel-gazing of Central American Iron Age elders for whom human sacrifice was the height of sophistication. But as much as ten per cent of the world’s population are said to have been ‘anxious’ that today would be their last. Yet the mood is surprisingly upbeat in Mexico where the tourist board of Yucatan state has been promoting ‘end of the world’ tourism to its spectacular Mayan ruins. A small fortune has been spent on a new museum of Mayan culture which has yet to open — suggesting that these particular Mayan aficionados are not expecting annihilation today. Down in Guatemala, another part of the old Mayan empire, crowds have been gathering near the ancient city of Tikal where several Mayan temples still stand. The last time Tikal had this much excitement was when film director George Lucas shipped his entire Star Wars production down there and used the temples as the location for the fictional planet, Yavin 4. Yesterday, locals reported an intriguing blend of Mayan disciples and Star Wars enthusiasts descending on the site. Few places have been busier than the tiny French village of Bugarach on the edge of the Pyrenees. The Mayans had never even heard of the Pyrenees and yet Bugarach is supposedly the best place to dodge extinction because of the strange mountain which looms over it. According to assorted New Age shamans and internet conspiracy theorists, the Pic de Bugarach is housing a collection of UFOs and aliens who were supposed to emerge today, gather up any locals and whisk them off to a new life as Earth implodes. ‘I’m here to welcome the great alien monarch who will rise from the mountain when the world ends,’ explained Sylvain Durif, 43, from neighbouring Arques, (but born, he says, on Venus). ‘Anyone who wants to be saved must come to Bugarach.’ Grab and go: Bill Poteat has been doing a roaring trade in buckets of freeze-dried food at his Southern Survival Supplies store in Morgantown, West Virginia . Around the village, Doomsday prophets are outnumbered by international camera crews who have come from as far as Toronto and Tokyo to gawp. Jean Prior, owner of the Ferme de Janou restaurant, is enjoying a busy trade in apocalyptic wine with the label: ‘End of the World — I Was There’. Another favoured spot for riding out the global storm is the Turkish hill town of Sirince, singled out by New Age mystics for its ‘positive energy’. And the Mayans have been great for manufacturers of survival kit. In China, farmer Liu Qiyuan has produced a set of steel and fibreglass balls which, he claims, can each accommodate 14 people through every sort of Biblical eventuality. In Montebello, California, Ron Hubbard has seen a last-minute run of orders for his £46,000 bomb-proof survival shelters, complete with leather sofas and plasma screens (tuned in to what, one wonders?). And in France, survivalists have been restoring old Maginot Line bunkers. These concrete fortresses might have failed dismally when they were supposed to keep the Nazis out in 1940. But there are those who believe they will keep the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse at bay in 2012. While a lot of the Armageddon talk is tinged with comedy, it is worth remembering that apocalyptic forecasts can have tragic consequences. Two months ago, Brazilian police foiled an end-of-the-world suicide attempt by 100 members of a doomsday cult, moments before the killer cocktail was to be handed round. The situation is certainly tense in some parts of the world. While Moscow socialites are paying $1,000-a-head for tickets to an apocalypse-themed party in an old Cold War bunker near the Kremlin, many provincial Russians are terrified. Line of defence: World War II historian Marc Halter at the Maginot Line's Schoenenberg bunker in Alsace, which will need to do better than it did in 1940 . There have been reports of panic-buying, especially of torches, Thermos flasks and kerosene lamps. The city of Novokuznetsk has seen a run on salt while the Siberian city of Tomsk has enjoyed a roaring trade in ‘survival kits’ which include rope, bandages and a can of sprats. Even President Vladmimir Putin has stepped in to calm things down. ‘I know when the end of the world will come,’ he told a Moscow press conference yesterday. ‘It will be in 4.5 billion years approximately.’ Explaining that the sun will eventually run out of steam, Mr Putin continued: . ‘Everything will end and the reactor will go out — that will be the end of the world.’ Other voices of international calm have included the Vatican’s official astronomer and the space agency, NASA. ‘I hear from kids who say they can’t eat, they can’t sleep, they’re considering suicide,’ said NASA’s David Morrison. Quoting a poll which suggested that 25 million Americans do not expect to see Christmas, he went on: ‘I worry about those people. There’s nothing that’s going to happen to the Earth, no cosmic catastrophe. It’s a little scary to think of millions of people who are storing up guns and machetes. I just hope they stay in their hole and don’t come out and make a mess.’ In China, the authorities have arrested more than 600  members of the ‘Almighty God’ cult for spreading rumours of an upcoming catastrophe. One leaflet reads: ‘Advice before catastrophe: Satan’s men will be extinct. Only the Almighty God can save man. Anybody who resists God will go to Hell.’ For many end-of-the-worlders, though, it is simply a case of ‘always look on the bright side of life’. Dating websites have seen a surge in people seeking apocalyptic dates and even ‘end of the world sex’. As New York model Niki Ghazian has informed the New York Post, she plans to go out with a party and, she hopes, a romantic encounter: ‘If I die, I don’t want to die on a dry spell. Everybody should go out feeling satisfied. If the world’s gonna end, why hold back?’","The ancient Mayan calendar comes to an end on today's date - 21st December 2012 .

Despite a Mayan prophecy, the world did not end on December 21 last year - but new evidence suggests the ancient civilisation's calendar system was, in other respects, accurate. By re-analysing a wooden beam from a Guatemalan temple, originally radiocarbon-tested in 1960, scientists believe it shows the Maya culture did collapse a thousand years ago because it failed to cope with climate change - a proposition first suggested last year. The Central American people had . developed a sophisticated society, accurate calendars and complex . architecture including pyramids. They . thrived during rainy periods but a prolonged . drought somewhere between AD 800 and 1100 is said to have brought about its collapse. For a long time, experts struggled to match dates from the Mayan Long Count calendar with the modern European calendar. Despite a Mayan prophecy, the world did not end on December 21 last year - but new evidence suggests the ancient civilisation's calendar system was, in other respects, accurate. Above, the Caana pyramid at the Caracol site in the Cayo District of Belize . The Long Count system comprised 20-day cycles made up of k'in, which formed 360-day cycles known as tuns. Another unit, b'ak'tun, represented a cycle of 400 years - and it was the ending of one of these that led to the belief of the apocalypse in 2012. Now, archaeologist Douglas Kennett, from Pennsylvania State University, has applied modern carbon dating methods to a lintel, carved with historical records, found at Tikal, which was a major Mayan city, according to NBC News. His aim was to confirm the accuracy of the dating: 50 years ago, other researchers at the university reckoned the beam had been carved between AD 695 and 712. 'When looking at how climate affects the . rise and fall of the Maya, I began to question how accurately the two . calendars correlated using those methods,' Kennett said. As well as using carbon isotopes to establish its age, he and his team looked at the tree rings in the wood. The date they concluded was around AD 658-696, which backed up the original correlation estimates. By re-analysing a wooden beam from a Guatemalan temple, originally radiocarbon-tested in 1960, scientists believe it shows the Maya culture did collapse a thousand years ago because it failed to cope with climate change. Above, a Mayan pyramid in Chichen Itza, Central America . The two estimates match up even more closely after factoring in the removal of ten to 15 years of wood growth while the carving took place, the researchers said in the journal Scientific Reports. The lintel they analysed concerned the defeat of Tick'aak K'ahk', king of the nearby city of Calakmul, by Tikal's leader Jasaw Chan K'awiil. This is turned re-confirmed the theory that the victory was in AD 695, 13 years after Jasaw Chan K'awiil took to the throne. Their report in the journal continued: 'These events and those recorded at cities throughout the Maya lowlands can now be harmonized with greater assurance to other environmental, climatic and archaeological datasets.' Maya rulers commissioned monuments to record events . Rainfall and the 'war index' from Mayan times . In a project led by scientists from Pennsylvania State University and Zurich last year, with expert input from Durham University, precisely-dated rainfall records were made from deposits in local caves. This was compared against a so-called 'war index', the dates of hostile events which Maya people recorded on stone monuments. Researchers, who it is claimed have made a unique timeline linking changes in culture and climate, found war and unrest matched periods of drought. Previously, when conditions were favourable with plentiful rain, the Maya civilisation expanded into large cities. The findings, published in the journal Science, described how Maya rulers commissioned monuments to record events and the research team found the frequency of texts carved in stone indicating rivalry, war and alliances increased significantly between AD 660 and 900, during the drying trend. At the time, Professor Kennett said: 'It is not just climate drying and drought that is important, but the preceding conditions that helped stimulate societal complexity and population expansion. 'This set the stage for societal stress and the fragmentation of political institutions later in time as conditions became drier.' Precise rainfall figures were calculated from chemical analysis of stalagmites in the Yok Balum caves in Belize. Dr James Baldini, of Durham University's Department of Earth Sciences, led the cave monitoring portion of the study. He said: 'The rise and fall of Mayan civilisation is an example of a sophisticated civilisation failing to adapt successfully to climate change. 'Periods of high rainfall increased the productivity of Maya agricultural systems and led to a population boom and resource overexploitation. 'The progressively drier climate then led to political destabilisation and warfare as resources were depleted. 'After years of hardship, a nearly century-long drought from 1020 sealed the fate of the Classic Maya.' The theory of climate change being to blame for the end of the Classic Maya civilisation has been suggested previously, but the link was controversial because of uncertainties over dating rainfall patterns. The Classic Maya region covers portions of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. 'Here you had an amazing state-level society that had created calendars, magnificent architecture, works of art, and was engaged in trade throughout Central America,' said UC Davis anthropology professor and co-author Bruce Winterhalder. 'They were incredible craftspersons, proficient in agriculture, statesmanship and warfare—and within about 80 years, it fell completely apart. 'It's a cautionary tale about how fragile our . political structure might be. 'Are we in danger the same way the Classic . Maya were in danger? I don't know. 'But I suspect that just before their . rapid descent and disappearance, Maya political elites were quite . confident about their achievements.' Periods of high and increasing rainfall coincided with a rise in population and political centres between AD 300 and 660. A climate reversal and drying trend between AD 660 and 1000 triggered political competition, increased warfare, overall sociopolitical instability, and finally, political collapse. This was followed by an extended drought between AD 1020 and 1100 that likely corresponded with crop failures, death, famine, migration and, ultimately, the collapse of the Maya population. Professor Kennett's research team collected a stalagmite from a cave in Belize, less than 1 mile from the Maya site of Uxbenka and about 18 miles from three other important centers. Using oxygen isotope dating in 0.1mm increments along the length of the stalagmite, the scientists uncovered a physical record of rainfall over the past 2,000 years. Combined, the stalagmite and hieroglyphs allowed the researchers to link precipitation to politics.

Zoologists hope that Britain's giant panda couple Tian Tian and Yang Guang will mate within days, after an unsuccessful meeting last year. Giant pandas have a short 36-hour window just once a year within which to breed when the female panda is ovulating. Male panda Yang Guang and female Tian Tian were introduced to each other during breeding season last year at Edinburgh Zoo, but the pair failed to mate. Zoo workers hope male panda Yang Guang (pictured at Edinburgh Zoo) will mate with female panda Tian Tian when she comes into fertility season within the next 10 days . Yang Guang has been kept apart from Tian Tian since last year when the pair showed no interest in each other . Members of the public look on at Yang Guang, the male panda who it is hoped will mate soon at Edinburgh Zoo . The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) revealed that Tian Tian will be in heat within the next eight days after tests showed the necessary hormonal crossover in progesterone and oestrogen had occurred. Throughout the rest of the year the two giant pandas are kept apart because they are naturally territorial and could attack one another. Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas, said: ‘We are now able to predict that the important 36-hour breeding window when both pandas are likely to meet is imminent. ‘Scientific results alone would . suggest the day is just less than 10 days away; however, as Tian Tian's . behavioural changes are coming in so strongly, we cannot rule out that . the key 36-hour window may be much sooner. ‘Every . individual giant panda is different and this is only the second time . Tian Tian has come into season in Scotland, so it is difficult to make a . precise prediction at this stage. ‘The next steps are to continue behavioural observational and hormone testing to confirm when the annual window has arrived.’ Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years. Yang Guang will have a window of just 36 hours to mate with female giant panda Tian Tian when she becomes fertile in the next 10 days . Although Tian Tian will give birth to two cubs if she mates with Yang Guang only one is likely to suvive . Edinburgh . Zoo, where the pair have lived since their arrival from China in . December 2011, has employed a number of measures to synchronise the . breeding cycles of the pandas, including controlled lighting, urine . testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping. Mr . Valentine said: ‘When the 36-hour window is here, Tian Tian and Yang . Guang will meet several times to have the opportunity to mate and then, . as Tian Tian finally ovulates and her hormones fall off, artificial . insemination will also take place.’ If . Tian Tian does fall pregnant, it will be July or the first half of . August when Edinburgh Zoo experts will be able to confirm it by using . ultrasound scans. The . majority of giant panda cubs are born at the very end of August or . beginning of September. Although females may give birth to two young, . usually only one survives. The . giant pandas’ naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population in the . wild from recovering quickly from illegal hunting, habitat loss, and . other human-related causes of mortality. In the wild the diet of giant pandas like Yang Guang (pictured in Edinburgh Zoo) is 99 per cent made up of bamboo .

A district attorney resigned on Tuesday from prosecuting a racketeering case involving the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas just days after a fellow Texas lawmaker and his wife were assassinated. Mike . McLelland, Kaufman County District Attorney, and his wife Cynthia were shot dead at their home close to Forney, Texas last Saturday. Assistant DA Jay Hileman sent a short email to the defense team today saying that he was stepping down for security reasons. Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow on Saturday . He is being replaced by another . Department of Justice prosecutor from Washington D.C. who will . travel to Houston to join the high-profile case. That individual will join attorney . David Karpel from the DOJ's gang unit in prosecuting . the large racketeering case, according to Dallasnews.com. The Aryan Brotherhood, a violent white supremacist prison gang, is suspected of . being behind the assassinations. However no evidence has tied the . gang to the slayings and no one has been arrested. Mr and Mrs McLelland were murdered less than two weeks after Colorado's prison . chief was shot to death on his doorstep, allegedly by an ex-convict. And on January 31, Kaufman . County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse was shot dead in a . courthouse parking lot in Houston. No arrests have been made for his . killing. Hit: Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes speaks at a news conference on March 31 after DA Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were murdered in their home . The killings have sent ripples of fear through the Texas legal community with many prosecutors increasing their security details. Harris County District Attorney Mike Anderson now has round-the-clock protection for him and his family after the assassinations. His district includes Houston. His spokeswoman told The Houston Chronicle: . 'This danger is present every day. They put bad people behind bars . everyday, and prosecutors and investigators carry this with them every . day. 'It's sad, it's . tragic. It weighs heavy on Mike, but it's not going to let it stop him, . or anyone in this office, from doing their job.' Precautions: Harris County District Attorney Mike Anderson (left) now has round-the-clock security because other lawmakers including Mark Hasse (right) have been shot dead this year . Law enforcement agencies throughout Texas have been on high alert, and steps were being taken to better protect other DAs and their staffs. Anderson said he also would take precautions at his office, the largest of its kind in Texas, with more than 270 prosecutors. 'I think district attorneys across Texas are still in a state of shock,' Anderson said on Sunday. Mr McLelland, 63, was the 13th prosecutor . killed in the U.S. since the 1960s. Kaufman . County Sheriff David Byrnes would not give details on Sunday of how the . killings unfolded and said there was nothing to indicate for certain . whether the murders were connected to Mr Hasse's shooting. In Colorado, sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Joe Roybal said . investigators had so far found no evidence connecting the Texas killings . to the Colorado case, but added: 'We're examining all possibilities.' Colorado's . corrections director Tom Clements was killed on March 19 when he . answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs. Evan . Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected . of shooting Clements, died in a shootout with Texas deputies two days . later about 100 miles from Kaufman. Crime scene: Law enforcement officers investigate the scene of Mark Hasse's killing in January . In an interview shortly after the Colorado slaying, Mr McLelland raised the possibility that Mr Hasse was gunned down by a white supremacist gang. McLelland, elected in 2010, said his office had prosecuted several cases against such gangs, particularly one known as the Aryan Brotherhood. The groups have a strong presence around Kaufman County, a mostly rural area dotted with subdivisions, with a population of about 104,000. After Hasse's slaying, Mr McLelland said that he carried a gun everywhere around town even when walking his dog. Suspect: Evan Spencer Ebel (left) is the main suspect in the murder of Colorado prison's chief Tom Clements (right) and he was killed in a shootout with police in Texas two days after the murder . He figured assassins were more likely to try to attack him outside. He said he had warned all his employees to be constantly on the alert. 'The people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more in the future.' The number of attacks on prosecutors, judges and senior law enforcement officers in the U.S. has spiked in the past three years, according to Glenn McGovern, an investigator with the Santa Clara County, California district attorney's office who tracks such cases. For about a month after Mr Hasse's slaying, sheriff's deputies were parked in the district attorney's driveway, said Sam Rosander, a neighbor of the McLellands. The FBI and the Texas Rangers joined the investigation into the McLellands' deaths.","Prosecutor Jay Hileman sent a short resignation email to defense team .

Now a new poll, designed to find out  men’s favourite hairstyles of the last 100 years, reveals that Mr Beckham has sported all the top ten hairstyles of all time – and the three worst ones, too. The footballer, who was recently signed as Paris Saint-Germain's forward, showcased the number one hairstyle - the quiff - as he arrived at his hotel in Valencia today. Scroll down for video . Top of the crops: Beckham shows why he is a style icon as he shows off his quirky half-shaved quiff arriving in Valencia today . Number one: The quiff, made famous by Elvis in the 60s and one of Beckham's favorite styles was voted top 'do' The father-of-four, who has dabbled with . double leather, manskirts and posing in his pants, has changed his hairstyle almost more often than he's changed his clothes - and in doing so, has notched up every hairstyle on the best - and worst - list. The poll revealed the quiff - the classic slicked-back look made famous by Elvis Presley in the Fifties -  as the top hairstyle in a new survey of 1,000 men. In second place was the classic side parting and in third place was 'the Bieber' - the long-fringed look favoured by the Canadian pop hunk. More modern cuts dominated the top ten, and a short-back-and-sides – the staple haircut of men for decades – didn’t even make the top 20. Researchers were stunned when they studied the results to discover that style icon Beckham, 37, has adopted every single hairstyle in the top ten. The classic side sweep was voted the second best style, and seeing it on David in his latest H&M underwear advert it is not hard to see why is such a popular look . The brushed forward, forehead sweep, now synonymous with pop sensation Justin Bieber (left) was voted the third best style and has, of course, also been seen on Beckham (right) Beckham works the James Dean look- and hair style!- which was voted the forth best look . The 'Spiky Crop'- shaved at the sides and spiky on the top- also made the top ten . More modern cuts such as the pony tail (left) and the centre parting (right) dominated the top ten . Cornrows, which even manage to look bad on David Beckham, were voted one of the top three worse hairstyles a man could have . Beckham has sported some truly bizarre hairstyles such as the Mohican (left) and curtains (right) which both made the top three worst styles . Men were also asked to nominate the three worst hairstyles. These were curtains, cornrows and a mohican. And Becks has had all three of these looks, too. The poll was carried out by the Crown Clinic in Manchester - Britain's leading hair transplant centre. It said that more men seeking transplants wanted their hair to be like Beckham's than any other celebrity. The quiff became a staple of the British Teddy Boy movement in the Fifties before going out of fashion in the Sixties. In more recent years, David Beckham, .

I look like that?' ‘On . most occasions, we can help patients to look like their idol. If they . can fill out their hairline with a hair transplant, they can adopt many . of the looks Beckham has. ‘Beckham has a wonderful head of hair . and he has adopted so many amazing styles - that is why he is an . inspiration to so many British men. ‘Whatever look he adopts always seems right - and sets the fashion for other men. ‘It is not surprise to me that, at some point in his life, he has adopted every single look in our top ten.’ Dr Shahmalak, hair loss expert on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, said for many balding men the only style option was the short crop - number 8 in the poll. He explained:  ‘Men who are losing their hair typically shave it off to cover up their baldness. ‘That really only gives them one option on their hairstyle - and after a while that can get a little dull. ‘A shaved head is not appropriate for all professions - if you think of lawyers or actors. ‘We work with a lot of celebrities who are losing their hair but cannot adopt the same look all the time. They come to us for a transplant and it gives their careers a boost.’ Dr Shahmalak has performed hair transplants on several stars including Christian Jessen from Embarrassing Bodies and the model-turned-actor Calum Best. There was a 25 per cent increase in bookings after Wayne Rooney went public with his transplant.","Quiff was rated the top men's hairstyle in a poll of 1,000 men .

Mark Serwotka, head of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said there 'definitely' were discussions about 'generalised strike action' Millions of workers will join the first general strike since 1926 as they send a message to the Coalition that they will 'not simply accept their lot', it has today been reported. Mark Serwotka, head of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents the civil service and other government agencies, said there 'definitely' were discussions about 'generalised strike action'. He said unions were co-ordinating in a bid to fight back against cuts to pay, jobs and pensions in the public sector, the Daily Telegraph reports. It comes after months of speculation about a general strike, and days after leaked papers from Britain's biggest union Unite revealed possible plans for a general walkout. But Mr Serwotka is the first trade union leader to publicly confirm that there were active discussions. He told Sky News; 'My own opinion is that what the Government is doing is getting so increasingly unpopular that even a 24-hour strike involving millions of people across the economy will be an incredibly important moment.' Today thousands of HM Revenue and Customs staff, members of the PCS, are expected to take part in a half-day walkout, coinciding with the start of the new tax year. The last General Strike (4-12 May 1926.) City workers crossing London Bridge after walking from their homes owing to the suspension of public transport services . A dense stream of private cars passing down the Embankment during the General Strike, 1926. The workers participating in the general strike included railway workers, dockers and steelworkers . Britain's previous general strike came in May 1926 following a dispute over reduced wages for coal miners. After the miners  were locked out from work, the TUC called on its 1.7million members to walk out of their jobs in solidarity. Last-minute negotiations with prime minister Stanley Baldwin's government were called off after the Daily Mail's printers refused to print an editorial criticising the proposed strike as a 'revolutionary move'. The workers participating in the general strike included railway workers, dockers and steelworkers. Thousands of volunteers and special constables tried to replace the lost labour, and after nine days the TUC admitted defeat and called off the action. Then from 1978 to 1979, the Winter of Discontent saw a public sector strike under Lord Callaghan's Government, which resulted in power cuts and piles of rubbish on streets. The strikes, which called for bigger pay rises, had even seen gravediggers join picket lines and leave dead bodies waiting to be buried. The PCS began a three-month campaign of protest over pay, jobs and conditions on Budget day -  March 20. Mr Serwotka warned that the strike today would be followed by further action in Whitehall over the next two months. A document drawn up by Unite and leaked last week described a general strike as 'desirable'. Fellow union, Unison, which has 1.3million members, said it would back proposals for a general strike as long as it was the end, not the beginning, of a protest campaign. The threat of co-ordinated industrial . action comes after unions voted overwhelmingly last September to start . planning the ‘practicalities’ of the first general strike since 1926  at the Trade Unions Congress. The idea was put forward by the Prison Officers . Association. Unite, Unison and the GMB all backed a motion to consider . the 'practicalities' of a general strike. But other, less radical, are likely to be opposed to the idea. If it goes ahead, a general strike . would wipe out vital services, with workers from teachers to prison . guards, firemen to nurses, dinner ladies to paramedics likely to walk . out. A general strike would cause more upheaval than previous protests against the Coalition as it would encompass both the public and private sector.","Mark Serwotka, head of PCS union, confirmed strike talks were held .

Changes: Primary school children as young as five will be taught Shakespeare, it emerged today . Shakespeare will be taught to children as young as five because the Government wants the Bard's 'cultural legacy' taught across the majority of lessons, it was revealed today. Primary school pupils will start to learn more about the playwright in maths, art and even food technology, Michael Gove will reveal today. More of his plays and poetry will also be taught in traditional classes like English and drama. As the curriculum is widened, youngsters will make meals enjoyed 450 years ago, like pea and bacon pottage, study statistics showing how people died at the time, draw portraits of Shakespeare and act out more of his plays. The Education Secretary believes that it is crucial for children to learn more about Shakespeare and his work, even if they have just started school. It came as it emerged teenagers studying for their GCSEs will have now have to read two of the Bard's plays to pass - when Labour previously only insisted on one. The campaign to increase exposure to Shakespeare in schools has been launched in conjunction with the 450th anniversary of his birth next year, a celebration backed by Dame Judi Dench. Mr Gove will speak as national Shakespeare Week starts today, saying the Government will 'bring Shakespeare's literary and . cultural legacy to thousands more children'.

The price of a first class stamp could soar to £1 in just three years if Royal Mail is privatised, a group campaigning against the move has said . The price of a first class stamp could soar to £1 in just three years if Royal Mail is privatised, campaigners claim. Save Our Royal Mail - set up by charities and pensioner groups to fight the expected sell off - said the cost would increase because other companies would be able to challenge Royal Mail's VAT-free status under competition law. Bankers and government ministers are . paving the way for a Royal Mail flotation. It is believed it could . happen as early as the Autumn. Stamps are exempt from  VAT but lawyers have warned that if the Royal Mail is privatised, this exemption will be challenged – almost certainly successfully – by other delivery companies. The price of sending a first class letter last year rose from 46p to 60p - an increase of 30 per cent. If 20 per cent VAT was added the price would increase to 72p. A further rise of 30 per cent would see the stamp cost 94p by 2015. The group has warned that even if VAT were not applied, the price of sending a first class letter would 'likely hit £1 in three/four years, assuming two increases in that period', The Daily Telegraph reports. Brian Binley, a Conservative MP and member of the Business Innovation and Skills Committee - which oversees the work of Royal Mail -  told the paper it was essential that the services currently enjoyed by the public can be guaranteed, before the Government rushes into selling off the group. He added: 'This should include a very careful look at how future price rises will adversely affect businesses as well as people in counties like Northamptonshire.' Bankers and government ministers are paving the way for a Royal Mail flotation. It is believed it could happen as early as the Autumn . A Business, Innovations and Skills spokesman said the Royal Mail will continue to be the designated universal service provider regardless of its ownership. They added that any change would not 'trigger a change in the current VAT exemption which applies to first and second class stamps as part of the one price, anywhere service.' The Royal Mail can trace its origins to 1516, when Henry VIII established the office of Master of the Posts - a rudimentary postal service. But the monarch and his courtiers were the only ones allowed to use it. In 1635, a Staffordshire merchant called Thomas Witherings asked Charles I for permission to run a proper state postal monopoly, open to ordinary people as well as the rich and powerful. The General Post Office was founded in 1660 by Charles II. During the Civil War, at the first Post Office in central London, Cromwell’s men set up a secret room where letters were opened, copied and resealed. Roundhead agents pored over the nation’s letters, looking out for any signs of dissent. After the war the service was returned to the public. By the time of Queen Victoria, in 1837, the Post Office had become a crucial part of Britain’s booming industrial landscape, with sub-post offices the hub of Victorian communities. The Royal Mail was once so vital to daily life, that post men delivered up to six times a day. A spokesman for HM Revenue and Customs declined to comment on speculation. A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'Stamp prices, whether set under public or private ownership, are subject to significant competitive pressures. 'Customers have many alternatives to the post and there are now many postal providers. It is pure speculation to suggest that stamp prices could reach £1 in the next few years – in fact in 2013 there was no increase in the price of first class or second class stamps. 'UK stamp prices are among the best value in the EU. In some cases, the UK is the cheapest.' The spokesman added: 'Clearly, the rules governing the implementation of VAT are a matter for HMRC not Royal Mail. 'VAT exemptions for core postal service delivery products such as stamps, by Universal Service Providers (USP), are in place in the vast majority of EU countries under the European VAT Directive. 'Under the Postal Services Act 2011 Royal Mail is the USP in the UK. The VAT exemption would apply regardless of whether Royal Mail was in public or private ownership. Similar VAT exemptions are in place for Universal Service products in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In each country the USP is privately owned.' Save Our Royal Mail is backed by the Countryside Alliance and the National Pensioners Convention, among others. The postal union the Communication Workers Union is believed to have contributed towards the cost of the campaign group's website. It will be launched today. The CWU said in a statement: 'Privatisation often leads to higher prices, fewer services, and lower standards. It also risks a 'race to the bottom' when it comes to jobs, with redundancies and lower terms and conditions. 'This would be disastrous for postal workers and postal services. It would be a major step backwards, not an improvement. 'At CWU we believe that Royal Mail can be a successful company and remain in public ownership; protecting valuable postal services for all communities. We don't believe there are convincing arguments linking privatisation with greater success and we would like to see continued innovation under public ownership.' Over the past five years the volume of . letters sent every day has fallen by 10 million as people increasingly . rely on other methods of communication such . as email.","Save Our Royal Mail warns companies could challenge VAT-free status .

Handcuffed: Mary Kerswell was led from Biggleswade Health Centre by police after a misunderstanding over her medical notes . A grandmother was handcuffed and led away from her doctor’s surgery by police after a row over her demand to see her medical notes. Mary Kerswell, 67, asked for a copy of her GP records after she was called in for a urine test for a kidney condition she did not have. When the mother of two was shown a brief summary of her medical history she was shocked to see that as well as being wrongly listed as having chronic kidney disease, it said she was a heavy smoker with Alzheimer’s. The incorrect summary of her notes also said the healthy pensioner had undergone a hysterectomy and a double hip replacement. Concerned about the errors, Mrs  Kerswell demanded a copy of her full 43-page medical notes – as patients are entitled to do – and was told it would take a week. But when the retired scientist returned to the surgery a week later after paying a £10 fee, she was told the notes were not ready. Frustrated, Mrs Kerswell staged a sit-in and refused to leave until the receptionist printed the records and addressed the errors. But the surgery called the police and a community support officer attended, before calling for back up. Mrs Kerswell was then handcuffed and spoken to in a police car. The pensioner, from Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, yesterday told the Mail that she could not believe the reaction to what she claims was a ‘peaceful protest’. She said: ‘When I went back they were not ready. The receptionist insisted they could not print the records for me. ‘I was going to see my cousin the next day and then be away and I wanted to get the records sorted. 'So I said I would wait. Anyone else would have just left me sat there until I gave up. They told me if I did not leave they would call the police. But I wasn’t doing anything wrong. It was a peaceful protest. I just sat there and sat there wishing I had my Kindle with me. ‘A PCSO came and called for reinforcements and then a policeman handcuffed me and led me outside. I just had to laugh. I could not believe what was going on. All because the receptionist wouldn’t press “print”.’ Receptionists at the Biggleswade Health Centre in Bedfordshire (pictured), reportedly refused to print them out the records for Mrs Kerslake . Yesterday, Bedfordshire Police apologised to Mrs Kerswell after admitting that the incident, in December, could have been dealt with ‘in a less intrusive manner’. Chief Inspector Mark Upex said: ‘I have spoken with Mrs Kerswell on two occasions and while she does not wish to make a formal complaint, she did raise some concerns about the actions taken by the officers. ‘The officers involved have been spoken to and advised about their future conduct. Mrs Kerswell was satisfied with this outcome.’ Mrs Kerswell said she was called by Biggleswade Health Centre just two days after the incident and told she had been taken off their patient list. She has since had to find a new GP. She has complained about the inaccuracies in her medical records. A spokesman for NHS Midlands and East said: ‘The investigation into this complaint is still on-going and therefore we are unable comment.’  The GP surgery was unavailable for comment.","Mary Kerswell, 67, paid £10 to see records at  Biggleswade Health Centre .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . PUBLISHED: . 05:38 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:32 EST, 28 March 2013 . Pippa Middleton's . first column for Waitrose magazine has been unveiled today, confirming the duchess' sister's ascent from party planner to professional foodie. The . Asian feast boasts five recipes across five pages of the glossy . magazine, all of which have been tried and tested by Pippa herself. And while many were braced for the . sort of facile recipes that were so roundly criticised when Pippa . released her much-lampooned guide to entertaining last year, here there . are plenty of ideas for the budding chef - and even the more experienced home cook - to get their teeth into - even if there is very little real cooking involved. But a closer look at the recipes - using many exotic ingredients that would cost around £115 to buy from scratch - reveals that the portions allocated for each diner are, for a meal termed a 'feast', actually minute. To double up would be to incur costs of £215 for one meal. Pippa . Middleton's first column has been unveiled - will it silence the . critics who didn't think the duchess's sister had anything to offer the . Waitrose customer? Some of the ideas have merit. There's an interesting take on a . classic cocktail in the shape of a ginger mojito garnished with red chilli and fresh mint. Some rather attractive . looking Vietnamese spring rolls use ready-cooked prawns and require assembly only. Simple, yes. Demanding zero expertise in the kitchen, yes. But also tasty and . impressive as a light starter. Although make no mistake: they need plenty of careful . attention to look as good as Pippa's. Simple but impressive: Vietnamese spring rolls similar to those in Pippa's Waitrose column . There are traditional hoisin duck rolls too, which as Pippa says, go down a storm. 'Make sure you make more than you think you'll need', she counsels - although at £4 a pack for the duck breast, and with four packs needed to double up on the recipe to allow for those extras, that makes £16 spent on duck alone. Omelette sushi, which Pippa says she used to make while at Edinburgh University (none of the usual Pot Noodles and corned beef hash for Pip's pals then) is a less enticing prospect. Fine for student fodder, the egg, red pepper or smoked salmon-filled rice rolls are not likely to impress too many guests at a more accomplished dinner party chef's Friday Night Feast. The Eastern feast is rounded off with tangerine and sake jellies with coconut cream, which involves juicing two 600g bags of tangerines - fine if you are a socialite with plenty of time on your hands; a bind if you have three children demanding their Turkey Twizzlers and a go on your iPad. Still, the jelly - a fruity concoction of tangerines, sake and fresh mint tempered with a swirl of rich coconut cream - certainly sounds enticing enough to have bags of fruit and cans of coconut flying off the shelves, which is surely half the point. The only drawback is that this seems to be lacking the main event. With just one spring roll, a couple of small duck pancakes and a jelly as sustenance, let's hope guests aren't drinking more than the welcome mojito. Pippa introduces her new column saying that Friday night is the 'perfect time to cook.' 'Regardless of how tired I might be, the moment Friday lunchtime arrives I get that contagious pre-weekend excitement,' she says. 'Fridays, of course, hold the promise of the weekend but also, being far enough away from pre-Monday melancholy, feel freer. 'All of which is why Friday, rather than Saturday, is the night to feast!' William Sitwell, editor of Waitrose magazine, defended his newest columnist, calling her 'fantastic' and 'tremendous' Pippa explains her decision to pick an Asian feast for her first column, saying she has always loved the flavours from countries like Vietnam, China and Japan. Pippa includes a disclaimer, saying that while some of the elements of the feast may seem 'too fussy' to make at home, the recipes actually require 'no Chinatown trips' and 'hardly any cooking'. Ahead of the column's publication, . critics expressed their fears that the young novice would have nothing . to offer the Waitrose customer. But with these recipes, which - with . the exception of the hoisin duck rolls - are outside the repertoire of . most Middle England housewives - will surely inspire experimentation at . some level among the footsure client base. The culinary skills of Pippa . Middleton were defended by the editor of Waitrose magazine, who . responded to critics who said the young novice had nothing to offer the . Waitrose customer. William Sitwell called Pippa . 'tremendous', and said that Pippa's Friday Night Feasts would be 'fantastic'. He accused her doubters of being jealous of her good fortune and skills. He . went on to compare Kate's sister's ideas to those of Cordon . Bleu-trained chef Yotam Ottolenghi and Ben Tish, the man behind one of . London's leading tapas restaurants, Salt Yard. Speaking to local radio station Siren FM, Sitwell said: . 'She's on tremendous form. The first column comes out next week so we . can expect the usual flurry of abuse from newspapers and food bloggers . who are jealous that they haven't got columns. 'In the mix of the magazine, her . stuff is fantastic. She's there alongside Yotam Ottolenghi and some . other up-and-coming chefs like Ben Tish from Salt Yard. 'You'll . still see an array of talent that we use. She's done her very first . series as an Asian-themed Friday night feast and I think people will . enjoy it. When people see the work that she's doing, they'll calm down.' And you certainly cannot fault Pippa's enthusiasm. In the final line of her introductory words, she says she can 'feel the Friday energy already'. 'Friends released from work, hair down, ties loosened and heels clattering in an excited scramble - especially if it's to my place!'.

Plan B - stage name of rapper Ben Drew - wrote the song in response to the London 2011 riots and featured a sample of the fourth movement of Shostakovich’s symphony, reported The Independent. The Russian composer’s work was first performed in 1942 and dedicated to Leningrad’s citizens. In the Novellos, he was credited in Plan B’s song as a co-songwriter of the hit, along with four others. Pianist Shostakovich died in 1975 and was one of the most popular composers of the 20th century. He composed his first symphony aged 19, but in 1936 Joseph Stalin was dismayed by a performance of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District - and state media slammed the ‘bedlam of noise’. However Shostakovich then produced his Fifth Symphony, which was a hit with Soviet dictator Stalin thanks to its message of victory emerging from adversity - and he became a musical hero.

When Lucy Wyatt was handed her newborn son after a gruelling 36 hour-long labour, she expected to feel relief and the overwhelming surge of love. But when midwives placed her baby boy on her breast, her first thought was, 'you did this to me.' Lucy says the traumatic birth, which she was forced to endure with no anaesthetic, left her exhausted and begging for a Caesarean. She was given an episiotomy and eventually gave birth to Henry with no pain relief. Scroll down for video . Traumatised: Lucy Wyatt, 34, says a difficult birth and Post Natal Depression left her terrified of having sex with her husband . After the birth, Lucy needed multiple stitches and was sent home still in considerable pain. The experience  - which Lucy herself describes as 'horrific' - not only left her shattered emotionally and physically - but left her terrified of having sexual relations with her husband. Lucy's experience mirrors that of many women, who according to a new One Poll survey commissioned by This Morning are fearful of sex following childbirth. Results of the poll found that almost half of mums are so traumatised by childbirth that they delay having sex for four months. And of those women who do struggle to reignite their sex lives after giving birth, the poll, of 10,000 women, found that three quarters fail to talk to anyone about the problem. For Lucy, the negative birth experience was impossible to shake off. 'It was really, really bad,' she told Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes on This Morning. 'I couldn't have imagined it would be that bad. 'I had a long labour - 36 hours - and I was begging for a C-section. I couldn't have any anaestheic. To make matters worse, I also had retained product, episiotomy and lots of stitches. Commonplace: Dr Dawn says more women than we might think suffer from sexual issues after childbirth - but they are too embarrassed to talk about it . Lucy says she was in 'lots of pain' when she went back home - and while she expected the pain to get better with time, it actually worsened. 'I was still in a lot of pain. I thought maybe the stitches were too tight, maybe this was supposed to happen. But the pain got gradually worse. And I didn't realise it at time - but I had signs of PND. 'I grew away from Henry when I was supposed to be growing close to him. I looked at him in hospital and thought - what have you done to me?' At first, Lucy didn't feel the same level of blame towards her husband. But further down the line, she says she began to fear rekindling her love life with her husband in case sex led to another pregnancy. 'I got worried that if we had sex again it could happen. And I was worried about how much it would hurt,' she says. This Morning's survey said half of mothers wait up to four months to have sex. Before Lucy tried, 14 months had passed. This Morning's residential expert Dr Dawn Harper said Lucy's fear was actually incredibly common. 'You tick so many boxes - traumatic birth, pain, Post Natal Depression - I would be more surprised if you had been having a very happy, healthy sex life early on,' she said. 'Every woman after a vaginal delivery worries sex will hurt. And there's a deeper psychology there that sex is what got you in this mess in the first place. Fears: 'Every woman after a vaginal delivery worries sex will hurt,' says Dr Dawn. 'And there's a deeper psychology there that sex is what got you in this mess in the first place' 'As a first time mother who had a traumatic delivery there is an element of shock. Plus sleepless nights - bed becomes for sleeping in.' Dr Dawn says many women do not think about intercourse until the six week check. 'We always start talking about contraception at that point,' she says. 'Depending what surveys you look at, about one in 20 won't have sex within six months. Most are back within a year - but Lucy had a lot to contend with.' Eventually, after 14 months Lucy's sex life was brought back on track. 'At five months I had counselling for PND and we did talk about sex, but I still didn't feel comfortable with it. 'After 14 months, I tried again - easing myself into it. I ended up pregnant again. It was probably a good thing. If it had had to be planned, I don't think there would have been a second. 'Because of my previous experience, I didn't believe it. I took about 30 tests until a friend said, ""you're pregnant. Buy some folic acid"".' The second birth was better than the first; Lucy describes it as ' okay'. 'I decided early on I wanted an epidural,' she says. 'It was fine. I had Emma, and I looked at her and thought, ""Oh lovely"" - it was how I thought I would have felt the first time. But the good fortune was not to last. A few days after giving birth and while she was still in hospital, Emma realised she was incontinent. 'My waterworks were not working at all. If I coughed, I wet myself. If I stood up, it would flood. The hospital said I could go home, but I knew something wasn't right. I was incontinent until a year later, when I had an operation. Lucy also suffered a uterus prolapse. 'There was so much swelling I was constantly uncomfortable,' she says. 'I had a lot of pelvic pain.' By this point, sex was entirely off the agenda and Lucy's husband John was feeling desperate. 'As a wife, did you have in your head, ""I need to be a wife again"", asked Ruth. 'Did you have those worries? Did you fear he would look elsewhere?' 'John would instigate sex and I'd say no,' Lucy confessed. 'I couldn't kiss and cuddle because I knew he'd want to go further. My self-esteem was so low. I felt I smelled of urine the whole time.' Lucy finally managed to have sex again after 20 months. But while Lucy feared that she was alone in her suffering, Dr Dawn says such issues are far more commonplace than women realise. 'Lucy had a big baby and a traumatic, interventional delivery. The incontinence with the second baby was partly down to problems caused . with the first baby. The stretching of the pelvic floor muscles caused . the prolapse. 'It's something women don't talk about,' she says. 'But I wish they did - they would realise they are not alone.

"By . Andrew Levy . PUBLISHED: . 14:11 EST, 17 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:22 EST, 17 April 2013 . 'Absurd': Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured at No10 yesterday, wants the clause removed . Teachers could be stripped of the ‘absurd’ right to refuse to do basic work-related tasks such as photocopying and stapling. Contracts currently contain a clause that states they cannot be ordered to carry out day-to-day duties that millions of other workers do as part of their job. Michael Gove today spelled out his intention to end the practice by referring it to the independent School Teachers’ Review Body, which looks at pay and conditions. In a letter to chairman Dame Patricia Hodgson he wrote there is ‘a need to review the framework for non-pay conditions’ that will give schools the ‘flexibilities they need to deliver outstanding education provision’. The ban on 21 routine administrative and clerical tasks was introduced in 2003, when support staff took over the duties. The list included collecting money for school trips, stapling reports together, investigating a pupil’s absence, keeping records and putting up displays in classrooms. They were also exempted from analysing exam results or pupils’ reports - both essential to identify weaknesses. It was approved by most unions except the National Union of Teachers, which argued classroom assistants would be expected to do more if workloads were reduced - meaning more lessons taken by people not qualified as teachers. The STRB has been asked to send its recommendations to Mr Gove by January next year. These could include removing the clause from the teachers’ employment contract. Those that continued to refuse to do the tasks would be in breach of contract. The Education Secretary’s letter will further inflame relations with teachers’ unions . The NUT and NASUWT, which represent 90 per cent of teachers between them, have already announced a series of strikes later this year over pay, pensions and conditions. Earlier this week the Department for . Education unveiled guidelines on how to appraise performance related . pay, which is being introduced from September. They included taking . pupils’ performance and behaviour into account. Banned job: The clause in the contracts prohibit teachers from being forced to carry out 21 administrative tasks such as stapling, keeping records and photocopying . Unions are also opposed to fundamental reforms to the National Curriculum and exam formats. A government source said some of the items on the list of prohibited tasks were ‘absurd’. They added: ‘Teachers shouldn’t be forbidden from analysing why their pupils might be struggling and all teachers who want to improve the reputation of the profession should support sensible reform. ‘Decisions on these issues and things like how best to prepare classes are much better made by teachers on the ground, heads of department and headteachers - not by politicians and union leaders.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘The STRB has said that there needs to be a consistent national framework for the profession. ‘It is now appropriate for the STRB to consider the full range of those aspects of the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document.’ But NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘The letter shows the depth of contempt the Secretary of State has for the teaching profession, for schools, and for children and young people. ‘He is determined to remove any provisions which support teachers in working effectively to raise standards.’","Contracts currently prohibit teachers being forced to do simple tasks .

Accused: The court heard PC Mark Milton's BMW 5 series patrol car had reached a maximum speed of 108mph before the crash . A police officer crashed his high-powered patrol car while driving at speeds of up to 108mph in a 40mph zone, a court has heard. Pc Mark Milton is alleged to have reached the 'grossly excessive' speed shortly before his BMW 5 series was badly damaged when it drove over a traffic island. The 46-year-old officer, whose vehicle suffered a shredded tyre and broken suspension strut, denies driving dangerously on the A442 at Cold Hatton, Shropshire, while on duty with West Mercia Police on the night of October 26, 2011. Opening the case, prosecutor Pat Sullivan told Worcester Crown Court the incident data recorder fitted to the 5 Series BMW showed the vehicle was travelling at 92mph when it struck the raised 'splitter' island at about 10.30pm. Mr Sullivan told jurors that Milton, who is based in Market Drayton, Shropshire, contacted his supervisor by radio several minutes after the collision claiming to have hit a kerb. The court heard a colleague of PC Milton then attended the scene of the accident, which triggered the driver’s airbag. Mr Sullivan said: 'Mark Milton explained that he had been chasing a car that he believed had been a stolen Audi. 'He was asked how fast he was driving and he said between 90 and 100mph.' After examining the roadway, the court heard, it became obvious to PC Milton and his colleague that the car had struck the central island. Alleging that the defendant’s driving fell way below the standard of a reasonable and prudent motorist, Mr Sullivan said: 'Where the collision had taken place the speed limit was 40mph. 'Therefore, an investigation into what had happened began internally within the police.' On trial: Worcester Crown Court heard that investigators quickly realised PC Milton had not hit the kerb as he had claimed . Evidence for the inquiry was contained in the BMW’s data recorder, which was analysed by a collision investigator. Mr Sullivan told the jury: 'He (the investigator) has concluded that the maximum speed attained by PC Milton as he drove along that piece of road - after the 40mph started and before the collision - was 108mph.' Analysis of a 26-second section of the data available to investigators showed that the average speed of the car was between 98mph and 99mph. Mr Sullivan told jurors: 'The Crown’s case is that this is grossly excessive speeding - so grossly excessive that it amounts to dangerous driving.' The court heard the accident happened at such speed the patrol car was sent almost half a mile down the road before coming to a stop. Witness PC Ian Edwards, a collision investigator with West Mercia Police, told the jury tyre marks showed that the BMW went onto a grass verge on the wrong side of the road. Mr Sullivan told jurors: 'The Crown’s . case is that this is grossly excessive speeding - so grossly excessive . that it amounts to dangerous driving.' He said: 'I was able to tell the vehicle had travelled 727 metres prior to coming to a stop.' 'There was about 26 metres before it goes onto the grass verge. It then travels along the grass verge and then comes back onto the road where it continues for some distance. 'I was able to go back 26.5 seconds prior to the impact.

Rail bosses are spending £9,000 on robotic falcons in a bid to stop pigeons from defouling their newly-refurbished train station. Network Rail are hoping the plastic peregrines will scare off pigeons and seagulls at Edinburgh's Waverley Station which has just had a new roof installed which has more than 24,000 panes of glass as part of an ongoing refurbishment. They are programmed to rotate their heads, flap their wings and unleash four different calls to strike fear into their prey. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A wing and a prayer: Rail bosses hope the falcons will deter pigeons from taking roost in their newly-refurbished train station . Plastic predators: The robots are programmed to rotate their heads, flap their wings and unleash four different calls to strike fear into their prey . Fear: Peregrine falcons live off prey birds such as seagulls and pigeons . John Donald of Robop, the East Lothian company which produces the birds, said: 'Most raptors hunt down small animals like voles, but peregrines live off other birds, so pigeons and seagulls are terrified of them. 'A falcon kills by descending on the target bird at great speed. This is called a stoop. During a stoop the falcon achieves a speed in excess on 100 miles per hour. 'Attacks occur with such speed and surprise that birds go on full alert as soon as a peregrine is spotted. 'Many species, such as gulls have a specific alarm call to alert their fellows who will tend to flock together and fly off. 'Robop has been designed to look, move and sound like a real peregrine falcon in order to cause the same reaction as the real bird. Our objective is to firstly cause a panic reaction so that the pest birds will fly away. 'We also want to convey to birds that a peregrine falcon has taken up residence in their territory, so there is no point in returning.' On patrol: The robotic peregrines will take residence at Edinburgh's Waverley station . Robop have installed their hand-built birds all over the world, including the All England Tennis Club in Wimbledon, an airport in Amsterdam and a salt mine in the US. They were brought in to help protect the giant new roof at Edinburgh's Waverley station installed by contractor Balfour Beatty. But John says the peregrines' presence may have a permanent effect on the pigeon population. He said: 'They have been there for 150 years so it may not happen overnight but if the pigeons and seagulls believe a pair of peregrines have moved in on their territory it could force them out.' A Network Rail spokesman said: 'We are advised that falcons are the most likely birds to deter pigeons and we will be interested to see how effective they are. 'There are a number of reasons why we try to deter pigeons, health and safety reasons primarily. If we didn't act to keep numbers in check, the station environment would quickly become very unpleasant and could lead to slips and falls. 'We already have replica, non moving, deterrent birds in various locations around the station as well as netting and surfaces that deter pigeons from landing and prevent access to known roosting spots. 'We also have a device in the travel hall that emits a noise at a high frequency known to deter pigeons from lingering.'","Plastic peregrines rotate heads, flap wings and emit screeching noises .

A teenager accused of snatching an . 11-year-old girl off the street and repeatedly raping her today claimed . he is 'not capable of doing anything as despicable and heartless'. Opemipo Jaji, 18, said at the time of the attack he was at a youth club working on a backing track for a song. He told a jury at the Old Bailey: 'I wrote the song after I heard a girl killed herself from bullying. I wrote the song hoping things would get better.' Jaji admits he was on the same bus as the victim and got off at the same stop. But he claims he then went on to a youth club in Enfield, North London, for a recording session. The trainee chef said he went to Jubilee Park . later that evening to compose music but left after 10 minutes because he . saw police at the gate. Jaji, of Edmonton, north London, denies raping the girl in November, last year. The court heard the girl was walking home from school when she was dragged into the park and subjected to a three-hour rape ordeal. She ran home and police were called. Traces of her blood were found on . Jaji’s white trainers and bag which he says were from when he sat down . on the grass later that evening. Opemipo Jaji, 18, told an Old Bailey . jury that when he previously mugged and sexually assaulted another . schoolgirl in an almost identical attack two years earlier it had been 'childhood stupidity.' Police search teams in Jubilee Park in Enfield looking for clues at the time of the rape in November 2012 . The trainee chef claimed that . since the first attack he’s been forced to grow up, and was planning to . set up his own catering firm. He also claimed he was to appear on BBC TV . talent show The Voice. The court heard Jaji accounts for every second of the day so he 'would not get into trouble.' Jaji denies he was the rapist who . grabbed the girl after she got off a bus and walked through a north . London park on a Friday night last November. The girl was forced to strip from . her school uniform and had a woollen glove pushed in her mouth to stop . her screaming as she was subjected to a terrifying three-hour ordeal. Her injuries were so bad she had to spend four days in hospital. The jury were told just 21 months . earlier, aged 16, Jaji grabbed a schoolgirl from a bus stop, dragged her . to a secluded area on a housing estate, stripped her of her school . uniform and used her school tie to gag her. He later pleaded guilty to robbery and sexual assault. Today, Jaji said: 'It was just childhood stupidity. 'Since I’ve been in prison and out, I’ve been forced to grow up. 'Since then I have sorted myself out. I . got an apprenticeship as a chef while being paid £10 an hour, I was two . weeks from starting my own catering business. I was suppose to be on . The Voice TV show on BBC. 'I am just not capable of doing something as despicable and heartless as this. To be honest, I don’t know what to say.' Terrifying assault: The girl finally reached home at 8pm and was taken to hospital for surgery . 'I have done everything to keep myself . out of trouble. Every single day of my week is planned out to the . letter by me. That’s just because I don’t really like too much free time . because you get into trouble.' He told the jury he had been on a . bus with the schoolgirl and had handed her back her travel pass when it . fell to the floor, explaining why his fingerprints were on it. He also said he went inside Jubilee . Park later that evening to compose music in his 'favourite spot' but . left after 10 minutes because he saw police at the gate. He explained blood belonging to the . girl found on the inside of his boxer shorts, around the crotch and zip . area of his trousers, on and inside his upper long johns, t-shirt, polo . shirt, trainers and on his Adidas sports bag must have been picked up . when he sat down on the grass.

Also on his bed was a picture of a seven-year-old dressed in . tennis clothes cut out and pasted on a piece of cardboard. They also . found a page of small ads searching for childminder. Rosina Cottage, prosecuting, accused Jaji of wanting case to go to trial so he could watch the girl having to relive her ordeal. He replied: 'What does that do for me exactly?' Ms Cottage said: 'You are sexually interested in very little girls and manipulate and control them. 'What better way than to control a . little girl than make her come to court and give evidence?

In 2011, Ronald, Eric and David Thurman celebrated their 80th birthday in Oxfordshire. They were known as the 'Tabloid Triplets' because their picture was published in a national newspaper when they were born in 1931. Eric, Alan and Audrey's birthday celebration was a rare get-together for the . siblings because Eric has moved to Wales. But there was a time when the three were inseparable as they grew up together. Grandmother-of-21, Audrey O'Donnell, who lives with husband Bernard in Wythenshawe, Manchester. Describing what she was told of their birth, she said: 'They used one of those ear trumpets and said that perhaps there was a second heart beat but they weren't sure. 'So it was a real shock when three of us arrived, there was a dash to get more nappies. They wrapped us all in cotton wool and cooking foil to keep us warm.' The triplets were such a rare sight, their father Edward was inundated with requests from baby food companies to use the triplets in advertising, but he turned them down.

David Edgerton, 23, has been jailed for nine years for the rape of a 14-year-old in North Wales last August . A judge has slammed police and prosecutors after a serial sex offender raped a 14-year-old girl just ten days after being freed on bail for another rape. David Edgerton, 23, of Connah's Quay, Flintshire, was jailed for nine years today after admitting dragging the schoolgirl into woods and attacking her last August. But judge Merfyn Hughes said the victim and her family are entitled to 'an explanation' after it emerged Edgerton was free on bail at the time, despite being arrested for the rape of a 42-year-old woman ten days earlier. Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales also heard that Edgerton had a history of violent and sexual offences against females stretching back to 2009 including an attack on a 10-year-old girl. Judge Hughes said: 'In my judgement both the victims and their families are entitled to as . full an explanation of the matters which led to the defendant being at . liberty and able to commit some of the offences. 'I would suggest the . Crown Prosecution Service and police should offer to provide the . explanation in person if they so request it.' The court heard how in August last year Edgerton had initially attempted to abduct a 13-year-old girl in the village of Leeswood near Mold in Wales but he stopped when a friend arrived. A short time later he conned the 14-year-old victim into showing him the way to find a pub before dragging her into woods, threatening to kill her then raping her. During the horrific ordeal the terrified girl managed to send a message to her sister's Facebook page via her mobile phone saying 'help' and 'raping me'. Her family frantically set out to find her and the victim could hear them calling her name as she was being attacked. The victim's mother eventually found the girl after she escaped and got back to the road. 'It's impossible to avoid . the conclusion the psychological scars of what you did to her will . remain with her for the rest of her life,' he told Edgerton. At an earlier hearing, Edgerton was convicted by a jury of attempting to rape a 20-year-old woman in her bedroom at Connah's Quay, Flintshire, in June 2009. Sexual predator: David Edgerton had a history of offences against females stretching back to 2009 . At the time the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge him because the evidence available was insufficient to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. In December 2011, Edgerton was jailed for six months after grabbing a ten-year-old girl in Chester. The attack on the 14-year-old girl took place in Leeswood in North Wales . The victim had told Cheshire police at the time she knew Edgerton wanted to take her somewhere and 'do stuff'. But despite her evidence he was only charged with common assault. As part of the current proceedings, he was convicted of assault with intent to commit a sexual offence. Edgerton was also found guilty of raping a 42-year-old woman in Warrington in August last year. Judge Hughes remarked: 'The third time he commits a serious sexual offence and the police and CPS don't bring all the threads together and realise how dangerous he is.' The judge said the bail decision puzzled him. 'There's no explanation why the police and CPS couldn't have understood the danger this man presented. In the absence of a full explanation, which I have no doubt will be subject of a full inquiry, I find it difficult to express a view because I don't have all the information.' Last night Detective Chief Inspector Peter Shaw of Cheshire police said : 'A full review of the rationale and decision making surrounding the decision to grant Edgerton police bail has been conducted by the Cheshire Constabulary Professional Standards Department. 'In any criminal case, the decision to charge with an offence, and to give consideration to removing an individual's entitlement to bail is based upon the evidence pertaining to the offence for which the suspect has been arrested. 'The decision to charge for serious offences must be reviewed by the Crown Prosecution Service and only when the evidence is deemed strong enough will authorisation to charge be granted. Until this point, the suspect's entitlement to bail would remain and there is no ability to introduce further bad character evidence at this stage. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC: 'There's no explanation why the police and CPS couldn't have understood the danger this man presented.' 'The circumstances of Edgerton's arrest in Cheshire, in 2012, was the suspicion of the rape of a 42-year-old woman. These circumstances were quite different to that of the other offences of which he was suspected. 'Ensuring that offences of rape are dealt with in an effective, yet compassionate, manner is a priority for Cheshire Police. Rape and sexual assaults are amongst the most traumatic of crimes. We want victims to be assured that we are here to help. 'Anyone who has been subjected to this type of crime should feel confident that they will receive the support they need from the Dedicated Rape Unit and other support agencies we work alongside. Foremost, any victim of a crime such as this will be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, and any allegations will be thoroughly investigated and with the needs of the victim as our main priority.' Justice: Sexual predator David Edgerton was finally jailed for nine years at Caernarfon Crown Court today . The CPS also defended its actions. Ed Beltrami, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Wales said: 'David Edgerton is a highly dangerous individual who is guilty of a string of horrific and violent offences. It is right that he has received a significant custodial sentence.' He added: 'Over the last few weeks I have reviewed the CPS involvement in this case so that I can be assured that we have acted in accordance with our obligations under the Code for Crown Prosecutors at all times. 'The CPS was first asked to provide advice to police on an allegation of attempted rape against . Ed Beltrami, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Wales, said: 'Some of the offences that individually . may have had weak evidence to support a realistic prospect of . conviction, became stronger cases when looked at together.' David Edgerton in 2009. At that time, a decision not to charge was taken on the grounds that the evidence available was insufficient to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. This was mainly because the victim was unable to identify the suspect with sufficient clarity. At that stage, this was the only allegation relating to Edgerton. 'In December 2011 Edgerton was successfully convicted of common assault on a child in Warrington. 'In August 2012 Edgerton raped a woman in Broughton, Cheshire. Police were still investigating this incident when Edgerton committed his terrible crimes in Leeswood less than two weeks later. The Broughton incident was not referred to the CPS by police until after Leeswood attacks had occurred. 'Once Cheshire police referred a file on the Broughton rape to the CPS, it was considered alongside the files on the Leeswood incidents. All matters were immediately dealt with holistically. 'Some of the offences that individually may have had weak evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction, became stronger cases when looked at together. As a result, Edgerton was charged with all offences, including the attempted rape in 2009. A further charge of assault with intent to commit a sexual offence was added, in relation to the Warrington common assault. 'I am satisfied that the CPS considered all allegations against Edgerton in the correct manner, as soon as the evidential files relating to these horrific offences were passed to us. By doing so, the prosecuting authorities ensured that successful prosecution of all the offences was possible.'","David Edgerton jailed for nine years at Caernarfon Crown Court today .
