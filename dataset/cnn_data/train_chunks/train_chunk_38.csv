"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Former NFL wide receiver Plaxico Burress pleaded guilty Thursday to a weapons charge stemming from a shooting incident at a nightclub last year, the Manhattan district attorney said. Former NFL wide receiver Plaxico Burress will serve two years in prison after pleading guilty to weapons charges. Burress, 32, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of attempted criminal possession of a weapon and will serve two years in prison, according to Alicia Maxey Greene, spokeswoman for district attorney Robert M. Morgenthau's office. Two years of supervised release will follow his jail term, she said. Burress is free on bail and will be sentenced September 22. A grand jury indicted the former New York Giants football player earlier this month on two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and a single count of reckless endangerment in the second degree. He pleaded not guilty to those charges earlier this year. Burress accidentally shot himself in the leg November 29, 2008, with a .40-caliber semi-automatic pistol he was carrying in the waistband of his jeans. The incident occurred in the VIP area of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan. A teammate who was with Burress, linebacker Antonio Pierce, drove him to a hospital and arranged to have the pistol delivered to Burress' New Jersey home, according to an August 3 statement from the district attorney's office. The district attorney also sought charges against Pierce, but the grand jury did not indict him. Burress was not licensed to carry a pistol in either New York or New Jersey. No one, including employees of the New York Presbyterian Hospital and the NFL, called the police to report the gunshot wound, as required by law. One of the hospital workers was suspended after the incident. Burress became a hero to New York Giants fans in the 2008 Super Bowl when he caught the game-winning touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning with 35 seconds remaining in the game. In the following year, however, Burress' career with the Giants was marred by a series of incidents in addition to the shooting. He was suspended from the team in early October for missing a practice, and later that month the NFL fined him $45,000 after he argued with a referee and threw a football into the stands during a game. Burress was suspended from the Giants immediately after the shooting incident. The team released him in April.

"(CNN) -- Amid international condemnation after security forces reportedly attacked demonstrators at a peaceful rally, reportedly killing nearly 160 people, the Guinean government said Tuesday most of the victims were crushed in the crowd. Police arrest a protester on Monday near a stadium in Guinea's capital Conakry during a protest. Reports put the death toll at 157, with more than 1,200 people injured, U.S. State Department Spokesman Ian Kelly said in a statement Tuesday. Earlier, the United Nations, citing media reports, said at least 58 people died Monday when security forces opened fire to disperse a demonstration at a stadium in the capital, Conakry. ""The United States condemns the Guinean military's brazen and inappropriate use of force against civilians,"" Kelly said. ""The military also stands accused of carrying out brutal rapes and sexual assaults on women demonstrators and bystanders during its rampage."" On Tuesday, the African Union expressed its ""grave concern"" about the situation. ""The [AU] Commission strongly condemns the indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians, which left dozens dead and many others injured, while serious other violations of human rights were committed,"" the AU stated. Tens of thousands of people were protesting the rule of Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara, who seized power in a bloodless coup in December, according to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. The United States demanded the immediate release of opposition leaders and a return to civilian rule, the State Department statement said. Human Rights Watch also condemned the violence against ""generally peaceful demonstrators"" and urged the government ""to hold accountable the security forces."" It quoted victims and witnesses who said security forces sexually assaulted women at the demonstration and also attacked demonstrators with knives and bayonets. ""Women were raped by soldiers in the stadium. I saw them,"" former Guinean Prime Minister Sidya Touré told the French newspaper Le Monde. Touré led the country from 1996-1999 and was participating in the peaceful demonstration. The government maintained in a statement that ""according to preliminary investigations, most of the innocent victims died as a result of being crushed in the crowd."" And it blamed ""certain political leaders"" for staging the demonstration despite being asked not to do so and warned that security could not be guaranteed for the gathering. The leaders stormed the stadium, ""breaking down doors and the main entryways, causing much violence that left dozens of victims, including 53 who died by suffocation and four killed by ricocheting bullets, which were recorded that day by authorities working with the Guinean Red Cross and verified by hospital officials,"" the government said. It accused the leaders of looting two police commissaries before the demonstrations, letting prisoners out of jail and stealing weapons. The government said it condemns ""these deliberate acts in violation of the law, and are working to find and bring to justice those responsible for these reprehensible acts."" The AU noted the violence comes amid serious uncertainties and setbacks in the effort to restore constitutional order to Guinea after the December coup. The AU urged the coup leaders to stick to their vow not to run for office in the January presidential election. The European Union's foreign policy chief Javier Solana, also condemned the actions of security forces in Conakry on Monday. Solana called ""for the immediate release of the arrested political leaders"" and asked authorities to ""exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition."" Guinea was thrown into turmoil in December after the death of President Lansana Conte. He was one of only two presidents to rule Guinea, after it gained independence from France in 1958. Conte came to power in 1984, when the military seized control of the government after the death of the first president, Sekou Touré. Following his death, Camara seized control in a bloodless military coup and declared himself president of the National Council for Democracy, which he called a transitional body that would oversee the country's return to democracy.","NEW: Guinean government says most victims were crushed in the crowd .

"(CNN) -- Phillip Garrido and his wife, Nancy, met while he was in a federal prison serving time for abducting a different woman from South Lake Tahoe, California, and holding her captive in a storage unit, Nevada probation and parole officials said Friday. Phillip and Nancy Garrido face 29 felony charges relating to the kidnapping of Jaycee Lee Durgan. Details of Phillip Garrido's past began to emerge after he and his wife were charged with crimes relating to the abduction of 11-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard in 1991 and her captivity in a hidden shed-and-tent compound in the couple's backyard in Antioch, California. Phillip Garrido, 58, and Nancy Garrido, 54, face 29 felony charges relating to Dugard's kidnapping. They both pleaded not guilty. Garrido's record as a registered sex offender began with a 1977 conviction on charges of kidnapping and rape of a South Lake Tahoe woman, the Nevada Department of Public Safety's Division of Parole and Probation said in a press release. The victim was found with Garrido inside a mini warehouse, a type of small storage facility, in Reno. Nevada, according to court documents from Garrido's appeal. She was raped inside the storage unit, according to the documents. The woman, a 25-year-old casino worker, picked up Garrido at a supermarket near Lake Tahoe on Nov. 22, 1976, after he asked her for a ride. The documents state that when she stopped the car to drop him off, Garrido handcuffed her, bound her legs and neck with a leather strap, and drove off with her to Reno.  Watch more about the psychological effects of being held captive » . Garrido, then 25, ""told the victim it wasn't intentional that he had taken her, but that it was her fault because she was attractive,"" according to the documents. Garrido served 11 years of a 50-year sentence in Levenworth, Kansas. Parole officials said he met his wife, Nancy, while he was in prison, but they didn't give details. Garrido's life began to spiral downward in high school, his father, Manuel Garrido, told CNN. ""He had a motorcycle accident and got on LSD and he's not in his right mind,"" Manuel Garrido said. ""He was in a bad accident and hit his head and then got on LSD in high school. That was the end. He went to selling dope. He went crazy."" Though he hasn't spoken to his son for 20 years because they ""didn't get along"" and has never been to the home where his son is accused of holding Dugard, Manuel Garrido said he wasn't surprised to hear about accusations. ""I wasn't surprised because I know he's out of his head for God's sakes,"" he said. ""He was an angel when he was young and it's a damn shame."" Phillip Garrido's father also said his son believes ""he talks to God and he can do things."" And Garrido apparently maintained a blog where he discussed talking to God and also claimed he could control sound with his mind.  Watch more about the blog » . The blog now has profanity-laced responses from people outraged over Phillip Garrido's alleged actions. Garrido's blog entries are posted by ""THEMANWHOSPOKEWITHHISMIND.""  He refers to ""God's Desire,"" which is a church based out of his home in Antioch, according to CNN affiliate KCRA of Sacramento. In a post on August 14, he writes that during a ""powerful demonstration"" in July in Pittsburg, California, ""the Creator has given me the ability to speak in the tongue of angels in order to provide a wake-up call that will in time include the salvation of the entire world."" ""You too can witness what the world believe's [sic] is impossible to produce!"" he writes, providing an e-mail address. ""DON'T MISS OUT!"" Several news outlets, including The New York Times, have reported on the blog since the case started making international headlines Thursday. In another blog posting last year, Garrido claims to have a ""new insight that has the potential of helping people who hear voices to possibly stop and re-examine their thinking before committing a violent act on themselves and/or others.""

"(CNN) -- No major security problems were reported at Michael Jackson's public memorial service on Tuesday in Los Angeles, California, according to police. Police gather Tuesday morning in Los Angeles for Michael Jackson's public memorial. The only controversy concerned the issue of who ultimately would pay for the city's efforts to heighten security as thousands of people from around the world flooded the city to say farewell to the pop icon, who died of unknown causes on June 25. A budget crisis pushed the city to ask the public for help in paying for security at the memorial. It set up a Web site where fans can donate. The city is hoping to recoup some of the estimated $2 million to $4 million it cost to have thousands of police and firefighters on hand in case of an emergency. Matt Szabo, spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, said providing security at the event was the city's ""obligation"" and its ""No. 1 priority."" But the city does need help, he said. ""Nothing could tarnish this event more than having a public safety disturbance of any kind,"" he said. ""We're working to make sure that doesn't happen. And we're asking Michael Jackson fans to help contribute."" Visit the donation Web site . Los Angeles faces a budget crisis and has amassed $530 million in debt. The state of California's budget deficit has climbed to $24 billion. ""Even though we're the entertainment capital of the world, we're not immune to the recession,"" Szabo said. Los Angeles Councilwoman Jan Perry said last week that the city would pay for the security efforts. But there remains some dispute. Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine on Monday called for AEG, the company that owns the Staples Center, to cover all costs of the memorial, arguing the public should not foot any of the bill, according to the Los Angeles Times. The city provided security downtown, where the public memorial for Jackson was held, and also at the Jackson family's private service earlier in the morning. Police said crowds outside the public memorial were not as large as they had anticipated. Between 5,000 and 15,000 people without tickets showed support for the pop star by waiting outside the Staples Center during the service, said Jim McDonnell, an assistant Los Angeles police chief. An exact count was not immediately available. Some 11,000 members of the public got free tickets to attend the memorial in the Staples Center after being chosen through a lottery. Another 6,500 were ticketed to watch it on a screen at the nearby Nokia Theater. About 1.6 million had vied for those tickets online.  See performances from the memorial » . Police asked members of the public without tickets to stay home. Before the memorial began, Police Chief William Bratton said he expected a security effort not seen in decades, calling Jackson's memorial the ""largest event we've planned for since the 1984 Olympics."" About 3,000 police officers were on hand to ensure the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, McDonnell said. By comparison, about 2,000 officers were deployed for last month's parade and celebration at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the Los Anegeles Lakers, who had won the NBA championship. By 1 p.m. local time, no police reports had been filed in relation to the event, said Richard French, a police spokesman. Police closed a several-block area outside the Staples Center and closed highway exits near downtown Los Angeles during the event. People without tickets or media passes were not allowed in that closed zone, said Earl Paysinger, an assistant police chief in Los Angeles. Helicopters flew overhead, and sheriff's deputies strolled through with bomb-sniffing dogs. But the security did not seem to affect the reflective and at times festive mood at Jackson's remembrance, according to CNN correspondents.","NEW: City of Los Angeles taking donations for security efforts via its Web site .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- He lies in a bed on a balloon-type mattress, to reduce pressure on his burned body. He is covered with bandages; a ventilator breathes for Michael Brewer because he can't do it for himself. He's hooked up to the marvels of modern medicine that are trying to give the 15-year-old burn victim a chance to be a kid once again. Sixty-five percent of his body is covered with second- and third-degree burns. ""People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about,"" said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami. ""I've been to movies like everyone else, and Hollywood hasn't even thought of something like this,"" Namias said. Brewer is heavily sedated, and the ventilator does not allow him to speak. His open wounds are covered by bandages, which are changed daily. It's a four-hour process. He has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began October 12, when police say five teenage friends, including a 13-year-old, doused Brewer with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire. The attack occurred after Brewer reported to police that one of the youths had stolen his father's bicycle. Police say the bicycle was stolen because Brewer did not pay one of the boys $40 for a video game. According to police, witnesses said the teens called Brewer ""a snitch"" as they used a lighter to set him ablaze. Namias explained how Brewer's organs are not functioning the way they should be, but that is expected at this early stage of recovery. ""He's still on the ventilator and advanced modes of mechanical ventilation. We are breathing for him. His contribution to the breathing is trivial,"" Namias said. Namias also explained that in burn cases, words must be chosen carefully when talking about patients and their condition because so much is at risk and so much can change quickly. ""When you say he's doing OK, in this situation it means he's alive and responding to treatments,"" Namias said. ""We're still dealing with the respiratory failure. We're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive."" On Monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in Broward County, Florida. State prosecutors were granted additional time to build their case. Formal charges are expected later this month. For now, all five teens are being held in custody. Four of the boys, all 15 years old, could be charged as adults. The 13-year-old also could be charged as an adult but under Florida law only if Brewer dies. Michael Brewer's parents, Valerie and Michael Brewer Sr., issued a written statement through the hospital last week. They are not granting interviews. ""The recovery process will be baby steps, but eventually he will be whole again,"" they wrote. But their son's injuries enter the realm of medicine and science that has no guarantee. ""There's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn,"" Namias said. ""Surviving is a miracle of modern medicine and about the technology and the things we do. This is not like a gunshot and you come out of the [operating room], and say everything's going to be OK,"" he added. ""We never give up, and we never predict it. ... Our expectation is survival."" Across the hospital floor in the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital, six other people's lives also are at stake: all victims of various accidents, all with burns similar to Michael Brewer's. They, too, are trying to regain at least a part of what they used to have. ""It's understandable that people can be burned in accidents,"" Namias said. ""But this was no accident. This didn't have to happen at all.""","Police say teens doused Michael Brewer, 15, with rubbing alcohol and set him ablaze .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Pakistani forces in the last month foiled a planned attack on the parliament building, the intelligence agency and other federal institutions, the country's interior minister told CNN Sunday. Pakistan's parliament building was one target of a planned attack, an official says. In the last four weeks, authorities arrested three men with suicide vests who were plotting to carry out the attacks, said Interior Minister Rehman Malik. Malik would not say exactly when the men were caught. Pakistan is in the midst of an intense military offensive against Taliban militants. The militants are suspected of launching attacks inside Pakistan and in neighboring Afghanistan from their haven in the mountainous tribal region along the northwestern border. On Sunday, a suicide bomber in volatile northwestern Pakistan killed at three people and wounded 15 others, police said. The bombing rocked the Pakistani city of Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province. The incident took place when police approached a man acting suspiciously. The man ran away, police chased him and a gunfight ensued. The man ran out of bullets and blew himself up. Two women and seven children were among the injured. Remains of the alleged attacker were found, police said. Five houses were destroyed. The incident follows a car bombing on Saturday in Peshawar that killed two people, including the spokesman for an extremist group called Ansar ul Islam. Two suspects are in custody. Malik said Sunday the government's anti-Taliban operations will continue during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month considered to be a time of peace. Militants in North Waziristan, part of the tribal region, have said they will observe a unilateral ceasefire throughout the month. ""There will not be a ceasefire during Ramadan. We are not interested in a ceasefire,"" Malik said. ""They haven't kept their commitment in the past. We will continue targeted actions against the Taliban."" Malik also said the Taliban killed the father-in-law of its leader Baitullah Mehsud and several other relatives, accusing them of leaking information about his whereabouts. Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house. The Taliban claims Mehsud is alive but ill.","NEW: Suicide bomber in northwestern Pakistan kills at least three, authorities say .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The legal battle between Miss California USA pageant officials and former beauty queen Carrie Prejean ended Tuesday with an agreement to drop their claims, according to a pageant spokesman. The pageant has dropped its lawsuit filed last month demanding Prejean repay $5,200 given her for breast implants, publicist Kenn Henman said. Prejean, in exchange, withdrew her suit accusing the pageant of violating her privacy by confirming to reporters that her breasts were fake, he said. Details of the agreement were not immediately available, he said Tuesday afternoon. ""We are moving forward from the past and looking towards the crowning of two winners and the new look of the upcoming Miss California USA pageant,"" pageant Executive Director Keith Lewis said in a written statement. The public fight began last April when Prejean, 22, stepped into controversy by declaring her opposition to same-sex marriage while answering a judge's question at the Miss USA pageant. Prejean finished as first runner-up. While state and national pageant officials publicly supported her initially, their opinions eventually changed after she continued to make public statements about same-sex marriage. She held onto her crown through May -- despite a series of questionable photos that emerged on gossip Web sites. She was dethroned in June by Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump amid growing complaints by state officials that she was uncooperative and not meeting her contractual obligations. Prejean filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in August, claiming that her firing was religious discrimination because of her stand against same-sex marriage. The pageant's countercomplaint said Prejean's belligerent behavior, lack of cooperation and contract breaches caused her firing, not her opposition to same-sex marriage. Prejean also claimed pageant officials violated her privacy by acknowledging to reporters that her breasts were fake. The truth about Prejean's breasts ""ceased being private during the swimsuit competition of the nationally televised Miss USA pageant, in which Ms. Prejean walked the stage in a bikini,"" pageant lawyers said in their countersuit filed in October. State pageant officials say they loaned the money for the breast surgery under an oral agreement with Prejean and she never repaid them. The group also asked a judge to give them any profits from Prejean's tell-all book due out this month, which they claim was written in violation of her pageant contract. One thing they all agreed on was that Prejean needed bigger breasts if she was to be competitive in the national pageant in April, the pageant's filing said. ""Ms. Prejean disclosed that she had been thinking about and wanting to have breast augmentation surgery for some time, but did not have the money to pay for it,"" the filing said. ""She felt that if she had the surgery, in her opinion, she would be more competitive for the Miss USA pageant."" After pageant officials agreed to loan her the money, Prejean underwent breast augmentation in January, the pageant filing said. The court documents gave an inside look at the hostile relationship between Prejean, California pageant officials and Trump. After the Miss USA pageant, ""With her new-found notoriety, an inflated sense of self, and the lure of financial gain available to her, Ms. Prejean turned even further against the Miss California USA organization, abandoned her obligations as the Miss California USA titleholder, and violated multiple provisions of the contract which governed her reign,"" the pageant filing said.","Pageant dropped lawsuit demanding Carrie Prejean repay $5,200 for her breast implants .

"Unheralded American Doug Barron has become the first player to be banned by the PGA Tour for taking performance-enhancing drugs. The 40-year-old has been given a one-year suspension. He is the first professional to fail a drugs test since the PGA and European Tours began their anti-doping programs in July 2008. ""I would like to apologize for any negative perception of the Tour and its players resulting from my suspension,"" Barron said in a statement on the PGA Tour official Web site www.pgatour.com. ""I want my fellow Tour members and the fans to know that I did not intend to gain an unfair competitive advantage or enhance my performance while on Tour."" In common with their policy, the PGA Tour did not release details of the drug taken by Barron to fail the test. Barron, who turned professional in 1992, was a PGA Tour regular for eight seasons, with his best finish a tie for third at the Byron Nelson Classic in 2006. He has won over $3 million but campaigned in recent seasons on the second-tier Nationwide Tour, playing just one event on the main tour this year. He is also reported to have had health problems. The last time Barron captured the headlines was in very different circumstances at the 2006 Transistions Championship in Florida, where he removed his shirt to play a shot out of the water on the 16th hole at Innisbrook. The incident was captured on television and was greeted with amusement by his fellow players. Neither the PGA Tour or the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) have yet to comment further on the suspension. Golf bowed to pressure from WADA to introduce drug testing in the sport last year. PGA Tour testing is administered by The National Center for Drug Free Sport every week of the season, with all samples analyzed by WADA-accredited laboratories.","Doug Barron becomes the first golfer to be banned for doping by PGA Tour .

"QINGDAO, China (CNN) -- Another round of toasts and exclamations of ""hajiu"" sounded out around me. I took a sip and set down my small glass of Tsingtao beer as my new friends downed theirs and refilled. Our seafood dinner, perched on the single cluttered table of a tiny antique shop, was punctuated regularly by such moments. A worker operates the giant fermentation units at the Qingdao Brewery plant in Qingdao. I joined in happily, although somewhat bemused, at each increasingly beery celebration of our host, the worldly Captain Jau. My company, a gathering from four regions of China, was engaging me in Chinese drinking etiquette, in the city of Qingdao. A few drinks in the People's Republic of China led me to discover European delights and other unexpected finds in this modest city. You'd be forgiven for not knowing where Qingdao (pronounced Chingdao) is. The Chinese city in Shandong province doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as Beijing, Shanghai, or even Xi'an. The 2008 Olympics gave it a place on the map as China's sailing hub; no longer a secret that holiday-making officials could keep for themselves. But my American spell-check doesn't recognize it (which says more about my spell-check), and you can still find pre-Cultural Revolution manhole covers. So what is it about this city that seduces the unassuming traveler? Nestled on the coast of Shandong province, almost exactly halfway between its big sisters, Beijing and Shanghai, Qingdao features as a handy pit-stop on East coast itineraries. It boasts great infrastructure, a charming climate, alfresco eateries, good coffee, sandy beaches, German history, international hotels, a brand new airport and even a famous brewery. Qingdao could pass itself off as a miniature Seattle if it weren't for the fact that pretty much no one outside of the five-star hotels speaks English, and that communism still articulates itself through the tourist beaches, stoically named Number One to Number Six. ""In mainland China, Qingdao's history is uniquely international; in fact, more of the city's cultural identity is wrapped up in its German colonial past than even its prominent role in the emergence of Daoism"" said Eric Blocher, editor of the English-language magazine Red Star. ""The local culture bureau once joked to us that Qingdao is a 'cultural desert', because it doesn't have the dynastic lineage of Nanjing or Xi'an, or opera for that matter,"" Blocher said. ""But that's not what makes a city livable, or even fun -- if your office is in downtown, you're never more than five minutes from a protected beach; there's always excellent seafood close at hand; you can buy China's best beer fresh, for 10 cents a pound, and walk around drinking it out of a plastic bag."" Following this key advice, I visited Qingdao during the International Beer Festival in late August, an event aimed largely at a domestic Chinese market. The West knows beer. China does not. The annual Beer Festival aims to change this. While the bright lights and myriad beers flowed, one thing was obvious: this was for the tourists. True Qingdaonese people are fiercely proud of Tsingtao beer, produced just down the road on Beer Street, and little else is drunk here in homes or bars. Pijiu, beer in Mandarin, is hajiu in Qingdaonese, the regional dialect. When in doubt, this does as well for a toast as anything else. Indeed, there is no better way of celebrating an occasion than by toasting the guest of honor with a bag of fresh beer. If I was the guest of honor at Captain Jau's table, I certainly wasn't living up to expectations. Particularly not for my self-appointed etiquette guardian and ""pure Qingdao boy,"" Loukas. As I raised my glass for a sip and Loukas jumped to toast the good weather for the nth time, it all became clear. In Qingdao, a beer glass is never raised without a toast. This serves three (frankly ingenious) purposes; beer is drunk in unison; beer isn't consumed too rapidly, since constant toasting would ruin conversation; and everyone finds ways to honor each other for the purposes of toasting. Captain Jau was particularly in favor of the latter as our eccentric host was made subject of most cheers, likewise teaching us the salutations he had learned from the many foreign guests he had cooked for. From the French ""salut!"" to the German ""prost!"" to the Turkish ""serefe!"" Most popular of all was homegrown ""hajiu!"" Alcohol is enjoyed throughout China. Microbreweries are yet to catch on here like they have in Japan and Singapore. For now Tsingtao holds the monopoly, and Qingdao's people aren't complaining. The Tsingtao Brewery, founded in 1903 by German settlers, confiscated by the Japanese in 1915, turned over to state ownership in 1949 and finally privatized in the early 1990s, has witnessed a colorful history. The largest stakeholder, Anheuser-Busch, recently sold majority ownership to Japanese Asahi Breweries. Residents are the first to introduce you to their biggest export. Outside every shop is a barrel or two of Tsingtao, with a ream of clean plastic bags ready to be filled with cheap 3.5 percent beer. Tsingtao beer tastes crisp and sweet (most likely from rice mixed in to cut down on the cost of barley. It is bought by the pound and weighed to prevent gaseous volume manipulation. A pint, when sold in this method, costs around 1.5 renminbi, or 22 U.S. cents. Beer is a way of life here and has been ever since the Germans arrived and erected tree-lined avenues, red-roofed houses and a brewery. The Germans are gone but the beer stayed. And with it, three hajiu-loving generations tell you about their happy memories. ""When I was little, buying beer was one special job I did for my dad every summer day,"" explained Irene Cheung over a fresh bag of beer. ""I was the little girl proudly and carefully carrying the plastic bag home."" It is easier to identify Qingdao by what it is not -- smoggy, crowded Beijing, or nightlife hub Shanghai -- than what it is or hopes to be. This may be the very reason why Qingdao remains largely unvisited by the West. And while there may not be much more than good weather, food and beer to keep you content, that may just be enough to hop on the three-hour flight from Hong Kong, or the one hour 20 minute-journey from Beijing or Shanghai. Following Olympic-based investment, more than 3,000 factories have sprung up in the airport suburbs. You can source anything from shoes to jewels to Durex condoms among the largely Korean-owned industries. If these things aren't up your street, head elsewhere; like functionally named Beer Street, Bar Street, or my personal favorite, Coffee and Tea Craft Street.

"(CNN) -- What can 40 goats and 20 cows buy a Kenyan man? Chelsea Clinton's love, if you ask Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor. Hillary Clinton says she would let her daughter Chelsea know about a Kenyan man's unique marriage offer. The Kenyan man first offered the dowry nine years ago to then-President Bill Clinton in asking for the hand of his only child. He renewed it Thursday after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked about the proposal at a Nairobi town hall session. CNN's Fareed Zakaria, the session's moderator, commented that given the economic crisis at hand, Chepkurgor's dowry was ""not a bad offer."" However, Clinton said her daughter was her own person. ""She's very independent,"" she said. ""So I will convey this very kind offer.""  Watch Clinton's response to dowry offer » . The audience laughed, but Clinton's comments were no joke to Chepkurgor, who described the younger Clinton as a ""beautiful, disciplined and well-natured woman."" ""Of course I have never met her, but I like her family and how they stick together,"" Chepkurgor told CNN. ""I've waited for a long time. I'm still waiting to meet her and express my love for her."" Chepkurgor operates a small electronics and computer shop in Nakuru, a major city northwest of Nairobi. He may still be waiting for Chelsea, but he's not exactly single. He married his wife Grace, a college classmate, in 2006. ""My wife has no problem with this,"" he insisted. ""She listened to the answers given by Hillary and did not complain."" Polygamy is legal in Kenya, so Chelsea would be Chepkurgor's second wife. ""Is that allowed in your side of the world?"" he laughed. In Kenya, a man proposes with dowry for the prospective bride, Chepkurgor explained. He said he stands by his initial livestock offer until someone makes a counteroffer. Chepkurgor, now 39, first made his intentions known when all three Clintons visited East Africa in 2000. He wrote a letter to the former president, offering himself as his only child's suitor. He said he had not expected the secretary of state to address the issue during her visit to Kenya this week. However, he admits his chances might be rather slim. ""Unfortunately, I don't have their contact information,"" he said. ""I just want to convey my message of goodwill to the Clintons,"" he said. ""And to all of America.""","In 2000, Kenyan man offered cows, goats for Chelsea Clinton's hand in marriage .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Financing for DreamWorks Studios' partnership with one of India's richest men was finalized Monday, giving Steven Spielberg and partner Stacey Snider money to resume making movies. From left to right, Steven Spielberg, Anil Ambani, Stacey Snider and Amitahb Jhunjhunwala. The deal with Anil Ambani, chairman of India's Reliance BIG Entertainment, provides Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios with $875 million, coming from Ambani, the Walt Disney Co. and loans made by a syndicate of banks. Disney will distribute and market about six DreamWorks Studios films around the world each year, with the exception of India, where Reliance will have those rights. Spielberg and Snider found themselves in need of financial partners last year when he cut ties with Paramount Pictures and began rebuilding DreamWorks into an independent studio. Although the deal, which was announced last year, has been characterized in some reports as ""Hollywood meets Bollywood,"" Spielberg and partner Stacey Snider will have creative control over productions. ""This will allow us to move ahead quickly into production with our first group of films,"" Snider and Spielberg said in a joint statement. Reliance BIG Entertainment is part of the Reliance group controlled by billionaire Ambani. ""Our partnership with Stacey and Steven is the cornerstone of our Hollywood strategy as we grow our film interests across the globe,"" Ambani said. ""Given our faith in the business plan that they presented to us and despite the current economic climate, we were always confident that this day would come. Now Stacey and Steven can focus on producing more of the great films for which they are renowned."" Ambani, whose company owns hundreds of theater screens across South Asia, has also invested development money this year with other Hollywood production companies, including those owned by actors Nicolas Cage, Tom Hanks, George Clooney and Jim Carrey. A DreamWorks announcement said that J.P. Morgan brought together the syndicate of banks to provide about $325 million in funding. The banks include Bank of America, City National Bank, Wells Fargo, Comerica, Union Bank of California, SunTrust, California Bank & Trust, and Israel Discount Bank. One of the first movies to go into production will be ""Harvey,"" an adaptation of the play that won a Pulitzer for playwright Mary Chase. The tale about a man and his invisible bunny friend was first made into a movie, starring Jimmy Stewart, in 1950. Spielberg's long career as a screenwriter, director and producer has included classic blockbusters ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" series and ""Saving Private Ryan.""","Steven Spielberg finalizes partnership with Indian tycoon, gets cash infusion .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- More than 80 years after his family was ordered from the country, the grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday as hundreds of admirers looked on. Relatives carry the coffin of Osman on Saturday after his funeral ceremony in Istanbul. Ertugrul Osman, grandson of Sultan Abdulhamid II and heir to the Ottoman throne, died this week in Istanbul of kidney failure at the age of 97, after having lived most of his life in exile in a humble third-floor walk-up apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Osman's funeral in the garden of the mammoth Sultanahmet Mosque was attended by Turkish state ministers, artists and media glitterati. They lined up to pay their respects to Osman's widow, Zeynep Osman, herself a descendant of the royal family of Afghanistan. One woman pressed her forehead to Mrs. Osman's hand in a traditional Turkish show of respect, saying ""I'm just an ordinary person, but I would like to kiss your hand."" ""His death marks the passing of an era,"" wrote Jason Goodwin, author of ""Lords of the Horizons,"" which tells the history of the Ottoman Empire, in an e-mail to CNN. ""Osman himself was born into a family that still ruled an empire stretching from the Balkans to the Indian Ocean. He was named after the founder of his dynasty, who lived seven centuries ago."" During annual campaigns at the peak of its power, the Ottoman Sultan's army of Janissaries struck fear into the hearts of European monarchs. For 400 years, the Ottomans declared themselves the ""caliphs"" -- spiritual leaders -- of the Muslim world. But the empire declined during the 19th century, eventually suffering a humiliating defeat and partition at the hands of Allied armies during World War I. In 1922, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, sent the last Ottoman sultan packing aboard a British warship. Two years later, Ataturk banned the caliphate, declaring Turkey a secular state. Ertugrul Osman, who had played as a boy in the imperial palaces of Istanbul, was sent with the rest of his family into exile. He lived for decades in Europe, then moved after World War II to the United States. Friends say he ran a successful mining business in Chile. They described Osman as a polyglot Renaissance man with a passion for politics and opera and a taste for evening cocktails. Over the years, Osman told reporters he had no interest in assuming the Ottoman throne. In the early 1990s, after more than half a century outside the country, Osman returned to Turkey at the invitation of a Turkish prime minister. Friends say that, prior to getting a Turkish passport in 2004, he traveled using documents identifying him as an Ottoman citizen. The hundreds of mourners at Saturday's funeral stunned other surviving members of the Ottoman royal family. One man rushed Bulent Osman, a tall, elderly French-born nephew of the deceased, kissing his hand and crying in Turkish? ""My prince, we are guilty for how we treated you!"" ""I am not a prince,"" Osman later explained to a reporter in French-accented English. ""I am quite surprised. It is the first time I have seen such an outpouring."" The royal family seems to be especially revered by devout muslim Turks, who see the sultan's descendants as a link to the abolished Islamic caliphate. ""They are our grandfathers,"" said a young man named Fatih, who wore the long beard, turban and robes of a fundamentalist Islamic sect. ""They glorified our religion and brought it to the highest level."" The funeral was attended by an eclectic mix of mourners -- stylishly dressed members of the royal family who grew up in Europe alongside fervent Islamists, some of whom pushed through the crowd ordering women to move to the back to pray. Hundreds of police officers blocked traffic as Osman was buried in a garden filled with the gravestones of Ottoman pashas and viziers, beside the ornate tombs of his grandfather Sultan Abdulhamid II and another ancestor, Sultan Mahmut II. Osman's death serves as a reminder of Turkey's recent, yet often forgotten Ottoman history, said historian Jason Goodwin. ""His funeral may be a catalyst for modern, republican Turkey to overcome its historical amnesia, and come to terms with its own past,"" Goodwin said.","Grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday .

"(CNN) -- The global economic crisis has caused a spike in world hunger that has left more than a billion undernourished, United Nations agencies said in a new report. The report says the stabilization of financial markets has meant less investment in agriculture, food distribution. ""It is unacceptable in the 21st century that almost one in six of the world's population is now going hungry,"" said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Programme. ""At a time when there are more hungry people in the world than ever before, there is less food aid than we have seen in living memory."" The report by the WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization was released Wednesday, ahead of World Food Day on Friday. Nearly all the world's undernourished live in developing countries, according to the report. An estimated 642 million people are suffering from chronic hunger in Asia and the Pacific. An additional 265 million live in sub-Saharan Africa while 95 million come from Latin America, the Caribbean, the Near East and North Africa. The final 15 million live in developed nations. Should developed economies be doing more to eradicate hunger, poverty? The number of hungry spiked as the global economic crisis took hold and governments pumped resources into stabilizing financial markets. The move meant smaller investments in agriculture and food distribution. ""World leaders have reacted forcefully to the financial and economic crisis, and succeeded in mobilizing billions of dollars in a short time period. The same strong action is needed now to combat hunger and poverty,"" said Jacques Diouf, director-general of the FAO. ""The rising number of hungry people is intolerable."" The report calls for greater investment in agriculture to tackle long and short-term hunger by making farmers productive and more resilient to crises. ""We know what is needed to meet urgent hunger needs -- we just need the resources and the international commitment to do the job,"" Sheeran said.","World Food Programme: One in six of world's population is now going hungry .

"(CNN) -- Emma Watson may have wanted to just blend in when she started her freshman year recently at Brown University, but it seems not everyone has the same idea. ""Harry Potter"" actress Emma Watson is an incoming freshman at Brown University in Rhode Island. The actress, best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the ""Harry Potter"" films, showed up last week at the Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island, where new students were treated to orientation activities before the official start of classes on Wednesday. Watson was photographed looking very relaxed in jean shorts and a white T-shirt, but reports are that her introduction to academia has been less than low-key, with much excitement being stirred by her presence. The blog Just Jared reported that while the British actress visited the campus on Friday with her mother and her boyfriend, Jay Barrymore, Twitter user @cupcakenar sent out the following tweet: ""My dad made Emma Watson mad by taking a photo of her going inside the Financial Aid office at Brown. She was with her mom & boyfriend."" Celebrities furthering their education are not new, but with the advent of social networking sites, stars' every move can be tracked and reported. When actor James Franco apparently fell asleep during a lecture at Columbia University in New York City earlier this year, a photo snapped by a classmate made the rounds online and prompted many a tweet. Franco, who has appeared in films such as ""Spiderman"" and the critically acclaimed ""Milk,"" was reported to be taking classes at Columbia and New York University while also writing a book. Paparazzi were on high alert when Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen began attending classes at NYU in 2004. Photos appeared constantly of the tiny twosome -- often with bodyguards in tow -- on their way to and from class after they moved from Los Angeles to New York City for school. Stars such as Julia Stiles, who enrolled in Columbia, and Natalie Portman, who attended Harvard, have tried to be as under the radar as possible while pursuing their education. According to a 2003 article about Portman in the university's Harvard Crimson newspaper, the ""Star Wars"" actress lived on campus her freshman and sophomore years while pursuing a degree in psychology. Portman told the college publication that she was able to enjoy her time as a student, despite her celebrity status. ""At the beginning of college I was talking to people who were actors who had gone to college, and I heard awful stories about people getting 200 visitors a year knocking on their dorm room, or having awful stalker issues,"" Portman said. ""But I've not been bothered once, and that's also thanks to the police here, who have been really wonderful."" Watson also has been quoted as saying she just wants to be treated as a regular student. ""I do hope that it will be only a short time before I am known as Emma Watson the student from the UK, rather than Emma Watson who starred in the 'Harry Potter' films,"" Watson said. The ""Harry Potter"" actress isn't the only famous student taking her seat at an Ivy League school this year. The Boston Globe reported that actress Ashley Judd has enrolled in Harvard's Kennedy School's Mid-Career Master in Public Administration program and asked officials to take additional measures to ensure her privacy. The paper reported that school officials complied, including having the registrar put a privacy block on Judd's file to prevent information about the actress from being made public and arranging to have Harvard police present during the program's coffee breaks. In speaking with the Boston Globe, Brown University's director of communications Mark Nickel declined to confirm that Watson was a student there, but he did say the school might take extra precautions to protect a young wizard. ''We do whatever we need to do to ensure safety and privacy, and that applies pretty much to all students,"" Nickel said.","British actress Emma Watson participated in freshman orientation at Brown .

"(CNN)  -- A judge has ruled in favor of two Florida school administrators who faced contempt charges for saying a prayer at a school luncheon, according to a group that helped represent them. Rep. Mike McIntyre is one of three members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus backing the school officials. U.S. District Judge M.C. Rodgers ruled Thursday in favor of Frank Lay, principal of Pace High School in Pace, Florida, and school athletic director Robert Freeman, the Liberty Counsel said. Lay and Freeman could have faced up to six months in prison and fines if convicted. They were accused of violating a consent decree banning county school employees from initiating prayers during school events. Ahead of the court proceedings, hundreds of supporters lined the streets outside the federal courthouse in Pensacola, Florida. Many of them carried signs and some sang songs. ""It is ridiculous that these men even had to think twice about blessing a meal,"" Liberty Counsel founder Matthew Staver said in a written statement. ""To criminalize the prayer conflicts with our nation's founding and guiding principles and goes directly against our constitutionally protected rights."" But the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit led to the consent decree, has maintained students have a right to be free from administrators who foist their personal religious beliefs on them. Still, an ACLU representative has said the organization ""never suggested"" people should go to jail for violating the decree, and the organization was not involved in the criminal proceedings. The ACLU filed suit last year against the district on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that ""school officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events,"" according to an ACLU statement. Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization. In addition, the court required that all district employees receive a copy. But on January 28, ""Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new field house at Pace High School,"" according to court documents. ""Freeman complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event. It appears this was a school-sponsored event attended by students, faculty and community members."" Attorneys from Liberty Counsel have said that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project -- all ""consenting adults."" The case caught the attention of members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, including the caucus' founder, Rep. J. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia. He and two other lawmakers, Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-North Carolina, and Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, also members of the caucus, wrote a letter in support of the two school administrators, saying that ""many of America's Founding Fathers were resolute in their faiths, and the impact of such is evident in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and many of their writings."" It added, ""The tradition of offering prayer in America has become so interwoven into our nation's spiritual heritage that to charge someone criminally for engaging in such a practice would astonish the men who founded this country on religious liberty.""","Two Florida school administrators accused of violating consent order on prayer .

"(CNN)  -- The Rev. Franklin Graham has arrived in North Korea bearing a gift for North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the country's official news agency reported Wednesday. The Rev. Franklin Graham reportedly will oversee the delivery of $190,000 in equipment for a dental school. Graham handed the present, which was not identified, to a high-ranking official Wednesday to give to Kim, the Korean Central News Agency reported. Graham, the son of the Rev. Billy Graham and the president of Samaritan's Purse, arrived Tuesday in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, KCNA said. On its Web site, Samaritan's Purse said Franklin Graham was to meet with high-level government officials and to inspect medical facilities that the organization has installed. ""I believe it is important to make visits like this to help improve relations and to have a better understanding with each other,"" Graham said, according to the Samaritan's Purse Web site. The group said Graham will visit a hospital and also will oversee the delivery of $190,000 in equipment to outfit a dental school that can train up to 70 dentists per year. KCNA reported that Graham said he hoped he could act as a bridge for better relations between the United States and North Korea. The visit marks Graham's third trip to North Korea. His father visited the country in 1992 and 1994 and met with President Kim Il Sung, Samaritan's Purse said. His mother, the late Ruth Bell Graham, attended a mission school in Pyongyang in 1934, the organization said. Later this week, Graham is scheduled to travel to China, where he'll dedicate a clinic that Samaritan's Purse built, visit a city destroyed by last year's earthquake and speak at churches, the organization said.","The Rev.

"(CNN) -- It seems no-one in South Africa can fail to be gripped by World Cup football fever. The running, tackling, shooting, offside-appealing proof comes with a clutch of grannies who have been playing in a fiercely competitive league around the Nkowankowa township, 600 kilometers north of Johannesburg. A squad of 35 nans down domestic duties twice a week to take to the field for their team Vakhegula Vakhegula, and compete against seven other teams in the region. Some of them even credit the beautiful game as having turned their lives around. ""I like to play soccer because it helps,"" said Nari Baloyi, who at 47-years-old, clocks in as one of the youngest players. ""We were sick, but now our temperatures, our blood pressures... have gone down ...even our doctors are amazed when we go for a check-up."" One of the more elderly members, Nora Makhubela, is convinced that football has given her a new lease of life following the setback of suffering six strokes. ""My life has really changed...if I were to run with you I would beat you even though I'm much older,"" she said, throwing down the gauntlet to the likes of Ronaldo, Messi et al. ""My life has improved because of the football. I wish God could bless the person who came up with this great idea."" The women contribute around $1 a month each for footballs, kit, and travel to the bi-annual regional tournament. Dozens of noisy fans cheer on the players, with the distinctive sound of the vuvuzelas -- a South African trumpet -- creating an atmosphere that would be welcome at any European Champions League tie. Makhubela is hoping her new-found love of the game extends long enough for her to be able to watch some of the matches when the World Cup begins in June. ""I pray every day to God to keep me alive until 2010. I would really love to watch the games,"" she said. The team was formed three years ago to offer older women a chance to exercise and come together as a group, says community worker Beka Ntsanwisi. ""Some of them couldn't even walk properly and if they did something in their free time they would be knitting or sewing and sitting all the time...here they run, shout, fight with you...it keeps them young,"" she said. David Maake said his job coaching the team is the best he's ever had. ""With young boys you need more money to achieve many things...here, I may come with my stress...but I will laugh so much until I forget everything,"" he said. The team have even suggested they play a curtain raiser for the main event itself, a brainwave the footballing authorities have said they will give serious thought to. If the women do manage to take part as an hors d'oeuvre to the World Cup proper one thing is for sure, what they lack in skill they will make up for in enthusiasm.","Grannies in a South African township have taken up football .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Seydi Burciaga just finished her overnight shift at Sam's Club, where she worked for the past 10 years. She made her way through the pouring rain in her minivan and turned onto her cul-de-sac in suburban Atlanta. Seydi and Pedro Burciaga were married for 14 years with two children. ""She was a very loving mother,"" he said. She was three-tenths of a mile from home. The mother of two young children never made it. Floodwaters from a swollen creek swept her Nissan Quest from Desiree Drive around 5 a.m. Monday. On a normal day, the creek is only a few feet wide. But days of nonstop rain turned the seemingly harmless waterway into a raging river. It sits at the bottom of a steep hill on a street with no lights. It would've been nearly impossible to see the swift-moving water or how deep it was in the pre-dawn darkness. Her car was picked up and carried behind an elementary school and lodged in trees. Water was coming in fast, she told a 911 dispatcher.  Listen to the frantic 911 call » . ""Please, come help me,"" she says, her voice cracking. ""Please."" The 911 dispatcher draws silent for a moment. ""Alright, ma'am. Just stay as calm as possible."" During the next 12 minutes, the dispatcher would try to reassure Burciaga as she elicited clues as to the caller's exact whereabouts. It was a neighborhood Burciaga knew well. She'd lived there for the past decade. She was known as the neighborhood mom who would take anyone who needed help to the dentist or the doctor. Fluent in Spanish, she would often act as translator. ""She was a very loving mother, a good wife, a strong woman,"" said Pedro Burciaga, her husband of 14 years. ""She liked helping everyone, and overall she worked very hard. ... She always had a smile for everyone."" As her life teetered in the balance, she described being near a yellow house and tried to give other details of where her vehicle was. The 911 call was one of more than 400 before daybreak Monday that sent rescue crews through the floodwaters of Gwinnett County, a large suburban county northeast of Atlanta. ""My car is turning. Now the wheels is getting up, and I'm going to drown,"" Burciaga says. A fire rescue team was at the scene by 5:09 a.m. Police arrived at 5:13 a.m. She was still on the phone with dispatch. The entire roadway was submerged by 5 or 6 feet of water. Nearby parked vehicles were nearly covered by the rushing water. An outbuilding had been carried from its foundation.  Watch how to escape from a sinking car » . ""Listen to me. You're not going to drown. Roll down your windows, if you're able to, and get out of your vehicle,"" the 911 dispatcher says. ""I'm in the back of my car. I don't know if I can break it,"" Burciaga says. ""Ma'am, if you can break it, break it. Do whatever you can to get out of your vehicle."" ""Yes, please, but my car is --"" ""It doesn't matter about your car,"" the dispatcher says. ""What matters is your life. We're going to save your life."" A few moments later, the waters intensify. ""It's taking me down now,"" Burciaga says, crying. ""It's taking you down,"" the dispatcher repeats. ""Just stay on the phone with me. I'm right here. I'm gonna stay with you."" ""Please! It's going to drown --"" ""OK, listen, you're not going to drown. We're going to be there for you. Just stay with me, OK?"" ""OK, OK,"" Burciaga says. Moments later, she shrieks, ""Oh my God!"" Her voice grows more concerned. Her cell phone goes out at 5:16 a.m. According to a police report, rescue crews tried to swim into the water to find her, but the waters were moving too fast, and they couldn't spot her. After about an hour, the waters receded. Her vehicle was 300 yards away. She was found across the back seats of her minivan. She was dressed in blue jeans, a green shirt and gray tennis shoes. Burciaga, a Mexican immigrant, was to turn 40 on November 18. She was the mother of a 9-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter. Her ritual every night was to tuck them in bed before heading off to work. ""She would give them a blessing, a kiss,"" her husband told CNN. Burciaga's death was one of at least nine in severe flooding that has shut down roads across north Georgia and caused gridlock on Atlanta's already congested highways.  See flood photos across the Southeast » . Her death troubled even the most veteran law enforcement personnel. ""There's really no words to describe it,"" said Gwinnett County police spokesman David Shiralli. ""We're here to save lives when we can. When we do everything in our power and we still fail at it, it makes us feel bad."" On the quiet street where Burciaga lived, residents made a makeshift memorial at the small bridge over the creek. Flowers were placed at the foot of the street; an angel figurine stood with her hands clasped in prayer. Nearby, shrubbery was flattened, possibly from her vehicle. The creek was back to being a tiny waterway. Residents said it floods often during rainstorms, but they'd never seen anything like Monday. ""At night when it's dark and water is covering the road, you can't really see it. It's not the first time it has overran, but it's never been that high before,"" said Nathaniel Knight, who lived next door to Burciaga for the past five years. Knight was still shaken by her death.  ""She's just a really nice person, a woman that works the night shift. Just so nice."" He said he felt for her husband: ""This just has to be horrible, just devastating for him."" A viewing for friends and relatives was held Tuesday evening. In nearby Duluth, her colleagues at Sam's Club were beginning their night shift, minus their colleague of the past decade. ""We've lost a valued member of our family, and we will always remember her smile,"" said store manager Annette Gillespie. ""She was an outstanding associate and hard worker, but most importantly, she was our friend."" Her husband struggled for words. His favorite memory: ""Her smile, how she was with my children. She loved them a lot. She gave them lots of love."" How so? ""With kisses, hugs,"" he said, gently. ""Now I'm destroyed because I'm going to miss her a lot.""

"(CNN) -- Google said Tuesday's widespread Gmail outage occurred when the company took some servers offline to perform routine maintenance, causing its remaining routers to become overloaded with traffic. Many Gmail users encountered this error message when trying to access their e-mail Tuesday. ""We know how many people rely on Gmail for personal and professional communications, and we take it very seriously when there's a problem with the service,"" wrote Ben Treynor, a Google vice president of engineering, Tuesday in a 9:59 p.m. ET post on the Gmail blog.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Every day, tens of thousands of fertilized hen eggs are delivered to Sinovac laboratories in Beijing. Each egg is infected with the H1N1 virus, then incubated for three days. White-coated employees examine every egg individually before the virus is extracted and used to make a vaccine. Vials of H1N1 vaccine before they are labeled and packaged. Sinovac Biotech Ltd. was the first company in the world to successfully complete clinical trials for an H1N1 vaccine. It was also the first company approved by the Chinese government to produce millions of doses for the public. China is set to become the first country to begin mass inoculations sometime around the beginning of October. According to Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong, the secret lies in years of vaccine research and development. Sinovac was the first and only company ever to create a vaccine for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the worldwide pandemic that left almost 350 people in China dead. The SARS vaccine was never used. By the time it was discovered, the outbreak had subsided. However, the breakthrough has enabled Sinovac to stay ahead of the curve. Watch as the H1N1 vaccine is produced » . ""The SARS vaccine helped us achieve the H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which helped us get the H1N1 vaccine,"" says CEO Yin Weidong. ""That's why we could be so fast and be the first."" Since Sinovac's success, at least two other Chinese companies and several around the world have also produced H1N1 vaccines. China has reportedly ordered 3.3 million vaccines from Sinovac, 4 million from Hualan Biological and another 3 million from the Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences. According to Yin, the main challenge for China will be providing enough vaccines for everyone. ""A country with 1.3 billion people needs 1.3 billion vaccines,"" he says. Watch report on China's inoculation preparations » . The Chinese government has long warned an outbreak of H1N1 could be catastrophic in a massive country with an underdeveloped health system. In recent weeks, the instances of H1N1 infections have risen dramatically throughout the mainland. There have been more than 9,000 cases of the H1N1 virus in China so far, and more than half of them have happened in the last few weeks alone. ""It's basically affected all provinces of China and we're worried because of the sheer number of people involved,"" says Vivian Tan, communications director for the World Health Organization in China. ""It's moving from the urban and coastal areas into more rural remote areas."" According to the WHO, the rapid acceleration of H1N1 is occurring in part because flu season is starting, the weather is cooling down and school is back in session. More than 80 percent of China's swine flu cases have occurred in schools or due to school-related activities. China has had perhaps the most extreme and active response to the virus than any other country in the world. For months, masked Chinese officials have boarded international flights upon arrival, checking all passengers' temperatures and administered health surveys before granting entry. Thousands have been quarantined, including entire flights and school groups. Health authorities have heavily publicized the risks posed by the virus and rolled out a Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment plan, as an alternative to the vaccines produced by Sinovac and others. Yet, some Chinese citizens remain skeptical that a vaccine is even necessary in the first place. ""It doesn't seem like my baby is going to catch the swine flu,"" says one mother at a hospital in central Beijing. ""And what if it affects his health in the future? I'm just going to avoid crowded areas."" Like any vaccine, the WHO has warned the H1N1 vaccine may have negative side effects. Sinovac plans to track and test patients for several years after vaccinations are administered to determine if there are any dangers. Ultimately, in China, the central concern remains that the H1N1 virus itself could expand and spin out of control. According to Tan of the WHO, ""I think one of our biggest fears is that (the H1N1 virus) could re-assort with the H5N1 avian flu virus that's out there, to create this 'superbug' which is both easily transmissible, quite lethal and quite deadly.""","Inside the Chinese lab that has created world's first H1N1 vaccine .

"(The Frisky) -- Even if you're not going to Fiji or the Maldives, accidentally ending up in a popular honeymooning spot while not actually on your honeymoon is easier than you think, especially with the abundance of all-inclusive deals online. Just because your hotel mates are on a romantic getaway doesn't mean they're not open to company. If watching smooching couples while chilling out with your friends makes you want to puke, no worries. You can still have a blast, even if you're not traveling with your newly committed soul mate. Relax . You probably chose the fantastic place because you found a great deal to an amazing destination (much like your cuddling neighbors), so take advantage. Hit the spa, do some yoga, swim or make time for the mellow activities that are tough to fit in back home. While you probably won't meet the guy of your dreams lying motionless in a mud wrap, you'll be Zen enough to have a new outlook once your return home. Don't underestimate the locals (or the ex-patriot) There's nothing better than getting to know a place by hanging out with people who can tell you more than a guidebook about the area's culture and hidden gems. Have a glass of wine and chat up the bartender (or the person with the best English if you're abroad) or find out about an area of town where the ex-patriots live. Especially if you've been away from home for a long time, an American omelet or bagel can keep you smiling. Make friends . Just because your hotel mates are using the vacation as a romantic getaway doesn't mean that they are not open to meeting others on their travels. There's a chance you'll end up chatting with a couple who bores you with the details of their wedding, but you might luck out and make a few friends (who perhaps will save you seats at the breakfast buffet the next morning). Plan activities . Jet skiing, para-gliding, R.V. treks -- take advantage of all the offerings, that way you'll have fun and burn some of the calories you've packed on by sipping cocktails on the beach all day. Besides experiencing new things, you may run across others who have unknowingly booked the same Travelocity deal without any romantic intentions. Come prepared . With portable board games, books, cards and an unlimited amount of iPod-fueled music, keeping busy in a honeymoon spot can seem a bit like summer camp (but with booze). Use the time a couple might spend in their room getting busy to work on your Scrabble skills, or catch up on all the new music you've downloaded but have yet to hear. And if you forgot your iPod, don't like spas, and can't find anyone in the entire city who isn't newly married and in love, you and your travel-mates can always place bets on which honeymooning couple will be the first to break up.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An investigation commissioned by the city of New York found private gun vendors selling weapons to buyers who admitted not being able to pass background checks, breaking federal law, a report released Wednesday says. It is illegal for unlicensed sellers to sell a gun if there is reason to think the buyer would fail a background check. The sales were made at seven gun shows in Ohio, Tennessee and Nevada, the report says. Hired investigators with hidden cameras were able to purchase guns from private sellers after announcing to the vendors they could not pass a background check, it says. Nineteen of the 30 private sellers the undercover investigators dealt with failed the integrity test, according to the report. The law does not require private unlicensed sellers at gun shows to do background checks on their customers. However, it is a federal felony for unlicensed sellers to sell a gun if they have a reason to believe the buyer would fail a background check. There were no arrests and no lawsuit were filed. ""Closing the gun show loophole has nothing to do with the Second Amendment,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a news conference Wednesday. ""It is basic law enforcement, plain and simple."" He said he does not want to shut down gun shows but to change the law. He cited a 2000 study from the then-Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms saying 30 percent of guns involved in federal illegal gun trafficking investigations are connected in some way to gun shows. The figure is disputed by gun proponents. ""We believe anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted and punished,"" the National Rifle Association said in a statement supplied to CNN. ""Instead of working with law enforcement to bring those who may have broken the law to justice, Mayor Bloomberg chose to use this information for a press conference. Bloomberg's priorities are clearly media first, justice later."" But Bloomberg has support from some in Washington, including Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey. ""This investigation reveals how easy it is for criminals and even terrorists to purchase firearms at gun shows and is further proof that we must close the gun show loophole,"" Lautenberg said in a written statement.","Sales made at gun shows in Ohio, Tennessee, Nevada, report says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday proposed fines against two of the nation's largest airlines, saying the airlines flew planes on hundreds of occasions in violation of FAA or airline safety standards. US Airways says the problems are in the past. United notes it self-reported its problem. The FAA is seeking a $5.4 million fine from US Airways and a $3.8 million fine from United Airlines for unrelated violations. Both airlines issued statements Wednesday assuring the public of their commitment to safety. US Airways blamed its problems on the difficulties of merging US Airways and America West maintenance operations in 2007. United, meanwhile, said it self-reported the incident leading to its proposed fine and has since taken steps to ensure that safety standards are met. The US Airways case involved the greatest number of planes -- eight. The FAA alleges US Airways operated the eight aircraft on a total of 1,647 flights last fall and winter while the planes were in a potentially unsafe condition. Three of the planes were flown while not in compliance with FAA rules known as Airworthiness Directives, or ADs. The FAA issues ADs when it discovers a potentially unsafe condition on a type of aircraft, and it wants airlines to inspect their fleets or conduct preventive maintenance. The FAA said it issued an AD requiring airlines to inspect Airbus A320 aircraft for possible cracking of a landing gear part. But US Airways operated two Airbus A320s on a total of 43 flights without complying with the ordered inspection. The airline also operated an Embraer 190 aircraft on 19 flights without performing an inspection to prevent a cargo door from opening during flight, according to the FAA. The remaining five cases involve the airline's failure to follow its own maintenance procedures, the FAA said. In a letter to its employees, US Airways Chief Operating Officer Robert Isom called the FAA announcement disappointing. ""It is important to remember that today's announcement references situations that are in the past, and in several cases, date back to two years ago,"" he wrote. ""Our team has worked cooperatively with the FAA to investigate and correct any discrepancies to the FAA's satisfaction."" The United Airlines case involves one aircraft, a Boeing 737. According to the FAA and the airline, a pilot noticed a low fuel pressure indication while on a flight from Denver, Colorado, on April 28, 2008. The pilot shut down an engine and returned to the Denver airport. United mechanics who inspected the engine found that two shop towels had been used to cover openings in the oil sump area, instead of protective caps. The FAA said the aircraft had flown more than 200 times in the unsafe condition before the problem was discovered. A United spokeswoman said the airline reported the incident to the FAA and has taken several measures to prevent a recurrence, including additional training of maintenance workers. Both airlines have 30 days to respond to the FAA's proposal for fines. In March, Southwest Airlines agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a complaint that it flew unsafe planes.","FAA seeks a $5.4 million fine from US Airways, $3.8 million fine from United Airlines .

"(CNN) -- After hours of back and forth between members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America decided Friday evening to accept noncelibate clergy members and lay leaders who are in ""lifelong"" and ""monogamous"" same-sex relationships. Previous Evangelical Lutheran Church policy allows gay and lesbian clergy, lay people to serve only if celibate. One of the country's largest Protestant denominations, the Lutheran church approved four recommendations to its ministry's policies that underscore a new approach to homosexuality. While the recommendations passed at the weeklong Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis, Minnesota, do not address recognizing same-sex marriage or civil unions, they do allow congregations to support same-sex relationships among their members and allow individuals in same-sex relationships to hold clergy positions. The previous policy of the 4.6-million member church allowed gay people to serve as members of professional rosters only if they were celibate. Some members argued prior to the vote that the change would fly in the face of religious teachings. ""Brothers and sisters, I ask you, before you dig yourselves deeper into this hole, if you are so absolutely certain that these behaviors are not sinful that you are willing to place yourselves and this church at the spiritual risk that comes from encouraging sin,"" said the Rev. Steven Frock of the Western Iowa Synod. Among those on the other side was Alan Wold of the Northern Illinois Synod. ""If according to some I am going to be in err for supporting this... Let me err on the side of mercy, grace, justice, and love of neighbor. Let me err on the side of gospel, which makes all things new."" Many feared the emotional debate could tear at the unity of the church. So the members voted to re-order their resolutions -- moving to the top a resolution that the church ""commit itself to bear one another's burdens, love thy neighbor, and respect the bound consciences of all."" It passed with overwhelming support. Other religious denominations, including Episcopalians and Unitarians, have made moves to accept gay clergy, and Evangelical Lutherans would not be the first to accept those openly in same-sex relationships, said David Masci, a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. But ELCA would be the largest to make such a move. The church is the third largest Protestant denomination, representing 2 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Pew Forum. The battle Friday was the latest in what Masci said many ""socially moderate"" denominations, including those in Judaism, are grappling with: balancing the growing acceptance of same-sex relationships with traditional teachings. As some have moved toward accepting same-sex relationships, within those same denominations ""you see more conservative wings that are pushing back against it,"" said Masci. On hand for Friday's debate were hundreds of ""interested parties"" -- including some people who are not members of the church, said John Brooks, ELCA spokesman. When asked whether there had been protests or rallies on either side outside the convention site, he responded, ""Interestingly, no."" In the convention hall, Brooks said, ""The debates haven't been rancorous or mean-spirited in any way. They've been quite civil. But people have been passionate with their feelings."" The Rev. Terri Stagner-Collier of the Southeastern Synod said a vote in favor of the resolutions would cause members of her own family to leave the church. Her sister ""felt her church was being ripped away from her,"" Stagner-Collier said tearfully, adding, I urge you not to do this to all of those people in the pew and in my family."" Sara Gross of the Oregon Synod said some ""dear members"" of the church will be lost if the resolution passes. But, she said, ""A vote to reject this recommendation sends a message to the world saying 'not all are welcome.'"" In a ""changing world,"" Gross argued, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America ""needs to be a voice that stands up and says 'yes.'"" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Evangelical Lutheran Church to accept gay clergy in lifelong relationships .

"MAMONI VALLEY PRESERVE, Panama (CNN) -- A famed primatologist says the plight of chimpanzees helped inspire Michael Jackson to write the song ""Heal the World."" Michael Jackson loved chimpanzees, said Jane Goodall: ""They made him smile."" But the theme and the lyrics of the song turned out to be about a better world for humanity. ""He wrote what he told me he thought was his most powerful song ever, but it didn't end up for animals,"" Jane Goodall said in a CNN interview Thursday night. Goodall spoke exclusively to CNN in a Panamanian rain forest where she is exploring a partnership on behalf of Roots & Shoots, her global youth education program. The interview comes as a new version of the song, first released on Jackson's 1991 ""Dangerous"" album, is being recorded by a collection of artists for release in late October. Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where ""he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. ... It was just a very charming day, very low key, nobody else was there,"" she said. Goodall, famous for her 50 years of groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Africa, said Jackson invited her because ""he loved what I did."" ""He loved chimpanzees,"" she said. ""He loved to watch them feeding. He liked their faces. They made him smile."" Years later, she met Jackson's chimp, Bubbles, and has visited him at his retirement refuge in Florida, she said. ""He's extremely handsome,"" she said. ""He's a beautiful, beautiful chimp. So, he was rescued in time from this life of being inappropriately dressed up and carted around like a little symbol."" Goodall, whose life has been spent understanding chimpanzees, said she found Jackson to be ""a sad person."" ""In some ways, he was like a child, and a very sweet and gentle child, and he wanted me to tell him many, many stories,"" she said. ""Stories about the chimpanzees, the forests, animals, anything. He told me he liked the way I told stories."" Goodall, who travels the world to promote protection of endangered chimps, said she had hoped Jackson would help get her message out. ""I said to him, 'You know, Michael, if you want to help, you could do a concert and give us a percentage. Or much better, write a song,' "" she said. Jackson asked her for tapes of animals in distress because ""he wanted to be angry and cry"" as he wrote the song, which became ""Heal the World,"" she said. The original CD cover notes credited Goodall for inspiring the song, she said. But, she added, the Jane Goodall Institute never saw any money from the song. Jackson later created the ""Heal the World Foundation,"" which he funded with a series of concerts. The group delivered millions of dollars of relief to children around the world.","Jane Goodall says Michael Jackson loved chimpanzees .

"(WIRED) -- Last month, when Zack Ajmal was planning a vacation to Italy, he set out to find the first thing that a traveler would need in a foreign land: a map. But digital maps of Rome and Venice for his Garmin GPS device cost almost $100. So instead, Ajmal turned to OpenStreet Map, a community-driven maps database. A user-edited map of cycling routes in Perth, Australia, available on OpenStreetMap's site. ""It worked out pretty well,"" the Atlanta-based engineer says. ""I found Open MTB, which had outdoor hiking and cycling maps with not just roads information, but also trails, short cuts and little known routes."" Ajmal is among roughly half a million users who are eschewing proprietary maps information from GPS companies and instead going with crowdsourced versions, which they then load onto their GPS devices and smartphones. The key to these map hacks is OpenStreetMap. Founded in 2004, OSM is to maps what Wikipedia is to encyclopedias. The site offers maps that can be edited, customized and loaded on to devices for free. Want to go whitewater rafting but need to know where the rapids are? There's a map for that. Or to know all the interesting points along the river Nile? There's a map for that. And it's all based on the OpenStreetMap data. ""The value is that it is a richer map with more up-to-date information because anyone can fix things,"" says Steve Coast, one of the founders of OpenStreetMap. ""Users get access to the underlying data and not just a picture of the maps."" Consumer map data is currently a duopoly split between two mapping providers: Nokia's Navteq and TomTom's Tele Atlas. The two provide the mapping data that powers almost all commercial map applications and devices. But maps from these providers are extremely restrictive in how they can be used. Want a map of the best hiking trails in the country or a walking tour of Rome? Traditional GPS services can't offer that. For adventurous geeks that calls for a DIY fix. ""OSM maps are a little new on the scene,"" says Rich Owings, who runs the GPStracklog.com website and is the author of the book GPS Mapping. ""Most people in the U.S. were not using them until recently, but now there are iPhone apps based on it."" Getting OpenStreetMap is easier on some devices than others. In Garmin systems, it's as simple as taking one of the available maps and dropping it into a folder on the device. ""It's really hard to mess up your GPS doing this,"" says Owings. ""And if you have questions you can always ask the community to help you out."" Owings says he loaded maps of Ecuador on his Garmin unit in about 30 minutes. ""It's not as clean of a map as one you can get from the Garmin store but they are pretty wonderful and have very good coverage."" For TomTom systems, getting OpenStreetMap can be a more difficult process. TomTom uses a proprietary mapping format, says Coast. That means a tricky process of converting OpenStreetMap into a TomTom-compatible format. OpenStreetMap has also been used to create iPhone apps such as MotionX, which is targeted at hikers, skiers and bikers; B.iCycle, a cyclometer that shows burned calories, trip distance and trails; and ATM@UK, which shows all ATM locations in Great Britain. The OpenStreetMap project is a cartographer's dream come true, says Randal Hale, who has a GIS consulting business. Hale has created custom maps for a few clients using OpenStreetMap and has put OSM-generated maps on his Garmin unit. ""With the professional mapping software, I have to purchase a license to use their version, which is expensive and I can't use the data for analysis,"" says Hale. ""With OpenStreetMap, I download it, make cartographic edits and hopefully I have made it better for the next user."" Meanwhile, traditional navigation companies are also reaching out to users for help on data. For instance, Nokia kicked off a pilot project at the University of California at Berkeley to collect traffic information through GPS-enabled cellphones. Users could download the software for free and use it to check on road conditions on their phones. At the same time, the software would report data about its users' positions to a central database, enabling the researchers to assemble traffic data in real time. Google has also said it will add nationwide real-time traffic data to its maps by collecting anonymous location data from Google Maps users. Still, community-created maps and navigation information remains a small niche, appealing only to ""GPS techies"" who are willing to take risks, says Owings. ""There's not a lot of public awareness because many people don't even know they can do this with their Garmin or cellphone,"" he says. But if you are planning to go to Berlin later this year, take a look at the OpenStreetMap site. Germany is expected to become the first country in the site's database to be fully mapped by contributors. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama said Friday he spoke with the police officer who arrested a Harvard professor and told the officer he did not mean to malign the Cambridge Police Department when he said police acted stupidly. President Obama on Friday explains to reporters the details of a phone conservation with Sgt. James Crowley. The president acknowledged that his words ""helped to contribute to ratcheting"" up the situation when he criticized the manner in which Sgt. James Crowley arrested professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. ""I unfortunately gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge Police Department or Sgt. Crowley specifically,"" Obama told reporters. ""I could have calibrated those words differently, and I told this to Sgt. Crowley.""  Watch Obama describe talk » . Obama spoke about two hours after police unions in Massachusetts called on him to apologize. He did not apologize for his remark but repeated that he believed his choice of words was unfortunate. He reiterated his assertion that he believes police overreacted, but said Gates ""probably overreacted as well."" ""My sense is you have got two good people in a circumstance in which neither of them were able to resolve the incident in the way that it should have been resolved,"" he said. Obama also spoke briefly with the arrested professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is a friend of the president, the White House reported. He and Gates had a ""positive discussion"" about his call to Crowley on Friday afternoon, the White House said. Obama also invited Gates ""to join him with Sgt. Crowley at the White House in the near future."" In an e-mail Friday to CNN's Don Lemon, Gates wrote, ""I was very pleased that the president called me today, and I was pleased that he proposed that I meet with Sgt. Crowley at the White House, since I had offered to meet with him since last Monday. ""I am eager for this to be used as a teaching moment to improve racial relations in America,"" said the e-mail. ""This is certainly not about me."" His attorney, Charles Ogletree, told Lemon that he applauds Obama's intervention and ""I look forward to working this out with all parties amicably."" Asked if he plans to file suit, Ogletree said, ""It depends on the response from everyone involved as to how we'll proceed."" Earlier Friday, police unions said Obama should apologize to members of the Cambridge Police Department for saying they acted stupidly, the president of a city police union said.  Watch African-American colleagues defend Crowley » . Dennis O'Connor, president of the Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association, also took aim at Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who reportedly has characterized the arrest as ""every black man's nightmare and a reality for many black men."" Echoing the words of Crowley, O'Connor said he was dismayed that the president and governor would opine on the issue without all the details. ""It's noteworthy that both qualified their statements by saying they did not have all the facts,"" O'Connor said as members of his and another police union stood behind him. ""Usually, when one hears those words, one would expect the next words to be 'so I cannot comment.' Instead, both officials, both admitted friends of professor Gates, proceeded to insult the handling of this case."" He further said Cambridge police resent the implication they allowed race to dictate their actions in the situation. ""We hope that [Obama and Patrick] will reflect upon their past comments and apologize to the men and women of the Cambridge Police Department,"" O'Connor said. Steve Killian, president of the Cambridge Police Patrol Officers Association, also called on Obama to apologize to ""all law enforcement personnel throughout the entire country that took offense to this."" Crowley previously said Obama had offended police in Cambridge and elsewhere. ""I was a little surprised and disappointed that the president, who didn't have all of the facts by his own admission, then weighed in on the events of that night and made a comment that really offended not just officers in the Cambridge Police Department but officers around the country,"" Crowley told CNN affiliate WHDH-TV in Boston. Obama said earlier he was ""surprised by the controversy surrounding"" his comments. ""I think it was a pretty straightforward commentary that you probably don't need to handcuff a guy, a middle-aged man who uses a cane, who's in his own home,"" Obama told ABC's ""Nightline.""  Watch Crowley's boss defend the arrest » . When Obama waded into the story by answering a question about it during his news conference Wednesday night, he admitted that he ""may be a little biased"" because Gates is a friend. ""I don't know all the facts,"" he also conceded. He said he did not know what role race played, but ""the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home."" iReport.com: Arrest sparks debate . But during his Friday remarks, Obama said he hoped the controversy surrounding Gates' arrest provides Americans with ""a teachable moment"" on how they can improve ""relations between police officers and minority communities."" Crowley, in the police report about the incident, said Gates refused to cooperate with him and repeatedly accusing him of racism when he went to Gates' home following a report of a possible break-in July 16. Crowley said he tried to determine whether there was someone else at the home and wanted to ensure Gates' safety. Gates, however, told him ""that I had no idea who I was 'messing' with"" and was being so loud, the sergeant said, that he could not give pertinent information to the department when he was calling in. Authorities have said they may release tapes of the officer calling in, in which Gates is heard in the background . Crowley's report said that when he asked to speak with Gates outside, the professor at one point responded, ""I'll speak with your mama outside.""  Watch Crowley's response » . Gates' attorney, Charles Ogletree, said the professor never made such a remark. The full story will show that Gates did nothing wrong -- and that Crowley did not identify himself at first, Ogletree said. Gates said Wednesday he would listen to Crowley ""if he would tell the truth about what he did, about the distortions that he fabricated in the police report. I would be prepared as a human being to forgive him."" Crowley has said he will not apologize. The police incident report states that Crowley twice provided his name to Gates, who subsequently asked for it two more times. Gates ultimately was arrested for disorderly conduct, but the department later dropped the charges. Cambridge police Commissioner Robert Haas said he ""deeply regrets"" the arrest but stands by the procedures his department followed. ""I trust [Crowley's] judgment implicitly. He is a stellar officer,"" Haas said. Haas added the department is ""very proud about its diversity within this community and how hard we've worked over the years to build a strong, solid relationship [between] the department and the community."" Haas said he agreed with Crowley about Obama's remarks. ""I have to tell you the officers take that very personally and basically feel hurt by that comment. We truly are trying to do the best service we can to the community and sometimes we make mistakes. We're human. But we learn from those mistakes and we move on,"" he said. Black in America 2: Does racial profiling still take place? Numerous police officers, including African-Americans, have spoken up on Crowley's behalf and portrayed him as a good and fair officer. Crowley, who is white, had once been chosen by a black police officer to teach a police academy course on ways to avoid racial profiling. Obama said he had heard of Crowley's record, saying, ""I don't know all the extenuating circumstances, and as I said, I respect what police officers do. From what I can tell, the sergeant who was involved is an outstanding police officer, but my suspicion is probably it would have been better if cooler heads prevailed."" Gates' legal team argues that authorities are misrepresenting the professor and the officer, and Gates has said he is determined to keep the issue alive despite the charges being dropped. ""This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,"" he said this week. Ogletree said Gates may bring forward people who say they've had similar experiences with Crowley. When asked for examples, Ogletree said only that they may come out in time depending on how the police department handles the situation moving forward. ""I think you will be hearing much more complex and different perspective on him [Crowley] in the coming days and weeks,"" Ogletree said, alleging that Crowley ""is well-known among people, particularly young people, for some of his police practices."" Gates has no immediate plans to file a lawsuit against the department, the attorney said. Ogletree had said earlier Gates might sue the police. CNN's Joe Johns and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","NEW: Gates eager for incident to be ""teaching moment"" to improve racial relations .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Lust, love and like. A healthful, happy love relationship serves up three out of three. A healthful, happy love relationship is a passionate best friendship. Modern women could learn a few things about love and seduction from Scheherazade. Many women think men only care about the lust angle -- finding a hot bod for hot sex. Unfortunately, there are many men who do only care about this. In my book ""Prince Harming Syndrome,"" I explain how relationships that are too focused on sex wind up being what my favorite philosopher buddy Aristotle called a relationship of pleasure -- where you find a sex-mate or a relationship of utility -- where you find an ego-mate or wallet-mate. However, a healthful, happy love relationship is what Aristotle calls a relationship of shared virtue -- when you find a soul mate. Where you each get one another at your core, inspire and support each other to grow into your best possible selves. A relationship of shared virtue is where you feel the whole triumvirate: lust, love and like. Meaning? If you want to fully seduce a man, then you've got to know how to grab a man by more than his you-know-what. You must truly turn on a man's soul! Oprah.com: 5 things that make you sexy . If you sleep with a man before you feel safe knowing you connect on a soul-to-soul level, the relationship might start off hot -- but like steam into air, it will rise quickly then -- pfffft -- vanish into vapor. Or worse, you'll wind up getting burnt. This is so important to prioritize, that I'm repeating this reminder in bold italic letters: If you can't stimulate a man in more areas than from the waist down, you will only be attracting a relationship of pleasure or a relationship of utility. And this man will not remain your man for long. One of my favorite quotes about love comes from the book ""The Little Prince"": ""It's only with the heart that one can see rightly; what's most important is invisible to the eye."" I love that the Little Prince recognized that the heart (another metaphysical word for soul) is the best lens for love -- making this Little Prince a major Prince Charming. Seduction Tip 1 (in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember): If you want to be a man's Princess Charming, you MUST do more than work on tightening your buns or boosting up your boobs! You MUST tap into what I call ""The Scheherazade Effect."" Oprah.com: What to do before you can find love . Remember the tale of Scheherazade and her 1,001 nights? Scheherazade was absolutely a Princess Charming who knew how to grab and stimulate her king's soul. Voilà! The CliffsNotes on Scheherazade: . There once was a king who got very bored with the women in his life very quickly. He would marry a new virgin, ""shtup"" her, then send her pretty self away pretty much immediately... to be beheaded. Talk about a bad breakup, huh? And talk about a King Harming, huh? Anyway, this king killed thousands of women by the time he finally met the enchantingly different Scheherazade. What made Scheherazade enchantingly different? Scheherazade loved to read books and had lots of fascinating ideas and interests to share. Wisely educated in morality and kindness, she had a passion for poetry, philosophy, sciences and arts. She kept the king on the edge of his bed -- not with mere alluring sexual positions -- but with alluring stories to be told, each more exciting than the next. And so the king kept Scheherazade alive -- eagerly anticipating each new tale -- until, lo and behold, 1,001 adventurous nights passed -- along with three sons -- and the king not only learned to love Scheherazade, but he made her his queen. Talk about living happily ever after, huh? The lesson learned? It's very seductive to a man when you, as a full-bodied and full souled woman, have passions in your life you can share to keep him inspired, titillated, growing and thriving. Seduction Tip 2 (again in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember): The more passions you have in your life, the more passion your man will have for you! Oprah.com: 4 steps to finding your passion . My friend David told me he fell in love with his wonderful wife of 13 years because he adored her ""world lens"" -- all the interesting perspectives she shared about life, all her passionate insights and enthusiastic talents. David's idea of love is being turned on by how his paramour looked at the world, instead of simply focusing on how she looked to the world. Which is why David is a 3-D Prince Charming who's found his Scheherazade. Unfortunately, I believe too many women feel that the best way to catch a guy is with the bait of their (to word it politely) ""vajayjay."" But if that is the main lure for love, then why aren't little ""vajayjay icons"" found on Valentine's Day cards? I'm kidding -- but I am serious! If you sleep with a man too soon, you risk being dizzied by an ""oxytocin high,"" and you will not know until you're already emotionally entrenched if the two of you have a true soul-nurturing connection. Plus, even in this modern world, you also risk the man respecting you less if you give sex away too quickly. It's timeless psychology. The harder you are to win, the bigger your estimated prize value. Many men do not want to belong to a club that has touched their members too quickly. It's the ol' Dr. Ejaculate/Mr. Hide Syndrome. As soon as the man comes, he'll want to go. Seduction Tip 3 (back to bold italics one last time for good measure): If you ever wanna hear ""I do,"" you have to start off saying a lot of sexual ""I don'ts."" For this reason, I recommend to the women I coach that they do not drink alcohol on dates. Staying alcohol-free will help ensure you clearly ""hear"" who a guy is, not simply ""see"" who he is. You don't want to be hypnotized by superficial qualities, like his looks and wealth. Plus, being alcohol-free will help make sure you don't move too swiftly forward physically (a.k.a. it will ensure you keep your vajayjay in your skirt!). Meaning? My overall big seduction tip for luring in healthful, happy relationship is to STOP trying to be seductive! If you focus too much on seducing a man with your body and beauty, you will only be luring in a man with your body and beauty. If you want to wisely be in a lust, love and like relationship of shared virtue, it's far more important that you excite a man's soul. Oprah.com: How to get lucky in love and life .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- British soldier Phil Packer was told a year ago that he would never walk again, but on Saturday he finished the London Marathon. Londoners applaud Maj. Phil Packer, who was told he'd never walk again. He completed the race 13 days after it started, walking on crutches for two miles a day -- the most his doctor would allow -- in order to raise money for charity. Flanked by cheering soldiers and supporters, an obviously emotional Packer had defied medical opinion after his lower spine was badly injured in the aftermath of a rocket attack on his base in Basra, Iraq, in February 2008. The attack sent a vehicle rolling down a sand bank, striking Packer ""head on"" and dragging him under it. The 36-year-old was left with no feeling or motor control in his legs, and no bladder or bowel control.  Watch more on soldier's battle » . Packer was in hospital for more than four months and it was then he decided to complete three challenges to help raise £1 million ($1.5 million) for Help for Heroes, a British charity supporting wounded veterans. In February he rowed the English Channel, and next month he plans to climb El Capitan -- one of America's iconic mountaineering sites -- a 3,000-foot vertical rock formation in California. Packer, who was met at the marathon finish line by British Olympian Steve Redgrave, said that he was £370,000 ($558,000) short of his goal but he was hoping for more donations. Dressed in a white charity T-shirt and desert fatigues, he was emotional. ""It's looking after our injured servicemen,"" he said. ""There's a lot of people that can't do this, so this is for them."" Earlier this week he told CNN that he ""wanted to be able to move on in life."" ""I wanted to do something for other personnel who had been wounded. ""I don't want to be helped. I want to help other people. Not that I'm not grateful, but... you know... I really want to be able to help people."" He attributed being back on his feet to ""fantastic medical support"" from Britain's Ministry of Defense and National Health Service. ""So many improvements are being made"" in medicine, he said. ""It's an evolving process.""  Watch more on Phil Packer » . However, he did not know whether he would be able to walk without crutches. ""I gotta see how it goes. Take every improvement as it comes."" Packer is far from alone; the six-year war in Iraq has disabled thousands of people. Britain's Ministry of Defense did not respond to a CNN question about how many service members had been permanently disabled in the war. In the United States, the Congressional Research Service reported in March that 31,131 troops had been wounded in Iraq. That figure is for battlefield injuries; many more veterans were later diagnosed with some sort of traumatic brain injury, but it is difficult to determine an exact number because of how the data is kept. It's not clear how many of the injuries are permanent because the Department of Veterans' Affairs does not classify some disabilities that way until 10 years after the injury, said Ryan Gallucci of AmVets, a veterans' service organization. Statistics for Iraqis are even harder to come by. Estimates of the number of wounded range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Iraq's Ministry of Heath says one in four wounded Iraqis have lost at least one limb. Britain's Prince Charles is among those who have expressed support for Packer. ""You are, if I may say so, a credit to the Royal Military Police and to the British Army as a whole,"" the heir to the British throne wrote in a letter posted on Packer's Web site, http://www.philpacker.com/. Packer is still on active duty and intends to remain so. ""I've still got a career in the armed forces. I'm going to go back to it."" He has 16 years of service under his belt, including time as an enlisted man before he went to officer training school and is, he noted with a rueful laugh, 20 years from retirement. He's been asked to be an ambassador for Prince Charles' charity, the Prince's Trust, which focuses on helping young people, in addition to his life in what he calls ""the disability community."" After his two-week effort, Packer was asked whether he would be relaxing in a warm bath. No, he said, ""I'm going to have a drink."" And with that, the army major lifted a shot glass and toasted his supporters. CNN's Richard Greene contributed to this report.","Phil Packer, 36, was wounded in the aftermath of a rocket attack in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Four months after he was escorted in his pajamas onto a military plane and flown out of the country, ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya could return to power within days, analysts said Friday. Negotiators for Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti, the politician who was appointed president hours after Zelaya's June 28 removal, reached an agreement late Thursday to form a government of national reconciliation. The nation's congress, in consultation with the supreme court, must approve Zelaya's return to power. The reconciliation government would rule until a new president, to be chosen in November 29 elections, takes office in January. Micheletti announced the agreement in a televised speech to the nation Thursday night. Zelaya said Friday his return to the presidency is ""imminent"" and should occur within days. He has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, since secretly returning to the country September 21. ""At this moment we are trying to reach a consensus so we can reconstruct democracy,"" he told CNN en Español on Friday. Although Zelaya's return to the presidency is not guaranteed in the eight-point pact, several analysts say they expect the congress will approve the measure. ""If Micheletti came forward with a public announcement, the odds of this being approved by congress are pretty good. It's a done deal,"" said Kevin Casas-Zamora, a senior foreign policy fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution and a former vice president of Costa Rica. ""It would be a horrible letdown if congress did not approve the agreement."" Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, also believes ""they'll go ahead and vote for it."" Said Larry Birns, director of the liberal Council on Hemispheric Affairs: ""There seems to be no other way."" The United States played a key role in the accord after weeks of stalemate. Thomas Shannon, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, and two other high-level U.S. officials arrived Wednesday and met separately with Zelaya and Micheletti. An agreement appeared possible Thursday when Shannon announced at a news conference that the U.S. delegation would stay another day. A delegation from the Organization of American States had visited Honduras in early October but failed to obtain an agreement. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias had held consultations with both sides but did not get them to agree on a solution. The OAS, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States condemned the military-backed coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The United States and others imposed economic sanctions, which some analysts say have started to hurt Honduras. ""The dark secret here is that the Honduran economy has been devastated,"" Birns said. ""Huge numbers of Hondurans have crossed over into Mexico and are desperate for jobs."" Crumbling economic conditions left Micheletti little choice, Birns said. ""All along Micheletti was holding a diminishing deck,"" he said. ""Not only the poor were being hurt. The cutoffs were hurting the nation's economic elite. So there was a very strong economic motive to reach a solution."" There also was a strong political motive, Hakim said. ""The candidates for president, the people looking forward, wanted to see the elections on November 29 as being legitimate,"" he said. Birns agreed that ""the candidates wanted a resolution because of legitimacy."" The United States and many other nations had said the elections would be considered illegitimate if held under Micheletti's rule. ""By far, the most important thing right now is not whether Zelaya will be reinstated, but that the U.S. is going to recognize the elections,"" said Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm. ""The next president will be able to receive diplomatic recognition and much-needed access to international aid and financing, which will be crucial given the weakness of the economy and the fact that the government is running out of money,"" she said. Zelaya also appeared to have little choice but to accept the pact, even though it does not automatically return to him to power, as he had demanded all along. ""He didn't have many options, did he?"" said Casas-Zamora of the Brookings Institution. ""He was never able to mobilize people in the numbers he claimed to have. He didn't have much clout, frankly. Holed up in the Brazilian Embassy he became much more marginalized. That's as good as it gets for him."" The president's four-year term -- whether it's Zelaya or Micheletti -- ends January 27, when the new head of state will take over. Berkman believes Zelaya heard the clock ticking. ""Zelaya probably accepted this agreement because he was running out of time and leverage, and he may have thought that going through congress was his best bet at getting an agreement in his favor,"" she said. Birns sees it as a face-saving move. ""The only thing Zelaya gets out of this is the dignity of serving out his complete term,"" Birns said. ""He will be a president without any authority. Basically, he's been rendered into a figurehead president."" In addition to the formation of a reconciliation government, the pact also stipulates -- at Zelaya's insistence -- that there will be no amnesty for those involved in his ouster. Micheletti said in an interview Friday evening with CNN en Español that he's certain Zelaya will try to prosecute him. Just a few weeks ago, it was Micheletti who was saying Zelaya would be prosecuted if he left the Brazilian Embassy. ""Yes, we are certain that there will be persecution,"" Micheletti said Friday. ""But I am not afraid. What we did was within the constitution."" Micheletti has insisted Zelaya was removed through constitutional means, not a coup. Some analysts say legal proceedings might not be the best course. ""Any attempt to seek revenge here is going to be costly and inefficient and conflictive,"" said Birns, head of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. The pact also calls for the creation of a ""truth commission"" to investigate the events surrounding Zelaya's ouster; the formation of a ""verification commission"" to ensure that the agreement is adhered to; and a solicitation to the international community to lift economic and diplomatic sanctions. The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal. Zelaya has said since his ouster he would not try to revive the issue if returned to power. That's a good thing, Hakim said. ""The most important thing,"" he said, ""are the assurances that Zelaya will be limited in his powers.""","Negotiators for President Manuel Zelaya and de facto President Roberto Micheletti reach deal .

"(CNN) -- David Michaelis' new biography of Charles M. Schulz explores the man behind  ""Peanuts,"" the comic strip that has delighted readers for decades. CNN.com appealed to fans out there to say what Linus, Lucy and Charlie Brown meant to them. Joy Hernandez has collected stuffed Snoopys since she was young; her dog, Dottie, is a Snoopy doppelganger. Readers responded with tales of bonding with family members while reading ""Peanuts,"" even meeting Schulz and finding inspiration and companionship in the strip's characters. Below is a selection of responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity: . Elise Marrion of Midland, Texas My grandmother always loved ""Peanuts,"" and across the generations, that was one of the things we shared. When I was 7 years old, I spent a summer with her in Denver and every morning, I raced to find ""Peanuts"" in the comics section. A retired teacher, Grandma always made me read at least one front-page news story before I was allowed to read the comics. That task turned into a great love of newspapers, and it inspired me to pursue a career in journalism. Sadly she passed away before I received my degree, but I still keep her Peppermint Patty doll to remind me of her and our times reading ""Peanuts"" together. Kimberly Mercier of Santa Rosa, California The ""Peanuts"" characters were more like friends, when I was growing up. Woodstock and Snoopy were always my favorites, even today. I spent many years ice skating in Santa Rosa as a child and would often see Charles Schulz there at his favorite table in the Warm Puppy Cafe in front of the fireplace. Sometimes, we got to watch him and his ""senior"" team play broomball on the ice. They enjoyed themselves so much. Mr. Schulz was always kind and friendly to me, and when I became an adult with sons of my own, he treated them with equal kindness, a warm smile and hello. We have the loveliest memories of the ""Peanuts"" characters and their creator, a beloved man in our town. Susan Clifton of Chalfont, Pennsylvania This is more a comment on Mr. Schulz than the ""Peanuts"" characters. I was in my early teens and a huge hockey fan. I loved the ""Peanuts"" programs and coloring books and my parents told me that Charles Schulz was a big hockey fan, too. I wrote him a letter telling him of our shared interest, and before I knew it, I received a personalized letter, along with two cartoons with the ""Peanuts"" gang playing hockey -- each signed with a little note. I treasured that letter and personalized cartoons so much and always loved him for the fact that he would take the time to send them to me. It pains me beyond words that those pieces got lost along the way and are gone forever. Zac Davis of Blue Springs, Missouri My favorite ""Peanuts"" strip shows Snoopy typing on his typewriter a statement that details a struggle in many men's lives (apparently even Schulz's own): ""Girls and root beer are not the answer."" Brian Heraty of Chicago, Illinois I remember snippets of the ""Peanuts"" gang throughout my childhood. ... From ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" and Christmas specials to ""Snoopy vs. the Red Baron,"" memories of Charlie Brown and the gang abound. In all that time, there were always two answers that eluded me: Why are all the boys bald or balding, and what's the deal with Peppermint Patty? Pedro Valle of San Juan, Puerto Rico My favorite ""Peanuts"" character has always been Linus Van Pelt. His view on humanity is unique, like an outsider looking in. In fact, my favorite ""Peanuts"" moment ever is when Charlie Brown challenges Linus' dream to become a little country doctor. He asks Linus how he could become a doctor if he can't deal with humanity. The very wise Linus responds: ""I love humanity; it's people I can't stand."" That sums up my own feelings to the letter. Vicki Boston of Tucson, Arizona I always love watching Charlie Brown and his ""Peanuts"" gang on the holiday specials. I see myself as a Marcie or Peppermint Patty type. I even played Peppermint Patty in grade school when we did two Charlie Brown skits, and I loved it. Melanie Taylor of Manchester, England I am 33 years of age and still enjoy watching the ""Peanuts"" cartoon shows. The Charlie Brown Christmas special would be, to this day, my ultimate favorite. As a kid, I hated being bullied, put down, let down, always had very few true friends who never passed judgment on me. In that, Charlie was ""me."" Linus would be my best friend Tammy, and no matter what, through thick and thin, Tammy was by my side, no matter how cruel the world was around us. We both had a true friendship bond back then. She is someone I wish I knew where she was. I would call her this instant if I knew how or where to find her. I would be calling her up and telling her that ""our show is on."" Shannon Brady of Austin, Texas I remember having ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" when I was very little. I used to watch that thing about 50 times a day till it finally died. Charlie Brown was the greatest. Kat Smith of Fort Washington, Maryland I have been a fan of ""Peanuts"" since I was a young girl. My aunt was a fan, and through her I too became a fan. There are so many quips and strips to choose from, but my all-time favorite quotes come from Linus. One came about during breakfast with his sister, Lucy, and some dialogue about snicker-snacks (the cereal they were eating). I don't remember all of it, but Linus told Lucy, ""My heart bleeds for the snicker-snacks company."" And of course there is the strip where Snoopy sent a sincere letter to the IRS asking it to please remove him from its mailing list. ... I've often wondered if I could do the same. Classic. Mark Eustace of Burlington, Ontario The greatest moment was in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" when Linus walks on stage with a single spotlight and explains the true meaning of Christmas. At my house you could hear a pin drop during that scene. Cassey Pelkey of Birmingham, England The most touching strip was the one printed just after Charles Schulz's death. I have been a ""Peanuts"" since I was 2 years old, and absolutely love them all. I think we can all see a little bit of Lucy, Peppermint Patty, Pigpen, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Linus ... in ourselves if we reflect on it. That's what makes it endearing. ... It's about Everyman. Kelly Cromwell of New York I have been a ""Peanuts"" fan since a young child. Drawing Snoopy and collecting comic books were an obsession when growing up. So when I decided to get a tattoo at age 28, I could think of nothing better than a dancing Snoopy. Ten years later, it still makes me smile. Joe Keilholz of Apex, North Carolina I have loved Charlie Brown since I was a kid. There isn't a single holiday that doesn't feel complete without watching any of the animated series, and not a day goes by without reading the classic strip. I've even gone so far as to try and get a tattoo with my face caricatured on Charlie Brown's body. The ring tone on my cell phone is Linus and Lucy, the e-mail address I send to everyone is Charlie Brown and my login names on almost every site are Charlie Brown-related. I can actually go on a bit more than this, but feel I should stop here. Needless to say, I feel very much like I'm a real life Charlie Brown. As to a catchphrase, of course the classic ""Good Grief"" is among the leaders. Grace Cavanaugh of Novato, California I have loved Snoopy and the gang for as long as I can remember. My first boyfriend gave me his Snoopy collection when he found out how much I loved the beagle. I still have it all. I think that Peppermint Patty would be the ""Peanuts"" character that I most identify with. She is bold but sometimes just so unsure of herself that it hits the right cord. Jacquelyn Bradley-Petersen of Ontario, California You can never get enough of the ""Peanuts"" gang. I always try and read the comic strip, but constantly watch the show, old videos and every special on every occasion. I will always love Charlie Brown. Watching it makes me smile and get into a zone where I forget about the day and everything else around me. Complete fun and goodness, serenity. Everyone can relate to one of the characters, especially Charlie Brown. At least I can. Thank you for talking about this and letting me relive some memories and have a nice moment.

"(CNN) -- A week before 9-year-old Michaela Garecht was kidnapped in Hayward, California, in 1988, she wrote a poem about people who had been abducted, her mother said Tuesday. Cases of missing girls Ilene Misheloff, left, and Michaela Garecht now linked to Garrido investigation. ""She sat down at the coffee table and wrote a poem about people behind the doors of steel, an amazing poem for a 9-year-old, ... and a week later she was kidnapped,"" Michaela's mother, Sharon Murch, said. ""It seems to me ... like it must be some sort of a prophesy or premonition, and I keep hearing the words that she said -- 'It's about people who were kidnapped and are being held captive, not people who were kidnapped and were killed.'"" Her comments came as authorities looked into whether Michaela's abduction and other unsolved kidnappings in the region are in any way related to Phillip Garrido, who was arrested last week for the kidnapping and rape of an 11-year-old girl just three years after Michaela was taken. That girl, Jaycee Lee Dugard -- now 29 -- was found alive last week, living in a tent and shelter compound in Garrido's back yard in Antioch, California -- 30 miles from where Michaela was kidnapped. The discovery raised Murch's hopes that her daughter might also be safe. ""My husband told me (about Dugard's discovery) at 5 in the morning. He woke me up and told me he had heard it on the news,"" Murch said.  Watch how case raises mother's hopes » . ""And I leaped up yelling, 'Oh, my God. I was, of course, joyful for Jaycee herself, but my first thought was 'please God, let Michaela be with her.'"" Murch said she feels there is a ""strong possibility"" that the two cases are linked. A bone fragment found near Garrido's home was being analyzed to determine whether it is was human and whether it connects Garrido to any other crimes, authorities said. The bone fragment was found on a neighbor's property in an area that Garrido had access to, they said.  Watch how bone fragment may offer clues » . Murch said police have approached her in the past five days to ask what Michaela was wearing on the day of her abduction. ""They apparently found a lot of stuff there,"" she said, referring to the Garrido property search. Police in several other San Francisco Bay Area agencies are also investigating possible ties between Garrido and other missing persons' cases. In Dublin, about 25 miles east of Oakland, police were looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff. She was 13 when abducted, investigators said. Antioch -- where Garrido is accused of holding Dugard -- is about 40 miles east of Oakland and about 165 miles southwest of Dugard's hometown, South Lake Tahoe. Contra Costa County sheriff's Lt. Steve Simpkins said police in Antioch and neighboring Pittsburg were searching Garrido's property ""for evidence relating to open cases."" Murch says the kidnappings of her daughter and that of Dugard have several similarities. ""The method of kidnapping was the same. They were both dragged into cars. The description of the cars was very similar. The girls looked very much like each other. There have been points in the past where the investigations have crossed with the same suspects, and Jaycee was found very close to home here."" Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said both girls were abducted in daylight, and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido, she said. Orrey said there were differences as well, though she would not elaborate. But she confirmed that Hayward police had been in contact with Michaela's family and witnesses since Dugard was found alive. Murch said a neighbor who witnessed her daughter's kidnapping called her on the phone when she saw Garrido on television and commented on a car removed from the Garrido property. ""That car looked like the car that Michaela was kidnapped in,"" Murch quoted her as saying. According to Murch, her daughter and a friend rode their scooters to the neighborhood market on a Saturday morning. ""They left the scooters outside the door. When they came out, one of the scooters was not where they left it. Michaela spotted it in a parking lot next to a car and went to get it, and when she bent over to pick up the scooter, a man jumped out of the car, grabbed her from behind, threw her into the car and took off with her."" That car was described as a tan color, possibly with some primer on it. ""Even before this (Dugard's reappearance) came up, I really had a feeling that perhaps my daughter might still be alive and might come home. And this has just heightened my hope for that,"" Murch said. She said she keeps busy by writing on her daughter's Web site. ""In some ways, it's a lot easier to continue to live without hope than to get your hopes raised again. Living with hopes not fulfilled is one of the hardest things, I think. ""If Michaela is out there and can hear me, I want her to know that I would like her to come home, that nothing that's transpired over the last 20 years can change the love we have for her. There's nothing that we can't overcome.""","Michaela Garecht, 9, kidnapped three years before Jaycee Dugard .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- The Bigfoot in the freezer is made of rubber, a Web posting asserted Tuesday. The frozen creature reputed to be Bigfoot turned out to be made of rubber, an enthusaist reports. The initial promoter of two hikers' claim that they found the body of Bigfoot in Georgia said he has determined that the discovery was a hoax. The body turned out to be rubber, and the two men who claimed that they found it, Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, have admitted that it was a costume, said a posting Tuesday on the Web sites of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. and Squatchdetective. The posting purportedly was written by Steve Kulls, who maintains the Squatchdetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program, where the find was announced weeks ago. In addition, Stanford University anthropologist Richard Klein said Monday that he was not aware he had been identified as participating in the project and would not be involved in any effort to examine the purported Bigfoot carcass. Whitton and Dyer announced last week that they had found the body of a 7-foot-7-inch, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They said they put the carcass in a freezer and had spotted about three similar living creatures. ""We were not looking for Bigfoot,"" Whitton, a Clayton County, Georgia, police officer, said Friday during a news conference. ""We wouldn't know what we were doing if we did."" He and Dyer insisted that scientific analysis would bear out their claim. The hoax was discovered after an ""expedited melting process,"" Kulls wrote. ""A break appeared up near the feet area ... as the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which looked unnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot."" Kulls said he contacted Tom Biscardi, the self-described ""Real Bigfoot Hunter"" who has been searching since 1971 for the creature of legend and appeared alongside Whitton and Dyer at the news conference. ""Later that day, Tom Biscardi informed us that both Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer admitted it was a costume,"" the posting said. Whitton and Dyer reportedly agreed to sign a promissory note and an admission of the hoax and meet with Biscardi at their hotel on Sunday. But when Biscardi went to the hotel, the two had left, Kulls wrote. ""At this time, action is being instigated against the perpetrators,"" the posting said, adding that the motives behind the claims were unknown. iReport.com: Do you believe in Bigfoot? The posting said Biscardi's organization, Searching for Bigfoot Inc., ""is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception."" Kulls did not immediately return a call to the Squatchdetective contact number. A woman answering the phone at Searching for Bigfoot Inc. said Biscardi had been ill and said she was not sure when he would be returning calls. A number listed as belonging to Matthew Whitton was disconnected as of Tuesday. Efforts to locate a phone number for Dyer on Tuesday were unsuccessful. Dyer and Whitton failed to show up Monday for a scheduled appearance on CNN's ""American Morning."" Kulls said that at the time he first interviewed Dyer on July 28 for the radio program, he suspected the duo's motive was financial. On August 12, he said, the two ""requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance, expected from the marketing and promotion."" Two days later, after signing a receipt and counting the money, Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the body: ""something appearing large, hairy and frozen in ice,"" Kulls wrote. Dyer, he said, insisted on holding the news conference and told Biscardi he would not release the body unless the briefing was held Friday. On Sunday, the research team was able to extract some hair and burn it. The hair sample ""melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair,"" Kulls wrote. Biscardi then gave the group permission to expedite the melting process, and the rubber foot was discovered, Kulls wrote. Meanwhile, Klein, the Stanford professor, said Monday that he was ""sorry that my name and Stanford's name have been brought into this."" Klein's name was mentioned Friday as one of four scientists, two of them Russian, who would analyze the corpse. Klein said he was unaware that Biscardi had identified him. He said he had been contacted by Biscardi in the past and responded to a request to examine bones that were identified as coming from a deer. ""He seems like a nice enough guy,"" Klein said, ""but I can't imagine why anyone would devote their lives to proving the existence [of Bigfoot]. Anything has a remote chance of being true, but there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real."" CNN's Peter Dykstra contributed to this report.","Hikers' discovery made of rubber, Web sites say .

"(CNN) -- More than 1 million babies born prematurely die each year before they are a month old, the March of Dimes said Sunday in the first comprehensive global report on premature births. A premature baby rests at a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, in October 2007. The organization suggested the situation could worsen if the rate of premature births increases. Each year, 12.9 million infants -- or nearly 10 percent of the annual worldwide birth total -- are born before 37 weeks of development in the womb, the organization said. More than 85 percent of the premature births occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia. ""Premature births are an enormous global problem that is exacting a huge toll emotionally, physically and financially on families, medical systems and economies,"" March of Dimes President Jennifer Howse said in a statement. ""In the United States alone, the annual cost of caring for preterm babies and their associated health problems tops $26 billion."" The March of Dimes report, which used data collected by the World Health Organization, breaks down premature birth rates by continent. The highest premature birth rate is in Africa, where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm, with more than 4 million premature deliveries annually. In populous Asia, although the preterm birth rate is lower at 9.1 percent, the number of premature births is higher, at nearly 7 million a year. While North America -- consisting of the United States and Canada in this report -- counts fewer than 500,000 premature births a year, its preterm birth rate is close to that of Africa, at 10.6 percent of all births, according to the report. The rate is the world's second highest. In the United States, the rate of preterm births has increased 36 percent in the past 25 years, with births between the 34th and 36th week of gestation accounting for the majority of the increase, the organization found. Much of the hike in preterm births is linked to more pregnancies after the age of 35 and the use of fertility treatments that can lead to multiple births. ""Wherever trend data are available, rates of preterm birth are increasing,"" the report said. Infants who survive premature birth face lifelong health risks, including the possible development of cerebral palsy, blindness, hearing loss, learning disabilities and other chronic conditions, according to the March of Dimes. ""Preterm birth is a global problem that needs greater attention by policymakers, researchers, health care providers, the media, donor organizations and other stakeholders,"" the report said. ""The marked disparities in preterm birth along racial/ethnic lines in many high-income countries and the concentration of preterm births in Africa and Asia also clearly indicate that addressing preterm birth is essential for reducing the pronounced inequities in neonatal health and for the world to achieve,"" it added. The March of Dimes, a nonprofit agency engaged in pregnancy and baby health research, said some premature births can be prevented by addressing risk factors in mothers, including diabetes, high blood pressure, nutrition, body weight and tobacco and alcohol use. Women who earlier gave birth to a preemie face a greater risk of having another. While doctors know some of the health and behavior factors in mothers that increase the risk of preterm births, doctors have yet to identify a reliable remedy to prevent early labor, said Christopher Howson, vice president for global programs of the March of Dimes. ""While much can be done right now to reduce death and disability from preterm birth even in low-resource settings, we need to know more about the underlying causes of premature birth in order to develop effective prevention strategies,"" Howson said.","March of Dimes: Nearly 10 percent of world's births are premature .

"(CNN) -- The label on the package claimed that it contained T-shirts and baby toys. When customs officials in Sydney scanned the parcel, they found five pythons and two venomous tarantulas. But when customs officials in Sydney X-ray scanned the parcel, they found instead five pythons and two venomous tarantulas. On Tuesday, authorities raided the house in Sydney to which the parcel had been addressed. Officials seized evidence but expect to file charges later, the customs agency said.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN)  -- South Korea will open its market to most U.S. beef, a senior government official said Thursday, according to state media. Thousands of people have taken to the streets of the South Korean capital in protest at the deal . South Korea banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 amid concerns over a case of mad cow disease in the United States. The ban closed what was then the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. It resumed limited imports last year -- allowing boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age -- but that re-opening was subject to interruptions and closed altogether in October 2007. A deal that South Korea and the United States struck last month bans the import of high-risk materials, like tonsils, brains, spinal cord marrow and a section of the small intestine, Agriculture Minister Chung Woon-chun said Thursday, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. These parts pose the greatest risk of transmitting mad cow disease to humans. The ban will be lifted within a few days, once the government's new import rules have been published. The pending resumption of U.S. beef imports hasn't been without political costs for President Lee Myung-bak. He apologized to the nation last week for failing to fully understand concerns about mad cow disease. In downtown Seoul, thousands of people have regularly staged protests, chanting ""We don't want crazy cows,"" since the deal to revive beef imports was announced. And the main opposition party has taken up the fight. ""We will be forced to make a critical decision if the government pushes through its plan to announce resumption of beef imports,"" said Sohn Hak-kyu, leader of the main opposition United Democratic Party, Yonhap reported. ""If the government and the ruling party ignore this warning, we will come up with every possible measure to stop them."" The opposition has already filed a suit to suspend implementation of new beef import terms, according to Yonhap. Lee's ruling Grand National Party (GNP) is working to soothe tensions, saying that American beef is safe to eat and that adequate safety precautions have been taken. ""The government has tried its best to free the public from unnecessary concerns, and sufficient countermeasures have been prepared,"" said Lee Hahn-koo, the party's chief policymaker, Yonhap reported. When South Korea and the United States reached the deal in April to re-open the South Korean market, they removed the major obstacle to U.S. congressional approval of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Lee urged the National Assembly this month to ratify the agreement as soon as possible to provide fresh impetus to the sluggish Korean economy, saying it will create 300,000 jobs. But the opposition has promised to fight the FTA until the beef pact is nullified. In 2003, the United States exported $815 million pounds of beef and beef variety meats to South Korea. The U.S. beef industry has lost up to $4 billion since the market closed, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.","South Korea to open market to most U.S. beef says government official .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Dan Neumann was a 14-year-old struggling against cancer when he came across an unexpected ally in his battle. Cancer survivor Dan Neumann plays Re-Mission and is helping create the game's next edition. He was receiving treatment for leukemia at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University in 2004 when he saw a flyer inviting teenage cancer patients to test a new video game. A self-described gamer, Neumann says he was immediately drawn to the posting. He signed up to try it and was won over by the game, which simulated what goes on inside the bodies of cancer patients. ""When you go through cancer treatment, chemotherapy becomes something you dread,"" Neumann, now 19, recalled. ""But with the game you're actively playing something and shooting cells."" That game eventually became Re-Mission, a video game that's helping teenagers around the world in their fight against cancer. Since its release in 2006, more than 145,000 free copies have been distributed, and now a new version of the game is in the works.  See what it's like to play the game » . Pamela Omidyar, wife of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, came up with the idea for the game. A former lab technician and avid video game player, she thought kids could learn a lot by experiencing the treatment process in a vivid way. That led her to launch HopeLab, a non-profit that took Re-Mission from the drawing board to an actual product. The organization, which focuses on using technology to create positive health outcomes in kids, was recently recognized by U.S. President Barack Obama for its innovative approach to tackling health challenges. Players control a tiny robot who travels through the human body to destroy harmful cancer cells. Along the way, she breaks down complex medical terminology and explains what's going on when the body undergoes treatment like chemotherapy. By making cancer a visible foe, Re-Mission gives kids a different mental view of who their enemy is, said Dr. Steve Cole, vice president of research at HopeLab. That's something that teenagers around the world can benefit from. Video games like Re-Mission transcend national boundaries and cultures, he told CNN. ""Everybody wants to beat death."" Re-Mission has been distributed to 81 countries, and patients anywhere in the world can download it for free online. According to Cole, providing an opportunity to experience the positive emotions that come from treatment can change the behavior of young patients and can make a real difference in their health. A study he conducted that was published in 2008 showed that patients who played Re-Mission took their medication more consistently and learned more about their disease than those who didn't. ""What this game is really built to do is help teenagers be better participants in their own medical care enterprise,"" said Cole. ""It gives them a real opportunity to affect their own health outcomes."" Neumann says when he was in the hospital, doctors walked him through pamphlets describing the chemotherapy process. But it was the game that ultimately made him feel better about his treatment. ""There's a lot of complex medical terminology, which is hard to digest at that age,"" he said. ""Re-Mission encourages you to learn that your chemotherapy is doing something."" Now in remission, Neumann is helping HopeLab develop the next edition of the game. In the early stages of development, the new product is expected to be released in 2012 at the earliest. He's been providing feedback on his experience as a cancer survivor and gamer to help developers understand what patients personally get out of playing Re-Mission. He wants other teenagers to experience the game, and says they shouldn't shy away even if they've never played video games before. ""Re-Mission is an excellent game for any cancer patient, regardless of whether they're a gamer,"" he said. ""It really makes you feel like you're engaging in your treatment.""","Re-Mission video game helps patients visualize battle against cancer .

"(CNN) -- Naval forces from several countries were searching Tuesday for a British couple and their missing yacht, which may have been hijacked by pirates off the coast of Africa, military sources told CNN. European Union anti-piracy forces may have spotted the missing vessel Tuesday, a spokesman told CNN. ""One of our helicopters spotted a yacht approximately 200 nautical miles from the Somali coast, towing two skiffs of the type normally used by pirates,"" Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Auwermann told CNN. The yacht has not been identified, and the EU helicopter could not make contact with it, he said. Paul and Rachel Chandler set off from the Seychelles for Tanzania on October 21, according to their blog. They have not been heard from since, but a distress beacon was activated October 23, according to naval officials. International military forces are treating the case as a ""potential hijacking,"" Lt. Ian Jones of Britain's Royal Navy told CNN. ""We have no confirmation that anything has been pirated,"" he added. There are many possibilities, he said, adding that he was aware of the reports of piracy but that hijacking was ""far from certain."" The weather in the area is quite good, he said. Before setting off, the Chandlers said that the journey could take as long as two weeks and that they would be out of contact for part of the voyage. ""We probably won't have satellite phone coverage until we're fairly close to the African coast, so we may be out of touch for some time,"" they wrote before setting off in the Lynn Rival, a 38-foot yacht. Britain's Foreign Office issued a statement saying it is ""extremely concerned for their safety,"" while pointing out that it had not confirmed reports they were taken captive. Pirates have been active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia. Two vessels were attacked the day after the Chandlers set sail. One of them -- a cargo ship -- was successfully boarded and seized off the Seychelles, while the other fought off its attackers near the Kenyan coast. Attacks in the region have significantly increased this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes. But successful attacks have decreased as a result of a strong presence of international monitors. The first nine months of this year have seen more pirate attacks than all of last year, the bureau reported October 21. From January 1 until September 30, pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks, compared with 293 in all of 2008, it said. More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. Out of those attacks, Somali pirates successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages. Eight people were wounded, four were killed and one is missing, the bureau said. CNN's Adam S. Levine contributed to this report.","European Union forces may have spotted couple's yacht off Somalia .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Whenever you speak with Carlos Santana, you pretty much know what you're going to get: lots of talk about love and light. spiritual analogies, name-dropping of people like Marvin Gaye and Mother Teresa. Carlos Santana will start a 72-show residency in Las Vegas in May at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. It may take a moment to enter the humble headspace of the 61-year-old guitarist legend, but once you're there, you realize that this is a man who acts with his heart instead of his head. Somehow, he's managing to live out his 1960s ideals in 2009 -- and he wants fans to experience a piece of that with his new Las Vegas, Nevada, show, ""Supernatural Santana: A Trip Through the Hits."" The 72-show residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino launches May 27, with 36 concerts this year and 36 in 2010. As with all his events, a portion of the cost of each ticket will be donated to the Milagro Foundation, the charitable organization founded by Santana and his family to benefit children around the world.  Watch Santana get into the groove » . Santana talked to CNN about the Vegas show and his beliefs. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: Your Vegas show sounds like it's your greatest hits mixed with a little bit of Carlos Santana spirituality. Carlos Santana: They're inseparable at this point. We're very different than a lot of bands. A lot of bands concentrate on show business and entertainment. We focus on light and touching people's hearts. We really believe that by coming to Las Vegas, it gives us an opportunity to take ourselves and the people who come to listen to us into a place where people are free from thinking they're sinners or unworthy. There's something really wonderful about music when music makes men and women dance, laugh and cry at the same time, because they're receiving like a Holy Ghost thing. CNN: Ticket prices range from $79 up to $299 -- which is a lot of money for some people in this economy. Santana: I have no clue about that. I'm more with, ""This finger goes onto this note and it makes juicy sounds, and I'm going to make people dance and laugh."" It's not like I don't care or I'm ignorant. It's just that I'm not wired to have that insignificance on me other than what I'm going to get to give back to other people. And other than that, I trust that the people around me -- which is my sister and my brother-in-law -- will take care of all of those dimensions. We don't like to gouge people, but we do like to be realistic that you do need to pay the rent ... and stuff like that. But other than that, since I was a child, I really don't put that much focus or significance into it. CNN: You're well-loved by mainstream audiences, and the Latino audience has been really supportive, too. Do you think this is opening up the door to perhaps invite the Latino audience to Vegas? Santana: They're already there. They're washing dishes and folding sheets -- I'm serious. The Latin community is there. It's just that we don't see them. ... I don't belong to just Latinos just because I speak Spanish. We go to Ireland, and if we go to Pakistan, or Istanbul or Malaysia, we're part of the family. We just did a tour in South America, and I have never seen so many children come to our concerts in my life -- and I've been doing this since '67. CNN: You were born in Mexico, and President Obama will be heading there to talk about the war on drugs. [Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton recently made some remarks that United States drug consumption is partially to blame for this problem. Do you agree with that? Santana: Totally. I think that the solution to all of this stuff would be to legalize it, decriminalize it, reinvest all that money into teachers in schools. ... If we would teach in schools the incredible sensation of climax that it feels to be of service to other people -- like Mother Teresa, or Desmond Tutu or the Dalai Lama -- smoking pot, and drinking tequila, and watching porno or whatever people do, it pales in comparison when you actually wake up to be of service to people. To go back to the question -- I think we should legalize marijuana. I think Barack Obama should bring the brothers and sisters home -- the soldiers. If I was to see him, I would go, ""Listen to Marvin Gaye's 'What's Going On' and John Coltrane, and bring the boys home from the war now, like we did with Vietnam."" They're not going to come here. People in Vietnam did not come here to attack us after we left them alone. So let's get rid of that fear, that fantasy, that stuff. Let's get rid of the bogeyman, because the bogeyman is us looking in the mirror of each other. CNN: What about when people don't get it, Carlos? What if they're listening to you and thinking, ""He sounds like one of those New Age Californians, and I really don't get what they're doing out there."" Santana: Well, they don't get it because they're stuck in something that is not working. Like, for example, a lot of people are stuck with certain parts of the Bible, believing that God is vengeful and jealous. That's Godzilla! I'm not stuck with a God like that. I'm stuck with a God that's all love, all compassion, all light, and he only sees you with purity and innocence, like the brand-new eyes of a child that's just been born. ... A lot about Las Vegas is illusion. It's entertainment and show business. We don't know none of that. We only know to go into your heart and help you remember that it's there. I know a lot of rich millionaires who are not happy, and you're only happy when you're doing something. CNN: Are you happy? Santana: I'm very, very happy because I'm grateful. My priorities finally have been crystallized. I started washing dishes, and now I do this. And this is a lot of fun.","Carlos Santana will be opening ""Supernatural Santana"" in Las Vegas May 27 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Brandon Boyd blends into his Venice, California, neighborhood like any other resident. Brandon Boyd, front man for Incubus, is going on the road with the band in July. He surfs. Shuns Starbucks in favor of the local smoothie shop. Walks his French bulldog, Bruce. Oh, he also paints and makes music with his multiplatinum rock band, Incubus. The quintet hits the road on a North American summer tour in July, and just released a greatest hits collection called ""Monuments and Melodies."" The packaging features artwork by Boyd, who held his first solo art exhibit at Mr. Musichead Rock Art Gallery in Los Angeles last fall. The showroom is on the Sunset Strip, a stone's throw from the clubs that were host to Incubus' first gigs. The most spectacular paintings are large, fantasy-inspired pieces drenched in burgundy or aqua. Usually, the artwork springs to life in a corner of the singer's kitchen, where an easel permanently resides. It's a zen-like space, with high ceilings, glossy concrete floors and warm, burnished wood. But instead of the requisite Buddha statue, there's a rubber rabbit's head for inspiration. The muse seems ironic and appropriate, especially since Boyd swears his home was a brothel back in the 1900s. CNN talked to Boyd about collaboration, the fulfillment of art and finding the perfect wave. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Isn't it ironic that you had your first solo art show before your first solo album? Brandon Boyd: I've actually thought very little about solo work up until just very recently. Most of it is because in my band, Incubus, it is very much a collaborative effort. I do what I do in the band, and everyone plays their respective parts, but in the end, we are sort of a democratic process. We meet in the middle for a lot of the songs, and I think that's why we sound the way we do -- because it's sort of five minds meeting in the middle. With my art thing, it's completely self-indulgent.  Watch the singer discuss his art » . CNN: So what does art fulfill in you that you don't get out of music? Boyd: To me, it's like the difference between a pen and a paintbrush. Music draws from almost the identical place as art does, which really is that intangible -- it's like you're pulling from the ether. I don't know where it comes from. Nobody really does. It sort of arrives when it wants to. ... I've been painting and drawing and taking pictures as long as I've been writing music -- and I've actually been drawing longer than I've been writing music. I didn't go around looking for it. It kind of found me. CNN: Your parents always encouraged you to explore your artistic side. Boyd: My parents are wonderful, and I'm really lucky -- but my mom has always been almost exclusively a right-brained person. She goes completely on her feelings of things, on her intuition, and so she instilled that in my brothers and I. And she also instilled in us from a very young age the importance of visualization -- visualization as a tool towards manifestation in your life. And so, from a very young age, if I didn't feel well, she's like, ""Well, draw what's happening and draw a solution."" If I had a stomach ache, I would draw a picture of my stomach, and I would draw what I thought the bad germs looked like -- and, you know, they had little robber masks on and stuff. And then I would draw a good germ, and of course it had a cape, and some tights, and he had a washcloth in his hands, and he could fly around and clean up the bad germs. And for some reason, I would always feel better afterwards. CNN: Did you ever visualize and draw what you wanted to achieve in terms of your music career, too? Boyd: Sometimes, yeah. But the guys in the band -- we kind of grew up together, and when they were like, ""We want to play music, let's start a band. You should be the singer,"" I was like, ""OK."" I'd never written anything before, I had never even really sang, but they knew that I knew how to draw, so it seemed logical that maybe I could write lyrics or carry a tune. So I always just sort of visualize lines, I would visualize a melody, and then sound it out to them, and they would help me sort of guide it through the instruments. And eventually, I got good enough at it that I was able to do it completely on my own. CNN: When you finish a painting, is it very much like finishing a song or finishing an album? Boyd: Yeah, there is definitely a sense of accomplishment. Very rarely is there any confusion as to when a painting or a song is finished. You just know when it's done. Someone wise once said when they were asked the question, ""How do you know when you're done with a painting?"" And they said, ""How do you know when you're done making love?"" I always thought that was a great analogy. CNN: Did you ever think, ""I need a fall-back job, like being an accountant, or a lawyer, or someone who works for IBM?"" Boyd: I feel very blessed, but no. I knew from a very young age that these were the things that I was supposed to do, and I actually made some very adult decisions when I was a teenager based on the knowledge that this is what I was going to do. There was really no question about it. CNN: What else do you want to do? Boyd: Painting and art are obviously in my focus, but I dream about getting a really big tube at the Bonsai Pipeline sometime in the near future.","Incubus' Brandon Boyd has been indulging in a love of painting .

"(CNN) -- A global commodities trading company says it is considering a settlement to legal claims that it is responsible for the deaths of 15 people and thousands of illnesses after 500 tons of toxic waste were dumped in the African nation of Ivory Coast. Signs such as this were still up in ""toxic zones"" around Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a year after the waste dumping. The Dutch company Trafigura said studies by 20 experts it has hired conclude that the chemicals did not harm anyone. ""In view of that expert evidence, and the fact that claims are not being made in this litigation for deaths, miscarriages, still births, birth defects and other serious injuries, the parties are exploring the possibility of compromising the claims which have been made,"" Trafigura said in a release Wednesday. ""A global settlement is being considered by the parties and it currently appears that this settlement is likely to be acceptable to most, if not all, of the claimants."" A United Nations report also released Wednesday said Trafigura did cause death and injury when the cargo ship Probo Koala dumped 500 tons of toxic waste belonging to the company at sites around Abidjan, the West African nation's largest city. The incident happened in August 2006. ""According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 people were hospitalized and over 100,000 others, complaining of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes, sought medical treatment after the incident,"" said the report by Okechukwu Ibeanu, an unpaid investigator for the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council. ""We still don't know -- and we may never know -- the full effect of the dumping. But there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste."" Ibeanu, who visited Ivory Coast and the Netherlands during his investigation, urged all parties to take steps ""to address possible long-term human health and environmental effects of the incident."" According to a U.N. statement, Ibeanu said last month that the areas where the toxic waste was dumped still have not been decontaminated and continue to threaten residents' health. Many people, he said, are still reporting headaches, skin lesions, digestive difficulties and nose, throat and lung problems. Trafigura noted in its release Wednesday that it initiated a plan two years ago that would compensate, without any admission of liability, any claimants who could demonstrate any injury caused by exposure to the waste, which the company calls ""slops."" ""The company has always maintained that the Probo Koala's slops could not possibly have caused deaths and serious or long-term injuries,"" Trafigura said. ""Independent expert witnesses firmly support Trafigura in this stance."" Trafigura also maintains it ""sought to comply with all relevant regulations and procedures concerning the offloading of the Probo Koala's slops in Abidjan."" The company denies that the ship went to Ivory Coast solely to dump the toxic waste. ""Trafigura has consistently stated that the Probo Koala was returning from a routine commercial voyage to deliver a gasoline cargo in Lagos, Nigeria, when it stopped in Abidjan,"" the company statement said. ""Consequently, any suggestion that the vessel was sent to West Africa solely for the purpose of offloading its slops is entirely inaccurate."" As one of the largest independent companies trading commodities, Trafigura has 1,900 employees in 42 nations, the company's Web site says. ""We handle every element involved in the sourcing and trading of crude oil, petroleum products, renewable energies, metals, metal ores and concentrates for industrial consumers."" the company says. Ivory Coast, a former French colony with a population of 20 million, is also known as Cote d'Ivoire.","Dutch firm Trafigura: Toxic dumping didn't harm anyone, according to experts .

"Editor's note: Rudy Ruiz founded RedBrownandBlue.com, a site featuring multicultural political commentary, hosts a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show; and wrote a guide to success for immigrants (""¡Adelante!"" published by Random House). He is co-founder and president of Interlex, an advocacy marketing agency based in San Antonio, Texas. Rudy Ruiz says people hold on to their views despite the evidence for fear of being labeled a flip-flopper. SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- As people shout over each other and tune out diverging views in town hall meetings, the health care debate is proving to be symptomatic of a major ailment threatening our nation: . A contagious culture of closed-mindedness threatens to suffocate our progress as a society. Why has it become so difficult to even consider changing our minds about important issues? Here's my diagnosis. Increasingly, the willingness to change one's position on political issues has been misread as a mark of weakness rather than a product of attentive listening and careful deliberation. During the 2004 Presidential campaign, the successful branding of John Kerry as a flip-flopper doomed his bid. Fear of ""flip-flopper syndrome"" is apparently catching like the flu, because today politicians are not alone in their determination to adhere to partisan positions despite the changing needs of our nation. Nearly everyone's so reluctant to appear wishy-washy that they stand firm even when the evidence is against their views. Three factors exacerbate this paralysis by lack of analysis: labels, lifestyles and listening. First, the labels ascribed to many potential policy tools render sensible options taboo, loading what could be rational, economic or social measures with moral baggage. This narrows our choices, hemming in policy makers. Any proposal including the words ""government-run"" elicits cries of ""socialism"" and ""communism."" Any argument invoking the words ""God"" or ""moral"" sparks accusations of ""right-wing extremism,"" ""fascism,"" or ""Bible-thumping."" Instead of listening to each other's ideas, we spot the warning label and run the other way. Second, our lifestyles favor knee-jerk reactions. The way we think, work and live in the Digital Age demands we quickly categorize information without investing time into rich interaction, research and understanding. We're hesitant to ask questions because we don't have time to listen to the long, complicated answers that might follow. And we lack the time to fact-check competing claims. In our haste, it's easier to echo our party's position than drill down, questioning whether party leaders are motivated by our best interests or the best interests of their biggest contributors. Third, we tend to listen only to like-minded opinions as media fragmentation encourages us to filter out varying perspectives. If you're a liberal, you avoid FOX News. If you're a conservative you revile MSNBC. The dynamic is even more pronounced online, where a niche media source can be found for any outlook. This silences the opportunity for meaningful dialogue and deliberation that might lead to reformulating positions, forging sustainable compromises, and developing consensus crucial to moving our nation forward on complex issues. So how can we overcome this challenge, starting with the health care debate? How do we open our minds to the possibility that we could actually learn from somebody else? Here's my prescription. For starters, we should eschew the notion that changing our minds is a character flaw. To the contrary, experts believe it's a manifestation of higher intelligence. Renowned psychologist Stuart Sutherland wrote in ""Irrationality,"" his seminal 1992 book: ""The willingness to change one's mind in the light of new evidence is a sign of rationality not weakness."" To further free our minds, we should aggressively treat the three Ls: . Let's lose the labels: from ""flip-flopper"" to ""commie,"" from ""fear-monger"" to ""right-wing nut job."" Trash the diatribe; mull the ideas. Let's engage in some constructive lifestyle management, slowing down to ponder -- and make independent decisions -- as enlightened people. We cannot allow the technological evolution to rob us of the intellectual strides of the American Revolution. We must value the art of listening, reflection, comparative analysis, and civil discourse if we're to make the most of our democracy. In the process, we should signal to leaders that we're willing to expand our horizons beyond party lines. Maybe they'll get in front of our parade, collaborating for a change. Let's request a second opinion and listen to each other. Switch channels. Visit different Web sites. Read a newspaper, while we can still find one. How about stepping into a town hall with an open mind, prepared to converse with people hailing from diverse circumstances? A range of perspectives enriches our viewpoint, empowering us to craft nuanced responses to complex situations. Ultimately, we must stop thinking that the only thing to think is what we've thought all along. As we learn more about multifaceted matters, our positions should evolve accordingly. Let's accept that it's OK to change your minds. In the end, opening our minds can only enhance the prognosis for our most cherished patient: America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.","Rudy Ruiz: It's become unfashionable to have an open mind about issues .

"(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama ""Antichrist."" The mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him. Not a good idea for either of them, as it turns out. Halloween is nearly upon us, but ""Antichrist"" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act. The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called ""Vows of Chastity."" It's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, ""Antichrist"" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named. The prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.) Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman. Of course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against ""Hostel,"" ""Saw"" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably. Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse. It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: ""Chaos reigns!"" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch. This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance. Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked ""You get what you pay for, folks"" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end. That unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more. Beautifully shot by Anthony Dod Mantle and acted with raw conviction, ""Antichrist"" is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less. If you don't believe me, go ask the talking fox. ""Antichrist"" is not rated and runs 104 minutes.

"CIMA, California  -- Driving along a pockmarked road amid rocks and Joshua trees in a lonely southern California desert, religious controversy might be the last thing you'd expect to encounter. A judge ruled the Mojave Cross must be covered until a First Amendment issue can be resolved. And if you don't look too closely, you're likely to zip right past the focus of a hotly contested Supreme Court battle. A federal judge has ordered the Mojave Cross, a war memorial erected by a veterans group 75 years ago, to be covered. It's boxed in plywood. The issue is less about what the cross symbolizes and more about where it sits: In the middle of the Mojave National Preserve, which is government land. The high court on Wednesday will consider whether the display violates the First Amendment's provision for a separation of church and state.  Watch details of the cross case » . More specifically, does an individual who protests the cross have legal standing to take the case to court? Do congressional efforts to minimize the appearance of a constitutional violation carry any weight?  View details on other cases awaiting the Supreme Court » . ""Religion is always very hard fought in the Supreme Court, and this is no exception,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington appellate attorney and co-founder of scotusblog.com. ""A single cross on a single plot of land has given rise to this huge constitutional controversy. The court will look at whether Congress, with a kind of wink and a nod, (can) say that this governmental cross is now on private land or are we (going to) say, no this is a governmental war monument and it has a religious symbol on it."" Riley Bembry, who served as a medic in World War I, helped erect the cross in 1934. It sits on a 4,000-foot plateau and was a place of reflection for many vets who retreated to the desert in part to recover from severe lung diseases caused by mustard gas attacks during the Great War. An annual Easter service is held there, but until recently only locals knew about it. The site is not on any maps.  Watch a video about the Mojave monument » . Bembry never got permission from the government to erect the cross, but for decades nobody seemed to care. He was the caretaker of the memorial for five decades until he died in 1984. In 1994, 1.6 million acres of desert -- including the land with the cross on it -- was transferred to the National Park Service. A few years later, a resident wanted to put up a Buddhist shrine near the cross. The request was denied. Frank Buono, a former deputy superintendent of the preserve, filed a lawsuit with the help of the ACLU, claiming federal officials were acting unfairly. ""He thinks that the government is in effect misappropriating this sacred symbol and trying to give it just a secular meaning,"" said Peter Eliasberg, managing attorney of the ACLU of Southern California. ""It strikes me as sort of odd that it just happens to be in that shape,"" Eliasberg said. ""If what they really wanted to do was have a war memorial, there are hundreds of other shapes that it could be in. ... Mr. Buono does not have an objection to the government having a war memorial there that's in the shape of a soldier, or that's in the shape of the Vietnam memorial."" A federal court ordered the cross removed earlier this decade. A judge ruled that until the dispute is settled the cross had to be covered. In 2001 Congress got involved. Lawmakers prohibited the Park Service from spending federal dollars to remove the display. A year later, they designated the site a national memorial similar to the Washington Monument and Mount Rushmore. More importantly, the Republican-led Congress agreed to transfer one acre of land around the cross in exchange for five private acres inside the preserve. A San Francisco, California-based appeals court turned that offer down, saying it failed to satisfy Constitutional concerns. The land swap ""would leave a little donut hole of land with a cross in the midst of a vast federal preserve"" the court said. The Supreme Court has traditionally taken a case-by-case approach to similar First Amendment cases. Among other things, it has upheld tax exemptions for churches and the mention of ""God"" on U.S. currency.  Test your Supreme Court knowledge » . At the same time, it has banned government-sponsored school prayer and imposed limits on public aid to parochial schools. In 2005, a Ten Commandments monument on the Texas Statehouse grounds was allowed to stand because it was surrounded by historical markers. But the same day, the placement of Ten Commandment parchments in two Kentucky county courthouses was ruled unconstitutional. The high court called them ""a governmental effort substantially to promote religion."" Earlier this year, the justices ruled that a small religious group could not erect a granite monument in a Utah park next to an existing Ten Commandments display. This time, the Obama administration will argue in favor of keeping the cross and allowing the land transfer. The implications of the case could extend beyond the Mojave Cross. Individual gravestones are not at issue, but war memorials have long featured religious imagery. ""There are 5 million veterans that we represent ... would be quite shocked and horrified to know that those memorials and the symbols chosen by vets 75 years or 100 years ago would suddenly have to be torn down by a bulldozer,"" said Hiram Sasser, attorney for the Liberty Legal Institute. Wanda and Henry Sandoz have been taking care of the memorial since Bembry passed away. They shake their heads over the legal fight that will take them to Washington. ""I hope it won't be too long before we can look at the cross again without that stupid box,"" Wanda Sandoz said. ""Yep, really. We'll repaint it,"" Henry Sandoz said. ""I already bought some white paint,"" Wanda Sandoz said.

"(CNN)  -- The Wu-Tang Clan -- the New York hip-hop supergroup that spawned millions of album sales, nine solo acts and a few acting careers -- almost never was.

Method Man, the group's most recognizable voice, was nearly killed before the band formed, Wu-Tang's chief producer, RZA, writes in his forthcoming memoir. Meth was walking to buy marijuana at 160 Park Hill Avenue in Staten Island -- the house in Wu-Tang's ""Protect Ya Neck"" video -- when RZA saw him across the street, he writes in the book. ""Come over here, yo!"" RZA beckoned, according to ""The Tao of Wu"" (Riverhead). ""He stopped and came running over. A few seconds later -- pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! -- a guy started shooting up the front of 160. A buddy of ours, Poppy, an innocent, school-going, nice guy -- he was shot and killed right there.""  Interactive: Where's the Wu been? » . It wasn't the only close call RZA said could have snuffed the band that rewrote the rule book for hip-hop acts. The year before the group formed in 1993, RZA was acquitted on an attempted murder charge that could have put him behind bars for eight years, he writes in ""The Tao of Wu,"" out Thursday. Expanding on the book's anecdotes in an interview with CNN, RZA explained that if he had been imprisoned or if Method Man, aka Clifford Smith, had been killed, the band never would have come to fruition. RZA, whose real name is Robert Diggs and whose stage name is pronounced ""Rizza,"" also talked about his role in the death of his cousin, Russell Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard or ODB. Two days before his 36th birthday in 2004, ODB died in a New York recording studio from an overdose of cocaine and painkillers. RZA writes in the book that he once witnessed ODB force his own son to watch him do drugs. RZA tried to leave, he writes, but ODB wouldn't let him. Now, RZA told CNN, he wishes he would've been tougher with ODB about his drug problem. Following are excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for language, flow and length: . CNN: Could your imprisonment or Method Man's death have derailed Wu-Tang's formation? RZA: Either one of those incidents could definitely have derailed it. Of course, myself being the abbot, the one who came with the idea, if I wouldn't have made it out of that tumultuous time -- it seemed like I wasn't going to make it out of it; there was a lot of odds against me -- but we stood strong, and self-defense made sense to the jury. We beat that ... It was the victory over that incident that made me change my whole direction. In a way, it's double-edged in that incident. One, if I would've lost that, yeah, Wu-Tang wouldn't have happened, but also it's the victory of it that inspired me and gave me the drive also to go and really get serious about Wu-Tang and the things I was dealing with. Same thing with Meth, he always brings it up ... that that day saved his life. He actually said, if it was anybody else calling him, he wouldn't have came. CNN: In the book, you cite lessons from Eastern religions, Christianity, Islam, [Nation of Islam offshoot] Five Percent, numerology, comic books, kung fu, chess. What would you say to someone who says it's difficult to reconcile these dogmas? RZA: Like it says in the Bible, ""In the beginning was the word, and the word became flesh"" -- if we go to the root of the word, we will find that, yeah, everything is similar. Everything is teaching us all the same path. It's just that one religion was good for these people because of their living conditions. In the Quran, they mention paradise being filled with wells, wells of water, and if you're in the desert and you've got a chance to get water and gardens -- as they describe paradise in the holy Quran -- if you're going to get gardens, that's the paradise that fits your situation. ... Everything they're saying relates to the people they're talking to. ... You remove the messenger and take the message. CNN: You say in the book that your penchant for violent lyrics in your younger years ""was a product of my history and environment"" and that it no longer represents you. But you also say you won't repudiate violence. Why not? RZA: One reason I haven't repudiated it is because when it's necessary, it's necessary. [The Bible's] Ecclesiastes tell us there's a time for everything -- a time for war, a time for peace -- so in times for war, there's time for violence. Then in [the Hindu scripture] Bhagavad Gita, it says Arjuna was talking, Arjuna didn't want to commit violent acts against an army that was attacking him. He couldn't find it in his heart to do it. It was people he loved. He didn't want to get into violence, but Krishna had to point out to him, ""Your duty is your duty."" ... So, to me, violence in the light of justice is still violent, but I don't see it the same. It's because of justice that I don't repudiate violence because justice must be served somehow. CNN: ODB was a product of his environment as well. To what degree were you and other Wu-Tang members responsible for his death? RZA: The guys would say it's more me than them because they say that's my cousin and I was right there. If you let a man that you love or anybody -- man, woman or child that you love -- sit there and destroy themselves in front of you, you're neglecting them ... Everybody let him do what he wanted to do. ... There were times when I took his drugs and threw them down the toilet. When I do that, he would get so pissed off I don't see him for weeks after that. ... So it got to a point, I was like, ""[expletive] it, let him do his drugs"" just to have him around me, just to keep him there. ... But it's still neglect, yo. CNN: You say you ran Wu-Tang like a dictatorship in its first five years. I know you and Raekwon have had creative differences and Ghostface Killah is suing you over royalties. Ever regret the dictatorship approach? RZA: I don't regret it because it got us to the power we are. ... To me, in the beginning, the dictatorship led us to such a strong foundation that even though Wu-Tang seemed to be crumbling, it didn't fall because of the root foundation of one man's idea. But now as it's coming back together -- we're living in the twilight age of it right now -- it's still surviving because of the democracy of it. CNN: Wu-Tang is still around, but nothing like the heyday of the 1990s. Will we ever see a renaissance? RZA: Well, to me, Wu-Tang is beyond Wu-Tang Clan. ... It's just like hip-hop is beyond Grandmaster Flash, but Grandmaster Flash was one of the first guys to hit those turntables like that. ... The same thing with Wu-Tang. You'll see the difference in hip-hop from the moment we came in to before we came in. We changed it. We changed the whole structure. CNN: Have you accomplished everything you've set out to accomplish? RZA: I'm me and the me that's me is me and is going to continue to be me, and it's always reaching and growing. I'm grateful for what I've accomplished. I'm grateful for anyone who thinks I accomplished something and says, ""Well he did this; he did that."" I'm proud to be accepted, but I feel like I've just scratched the surface for some weird reason.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- With strong sales and equally powerful praise, the July issue of Italian Vogue can be judged a resounding success. Chanel Iman is one of several models of color featured in the ""Black Issue"" of Italian Vogue. Dubbed the ""Black Issue,"" the magazine celebrates models of color from the past and present, including Donyale Luna, Liya Kebede, Naomi Campbell, Iman and Chanel Iman. Within 72 hours, the magazine sold out in the United States and Great Britain. Blog posts and e-mails about the beauty and historical significance of the issue began to flow -- and industry insiders were equally pleased. Praising renowned photographer Steven Meisel, who shot most of the issue's fashion pictures, The New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn gushed, ""I think they are some of the best he's done. ... They are crazily, softly beautiful, plainly the work of someone who knows women and fashion.""  See what all the fuss is about » . Another 40,000 copies of the ""Black Issue"" were recently reprinted to meet the still strong demand. But will the all the hoopla translate into tangible change for black models in the fashion industry? Will more color be seen on the runway and in magazines? Many observers have their fingers crossed. ""All the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that it's OK to use more black girls,"" said Carlos Ojeda, an agent at New York Models. ""It's OK to have more than just one, and she doesn't have to always be Naomi."" ""Italian Vogue is very influential around the world on an artistic level,"" said Constance White, style director at eBay. ""That is the book that all the art directors, the photographers, any fashion editor looking for inspiration turns to ... and always has. It has always been the trendsetter, so hopefully people will look at it and say using black models is both relevant and right and will start doing it too."" Bethann Hardison, a legendary model agent-manager, said she has noticed a shift in the industry since she began holding town hall meetings last September to address the lack of diversity in fashion. The packed-to-the-rafters events quickly became the talk of the industry, and Hardison is widely credited with sparking the current movement. ""I started seeing more black models on the runway back in February,"" she said, pointing to the shows of designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Michael Kors as examples. ""I have already seen change, and I know that I will continue to see change."" Not all are nearly as optimistic, and fear the diversity issue will become as passe as the skinny-model debate of a few years ago. ""I hate to sound cynical, but by January, I feel like it will be back to business as usual,"" Ojeda said. ""I want to be hopeful and positive, but a part of me does not want to get my hopes up."" ""Let's see if Italian Vogue is going to be able to live up to the standards that they've now set,"" added one prominent New York-based stylist. ""You can't have an issue with all black girls, pat yourself on the back and say 'that's it for the year.' "" Hardison is working hard to make sure that doesn't happen. She's already scheduled another town hall meeting for September, and she's also planning a mixer to introduce fledgling models of color to industry players. ""We just have to keep the bar high,"" Hardison said, ""and keep showing beautiful women and pictures.""

"(CNN) -- Enough Afghan opium to supply world demand for two years has effectively gone missing, with the Taliban suspected of stockpiling supplies in a bid to corner the market, the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has revealed. Pakistani customs officials destroy contraband narcotics on the border with Afghanistan. Afghanistan is the world's leading narcotics supplier. Earlier this month, a U.N. study revealed Afghanistan's opium production had dropped dramatically this year partly because of new aggressive drug-fighting tactics in the country. According to the UNODC report, production dipped by 10 percent this year while cultivation fell by 22 percent. However, a senior U.N. spokesman warned that this positive news should be treated with caution. ""We figure the world needs around 4,000 tons of opium a year for licit and illicit purposes,"" Walter Kemp of the UNODC told CNN. Has enough empasis been placed on drug trafficking? ""But this year around 6,900 tons was produced, with 7,700 tons delivered last year and more than 8,500 the year before that.  Map showing where Afghan opium is going » . ""So if the world only needs around 4,000 tons of opium and a further 1,000 is seized, where is the rest of it going?"" According to Kemp, world demand for opium remains stable yet prices are not crashing, which suggests a large amount of opium is being withheld from the market. ""Our guess is that around 12,000 tons of opium has been stockpiled somewhere -- not all in one place but in and around Afghanistan,"" he added. ""So while production might be coming down -- mostly because of market reasons -- there's still a lot of product around to satisfy demand for about two years."" It is unclear exactly who is responsible for this but there's growing evidence, according to the U.N., that the Taliban are becoming increasingly involved in the industry and could be sitting on huge stockpiles of opium to use as credit for financing their activities. ""Farmers will be keeping small amounts back as credit for things such as a dowry or buying livestock,"" said Kemp. ""But they won't have the means to store supplies in the kind of quantities we're talking about here. ""It's probably in the hands of people with the ability to store it underground and to keep people away from it through corruption or force."" Hakan Demirbuken, a research expert on the U.N.'s Afghan Opium Trade Program, said Taliban involvement in the drugs trade is not limited to taxing Afghan opium farmers and traders in return for their ""protection."" He told CNN: ""Last year we estimated that Afghan poppy farmers earned around $730 million, while traders who take the product on to the border earned around $3.4 billion."" ""From this lucrative business the Taliban took around $125 million in tax. ""But according to U.N. figures they need around $800 million per year for their operational needs."" However, most of the trade is controlled by organized criminal groups from outside Afghanistan. Therefore Demirbuken believes groups such as the Taliban and al Qaeda will be forging links with criminal gangs in order to become more involved in the production and trafficking stages. In addition to the increased revenue greater involvement would provide, he said groups such as al Qaeda ""will have noted the destabilizing effect this industry -- and the sums of money it generates -- can have on more vulnerable countries with weak governments."" In October last year, the United States told NATO members that the drug trade was a threat to coalition troops because there was a direct connection between it and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. ""There is what we call a nexus of insurgency. There's a very broad range of militant groups that are combined with the criminality, with the narco-trafficking system, with corruption, that form a threat and a challenge to the future of that great country,"" then-U.S. commander in Afghanistan Gen. David McKiernan told reporters. As a result NATO combat forces have now been actively attacking militants, drug laboratories and buildings connected to insurgents with ties to drug lords for the first time since the start of the Afghan conflict in 2001. Meanwhile, international law enforcement organization, Interpol, believes there has been a change of tactic involving Afghanistan's opium, with much more of it being turned into heroin within the country and stockpiled or couriered out, primarily through Iran. Historically Afghanistan has been responsible only for cultivating raw opium, with the conversion into a final product taking place across the border in Pakistan or in Iran and Turkey, according to the UNODC. Producing heroin in Afghanistan makes it easier to conceal and transport than the bulkier raw opium.","Recent study revealed Afghan opium production has dropped dramatically .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When they set sail from harbor most yachtsmen leave only their worries behind. But when Hilary Lister goes out to sea, she sheds an entire way of life. Hilary Lister says she feels ""a thousand times"" more free when she sails. The 36-year-old Briton is a quadriplegic who can only move her head, eyes and mouth and needs to rely on carers for almost every need. In spite of these restrictions she became the first disabled woman to sail solo around Britain Monday scoring a victory against the rare degenerative illness she has suffered from since age 11. The inventive technology behind her voyage is called ""sip and puff"" -- a system of three pneumatic straws positioned near Lister's mouth that allow her to control the boat through a series of semaphore-like commands she can give by either blowing or sucking through the straws. Developed by a Canadian engineer, the system let Lister alter course and trim the sails of her 20ft long keel boat to complete the record-breaking trip over two summers. Lister's passion for sailing is all-consuming and, considering what it has given her, unsurprising. ""When you leave the quayside, you leave behind the stresses of everyday life,"" she told CNN. ""Any sailor will tell you that. ""If you multiply that sense of freedom a thousand times, that's how I feel. I leave behind my wheelchair, a team of carers and suddenly it's just me."" An Oxford University graduate and talented sportswoman in her youth, by 2003 Hilary's illness had laid her so low she was a virtual recluse, never leaving the home she shared with her husband Clifford, and by her own admission deeply depressed. A friend suggested she go to Westbere Sailing. The center specializes in helping disabled people on to the water, but Hilary almost never made the 20-minute trip from her home near Canterbury in southern England. ""I was ill and running a temperature and I was about to cancel it, but something stopped me from backing out,"" she said. She credits the decision to go to the center with saving her life. ""[The staff]treated me like an intelligent, capable person and not like an object to be pitied,"" she said. Her illness is called reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It makes it difficult for her to breathe -- the media interviews she has done since her latest achievement have exhausted her, she said. It also puts her in near-constant agony, a situation that is only manageable with the use of powerful drugs. Despite these hardships, or perhaps because of them, Hilary has no fear when she is out at sea. Her aim is to help other disabled people feel empowered in the same way and to that end she has set up her own charity, Hilary's Dream Trust. The charity exists to provide assistance to disabled and disadvantaged adults who dream of sailing. ""It is difficult to do all the press, my diaphragm is in a bad way and I get tired easily with the interviews. But I want people to know my story because it's important they realize disabled people can accomplish anything, given the right tools."" Her own accomplishment she began last summer with the help of a support boat and a specially adapted motor home that she returned to after each day's sailing to recuperate. Last August she was forced to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and strong winds. She took up the gauntlet again in May and was rewarded with some transcendent moments. ""When I was in the Irish Sea I saw something that looked like a blow hole on my starboard side,"" she said. ""I wasn't sure what I'd seen then suddenly out of the water this huge whale emerged like an Exocet missile. Next thing a pod of them -- we think they were humpbacks -- were all around my boat. ""I remember thinking, 'I wonder if this is safe' but I was enjoying the moment so much. It was so exhilarating.""","Hilary Lister has become the first disabled woman to sail around Britain .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Seven emergency medics in England have been suspended from work for playing an Internet game that involves being photographed lying down in unusual places.

"LEONE, American Samoa (CNN) -- Another earthquake struck Wednesday near the Samoan islands, an area already devastated by earthquake and tsunami damage which killed more than 130 people. A traditional Samoan fale is destroyed Wednesday in the devastated village of Leone. The 5.5-magnitude earthquake occurred at 6:13 p.m. Wednesday evening (1:13 a.m. Thursday ET), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake's epicenter was 10 km (6 miles) deep in the Pacific Ocean about 121 miles (194 km) from the city of Apia, Samoa. The quake did not trigger a tsunami warning, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. It followed an 8.0-magnitude earthquake which hit the small cluster of Samoan islands early Tuesday triggering a tsunami. At least 139 people are confirmed dead as a consequence of Tuesday's quake and tsunami. They include 22 people killed in American Samoa, 110 in Samoa and seven in Tonga, according to officials on the islands.

"Aboard the Tea Party Express (CNN) -- From the stage, Deborah Johns is the angry conscience of the tea party movement. A protester uses a Nazi swastika to make a point at a Tea Party Express stop in Dallas, Texas. ""Question everything your government is doing,"" she tells a crowd of about 100 from the bus's stage in the parking lot of the Winners casino in Winnemucca, Nevada. Under a setting sun on the steps of the state capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, Johns says: ""Our men and women took an oath when they put on the uniform to defend and protect this country from enemies both foreign and domestic. I think we've got some domestic enemies in the White House."" On a sunny afternoon in Louisville, Kentucky, Johns works the crowd of about 2,000 into a frenzy. ""The men and women in our military didn't fight and die for this country for a communist in the White House,"" she says, and the crowd erupts in a chant of ""U-S-A, U-S-A!""  Watch rally participants converge on Washington » . On the bus, Johns slips off her heels and slips on a pair of ankle socks. She curls up under a quilt her grandmother made. She favors skirts and cardigans -- a pit bull in cashmere. She leads the rallies in each city with Mark Williams, a former talk radio host who now writes books and makes the rounds on cable TV chat shows. Both work for Our Country Deserves Better, the conservative political action committee sponsoring the Tea Party Express bus tour. The tour concluded Saturday at the U.S. Capitol in Washington after a 34-stop tour that began August 28 in Sacramento, California. Williams is the showman of the bunch. His signature line when he gets the mic goes like this: ""You can have our country when you pry it from our ... cold ... dead ... fingers!"" Again the crowd erupts.  Watch scenes from Tea Party Express rallies » . Seldom seen on stage are the two gurus of the tea party movement, veteran politico Sal Russo and his protégé, Joe Wierzbicki. They are charged with turning the passion on display at the tea parties into political action. They have three goals: Defeat President Obama's health care reform efforts, win back the House and Senate in 2010 and take the White House in 2012. Russo grew up in a house full of working-class Democrats in Monterey, California, and nearly gave his father a heart attack when he became a Republican. His first paid gig in politics was working for Ronald Reagan's 1966 California gubernatorial campaign, and he has worked in conservative politics ever since. Russo often watches the raucous tea party events from his perch in the bus. Besides Johns and Williams each event features several musical acts and featured speakers. The crowd is its own sideshow. Tea partyers are a creative lot, and many in the crowd express themselves by way of their clothing and signs.  See some of the getups and signs » . ""Obamacare Condense Cream of Crap soup"" reads a sign in Sparks, Nevada. In Dallas, Texas, a darker mood prevails. A homemade sign with ""Obama Lies"" features a bold, black swastika. As the tour moves on, Nazi imagery becomes more prominent -- and sometimes confused. One sign at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, has Obama's portrait sandwiched between pictures of Adolf Hitler and communist philosopher Karl Marx. In Canton,Ohio, Obama and Hitler adorn a sign reading ""Hitler made great speeches, too."" In Elko, Nevada, over a Basque supper of oxtail, lamb and sweetbreads, Russo assesses the tea party movement. ""There are some people who are mad at everyone,"" he says, ""but there are others who say, 'How do we move beyond this and turn it into action?'"" Rare is the conversation with Russo in which he doesn't bring up the name of his idol and one-time boss, Ronald Reagan. But if there is a Reagan out there to take the reins of the tea party movement, Russo doesn't know who that person is. ""It's opened for a leader. I don't see anyone out there that can grab it,"" he says. ""I'll be surprised if someone emerges. I don't see who that is."" Many in the crowd hope former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will emerge as the leader of the movement, ""but she has so many negatives,"" Russo says. If the tea party movement has an architect, it is Joe Wierzbicki. Unassuming in wrinkled khakis and a polo shirt, he is in near perpetual motion. Hands gesturing wildly through the air, he describes his plan. ""There are going to be stops along the way. The first stop is going to be the health care reform act,"" he says. If the tea partyers can play a part in stopping the president's health care efforts they will be poised for a much bigger challenge: taking control of Congress from the Democrats, he says. ""Those politicians that aren't responsive to this message are going to face a lot of trouble in their re-election bids in 2010,"" he says. That the tea party movement has no leader at this point is just fine with Wierzbicki. He says right now the movement is centered on a few key issues: taxes, expansion and distrust of Obama. ""If there was a leader there might be a divisive factor,"" he says. In Wierzbicki's plan, the movement doesn't need a leader until after the 2010 election. ""From then to 2012 is probably the period of time when you'll find a big national leader that will emerge that the majority of the people in this movement will feel comfortable following,"" he says. No one on the tea party express seems concerned with the vocal fringe of the crowds that come with offensive signs -- besides Nazi imagery, a poster of Obama as an African witch doctor has become popular -- or the numerous conspiracy theories that float around most tea parties. In Battle Creek, Michigan, a woman in her 60s says, ""I really don't want to be a guinea pig for the experiment they have with the population control."" In Canton, Ohio, a woman argues with an Obama supporter: ""He's going after our kids to try to indoctrinate them into a national defense army."" The Tea Party Express tour has been free of violence, but occasional outbursts of vitriolic hatred toward the president combined with some menacing outward appearances often overshadow the more moderate tea partyers. iReport.com: Weigh in on health care . In Louisville, Kentucky, two young men in camouflage fatigues roamed the crowd trying to recruit new members for their militia called the Ohio Valley Freedom Fighters. They bear signs reading ""AK-47s: today's pitchfork"" and ""Quit worrying. Start your militia training today."" In Jackson, Michigan, a young man didn't need a sign. He was carrying the real thing: A loaded AK-47 assault rifle and two loaded handguns. ""I don't want a revolution. I don't want a civil war,"" he said. ""But it is a possibility. It's there as an option, as a last resort."" From the stage, Deborah Johns and Mark Williams never interact with most of these characters. Russo shrugs it off, saying that the early stages of every political movement have people like this. To Wierzbicki these troubling elements are just part of the price of a grassroots movement. He is convinced they will not derail the movement. ""The message will be moderated by the time it gets to 2010,"" he says.","Tea Party Express bus tour concludes Saturday at U.S. Capitol .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It may look like an air mattress you might see lying around next to a swimming pool but in reality its function couldn't be less trivial. The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin could play a major role in saving lives in the developing world. The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin (SWDT) -- a new portable water purifier -- could be a major step forward in the fight against disease and mortality in the Third World. Eric Olsen, a San Francisco-based architect and the inventor of the SWDT believes the product could help eradicate the scourge of polluted water which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate claims over 1.5 million lives every year. Not only does it purify water -- up to 20 liters -- it makes it more portable in large quantities -- a vital dual role in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central Asia where access to clean water is often scarce. ""There are lots of products that do one or the other,"" Olsen told CNN. ""There's a really interesting product that's been around for 10 or 12 years called the Hippo Water Roller -- a 20 gallon drum with a handle attached that allows people -- mostly women -- to transport a week's worth of water back home"". Olsen also points to another product developed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) that has successfully tackled water impurities. According to Eawag SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection Process) is already used by more than two million in over 30 countries. ""The idea of SWDT,"" he says, ""is to combine these two products and make them into something that can do both roles effectively"". Made out of a top layer of recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a bottom layer of durable rubberized nylon, the SWDT is both flexible and robust. Its design was morphologically inspired by the saguaro cactus and is adaptable to a variety of situations -- as a wrap to carry or placed on the roof of a mud hut -- and is easy to store. The SWDT uses passive solar radiation -- a water sterilizing method approved by WHO -- which disrupts the reproduction of microorganisms. Heat and UVA radiation from the sun pass through the LDPE layer and into the water cavity and are reflected back by the bottom layer of nylon. On a sunny day purification takes five hours. Olsen admits that its performance is hampered by its low density -- scratches to the surface mean it doesn't transmit the sun's rays as effectively -- but he is confident that this can be overcome with more research. Production using a Radio Frequency Welding equipment may be relatively expensive but Olsen says that the raw materials are cheap and the labor is inexpensive. ""We are trying to imagine ways that this thing can be made and repaired by people where it is most needed,"" he said. ""We are working on a sheet welding process which is much lower tech, inexpensive and also capitalizes on the handcraft skills of local people"". What started out as a solo effort a little over a year ago has gradually grown into a collaborative project. Olsen's students at the California College of Arts, where he currently teaches -- he moves to a new post at Woodbury University this fall -- have lent their enthusiasm and experts from the bioscience and textile industries are increasingly coming on board. Olsen's efforts have already been recognized. The SWDT won first prize in the 2008 Next Generation Design Competition run by Metropolis Magazine -- netting him $10,000 -- and he is waiting for conformation that the invention has been selected for Wired Magazine's Next Fest show which takes place in Chicago later this year. So what next for Olsen and his invention? The aim is to adapt the original design and turn it from a water carrying wrap into a fully fledged coat and he's also looking at ways the material might be redrawn as a tent. He's currently in the process of trying to qualify for non-profit status. And with the likes of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other institutions out there, he thinks the prospects for funding development and deployment look promising.","The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin aims to reduces disease and death .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Fires in central and southern California raged Saturday as triple-digit temperatures mixed with dry conditions continued to fuel the flames, torching thousands of acres and threatening scores of homes. Firefighters look on as fire rages near Ocean View Drive in Los Angeles on Saturday. Authorities confirmed three civilian injuries from a growing blaze known as the Station fire burning through the Angeles National Forest-La Canada Flintridge. The blaze nearly quadrupled in size from 5,500 acres Friday to more than 20,000 acres, officials said. The blaze, which grew to more than 20,100 acres, was 5 percent contained early Sunday, officials said. It was upgraded to type 1 brush fire -- the most severe classification. ""Today what happened is what I called a perfect storm of fuels, weather and topography coming together ... essentially the fire burned at will,"" Mike Dietrich of the U.S. Forest Service said Saturday. Authorities consider the Station fire an anomaly, as it is not driven by strong winds as most California wildfires.  Watch CNN's Reynolds Wolf explain what's driving the fire » . ""The fire has been very active on all fronts,"" U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Randi Jorgensen said. The fire threatened about 10,000 homes in Los Angeles County and 900 homes were evacuated, she said.  Watch close-up views of the fast-moving fire » . ""Basically, all the homes that back up to the National Forest in the La Canada-Flintridge are in danger from the fire,"" Jorgensen said, adding that fire officials have told residents to be prepared for possible evacuation orders.

That blaze was about 10 percent contained Friday evening. Hemet is about 85 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Firefighters fully contained another fire that torched 230 acres about 20 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles on Friday. The blaze, called the Palos Verdes fire, forced 1,200 people to evacuate and destroyed five homes and two other buildings. Another fire in the Angeles National Forest had burned more than 2,100 acres. The blaze, called the Morris fire, started Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Villagers march more than 300 kilometers from northwest Cambodia to ask the prime minister to save their homes from developers. Some 400 families in the country's south learn their farmland had been given to developers only when bulldozers arrive. Villagers in northwest Cambodia set court documents on fire in protest over a land dispute. Such examples of forced evictions and land conflicts are cited by the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee (CHRAC) in a report, ""Losing Ground,"" released Thursday. The report was a collection of voices from people rarely heard and ""present a painful look into the lives of people affected by forced evictions and intimidation, mainly the rural poor,"" said CHRAC, a network of 21 non-governmental organizations. ""The voices in the report belong to Cambodians who have been or are facing eviction. Most have insisted that their names and photographs be used, believing that openness will bring justice and appropriate solutions,"" the group said, adding that such trust is ""the springboard for the next stage of Cambodia's recovery from decades of civil strife."" An estimated 150,000 Cambodians live at risk of forced eviction, Amnesty International said in its 2008 report on the country. Read about AIDS patients who were resettled to an isolated area . Beng Hong Socheat Khemro, deputy director general of Cambodia's Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction, said the government was committed to finding the best solutions for not just squatters, but the entire population, and that it is drafting legal guidelines on squatter resolution. He also said the government rejected the term forced evictions, saying that meant people were forced off land they legally owned. He noted that various factors affect land use and ownership in the country: The 1970s ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge regime abolished all legal and regulatory documents regarding land, strong economic growth has contributed to demand for land, particularly in urban areas, and the pace of urbanization has stepped up in recent years. ""Many people illegally occupy land that does not belong to them,"" he said, later noting: ""What has happened now with the resettlement, or the relocation, of people is the fact that the government is implementing the law."" ""I am very sure that those who claim to be on the land before the legal land owner, most of them do not have any proof at all,"" he said. ""Most of the cases that people -- illegal squatters, settlers -- have claimed that they have been on that land since, let's say 1979, are not true. If you study the legal development of Cambodia, you will understand, and not many people understand, including the NGOs (non-governmental organizations) themselves."" Amnesty said poor Cambodians share the plight of many impoverished people around the world. The group cited the forced evictions of thousands in Angola, violence and insecurity in Brazil's shantytowns, and social services denied to Roma in Italy. ""There are more than 200,000 such communities, home to 1 billion people around the world,"" the group said. ""In Cambodia for the last two years, Amnesty International has been focusing on forced evictions as one of the country's most serious human rights violations today,"" Amnesty said in a statement on CHRAC's report. ""The increasing number of land disputes, land confiscations, and industrial and urban redevelopment projects hurt almost exclusively people living in poverty."" People fighting evictions ""experience harassment at the hands of the authorities or people hired by private businesses. The rich and powerful are increasingly abusing the criminal justice system to silence communities taking a stand against land concessions or other opaque business deals affecting the land they live on or cultivate,"" Amnesty said. CHRAC said development of Cambodia, recovering from the Khmer Rouge genocide and ensuing decades of conflict, ""must not negatively affect"" people's lives. ""Our communities are losing land and natural resources. These are the resources that people have depended on for generations,"" CHRAC said. The report details evictions across the country. One group of villagers walked from the rice bowl of Battambang in the northwest to Phnom Penh to deliver a letter to Prime Minister Hun Sen, seeking help in two long-running court fights with businessmen who claim to own a total of 200 hectares of their land. ""We didn't have enough money to get the bus to Phnom Penh. We had to walk. It was our last hope. We had to see Hun Sen or we would lose our land,"" said Chim Sarom, 45. They delivered their letter, but Sarom said they were unsure whether he ever got it. She said authorities gave them money to go home and were told an official would visit them. ""No government official ever came to our village. If we have to, maybe we will walk again,"" she said.","Cambodian human rights network releases report on forced evictions .

"THE EVERGLADES, Florida (CNN) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida's Everglades. The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular. Reptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades. ""The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,"" he said. Wasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed. And breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs. They are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say. The travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading. ""It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,"" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python. Volunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons. A ""Python Patrol"" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find. ""The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,"" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys. It is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners. ""These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,"" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle. The state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski. Twenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure. What Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move. When he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed. On one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him. Finally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. ""Yeah, baby! Hee ha! Look at the size of this one,"" he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck. He got out and picked up the brownish-green snake, which immediately coiled around his arm. ""This isn't a big one,"" he said, but as he got a closer look, he did not deny that it was a good one: ""At least 12 [feet.]"" Wasilewski has a soft spot for these species, and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them. He says it is not the snakes' fault that they ended up in the Everglades, but he acknowledges the problems they are causing on the Florida ecosystem and the need to do something. ""One down, 100,000 to go,"" he said.","Florida Everglades are perfect place for Burmese pythons to live and breed .

"Editor's note: We asked readers to weigh in on CNN.com Live producer Jarrett Bellini's vacation destination, and you chose South Africa. Check back for updates on his trip. Giraffes are a common sight in Kruger National Park. KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (CNN) -- I spent two nights sleeping under a full-moon sky, nestled in my trusty hammock at Kruger National Park. Our guides provided us with tents, but I figured I wouldn't have too many opportunities in my life to slumber in the open bush on the African continent. Thus, I rested more or less exposed throughout the night, hoping that a lion wouldn't figure that he wouldn't have too many opportunities in his life to maul a sleeping American tourist in the open bush on the African continent. Needless to say, I survived, and it was magnificent. Visually speaking, I wasn't sure what, exactly, to expect from a South African safari, for my complete mental database of safari images spanned a wide variety of distinct landscapes, and most were cartoonishly obstructed by rich, middle-aged tourists covered head to toe in unnecessary beige safari gear. However, Kruger National Park seemed to fit, quite perfectly, my idea of the African savannah. Arid and brown from the winter dry season, it was a forever-long expanse of low trees and dusty earth, the kind that somehow allows the early sun to reflect that perfect glow of stunning reds and oranges.  See the animals » . Our guide was a self-proclaimed African bushman named Elson, who seemed to have an amazing one-ness with both the land and the animals. We'd be driving down one of the many nondescript dirt roads at a fairly fast pace, only to have him hit the brakes of our jeep, slam into reverse and point out a leopard 200 yards away. It would take the rest of us a fair bit of time to finally see what he noticed at a mere passing glance. He knew the land, and he knew the animals -- a talent that proved helpful for finding the less common residents in the savannah. The other creatures carelessly came into view as though the roads and cars were just a natural part of their habitat, a mild annoyance at worst. iReport.com: Share your South Africa experiences and suggestions . Kruger National Park is roughly the same size as Israel, and here, many animals roamed right along the roadside, gnawing on whatever vegetation remained until the rainy season would flourish the plants anew. Seemingly endless miles of terrain, and there they were just feet away from us. If you didn't know you were in a national park, you might think you were in a zoo. That's how close the animals came to our jeep. Only, here, they weren't in separate enclosures, wandering aimlessly within an artificial terrain. This was truly their home, and we were only passing guests. Giraffes tore away at high branches. Elephants walked fearlessly, one-by-one across the road. Rhinos ... well, the rhinos pretty much just sat there looking stupid. But the zebras frolicked. The hippos splashed in the water. And the baboons stopped at nothing to make me laugh. Of course, the rare lions and leopards pretty much just shaded themselves under distant trees, and the crocs swam silently through the bog. But they were there. And we were there. And it was beautiful. And just as soon as it began, our time in the South African bush was over. A couple of giraffes and elephants met us by the roadside to bid our group farewell as we drove out of the park. The preserve faded silently behind us, and the road ahead paved my way to Swaziland for a short stopover before continuing to the second part of this South African journey.","CNN.com's Jarrett Bellini is traveling in South Africa .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- While President Obama takes plenty of heat over his plans to overhaul domestic policies, critics have also taken aim at his foreign policy approach, particularly as it relates to human rights around the globe. Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski says Obama should have met with the Dalai Lama. Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski said Wednesday that while the administration appeared to have ""gotten the balance right"" on Myanmar, the military junta-ruled Asian nation formerly known as Burma, by starting a dialogue while maintaining sanctions, ""China is a different matter."" ""And that's where we've seen the tension play out in the most acute way, with several signals that have been sent suggesting that the administration is putting human rights issues to one side,"" Malinowski said on CNN's ""Amanpour."" ""And most recently, the, I think, symbolic mistake of the president declining to meet the Dalai Lama before his own visit to China later next month.""  Watch the discussion » . The Tibetan spiritual leader, who fled to India in 1959 and established a government in exile there, visited the United States earlier this month. China considers Tibet a renegade province and accuses the Dalai Lama of inciting violence. The timing of a presidential meeting with the Dalai Lama is considered largely symbolic, and Malinowski said the president's delay ""sent a message to the Chinese government that perhaps this isn't as high a priority for the United States as it has been in the past."" Malinowski also criticized the U.S. special envoy to Sudan, retired Air Force Maj. J. Scott Gration, who had suggested wooing the Sudanese government with ""cookies"" and ""gold stars, smiley faces, handshakes, agreements, talk, engagement"" to change its attitude about Darfur, where genocide and famine have killed hundreds of thousands of people. ""It's a really dumb thing to say,"" said Malinowski, who previously served in the administration of President Clinton. ""Governments like this, they are not children, and they do not react to cookies and gold stars,"" he said. ""They act on their interests, and historically, as you know from Bosnia, to all the places where we have successfully defeated this kind of violence, governments respond to pressure."" Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, a candidate for re-election next year, has been indicted on war-crimes charges by the International Criminal Court. Despite Gration's comments, the Obama administration has not yet articulated a Sudan policy. But Louise Arbour, president of the International Crisis Group and a former U.N. human rights commissioner, told ""Amanpour"" that talking rather than pressuring governments over human rights can be beneficial. ""If you have a policy of engagement, which I think very much is the one put forward by the Obama administration, you may give an impression that you're softening,"" said Arbour, who is also a former war crimes prosecutor. ""It's very easy to look tough, right? You don't talk to anybody, you repudiate everything, you slam all the doors and you accomplish nothing, or very little. And we have a lot of precedence for that. ""When you have a policy of reinforcing diplomatic initiatives, engagement, it may look soft, because you have to put on the table a multiplicity of issues, not just a single one. But on balance, I think there's more chance on some of these ... all important initiatives than just by looking tough and achieving nothing."" Arbour added, however, that the engagement approach to human rights abuses will not create fast change from the abusive regimes. Noting the glacial pace of transformation in Myanmar, where democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been held under house arrest for nearly two decades, Arbour said ""it's going to be very slow."" ""You can't have 20 years of extremely adversarial, confrontational posturing, and then say, well, we're ready to talk and be friendly, and assume that the other side's going to roll over,"" she said. ""It's just not going to work that way."" ""There have to be very slow processes, but I think Aung San Suu Kyi herself has been encouraging more engagement. She wants to have contact with the junta and with foreigners, and it's happening. These are small steps. They're certainly in the right direction.""","Good start in Myanmar, China problematic, says Human Rights Watch official .

"(CNN) -- A videotape on a Russian Web site allegedly showing a State Department employee having sex with a prostitute is a ""smear campaign"" meant to discredit the man, a State Department spokesman said Thursday. The State Department has said the tape allegedly showing an employee having sex with a prostitute is a fake. The employee, Brendan Kyle Hatcher, denied any encounter with a prostitute to his superiors at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, another State Department official said. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, ""supports"" Hatcher, who remains at his job at the embassy. Hatcher had previously worked in the sensitive area of religious and human rights in Russia, the spokesman said. ""Mr. Hatcher ... enjoys the full confidence of Ambassador Beyrle and fully intends to serve out the rest of his tour in Moscow,"" Kelly said at an afternoon briefing at the State Department. The United States ""deplores this type of campaign and use of the Internet to smear a foreign service officer of good standing,"" he added.  Watch why the U.S. says the tape is doctored » . Beyrle was unequivocal in expressing his support in an interview with ABC News. ""Kyle Hatcher has done nothing wrong,"" he said. ""Clearly, the video we saw was a montage of lot of different clips, some of them which are clearly fabricated."" A senior State Department official said, ""It's a doctored tape and a set-up designed to implicate someone working as a liaison with religious and human rights groups in Russia."" The official said Hatcher, who is married, ""was approached by Russians; they tried to blackmail him, but he did everything correctly,"" reporting the incident to his supervisors at the Embassy. The tape then appeared on the tabloid newspaper Web site Compromat.ru and was picked up by other outlets. Diplomatic sources who declined to be named said Compromat.ru has a history of ties to Russia's security services. Russia's Foreign Ministry had no comment when asked about the video. Another senior State Department official, who has seen the video, said ""it's clear to me that it's him,"" referring to portions showing Hatcher alone in the hotel room. ""But then the lights go down,"" and the footage from there on is faked, that official said. The video of Hatcher in the hotel room was taken last year, ""somewhere in Siberia,"" said the senior State Department official who watched the video. It was shot in a hotel that Hatcher visited, the official said. When questioned about the possible motivation for creating the video, the official said it's presumed ""it was done because of his human rights work,"" in Russia. The official doubted the incident will have any effect on U.S.-Russian relations and noted that the Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry have both been ""very cooperative"" in the months since the footage came to light. ""The vast majority of people there are working toward better relations,"" the official said. Another official said Hatcher is a ""great officer"" who, until last summer, was a political reporting officer focusing on religious freedom issues in Russia. The assignment lasts two years: one year in that specialty and a year on the visa-issuing line at the embassy. Last year, this official said, Hatcher was the lead officer compiling the State Department's Religious Freedom report and was given an award for his work by the ambassador. Another official confirmed that Hatcher received a meritorious honor award in 2009 and a group award in 2008. Hatcher, one official said, worked with religious groups that are considered ""outside the mainstream"" in Russia, such as Protestants and non-Christians. Such faiths often face official and unofficial discrimination in the largely Russian-Orthodox society. Another senior State Department official said, ""there is a lot of inertia"" among some special security services in Russia. ""They are pretty much unreconstructed,"" he said. The security services may have wanted to compromise Hatcher's ability to work with religious groups, he says, ""or they may have wanted to throw a stick into the spokes"" of the U.S.-Russia relationship. ""Some in Moscow,"" he said, ""are looking to integrate with the West, and others are trying to stop that."" The officials asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

"(CNN) -- The Academy-Award winning British producer and (briefly) Columbia Pictures head David Puttnam used to have a placard on the wall of his office. It read: ""Hello, he lied."" In ""The Invention of Lying,"" Ricky Gervais plays a ""loser"" in a society that tells only the truth. Lies are second nature in Hollywood, or maybe even first nature, so it's not surprising that the breathtakingly simple but bewilderingly original idea underpinning the new movie from ""The Office"" creator Ricky Gervais came from an industry neophyte, Gervais's co-writer and co-director, Matthew Robinson. The idea? In a world in which everyone always speaks the truth -- in which no one has ever so much as considered deceit, flattery, hyperbole, hiring an illegal maid or under-declaring their taxable returns -- what status, fame and fortune would fall to the first man to realize the power of fabrication? Appropriately, Gervais' character, Mark Bellison, works in the film biz as a screenwriter. But this being a society in which fiction has yet to be invented, his job consists of penning historical lectures that will then be read aloud to the moviegoing public by the on-screen narrator. Mark has drawn the short straw with the 14th century (no one wants to hear about the Black Death), and he's about to be fired, as his secretary (Tina Fey) is eager to tell him. She's never liked him anyway; she tells him that, too. An honest world can be a brutal place for a short, fat loser, which is all that Mark is. After all, everybody says so. The movie never surpasses the gleeful hilarity of the first 25 minutes, when it allows us to imagine just how crushing and soulless this nakedly Darwinian universe would be. The high point comes early, with Mark's dispiriting blind date with the beautiful Anna (Jennifer Garner), who is scrupulously frank about her first impressions and his long-term prospects, which are nil. She's searching for a fiscally well-endowed, genetically attractive mate, and Mark ain't him.  Watch Gervais explain why Garner came cheap » . Gervais has made similar, self-deprecating remarks about the chances of a chubby Brit like him making it in Hollywood -- a line he repeated at the Emmys recently -- though it must be said, so far, Hollywood seems to be welcoming him with open arms. ""The Invention of Lying"" is loaded with celebrity cameos from the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton and Christopher Guest. Gervais should relax: Clowns don't have to be Cary Grant. Funny-looking is fine for a funny man. Meanwhile Mark's obsession with the unfairness of it all smacks of self-pity. It doesn't seem to have occurred to the filmmakers that his attraction to Anna is based entirely on her looks. Garner's role cries out for grace notes -- a kind word, a quip, an insight, some flash of warmth -- Garner can only hint at. Provocatively, the big lie that changes everything is the promise of an afterlife Mark gives to his mother on her deathbed. The word soon gets out, and Mark is forced to spell out the tenets of the world's first religion, as dictated to him by ""the man in the sky."" Or so he says, and who should doubt it? You have to admire the audacity of such sacrilegious mischief-making, but truth be told, the movie loses its way the longer Gervais spins out this anti-parable. His false prophet acquires fame and fortune but still struggles to convince the girl that he's a better bet than Rob Lowe in the genes department. The ending's uncertain mixture of cynicism and sentimentality doesn't feel entirely plausible, and between them, Gervais and Robinson can't smooth over the story's bumpy patches. At times, the energy just seeps out of the film. But that doesn't mean ""The Invention of Lying"" isn't the funniest movie around right now. At its best, it's inspired. It's just that Ricky Gervais still has a ways to go before his filmmaking reaches the sustained pitch of his TV work. It should be fun seeing him figure it out. ""The Invention of Lying"" is rated PG-13 and runs 100 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.","""The Invention of Lying"" has moments of inspired comedy, says Tom Charity .

"(CNN)  -- Typhoon Morakot dumped heavy rain on Taiwan early Saturday and threatened to further soak the recently drought-stricken island. A man fights against strong winds in Hsintien, Taipei county, Taiwan, on Friday. As of 3 a.m. local time, the storm's eye was over the northern part of the island, CNN forecaster Kevin Corriveau reported, although he noted that slow-moving Morakot is so large it encompassed the entire island. Journalist Andrew Lee in Taipei, citing local media, said the storm had blown off roofs and washed out some bridges. Corriveau said the island has received more than 39 inches (99 centimeters) of rain from the storm, which he said was expected to dump another 39 to 47 inches (99 to 119 centimeters) of rain on Taiwan. The storm made landfall carrying winds of up to 92 mph (148 km/h), with gusts up to 115 mph (185 km/h), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. iReport.com: See balcony view of heavy rains . Corriveau said the storm was expected to linger over the island for several more hours, and the southern portion of Morakot would likely be passing over Taiwan for hours after that. The storm's impact had already been felt by Friday morning, with mudslides and landslides occurring on the island. The area has been severely affected by drought in recent months, leaving the ground so hard that it does not absorb the rainfall, Corriveau said. Taiwan's Central News Agency, acknowledging the drought, cited the Water Resources Agency as saying that the storm had replenished the island's reservoirs and would put an end to water rationing in several areas.  Watch more about the typhoon's impact » . The storm prompted airlines to cancel flights. Schools and government offices were closed ahead of Morakot's arrival, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. Trading at the Taiwan Stock Exchange was also postponed until Monday, the news agency reported. In China, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that governments in coastal provinces were readying themselves for the storm and had ordered fishing boats to seek shelter before Thursday night. In Fujian province, about 8.4 million text messages had been sent to citizens warning them to prepare for the typhoon, Xinhua reported. More than 900 people, including Chinese and foreign tourists, have been evacuated from the resort of Nanji Island off east China, the news agency reported.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Amid turmoil over the treatment of post-election detainees and controversy over the mass trials of political figures, Iran's supreme leader on Saturday appointed a new judiciary chief, Iranian media reported. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during the announcement  that Sadeq Larijani, right, will head Iran's judiciary. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tapped Sadeq Larijani -- brother of Iran's powerful parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani -- to replace Hashemi Shahroudi, a vocal hardliner against the opposition movement, who finished his 10-year term, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Another brother, Mohammad Javad Larijani, is the secretary-general of the judiciary's human rights office. The development is significant in that the two brothers now head two of the three branches of Iran's government, and tensions between Ali Larijani and hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have emerged as the president tried to assemble his Cabinet for his second term. Sadeq Larijani makes the transition as a third round of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the Islamic republic's disputed presidential election were scheduled to appear in court Sunday, the semi-official Fars news agency said. The mass trial of about 100 Iranians is being held in the Revolutionary Court. Reformist politicians, lawyers and journalists are among those accused of protesting in an attempt to overturn government leadership. More than two dozen detainees were scheduled to be on trial Sunday, according to media reports, although it is not clear whether it will be the defendants' first appearance in court. Among the defendants who have been on trial this month are Seyyed Mohammad Abtahi, a former Iranian vice president; Maziar Bahari, an Iranian-Canadian reporter for Newsweek magazine; and Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar. Street protests and a brutal government crackdown followed the June 12 presidential election, leading to the arrests of more than 1,000 people. The official death toll from the post-election unrest is 30, although opposition leaders reportedly have said it's more than twice that figure. The new judiciary chief's brother, Ali Larijani, spent the last week dismissing allegations by Iran's opposition that post-election detainees were raped while in custody, according to state-run media. Larijani said that a special panel of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, conducted a ""precise and comprehensive inquiry"" into the treatment at Tehran's Evin and Kahrizak prisons, and found ""no cases of rape or sexual abuse,"" government-funded Press TV reported. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry also denied that prisoners had been tortured. ""What kind of talk is this? There was never any pressure used against these people,"" Hassan Qashqavi said Monday, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. They were responding to accusations made by opposition candidate Mehdi Karrubi who, along with opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, ran against hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election. Iran's election authority declared Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner of the race, sparking hundreds of thousands of Iranians to take to the streets in protest. Iranian opposition figures, including Karrubi, have compared the treatment of the detainees to the abuse of political prisoners under the ""oppressing regime"" of the shah, who was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. In an open letter to former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani posted Saturday on his party's Web site, Karrubi says an ""impartial committee"" is needed to ""investigate these tragedies with transparency until they are resolved."" ""Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems,"" Karrubi says in the letter. ""Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they [the victims] have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses."" Larijani on Wednesday challenged Karrubi to ""present evidence of such outrages"" for the Majlis to investigate, according to Press TV.","Iran's supreme leader picks brother of parliamentary speaker to head judiciary .

"PADANG, Indonesia (CNN) -- The first school assembly since the earthquake was charged with emotion and grief. Students gather for the emotional assembly at their school in Padang, Indonesia. Students at SMA1 High School in Padang have been arriving amid the ruins of their classrooms hoping life will get back to normal quickly. They still don't know how many pupils were victims of the earthquake. Only half the 800 students turned up Monday. But there was a gasp of shock as the vice principal informed them that one member of staff had been killed in the quake. As prayers and a lament were sung in the yard, the emotion was too much for one teacher who fainted and was carried away. Many students have stories of narrow escapes and cheating death by seconds. Haria Fitri told me she was taking a shower when suddenly the bathroom started shaking violently. She grabbed a towel and ran downstairs and jumped out of a window, just as her house collapsed behind her. Many are clearly traumatized by what happened, mentioning how scared they are that another quake will again turn their world upside down. The teachers too seem stunned by what's happened. Most of the classrooms here are full of rubble and lessons are now being conducted in a tent outside, provided by United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF. 17-year-old student Harris Putrareza, said: ""When I see my school, very big destruction, I get a little sad, but I am very happy to be back to my school."" The school's English teacher, a warm, animated woman called Gustina said: ""They feel very sad, they can't control their emotions, what pity our school is broken."" In some ways the very spirit of the school has been damaged. It was built in 1917 during the Dutch colonial period and has survived numerous earthquakes down the years. But this one ripped the place apart, leaving mountains of red bricks lying on the desks and huge gaping holes in the ceiling. One building is simply too dangerous to enter and may have to be torn down. Everywhere there are little reminders of the day the earth shook so violently: the trophy cabinet full of toppled sports awards, the covered walkways choked with smashed stone pillars. The senior students are already wondering how they will cope when it comes to their important mid-term exams next week. The principal has announced a postponement, while they find a suitable room. Slowly the students at this highly-acclaimed school will refocus on their studies, but no one will forget that day at the end of September when everything changed in Padang.","Death toll from two powerful earthquakes that struck Indonesia has risen to 608 .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Chelsea have said they will mount the ""strongest appeal possible"" following the transfer ban placed on the club by world football's governing body FIFA. English Premier League side Chelsea have been banned by  FIFA from signing any new players until 2011 . The punishment, which would prevent any new member joining the squad until 2011, was dished out after the club were found to have ""induced"" Gael Kukuta to breach his contract in a transfer from French league side Lens in 2007. In a statement on their official Web site, Chelsea announced their plan to: ""Mount the strongest appeal possible following the decision of FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber over Gaël Kakuta. ""The sanctions are without precedent to this level and totally disproportionate to the alleged offence and the financial penalty imposed. We cannot comment further until we receive the full written rationale for this extraordinarily arbitrary decision,"" the statement concluded. The ruling came after Lens complained to FIFA that Chelsea had acted improperly over the transfer of 18-year-old left-winger Kakuta two years ago. The complaint was referred to the body's Disciplinary Resolution Chamber (DRC) who decided to impose a ban on any further player recruitment by last season's Champions League semifinalists. Have FIFA made the right decision? Sound Off below. A statement on FIFA's official Web site read: ""The DRC found that the player had indeed breached a contract signed with the French club. ""Equally, the DRC deemed it to be established that the English club induced the player to such a breach. As a result the player was condemned to pay compensation in the amount of €780,000 ($1.1 million), for which the club, Chelsea, are jointly and severally liable, and sporting sanctions were imposed on both the player and Chelsea in accordance with art. 17 par. 3 and 4 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players."" Kakuta, who was voted the side's academy player of the year in his first 12 months with Chelsea, received a personal suspension of four months as a result of the ruling. ""Chelsea are banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, for the two next entire and consecutive registration periods following the notification of the present decision."" The first football transfer window in Europe runs from January 1-31 in 2010; the second from the end of the current season until August 31 in Europe, and  September 1 in Britain next year. Chelsea were also ordered to pay Lens ""training compensation"" of €130,000 ($185,000), in a decision the club could appeal at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Football governing bodies have intervened on two previous occasions in recent times regarding the acquisition of new players by Chelsea. In 2005, Nigeria midfielder Jon Mikel Obi was ordered by FIFA to return to Norwegian club Lyn Oslo to see out his contract before eventually joining Chelsea, after protracted transfer negotiations had led to disagreement with Manchester United who also claimed they had signed the player. Chelsea were also fined £300,000 ($490,000) by the English Premier League over the capture of England defender Ashley Cole from Arsenal in 2005. The club were found guilty of breaking rule K3, which forbade them approaching Cole, who still had two years left on his Arsenal deal, ""by any means while under contract."" Watch a former Chelsea manager discuss the ban » . The Blues were also warned they could face being docked points if a similar offence occurred during the 2005/2006 season. It is the second time FIFA have handed out a transfer ban on a club. The transfers of Switzerland's FC Sion were frozen until the end of the 2010 season after they attempted to sign Egypt's Essam El Hadary before the goalkeeper's contract with Al-Ahly had expired.","Chelsea to mount the ""strongest appeal possible"" following the club's ban .

"YANAGAWA, Japan (CNN) -- Wearing a Nashville School of Law T-shirt, Christopher Savoie walked into a second-floor police interrogation room. In one corner, a stopwatch was running to hold him to the 15 minutes allotted for the interview. A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. ""I'm so scared,"" he said. Savoie chose his words carefully, lest police Officer Toshihiro Tanaka cut short the rare interview Savoie was granted with CNN on Thursday. There were so many rules: No recording devices. No tough questions. Speak only in Japanese. ""I want Americans to know what's happening to me,"" Savoie continued in Japanese. ""I didn't do anything wrong. Children have the right to see both parents. It's very important for my children to know both parents."" But Japanese authorities disagree. They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan.  Watch what else Savoie had to say » . He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka, to try to obtain passports for the children, screaming at the guards to let him in the compound. He was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil. Japanese police, alerted by his estranged wife, arrested him. The Savoies were divorced in Tennessee in January after 14 years of marriage. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights with his children, but after he returned from a short summer trip, his estranged wife fled to Japan with the children, according to court documents. A United States court then granted sole custody to Savoie.  Watch why the case is complicated » . Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order. The law there also follows a tradition of sole custody divorces. When the couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction. But Japan is not a party to that agreement. Savoie was out of luck. If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent, the person who took the child is considered an abductor. ""Japanese people think she's the victim here,"" Savoie said. ""In the States, my ex-wife is the one who's in the wrong."" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley recognized this case as a difficult one. Even though the United States has strong ties with Japan, on this particular issue, the two nations' points of view could not differ more, he said. In Yanagawa, those who have heard about the abduction case tend to side with the woman. ""They belong with their real mother,"" said one woman, herself a mother of two children. But most have not heard of the case, because it has not been reported in local newspapers or on television. Savoie's attorney, Tadashi Yoshino, knows the cultural divide will be hard to overcome. ""He technically may have committed a crime according to Japanese law but he shouldn't be indicted,"" Yoshino said. ""He did it for the love of his children."" Savoie, a law student who already has a Ph.D. and a M.D., will spend 10 days in jail while Japanese prosecutors sort out the details of the case. In the interrogation room, Savoie appeared exhausted. Tears welled in his eyes. He glanced over at the police officer, then paused to regain composure. ""I love you, Isaac, Rebecca,"" he said. ""Your daddy loves you forever. I'll be patient and strong until the day comes that I can see you both again. I am very sorry that I can't be with you."" He was grateful be able to get the words out. Moments earlier, the interview had almost ended after Savoie blurted out in English: ""I love you,"" a message intended for his current wife, Amy, in Nashville. Then, as is Japanese custom, he bowed. And from the other side of the glass barrier, he gave a thumbs up, mouthing the words, ""Thank you.""","Man charged with abducting his own children denies committing breach .

"(WIRED) -- Apple is the exclusive gatekeeper to its iPhone App Store, able to reject apps at will -- as it did July 28 with Google Voice. Some would-be iPhone developers, rejected by Apple, are turning to an unauthorized app store called Cydia. But some developers aren't taking the rejection lying down: They're turning instead to an unauthorized app store called Cydia, where forbidden wares continue to exist -- and even earn developers some money. That store is operated by Jay Freeman, more fondly known in the iPhone ""Jailbreak"" community as Saurik. Only five months old, his app store Cydia specializes in selling apps that Apple would reject or ban (or already has). To use Cydia or the apps available through it, customers need to jailbreak their phones -- hack them to work around Apple-imposed restrictions -- a process that Apple claims is illegal. Indeed, you can even get a Google Voice app, GV Mobile, through Cydia. After Apple pulled the app from its App Store, developer Sean Kovacs (who is not affiliated with Google) made it available for free through Cydia. It's difficult to get accurate data on how many customers have jailbroken their iPhones. But based on the number of unique device identifiers tracked on his server, Freeman claims that about 4 million, or 10 percent of the 40 million iPhone and iPod Touch owners to date, have installed Cydia. On a recent day, he said 470,000 people were connecting to the Cydia store, up from 350,000 per day just a few months ago. Among many free apps, there are also 15 paid apps in Cydia, and the store has earned $220,000 in overall sales in just five months. ""People are so annoyed by Apple and their s---, and if you give them opportunity to go around it, then they'll even pay for it,"" said Kim Streich, a developer whose app 3G Unrestrictor earned $19,000 in sales in just two weeks through Cydia. Though Cydia is relatively young, the underground ""Jailbreak"" community has existed since the first iPhone launched in 2007. That year, Apple didn't yet have an app store for its iPhone, stifling the true potential of the device. This limitation inspired digital rebels to hack away at the iPhone's closed platform in an effort to free its mind. The result? An app called Installer, opening a door for early iPhone owners to add games, utilities and other third-party software coded by developers. It wasn't until 2008 that Apple offered a software development kit for third-party coders to make programs for its iPhone. That led to the opening of the official App Store in July 2008. Apple's store grew rapidly, accumulating 65,000 apps and serving over 1.5 billion downloads to date. Many developers abandoned Installer for the more popular App Store, leaving behind an underground space where unauthorized wares could continue to exist. Installer died and became reborn as Cydia, which evolved from an app library into a store in March 2009. To gain access to Cydia, iPhone owners must jailbreak their smartphones using some freely available tools courtesy of the hacker group iPhone Dev-Team. Given the nature of this procedure, it's clear Cydia's primary audience consists of nerdy rebels wishing to utilize the full power of their iPhones, restriction-free. Cydia's numbers appear small compared to the rare stories we hear about developers turning into millionaires with hot sales of their iPhone apps in the App Store. But the idea behind a store like Cydia is that you don't have to be huge to make money. With a smaller market, fewer competitors and a reasonably large customer base, each developer has a higher chance for making a quick buck, Freeman said. Plus, you get more personal attention: Developers submitting their app through Cydia need only contact Freeman, and their app can be made available almost immediately. That's an enticing alternative to Apple's approval process, which can take months and is notoriously opaque: Some App Store developers have faced difficulty getting answers to simple questions from Apple about their apps. It's obvious what's driving iPhone customers toward Cydia: Apple's rejections and restrictions of major iPhone apps. Most notably, Apple recently banned apps supporting Google Voice, the search giant's internet-based phone enhancement service that can provide cellphone users with free text messaging and transcribed voicemail. Angry consumers and developers theorize that Apple banned the Google Voice apps so as not to detract business from its partner AT&T's phone services. The incident has brewed so much controversy that even the Federal Communications Commission has gotten involved, sending letters to AT&T, Apple and Google inquiring about the reasons for the rejections. ""Looks like Apple and AT&T pissed off a lot of people,"" Kovacs wrote in a July 28 blog post. ""I'll be releasing GV Mobile v1.2 on Cydia for free today or tomorrow."" Another high-profile App Store regulation involves SlingPlayer, an app that enables iPhone users to stream video from a Slingbox device hooked up to a TV. When Sling originally submitted the app, it was capable of streaming over both Wi-Fi and the cellular 3G connection. However, Apple requested Sling to modify the app to work on Wi-Fi only. AT&T said this was a necessary move to prevent congestion on its 3G network. That restriction spawned the most successful Cydia app to date, 3G Unrestrictor, developed by Streich. 3G Unrestrictor, a $2 app that has sold 9,500 copies, allows the iPhone to circumvent any network limitations imposed by Apple. For example, the app enables SlingPlayer users to stream TV over 3G as well as Wi-Fi; and when using the VOIP app Skype to place phone calls, customers can also use the cellular connection, whereas normally the app only enables users to dial over Wi-Fi. ""It's just amazing what you can do on such a little cellphone, and Apple just forbids customers from doing these things, and it's just a shame,"" Streich said. ""That's why I'm so happy there's a Cydia store."" Another developer who reports positive experiences with Cydia is Jonathan Zdziarski, who said he has made more money through the unauthorized store than Apple's App Store. In February, his app iWipe sold 694 copies in Cydia, compared to 91 copies of iErase in the App Store. ""I guess you could say the App Store is kind of like Wal-Mart, with more crap than you'd ever want to buy,"" Zdziarski said. ""And Cydia is like the general store that has everything you want and need, from fresh cuts of meat to those homemade cookies you can't get anywhere else."" Though some developers say they're having better experiences selling apps through Cydia, it's unlikely they will succeed on a longer term, said Rana Sobhany, vice president of Medialets, an iPhone app analytics company. She said the average consumer would prefer to purchase apps through a well trusted source such as Apple. ""There have been all these apps downloaded in the App Store because it's easy for consumers to find, download and pay for apps,"" Sobhany said. ""This model is new because Apple has been training people how to download music to their iPods for years."" However, even in the case of the App Store, developers who strike it rich still face challenges recreating their success, said Phillip Ryu, co-creator of the e-book reader Classics, which has sold over 400,000 copies to date. ""If you're hoping to reach the mainstream, the best you can hope for is your app catches on fire and charts high enough for you to make a windfall,"" Ryu said. ""Essentially you aim for the jackpot, and if you don't hit that, it's not going to make you a living."" Freeman said it was too soon to tell whether Cydia would provide developers stable incomes, but he recommends they give it a try, considering the successes some are experiencing. He admits, however, he isn't making much money as the creator of Cydia: Like Apple, he takes 30 percent of each app sale to cover taxes. ""I don't make much money off this project, but I value the community, and I look forward to how this changes the device landscape,"" Freeman said.

"SARATOGA SPRINGS, New York (CNN) -- Two years ago, Dawn Warfield was drowning in debt. Dawn Warfield sold one of her two video stores to help reduce her debts. The average American household has $8,329 in credit card debt, according to the Nilson Report, a credit industry newsletter. Warfield had nearly 10 times that amount. At its worst point, her debt totalled nearly $80,000. She had 17 credit cards and admits that living beyond her means was part of the problem. ""I'll own up to that,"" she said. ""There is always unforeseen expenses, and when you are making the minimum payments on these credit cards, when you think you can't afford to make more than that, they don't go down."" But Warfield's spending was not the only factor working against her.  Watch Warfield describe how the debt piled up, and how she started paying it off » . She was in the middle of an expensive divorce and had been charging business expenses to her personal credit cards when she opened a second location of her video store. ""Every month I was writing out 17 checks,"" she said. ""And the interest rates ranged from like 6 percent to 33 percent. So it was impossible. ""I was transferring balances from one card to another, and every time I got a card to a decent interest rate, I felt like one of the cards would come off the promotional interest rate, and I was just never catching up."" So Warfield took matters into her own hands. She sold the second location of her video store, stopped using her credit cards and decided it was time to get help. ""I sat down one day and I called each credit card one by one, and I asked each one to work with me ... to lower my interest rate."" The credit card companies did not respond to her plea. Instead, she was directed to the debt management program of the nonprofit Consumer Credit Counseling Service, part of Money Management International. Counselor Eric Jackson helped Warfield analyze her bills and expenses and created a plan to help her get lower interest rates. Now she makes a single monthly payment. ""I don't even have to think about it, which makes it a lot easier for me, because when you have a lot of debt, it's not just financial, but it's emotional, you know, even physical,"" Warfield said. ""You think about it all the time."" Adds Jackson: ""She's making her payments on time, they're posting to her creditor accounts, she has very low interest rates -- that was one of the benefits -- and she's definitely doing well. ""She is on track to get all her debts paid off in full within the five years."" Today, Warfield is less than $40,000 in debt. ""I'm about halfway,"" she said.

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- U.S. officials urged American citizens in Germany to keep a low profile and remain wary of their surroundings after the terrorist organization al Qaeda posted a video message threatening attacks in the country. German special police patrol in Berlin last month during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu. A State Department travel alert, issued Wednesday, remains in effect until November 11 -- two weeks after Germany holds its federal elections on Sunday. Al Qaeda posted its video threat on the Internet on September 18, vowing attacks if the elections do not come out the way it wants. The same day, the German government reacted to the video by raising its own alert level and heightening security. The British Foreign Office has also issued an advisory to its citizens living and traveling to Germany. The State Department travel alert asks Americans to keep abreast of news reports and consider the security procedures in place when they visit public places or pick hotels and restaurants. Germany's interior ministry said earlier this month that the country has noted an increase in threats by al Qaeda and other Islamist groups since the beginning of the year. In the nearly 26-minute video statement, a man identified as Bekay Harrach, using the pseudonym Abu Talha and speaking in German, said that, if the September 27 elections vote into power parties that do not pledge to pull German troops from Afghanistan, there will be a ""rude awakening."" The speaker called on Muslims living in Germany to stay away from public life during the first two weeks after the elections, implying that any attacks would take place then. The speaker repeatedly criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also criticized Merkel's rivals, the Social Democrats, but offered the possibility of a ""peace offer."" ""If the German people vote for peace, then the Mujahedeen will choose peace with Germany as well,"" he said. ""And with the withdrawal of the last German soldier from Afghanistan, the last Mujahed will also leave Germany.

"(CNN) -- The reaction to Mackenzie Phillips' detailed account of her sexual relationship with her father, John Phillips, has been explosive, and some of the strongest statements have come from her family. Chynna Phillips said she doesn't think anyone could make up having a consensual incestuous relationship. But as the former actress and musician talked with Oprah Winfrey for the second time this week -- this time about the firestorm that erupted from her hour-long interview Wednesday -- she said she doesn't regret writing her memoir, ""High on Arrival."" ""I understand this is a difficult thing for my family,"" Phillips told Winfrey via satellite Friday, ""but nobody's talking about this, and if I've started a national dialogue, then I'm forever grateful."" Phillips said she has gotten letters and Facebook messages from incest survivors, thanking her for coming forward. ""It's been heartening and heartbreaking at the same time,"" she said. John Phillips died in 2001. Two of his former wives, however, have vehemently denied Mackenzie Phillips' accusations. In an statement to CNN, Michelle Phillips, an original Mamas & Papas bandmate who divorced John in 1970, called the situation ""very hurtful."" ""Mackenzie's drug addiction for 35 years has been the result of many unpleasant experiences,"" Michelle Phillips said. ""Whether her relationship with her father is delusional or not, it is an unfortunate circumstance and very hurtful for our entire family."" She spoke more strongly to The Hollywood Reporter's Roger Friedman, telling him, ""Mackenzie has a lot of mental illness. She's had a needle stuck up her arm for 35 years. ... She did 'Celebrity Rehab,' and now she writes a book. The whole thing is timed."" Genevieve Waite, who married John Phillips in 1972, told Winfrey in a statement that ""John was a good man who had a lot of problems, [but] he was incapable, no matter how drunk or drugged he was, to have sexual relations with his own child."" The fallout from Phillips' decision to reveal her family's secrets has been heartbreaking for her sister Bijou as well. Bijou Phillips supplied a statement to Winfrey stating that Mackenzie told her about the incestuous relationship with their father when Bijou was 13 but later denied it. ""This news was confusing and also scary, because I'd lived alone with him since I was 3,"" she said. ""[John Phillips] was Mr. Mom, loving and encouraging; the man who raised me would never be capable of such things."" She also questioned why Mackenzie would leave her alone with their father if he'd molested the elder sister. Still, Bijou Phillips showed signs of measured support. ""I understand Mackenzie's need to come clean, but it hurts because the man in question isn't here to defend himself,"" she said. ""I hope she can come to terms with this and find peace."" Mackenzie Phillips told Winfrey that her family's disbelief and anger saddened her, especially since she and Bijou Phillips have been very close. Phillips recalled the way Bijou immediately came to her aid when she was arrested last year for cocaine and heroin possession. ""I love my baby sister, and I miss having contact with her,"" Mackenzie said. ""By the time Bijou was living with my father, I felt she was safe. I did take her out of there if I felt like she wasn't being watched properly,"" she said in her defense. But she added that Michelle Phillips' statements weren't as surprising. ""When Michelle found out I was writing this book, she vowed to do everything to discredit me,"" Mackenzie told Winfrey. ""She's having a textbook reaction, trying to sweep it under the rug. It seems so unkind and ungenerous to lash out in this way; I don't have a history of mental illness. I have a history of drug addiction."" Chynna Phillips, who also sat down with Winfrey on Friday, said she believes that her mother, Michelle, made those statements out of anger and that she does still love Mackenzie, even if she doesn't admit it. ""I think the most devastating thing is when people are in denial and don't want things on a public platform, it's not something everyone wants to share with the world,"" Chynna Phillips said. ""It's not something my mom wants plastered all over the papers."" Chynna told Winfrey that she'd known about her sister's history with her father for about 12 years and believes that no one would go out of their way to admit having a consensual incestuous relationship. She's also not the only one who thinks Mackenzie is telling the truth. Jessica Woods, the daughter of former Mamas & Papas band member Denny Doherty, also wrote in to Winfrey and said her father knew about everything. ""I just watched your show,"" Woods wrote, ""and everything she said is true. My dad told me the awful truth, and he was horrified at what John had done."" Chynna, who grew up with her mother, said that although she didn't spend a lot of time with John Phillips, the memories she had of him were positive, in spite of the heavy drug use she witnessed. ""He was a very charismatic man,"" she said. ""He was a very talented man and a very loving man in many ways."" Now one half of the Christian music duo Chynna and Vaughan, Chynna said that her relationship with Mackenzie has grown over the past six months and that she's proud of her half-sister for having the courage to talk about her past. ""The thing is, who among us haven't done something that we're highly ashamed of in our lives?"" she said to Winfrey. ""Who are we to cast the first stone? In my faith, as a Christian, God told me I need to forgive. Am I happy that she put me in this position? No, I'm not. But I have to forgive. It's 13 years later, and I still haven't digested this information."" Chynna added that she hopes her sister will take her experiences and use them to help others, offering one piece of advice: ""Get the Lord on board, because you'll need it.""","Mackenzie Phillips talks about family's reaction to her claims of incest .

"(CNN) -- Josh Rouse is a chameleon. And a busy one, too. Josh Rouse has made his name with well-crafted songs in a variety of styles. Listeners to his first album, 1998's ""Dressed Up Like Nebraska,"" may have lumped him into the alt-country movement. Aside from Rouse's rough, intimate voice, that album sounds little like 2003's ""1972,"" which features songs such as ""Love Vibration"" and ""Comeback (Light Therapy)"" and has a funkier, more upbeat production to match. The 36-year-old singer's willingness to follow several paths may have come from moving around as a child. Rouse was born in Nebraska and grew up around the West and the South. ""It really shaped me as a person,"" he told the Toronto Sun. ""There's an openness to the sound that I think I got from moving to, say, a big city in California to a Wyoming town of five or six hundred."" Though he has yet to have a breakthrough single in the United States, his music has appeared in the movie ""Vanilla Sky"" and TV shows including ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Party of Five."" He's also admired by fellow songwriters. In 2004, the Australian newspaper The (Melbourne) Age noted Rouse was going to have dinner with Edie Brickell, the ""What I Am"" singer who is married to Paul Simon. ""She called me and said, 'I love ""1972,"" ' and I was like, 'I was listening to you when I was 16 -- and you're married to Paul Simon!' "" Rouse told the paper. On the business side, he's marching to his own drummer. On joshrouse.com, Rouse's Web site, he sells his ""Bedroom Classics"" -- dozens of songs Rouse recorded live or in random locations (hotel rooms, apartments) available to fans. For those who like a more traditional medium, the CD, Rhino Records recently compiled a two-disc set of Rouse's material -- including several demos and outtakes -- for ""The Best of the Rykodisc Years,"" which covers the first seven years of Rouse's career. ""Listening to this collection of tracks taken ... it's plain that Josh Rouse arrived fully formed,"" writes Allmusic.com's Tim Sendra. ""From his first release ... he was already a thoughtful writer with a heartbreakingly intimate voice and the unfailing ability to wrap his melancholy in warm and sweet melodies."" Rouse answered several questions via e-mail for CNN.com. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your music showcases a number of styles -- the fairly basic sound of the early records, the early-'70s infused stuff from ""1972,"" and then there are songs like ""Miserable South"" that would sound comfortable coming from Otis Redding or Al Green. So, though it's a cliché, what are your influences? Josh Rouse: Anything that is soulful and honest is an influence. There are too many musicians/writers to name. CNN: Are you surprised that Rhino put together a ""best of""? Rouse: No, I was aware that they were planning on doing it. It's nice to reflect on the body of work I've created. CNN: One of your songs, ""Directions,"" was on the ""Vanilla Sky"" soundtrack. What effect, if any, did this have on your career? Rouse: Well, I got to meet Cameron Crowe, and he seemed nice. I'm sure it exposed my music to some people who might not of heard it otherwise. However, it did not have a Zach Braff effect on my career. CNN: With all the material on the Web, as well as your albums, you're obviously a prolific songwriter. Has it been helpful to put all that out there, or have some people criticized you for releasing too much, as Ryan Adams has been criticized? Rouse: More than being criticized for releasing a lot, I think it's more difficult to receive a lot of attention for one specific record. Sometimes [the] press doesn't want to write on a songwriter they just wrote about a year or two ago. I think my fan base is grateful. CNN: Which of your songs are among your favorites, and why? Which would you like to have back -- or rework? Rouse: ""1972"" is a beautiful song all the way around. I don't think I ever want to rework anything. I'm constantly trying to move forward. Sometimes you say, ""I wish that was faster, etc."" but it I'm not going to go back and re-record it. CNN: In the album notes, you mention that you write best when you're in motion -- getting ideas for melodies in taxicabs, for example. How do you hold on to those? Rouse: If they're good, I can usually remember them. I also have a variety of small handheld recorders. CNN: You've got songs referring to Nebraska, the Hamptons, Nashville ... have you thought of pulling a Sufjan Stevens and profiling a state? Rouse: No, and I'm not sure half of those Sufjan songs are profiling a state. However, it makes for a great marketing tool. CNN: You say you feel as if these albums are your ""first stage."" What's next? Rouse: I'm currently working on an Afro-Brazilian record in Spanish.","Josh Rouse has fans among other songwriters .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- By the end of World War II in April 1945, with about two-thirds of European Jewry wiped out, Jewish survivors stepped out of the darkness in search of a place to call home. Bestselling author Anita Diamant releases her latest historical novel, ""Day After Night."" About 250,000 were considered displaced persons, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. A growing number of Jews -- before, during and especially after the war -- dreamt of helping to build a Jewish homeland in what was, at the time, British-controlled Palestine. ""Getting out of Europe, for a lot of people, felt like getting out of a graveyard,"" said bestselling author Anita Diamant, whose newest book focuses on this period. ""Palestine was like over the rainbow, practically. It was somewhere that they knew they were wanted, at least by the Jewish community in Palestine, and it was a way to start over again in a completely new world."" Immigration quotas, however, meant that the more than 100,000 Jews who arrived between 1945 and 1948, when Israel was declared a state, did so illegally. Most of those who were captured were sent to internment camps in places like Cyprus. But some Jewish prisoners ended up at a camp in Palestine called Atlit, located on the Mediterranean coast near the city of Haifa. Living in barracks and peering through barbed wire, these Holocaust survivors lived in limbo between their past and their future. ""Nobody else wanted them, so they wanted to go to Palestine,"" Diamant said. ""There was this bottleneck. It was a big problem for the British, and it was also a public relations nightmare for the British.""  Watch Diamant talk about her new book » . One night in October 1945, members of the Palmach -- an underground Jewish fighting force originally created to help the British fight the Nazis -- broke into Atlit and helped more than 200 prisoners escape. Central in this charge was Yitzhak Rabin, who would go on to be Israel's prime minister, and who was assassinated by a Jewish extremist in 1995. Diamant, author of ""The Red Tent,"" among other books, delves into the lives of four women who were part of this experience in her latest historical novel, ""Day After Night."" Carrying with them different wartime experiences, they are: a Polish partisan fighter, a Parisian woman who was forced into prostitution, a Dutch Jew who was in hiding, and a concentration camp survivor. CNN sat down with Diamant, a daughter of Holocaust survivors, to talk about her latest book, the reason this story is relatively unknown and her attempt to stay out of Middle East politics. CNN: How did you decide to focus on this specific story? Diamant: The story found me, the way I think all of my novels found me. My daughter was in Israel on a semester program when she was 15, in 2000, and my husband and I went on the parents' trip. So we were on and off the buses with the kids as they did their field trips, and one of the field trips was in Atlit. We were given the tour, and we were told the story of this escape and about these so-called illegal immigrants. And I thought there's a novel. CNN: This isn't a piece of Israel's history that many seem to know about. Why is that? Diamant: American Jews, even people who know Haifa well, who know Israel well, it comes as a surprise to them. It's not one of the big bloody chapters. It was early in the conflict in terms of Jewish resistance. After this they started bombing train tracks and doing more overt military resistance to the British occupation, as it was known then. Part of the reason we don't know about it is that I think the Holocaust is still such a huge shadow, and it's still something we focus on. This is a relatively tender interlude. It's not the founding of the state, and it's not the Holocaust. CNN: Are the characters based on real women you learned about in your research? Diamant: No, they're my girls. I invented them based on some stories that I had heard and read. ... There were women partisan fighters. I know that women were forced to do things against their will to survive. A lot of people were in hiding. It's sort of based on common knowledge about what happened during the war but at the same time trying to flesh out women's stories which I still think are under-told. CNN: What was the central struggle facing these women and the people in Atlit in general? Diamant: It's the struggle to continue after great loss, great pain and great suffering. How do you cope with those memories? Where do you put them? How do you carry them with you into the future? How much do you have to forget in order to live, to continue? ... We are a resilient species. Life moves on and they fall in love. And they're coming back to life, their bodies are coming back to life. A lot of marriages happened in displaced persons camps and camps like this, and a lot of babies were conceived in places like this, too, because life demands that we continue. But that can feel also like a betrayal of all the people you lost, so it's a painful tension -- the past and the future. CNN: Politically, everything that involves Israel is so loaded. Did you worry about this? Did you factor in how history unfolded after this? Diamant: I focused it very narrowly on this one little window of history. For it to have integrity, telling the story of that period, you can't know what happens next. So I really focused on their stories, their personal stories. Maybe that's a cop-out? But in writing a historical novel, you can't go outside of the box. I don't think I can. Although...a couple characters say, ""They told us there was nobody here. There are all these Arabs here."" There was a slogan: ""People without a land, and a land without a people."" That was the slogan in Europe that was used to drum up Zionist support. But in fact there were people in the land, and they got there and they went, ""What? No one told us."" Jews have been grappling with that fact from before the founding of the state. So it's acknowledged in here, but it's not the center of the book.","After Holocaust, before Israel became a state, 100,000 survivors immigrated illegally .

"Editor's note: Leslie Sanchez, a Republican who was director of the White House Initiative on Hispanic Education from 2001 to 2003, is the author of a forthcoming book, ""You've Come a Long Way, Maybe: Sarah, Michelle, Hillary and the Shaping of the New American Woman."" Sanchez is CEO of the Impacto Group, which specializes in market research about women and Hispanics. Leslie Sanchez says Michelle Obama's fashion choices have helped create a positive image for the first lady. (CNN) -- In just 200 days, Michelle Obama has put her own stamp on one of America's most unusual political positions -- the unelected, undefined job of being first lady. And the way she's done it? It's largely through the fashion choices she's made. Each of her predecessors has brought a unique perspective and personality to the east wing of the White House, helping to shape how the nation views the president and how the world views the nation. The use of fashion and image as a political strategy is an underrated factor. While Washington's political cognoscenti debate the successes and failures of the young Obama presidency, one half of Washington's newest power couple fine tunes fashion as a political strategy -- and it's working for her.  See photos of Michelle Obama's fashion » . The fashion authorities who are gathered this week in New York for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, more than seven months into the Obama presidency, are watching Michelle Obama's redefinition of the role of first lady with professional and personal interest. The contemporary standard for the job was set decades ago by Jacqueline Kennedy, who had both a high sense of fashion and the style to pull it off. Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the historian at the National First Ladies' Library, points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed, liked European style and had American designers copy it. She even went as far as to personally design her own outfits on three important state occasions, including her famous White House dinner for Nobel laureates, while letting other designers take the credit. The comparisons between Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Obama are as apt as the comparisons between their husbands. Michelle Obama comes across as feminine yet strong, professional and, unlike Mrs. Kennedy, approachable. She's a thoughtful presence on the national stage, but it's a very different kind of style from what we associate with Jackie Kennedy, who displayed a style of wealth, youth and glamor to an adoring middle class. Mrs. Obama, on the other hand, is portrayed as a take-charge woman who is sensitive to today's economic realities. Not stylish in her own right, she blends advice from her noted advisers to appear independent and progressive, yet ""in touch."" But while Jackie was high fashion, Michelle Obama is trendy but traditional. And that approachability extends to her personal style as well, her advisors having absorbed the lesson that the first lady's style is all too easily linked to her husband's presidency. Ronald Reagan's opponents used his wife Nancy's interest in fashion and her intent to look like the wife of a president, rather than mimic the school-marmish attire of her predecessor, as a gateway through which to attack the president. Mrs. Reagan's wardrobe choices, especially her designer Adolfo dresses, were used to make her husband seem insensitive to the poor and hungry. Mrs. Obama has avoided making the same mistake during the worst economic times in recent memory. She seems to have made a calculated decision to avoid that trap by focusing on emerging designers, like Jason Wu for her inaugural gown or choosing to wear trendy, off-the-rack clothes like the J. Crew gloves, sweater and skirt she chose for her husband's inauguration. And whatever the style mavens have to say about that, it produces political benefits. J. Crew's shares jumped 10 percent within 24 hours after the nation saw her in its clothing, which prompted NBC's Conan O'Brien to suggest the president consider wearing a Buick. As Women's Wear Daily media reporter Stephanie Smith says, this child of Chicago's South Side has become ""the biggest celebrity in the world."" Forbes lists her among the ""Most Powerful Women,"" and there's no doubt she's expanding the boundaries of perceptions surrounding the role of a ""traditional"" first lady, balancing her visits to homeless shelters and military bases with taking part in her children's soccer games. As The New York Times reported, Mrs. Obama ""pointedly controlled her look on the covers of People, Essence, More and O, Oprah Winfrey's magazine. Editors at Essence, who suggested colors, styles and accessories, said her staff did not call to acknowledge their overtures. ... Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor-in-chief of More... said Mrs. Obama refused to wear anything other than her own clothes for their October cover. 'She wanted none of that. She was creating the cover. She was creating the image. There's definitely a will of steel there.'"" According to Anthony, the general public's fascination with Michelle Obama spills over and helps the administration. To him, everything the media and the public criticize or praise is visual. ""It's not anything she's saying or doing. That's perhaps somewhat tactical. If she's unpopular based on her clothes choices, the White House can say it's really not of importance."" IMG executive Fern Mallis, the creative inspiration behind New York's Fashion Week, says ""most first ladies have always been on a pedestal of expensive, elegant clothing, of couture evening gowns. It's something that people can't really relate to."" This was especially true during the Kennedy years. Even if most American women wanted Jackie's dresses, Anthony points out, they could not buy them. These clothes were not only too expensive -- they weren't even available at the high-end stores. They were one of a kind. Mrs. Obama, because she has made fashion ""more democratic,"" says style expert Robert Verdi, has made her own impact on a world full of elites and -- let's face it -- snobs. Mrs. Kennedy, he says, ""was very contemporary and up-to-the-moment in fashion. But fashion at that time as not democratic. There was no Zara, no J. Crew, no Banana Republic. It was not accessible; it was exclusively aspirational."" On balance, though, Michelle Obama has shown a feminine but bold approach to her style by rattling the image of what a ""Washington"" first lady must look like. For other professional women and moms, the impact may not be purely imitation, as was the case with Jackie Kennedy, but rather the timely embracing of a new image of a modern, professional woman. Whatever it is, it's clearly by design. The push-pull of knowing fashion and appropriately wearing fashion may take Mrs. Obama longer to manage. Though a risk-taker and eager to highlight the equivalent of ""mom and pop"" designers, she, like many women, is still safely wearing styles others create rather than something new we could aspire to. Still -- whatever the implications for fashion -- on a political level, the first lady's approach is working. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Sanchez.","Leslie Sanchez: Fashion choices are important strategy for a First Lady .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A store owner in New York who is being hailed as a hero after rescuing a 4-year-old boy from a burning building said he plans to visit the child in the hospital Friday. Horia Cretan climbed up a fire escape and helped save a boy through the window of a burning building. Horia Cretan, who owns an electronics store in the Bronx structure where the fire broke out, also hopes to meet Christopher's parents for the first time, he told CNN's ""American Morning."" The boy is expected to recover, Cretan said. The child was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where a nurse said she couldn't provide his condition. Cretan, who moved to the United States from Romania 15 years ago, said he was inside his store Wednesday when he heard a child's screams. It was about 4 p.m., he said, about the time children play outside after getting out of school, but he said the screams he heard were ""totally different."" He reached a fire escape and climbed to the fourth floor, where a firefighter handed the boy to him through a smoke-clouded window, video from the scene shows. ""What I was worried about is, is he still alive? Because his head just dropped, and he wasn't helping himself or helping me,"" Cretan said. ""He just couldn't hold his weight and he was unconscious."" While the firefighter was handing over the boy, other crew members were trying to get into the building's main entrance to make their way to the apartment where the fire was, the store owner said. Cretan covered himself and the boy with a blanket or curtain to shield themselves from falling debris and glass, which cut the boy on the leg.  Watch Cretan describe the rescue » . During the rescue, the boy's brother stood below, yelling, the rescuer said. Christopher was given oxygen on the ground and taken to the hospital. Cretan said it wasn't the first time he rescued someone. He said he rescued his sister from a fire in Romania that killed their father. The 33-year-old Cretan said he was 12 years old at the time. ""It was a sad story, a tragic moment at the time,"" he said, referring to the Romanian incident. ""And you know, it had an impact on people around the neighborhood like it does right now. It's amazing. This just skyrocketed."" Cretan said he's received messages across the globe about the Bronx incident. ""This has become famous because somebody happened to be on the corner with the camera pretty much. You don't do things like this for merit. The merit in itself is you save somebody,"" Cretan said. ""And the whole community's just being great. Adopting me like a son, and I'm a part of a big family and I'm happy to have them in my life.""","Horia Cretan says he was working in his store when he heard a child's screams .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya needs $230 million over the next six months to feed millions affected by drought, the United Nations said in a new report. Farmers carry food handouts from the World Food Programme at a distribution spot near Nanyuki. The three-year failure of annual rains has reduced crop output, the main source of food for the country of 37 million. The drought has also affected water production and prompted power rationing in the east African nation. Kenya gets most of its energy from hydro-generation. About 3.8 million Kenyans need emergency food aid, and conditions are expected to deteriorate in the next few months, the United Nations World Food Programme said Wednesday. The rate among children under 5 suffering malnutrition has gone from 15 to 20 percent in some cases, the report said. ""People are already going hungry, malnutrition is preying on more and more young children, cattle are dying -- we face a huge challenge and are urging the international community to provide us with the resources we need to get the job done,"" said Burkard Oberle, Kenya director of the World Food Programme. The organization said it is helping about 2.6 million people in Kenya affected by drought while the government is supporting 1.2 million more until the end of October. ""In order to feed all 3.8 million people for the next six months, WFP and the Kenyan government will require strong support from donors in the weeks ahead,"" the report said. More than 17 million people across the Horn of Africa need help from the United Nations, which is battling funding shortfalls. Some of the most dire nations include Somalia and Uganda, which need $164 million and $96 million respectively.","U.N.: Kenya needs $230 million to feed millions affected by drought .

"(Mental Floss) -- Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country. Not all food items are always listed on restaurant menus. Be warned, this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol. We've compiled a list to get you started. 1. If you're at Starbucks and in need of just a little caffeine, don't worry -- there's a tiny option for you. It's the Short size, and they don't advertise it. It's like a little baby cup of coffee. It also comes in handy when you're scrounging for change and don't have enough for a tall (not that that has ever happened to me). 2. It's a good thing we don't have Jamba Juice here in Iowa, because I would be all over candy-based smoothies. Because it's considered a health-food chain, Jamba Juice doesn't officially list these on their in-store menus, but the Web site Mighty Foods assures us that the secret flavors exist. The ones they confirmed with the company's headquarters include Strawberry Shortcake, White Gummy Bear, PB&J, Various flavors of Starbursts, Fruity Pebbles, Push-Up Pops, and Skittles. Other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist: Chocolate Gummi Bear, Apple Pie, Sourpatch Kid, Tootsie Roll, and Now and Later. 3. This one might be my favorite. At Fatburger, you can order a Hypocrite -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon. 4. Chipotle has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available, they will make it for you. Things that have been tested include nachos, quesadillas, taco salads and single tacos. Some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item, however, so maybe someday soon you won't need a super-secret handshake to order one. Mental Floss: 7 food promotions gone horribly wrong . 5. If you're at Wendy's and you're really hungry -- like, three-patties-just-won't-cut-it hungry -- go ahead and order the Grand Slam, which is four patties stacked on a bun. This option is only available at select Wendy's, and it's also known as the Meat Cube. 6. Several places, including McDonald's and In-N-Out, will serve you the Neapolitan milkshake. It's just what it sounds like -- chocolate, vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup. 7. In-N-Out Burger's ""secret menu"" isn't so secret these days -- in fact, they've posted it on their Web site. But in case you're not in the habit of surfing fast food Web sites, here's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items: ordering something ""Animal Style"" at In-N-Out means you're going to get it with lettuce, tomato, a mustard-cooked beef patty, pickles, extra spread (it's sort of Thousand-Islandy) and grilled onions. You can even get your fries Animal Style. Mental Floss: Why is it called ""Thousand Island"" dressing? ""Protein Style"" is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun. A Grilled Cheese is two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato and spread on a bun (grilled onions if you so choose). And you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you're ordering lumber: 3×3 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese, 4×4 gets you four of each, and so on. According to photos posted at SuperSizedMeals.com, one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a Las Vegas store a few years ago. One item not listed on the Web site secret menu: the Flying Dutchman, which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties, hold the bun. 8. Feeling a little health-conscious at Popeye's? If you are, you really should have gone somewhere else. But there's a little hope for you -- ordering ""naked chicken"" will get you breading-free poultry. The word is that this is on the menu at some Popeye's, but not all of them, although it is an option at all of them. 9. Like Chipotle, Taco Bell will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it. Since most of the food at Taco Bell is made out of the same basic items, that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them. One ""secret,"" though, is that they have a not-advertised green chili sauce at most locations, and apparently it's excellent. 10. Some Subways will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s. Once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating, the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places (the word is that Canadian and Mexican Subways still offer them on a regular basis). But if you ask, lots of places will still make it for you. Be warned, though -- Jared would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Monstrosities, eyesores, nightmares of architecture -- call them what you like, ugly buildings are sadly all around us. Worst in Britain: The Bullring Shopping Centre in Birmingham was voted as the country's ugliest building. And you cannot simply define one category of hideous architecture. There is ugly, and then there is Ugly. The latter often open in controversial circumstances: There may be protests from local residents, and there can even be calls to knock them down. Yes, these are the world's ugliest buildings. From the divisive Millennium Dome (02 Arena) in London, to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, and the incomplete Ryugyong Hotel in North Korea -- we have compiled a gallery of ten of the world's ugliest buildings for your viewing displeasure. Although the buildings shown are scattered across the globe, they share several things in common. All of them had big budgets, most were attempts at creating contemporary or futuristic styling, and they have all divided opinion among local residents, architects, and the general public. • Click here to see photos of the world's ugliest buildings » . And these largely unpleasant buildings should not be treated as a joke. Sometimes the architecture can have a grave impact on the perception of a city or region. Birmingham, in the Midlands of the United Kingdom, for example, was recently voted the ugliest city in the country through a national poll. This came after the city's Bullring Shopping Centre and the Birmingham Central Library were named as the number one and two ugliest buildings in the country. And far from it being a case of the rest of the country bashing the area, in a local poll some 40 percent of local residents agreed that their city was home to the single ugliest building in the country.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chinese leaders Monday mourned the death of Zhuo Lin, wife of former national leader Deng Xiaoping. Zhuo Lin, center, mourns at husband Deng Xiaoping's funeral in 1997. Zhuo, a former consultant of the Central Military Commission General Office, died July 29 at age 93 and was cremated Monday, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. She was ""an excellent Communist Party of China member and time-honored loyal communist fighter,"" the party said in a written statement. Zhuo stood by Deng through decades of what CNN once described as ""amazing comebacks"" from ""political purges."" Though a committed Communist revolutionary, Deng also was a chief architect of some key reforms that reshaped China's economy. Zhuo met Deng in 1939 when they were young revolutionaries. She became his third wife and mother of his two sons and three daughters. When Deng rose to prominence as the most powerful leader of China, the family became China's ""first family."" Zhuo and Deng remained together until his death in 1997. Part of their story includes time spent together in exile. In 1966, Deng proposed major reforms including free markets for farmers and incentive bonuses. He was quickly denounced as a ""capitalist roader,"" a Maoist term used for people embracing capitalist ideals. He was under house arrest for two years, paraded in a dunce cap through the streets of Beijing and forced to wait tables at a Communist Party school. In 1969, Deng, Zhuo and several of their children were exiled to Jiangxi province in southeastern China. Deng later said only a personal security team supplied by Chinese leader Mao Zedong protected him from being killed. As Xinhua reported, Zhuo was Deng's companion ""through thick and thin."" When he ascended to power in 1978, Deng argued that ""poverty is not socialism"" and encouraged the creation of a market economy and capitalist-like enterprises. By the early 1990s his reforms had helped lift an estimated 170 million peasants out of extreme poverty. But he refused to abolish the power of the Communist Party over the lives of China's citizens. And he apparently approved the brutal suppression of unarmed demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989. The remarkable ups and downs of Deng Xiaoping's long political career took a dramatic toll on Deng and Zhuo's children, CNN reported in 1999, ""leaving one son crippled from an attack during the Cultural Revolution but, in more recent years, enabling all five Deng heirs to succeed in business, government or the arts."" The Cultural Revolution was initiated by Mao in 1966 to purge reformists and return the country to his style of communism. Zhuo took on various roles in the Chinese government. In 1978, she was appointed a consultant of the Central Military Commission General Office, Xinhua reported. ""She served as a deputy to the fourth and fifth National People's Congress and was awarded the Independence Merit Medal from the People's Liberation Army in 1988,"" the news agency said. ""My father and mother did not just share a family, they shared political ideals and life pursuits,"" said Deng Rong, in a Xinhua report. According to Xinhua, several leaders and former statesmen attended Zhuo's cremation ceremony, including President Hu Jintao, former President Jiang Zemin, legislator Wu Bangguo and Premier Wen Jiabao. ""To complete the last trip with her beloved husband, Zhuo chose to have her ashes scattered at sea as her husband's were,"" Xinhua reported.","Chinese Community Party calls her ""time-honored loyal communist fighter""

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration has unveiled a government ""app store"" designed to push the federal bureaucracy into the era of cloud computing. The Obama administration is pushing for the government to use cloud-computing technologies. The change means some federal employees will begin using services like YouTube, Gmail and WordPress, which store data on private Internet servers instead of on those paid for with public money. The process will start small but will ramp up quickly, Vivek Kundra, the U.S. chief information officer, said in a blog post on Tuesday. ""Our policies lag behind new trends, causing unnecessary restrictions on the use of new technology,"" Kundra writes in the post on WhiteHouse.gov. ""We are dedicated to addressing these barriers and to improving the way government leverages new technology."" The app store is designed for federal employees doing official government business and is not intended for use by the public. Also on Tuesday, Google announced the creation of a ""government cloud,"" in which public data will be stored on Google computer servers by 2010. According to a Google blog post, this dedicated space will serve the needs of federal, state and local governments. With ""cloud computing,"" users access applications that exist online instead of on their computers' hard drives. Both projects are designed to save the government money and to give government employees access to tools sometimes used in the private sector. The measures fall in line with the Obama administration's efforts to get the federal government up to speed with the latest technologies. Kundra wrote that the cost savings could be significant. The federal government spends $75 billion per year on data storage and other information technology costs, he wrote. A video on the new app store Web site also says government servers that host government Web sites and infrastructure often waste energy and money because they duplicate the efforts of the private sector. The app store, which is online at apps.gov, is essentially a compilation of Web programs, tools and services available to some government employees. A social media page, for instance, explains the possible uses of Web sites like YouTube, TwitVid and Flickr. People using the site have to log in and submit requests for approval before gaining access. Many of the applications, such as those mentioned, are free. Other business software in the government app store requires payment. ""With more rapid access to innovative IT solutions, agencies can spend less time and taxpayer dollars on procedural items and focus more on using technology to achieve their missions,"" writes Kundra. Ben Parr, associate editor at the social media blog Mashable, said it's smart for the government to turn to third-party tech companies that know their stuff better than federal bureaucrats. ""I'm a fan of it, because in most circumstances government is inefficient and this is a big way to really bring government up to speed in terms of computing,"" he said. ""There are a lot of places where the government is far behind."" Some privacy experts are concerned about the fact that some public data could end up on private-run computer servers, however. Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said people are required to submit information to the government and their data should be protected. ""We're not against the cloud computing model but there are real concerns here, both about privacy and security online,"" he said. He questioned whether Google, for example, would be able to use keywords from heath records to push pharmaceutical company ads at the American public. The details of government agreements about cloud computing need to be more public to ensure proper encryption techniques are taken and privacy laws are upheld, he said. ""I think it might make people wonder why government data is being commercialized in this way,"" he said. Parr said most government data is public anyway. ""So I definitely don't expect to see the CIA posting private documents on Scribd,"" he said, referring to the site where people can publish documents and other writing.","The ""app store"" would be for federal workers doing government business .

"(CNN)  -- When the late Sen. Edward Kennedy was growing up, there was a family edict: Kennedy men don't cry. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, left, and Ted Kennedy Jr. appear on ""Larry King Live"" on Monday evening. On ""Larry King Live"" Monday night, the senator's sons -- Ted Kennedy Jr. and Rep. Patrick Kennedy -- said times have changed, and that includes the no-tears rule of an earlier generation. In a wide-ranging interview, they also discussed the moment of their father's passing, how their mother, Joan, was handling her ex-husband's death, the legacy of Chappaquiddick, the Kennedy ""curse"" and their impressions of their dad's memoir, ""True Compass."" The 77-year-old senator died August 25 after a battle with brain cancer. ""You know my father was very good at overcoming his own kind of old, traditional sense of not talking about your feelings, not really expressing a lot of emotions,"" Patrick Kennedy told King. The family has had plenty of moments over which to shed tears. King asked Ted Kennedy Jr. if there was crying when he lost his leg to cancer as a boy. ""Absolutely,"" he replied. Ted Kennedy Jr. said his father's memoirs explore his father's emotional tribulations. ""[It talks] about the very difficult things that he had to do, for example telling my grandfather that my uncle Jack had been killed."" Both sons said their father's last year was a gift to them and the family. His brothers  -- President John F. Kennedy and  Robert Kennedy -- had their lives cut short by assassinations in the 1960s.  Watch sons tell of their last year with their father » . ""He also was able to enjoy a lot of accolades, not just from obviously his natural constituencies in the Democratic Party, but ... quite moving testaments from many of his Republican colleagues,"" Teddy Kennedy Jr. said. ""It was really wonderful to see my father actually be able to revel in a lot of those compliments that people had to say about my dad."" ""The really beautiful part about having that extra year with him where he didn't have to traipse all around the world and all around the country was that he was able to spend time with us, and we were able to be there for him emotionally and physically,"" Patrick Kennedy said. Despite their many family tragedies, they debunked the so-called ""Kennedy curse."" ""You don't buy the idea of a curse?"" King asked. ""No. No. Obviously my dad had a sense of spirituality that transcended his ability to face these problems, you know, in a way that would have otherwise paralyzed the normal person,"" Patrick Kennedy said. Ted Kennedy Jr. added,  ""The Kennedy family has had to endure these things in a very open way. But our family is just like ... every other family in America in many ways."" He also described the moment of his father's passing. ""I was there, Larry. It was very peaceful. ... He was suffering in those last few weeks [so] it really did take the sting out of his final passing. ... And it was a very peaceful, extremely spiritual thing."" The sons elaborated on how their mother, Joan, has handled being divorced, her ex-husband's death and their thoughts on their stepmother. ""My dad was and remains a central figure in her life. Obviously, they both shared so much of their lives together,"" Patrick Kennedy said. ""The fact is that my dad and Vicki [Sen. Edward Kennedy's second wife] were so gracious. In all of the holidays, my mom was included. There wasn't any of this bitterness and everything. ... And I really am so grateful to Vicki for that, to my dad for that. ""Vicki was such a great sense of support to my dad at the end. ""My mom has been such an inspiration to me,"" Patrick Kennedy went on. ""She has struggled, as we talked about in an earlier program, with this disease called alcoholism, which I suffer from as well. She's been so public in her fight on this that she's inspired so many people and inspired me."" The sons also talked about their father's memoirs, including the now-infamous episode at Chappaquiddick. After a July 18, 1969, party for those who had worked on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign, Ted Kennedy drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts. Although he managed to escape, his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. Kennedy did not report the incident immediately and later pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. ""Years ago, he spoke to me about exactly what happened that night,"" Ted Kennedy Jr. told King.""And I knew how sorry my father has been each and every day of his life for what happened that night. If he could undo that moment, he would give anything to have been able to do so. ""And in this book ... he doesn't make an excuse -- any excuses. He accepts responsibility for what happened. But ... it's what you do with these tragic events that happen in your life that's really the measure of the person."" They said they drew a lot of inspiration from reading ""True Compass."" ""I feel like this book ... is a gift. It's a gift to me and my children who of course knew him as a grandfather but never really knew him as a man in the fullest sense of the word,"" Ted Kennedy Jr. said. ""I was a little worried when I first opened up the pages because even though he'd been talking about it and even though I'd heard many of these stories before, I really didn't know what to expect. And what I found was ... a riveting, riveting two-day read."" ""Many people castigated him and attacked him and made him a caricature where he actually was a very real person as we've seen in this book,"" Patrick Kennedy told King. ""There wasn't a better politician around. My dad had the ability to just connect with anybody.""","Sons of late Sen. Edward Kennedy say dad learned to embrace emotional side .

"(CNN) -- Just three weeks after Jon and Kate Gosselin announced their separation, there is speculation of a new plus-one in the mix for ""Jon & Kate Plus 8."" Jon Gosselin, here with his sons, was photographed on vacation with another woman. Fans of the show are buzzing about photos of Jon Gosselin apparently on vacation in Saint-Tropez, France, with a young woman who is definitely not his wife and reality TV co-star. People.com identified her as Hailey Glassman, the daughter of Dr. Lawrence Glassman, a surgeon who famously performed a tummy tuck on Kate that was documented for the Gosselins' hit TLC show. Gosselin and Glassman appeared to be the guests of designer Christian Audigier, creator of the Ed Hardy line, and the pair was spotted holding hands, smoking together and lounging aboard Audigier's yacht. The Gosselins' marriage became the focus of their reality show -- which had followed the adventures of the pair raising a set of twins and sextuplets -- amid allegations that Jon was cheating on Kate with 23-year-old teacher Deanna Hummel. Jon repeatedly denied that he had strayed. But after much speculation and tension on the show, the couple announced in June that they had separated. The same day, Kate filed for divorce. Given the media spotlight, dating coach Patti Feinstein said, it's not a good idea for Gosselin to be out with another woman so soon after the marital rift. ""You need to take a little time off from dating, because there is this rebound period,"" Feinstein said. ""He's probably feeling that he wasn't getting enough attention from his wife, so he's all lonely, and he needs to be stroked up. ""Once he gets the feeling that 'I'm loveable; I'm worthy; someone loves me for me and wants to put me first,' "" Feinstein theorized, ""then that person he is dating, either he will dump her, or she will dump him."" Relationship expert Nancy Slotnick said the unfortunate ones in the high-profile tabloid fodder are the Gosselin children: 8-year-old twins Cara and Mady and 5-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Collin, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. ""Their whole TV show is based on them being parents and caring for all of these kids they have, and both of them seem totally wrapped up in themselves,"" Slotnick said. ""It's strange that [Jon] feels like he has to deny the whole thing, then at the same time he is flaunting it."" Psychotherapist M. Gary Neuman advises that parents should wait about a year after a separation before introducing a relationship to their children. ""Children need about a year at least to adjust to the new sense of family and to develop individual relationships with each parent,"" said Neuman, the author of ""Helping Your Kids Cope With Divorce the Sandcastles Way."" ""When Dad has a girlfriend, then kids can see that as an intrusion on their time and their situation."" Neuman, whose Sandcastles program for children of divorce is mandatory through the court system in several states, said children go through a great deal of emotional turmoil in the wake of a broken marriage. Couples should wait at least six months to even let their kids know that they are actively dating, Neuman said. ""It is hurtful to children to think that their parents are dating when it is done so soon after a separation,"" Neuman said. ""Because what it says is that it is minimizing the marriage, and the marriage is crucial to children because they came from this union, and they want to know that their parents were in love when [the children] were born. ""The idea that there could be such a quick move to dating that the children are aware of could devalue their parents' relationship and therefore themselves."" Neuman noted that parents going through a divorce can date privately but said they should also consider counseling before entering another serious relationship to guard against the high divorce rate for second marriages. Jon Gosselin hasn't commented on the seriousness of his apparent relationship or even confirmed that it is a relationship. He told People that he felt ""very relaxed"" during his time away, though he added: ""I keep thinking about the kids and missing them.""","Speculation arises about possible girlfriend for Jon Gosselin .

"(CNN) -- Re-elected German Chancellor Angela Merkel is eyeing a new coalition to replace the ""grand coalition"" her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party shared with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the previous parliament. Angela Merkel has pledged to be ""a Chancellor for all Germans"". If, as expected, Merkel forms a new coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FPD) it will have wide-reaching implications for Germans. The FPD are more economically liberal than Merkel's previous partner, the SPD. According to CNN's Fred Pleitgen, the FPD led by Guido Westerwelle will push for control of some key positions in the new government, including perhaps the finance ministry. Pleitgen believes that economic policy is likely to change dramatically. ""This means a whole lot more pro-business politics for Germany than in the past. You'll probably see tax cuts and it will probably mean smaller government than seen in the past four years,"" he said. Speaking at a post-election news conference on Monday, Merkel said that the result is an opportunity to build a smaller government. ""If one looks at the majority relationships, we will be dealing with a smaller partner, the FDP,"" she said. ""We are happy to use this chance in very difficult economic times to secure jobs, create new ones and drive growth more decisively."" Merkel also pledged to be ""a Chancellor for all Germans"". The election was disastrous for her rival, foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the SPD who saw their vote fall 10 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 to 23 percent. The result is the SPD's worst result since World War II. The results leave the CDU as the strongest party in the German parliament with 27.3 percent of the popular vote -- slightly down on the 27.8 percent it achieved four years ago. Despite being the biggest party in the Bundestag, the vote marked one of the CDU's poorest showings in an election. But its traditional coalition with the Christian Social Union -- who won 6.5 percent of the vote -- means that the CDU/CSU bloc won 33.8 percent of the vote. The biggest winners on election night were the Free Democratic Party (FPD) whose share of the vote rose nearly five percent from 9.8 to 14.6 percent.","Angela Merkel is elected German chancellor for a second time .

"(REAL SIMPLE) -- The summers of my youth were filled with the kinds of activities that were common to every kid in the 80s but are considered almost death-defying these days: tree climbing, bike riding without a helmet, and daylong road trips spent in the backseat of the family car, where we bounced around like Super Balls, nary a seat belt in sight. Kate Simonson and her dad, Mike Fieseler, at her home in Iowa. Still, my mother was safety-obsessed about some things, like swimming lessons. Year after year, she forced me to take them at our local pool in Iowa City. Having to go against my will seemed all the more unfair to me, since my mother could not swim and was actually afraid of the water. But my mother reasoned that if water came between her children and their safety, she would be helpless. ""I can't save you,"" she would calmly state in answer to my pleas to bow out of the lessons. ""So I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you can save yourself."" Real Simple: Mother-daughter relationships . It's no wonder she embraced this philosophy of self-reliance. She knew how unexpectedly life can rob you of someone you care about. My parents adopted me as an infant and went on to have a biological child -- my brother, Jason -- a couple of years later. My dad was an electrician, and he died in an accident on the job when I was three. After his death, my mother had to raise us alone, and she was acutely aware that she was truly on her own, with no backup plan. She was fiercely strong and yet constantly fearful. I have almost no memories of my father. Instead I remember Mike Fieseler. He was a former industrial-arts teacher whom my mother dated off and on for much of my childhood. Jason and I weren't his biggest fans. He was a man of strict rules, while my mom's approach could be more properly deemed overindulgent leniency. iReport.com: Share your bonding with dad memories . We resented having to share the spotlight with him -- a sentiment that was particularly strong every Christmas morning, when we had to wait for him to arrive before we could open gifts. (There is little a man can do to endear himself to children less than delaying Christmas-morning gratification.) And when they stopped dating, when I was 15, I wasn't unhappy to see him go. Real Simple: Small, helpful gestures with big impact . Then, on February 18, 1991, when I was 17, my mother suddenly died of a brain aneurysm. One minute she was laughing with friends, enjoying an evening out; the next, she was unconscious on the floor. She never woke up. Just 19 hours later, she was dead, leaving my 15-year-old brother and me orphans. In the moments of shock and horror that followed, my relatives all gathered in the hospital, and I went home with only a close friend for company (Jason followed a while later). We spent that night on our own. I was numb; it had all happened so fast. I could barely think beyond the immediate moment. The next morning, my grandfather, aunts, and uncles were still immersed in their own mourning. Shell-shocked as I was, I knew I had to let people know what had happened. I saw my mother's address book lying where she had set it only days before and started dialing. One of the phone numbers I found was Mike's. Even though he lived about an hour away, it felt like he was there in an instant. As soon as he walked in, he took charge -- and took care of Jason and me. Among other small kindnesses, he gave me a credit card and said, ""Why don't you buy something to wear to the funeral?"" He gave me permission to be a 17-year-old -- to focus on the more mundane issue of what I was going to wear instead of weighty adult concerns. Real Simple: Father's Day gift ideas . Generally, when children are orphaned, a family member comes forward to take them in. This didn't happen in our case. Everyone had a good reason, I suppose. My mom's father was too old to assume responsibility for us; my mother's sister and her husband had three kids of their own and weren't able to take in any others; her other two siblings were both single and worked long hours. The guardian named in my mother's will was a babysitter that none of us had seen in 15 years. But I can tell you this: Abandonment, even for very good reasons, feels awful. It was heartbreaking and terrifying to have lost the person we loved most and then to be set adrift. Months passed and it felt like our relatives could offer no reassurances. The only news we got was that if Jason and I remained without a guardian, we would have to enter foster care. Our mother was gone, and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves. And, once again, there was Mike. After the funeral, he was a constant presence. He made sure that food filled the cupboards, the bills were paid, and the lawn was mowed. (Mike's adult daughter, Linda, pitched in and took care of his house.) He made sure I went back to school even when it was the last thing I wanted to do. His overbearing personality -- the trait I had hated the most -- is what comforted me the most and got me through those difficult days. Mike says that Linda came up with the idea to make his role with Jason and me official -- he could become our guardian. He was on board right away. Mike still says he never considered not doing it; caring for us was simply the right thing to do. One day he made us his offer. In a moment where the grief of loss and the pain of being unwanted threatened to capture my very breath, this man, whose only tie to us was having dated my mother, said he would be honored to take us in. From that moment on, everything was different. His girlfriend, Patty, threw us a ""guardian party"" when the paperwork became official. It was just a small gathering, but it made us feel special. I received a key chain with my initials, and I remember thinking that the idea behind it was so lovely. Over the years, Mike has become not merely a legal guardian but a real father to me. When I fell into depression in college, unable to get past thoughts of my mother and all I had lost, he was there to listen. When my husband, Eric, and I bought our first house, Mike spent weekends installing insulation and repairing our gutters. He never wrote me off as a good, mature kid who could handle everything herself. He walked the line between trusting me and recognizing when I might need help. And what more could you want from a father than that? His was an unconventional path to parenthood, to say the least. It is not by birth or adoption that I consider this man to be my father; it isn't even through his presence in my childhood. It is rather by sheer good luck on my part. Before he made that generous offer, I felt as though I had lost my mooring and the waters were flooding in; afterward, I simply felt rescued. If my mother had taught me to be strong and depend on myself, Mike imparted his own lesson -- that the world will provide for you, even when you least expect it. Eight years after Mike stepped forward, he walked me down the aisle. Four years after that, I gave birth to his first granddaughter, Emily Michl Simonson. (Mike's legal name is Michl.) The name is a reminder of my saved past and a promise for the future, and I hope one day Emily will see that as well. Because as much as I plan to teach her to swim (indeed, she's now six and enrolled in lessons), I also want her to know this: No matter how fast the waters rise, no matter how hard it may be to keep her head above the waves, someone will throw her a line.

"TAMPA BAY, Florida (CNN) -- Judging by her proud expression as she left the parking lot in her 1991 Honda Accord for the first time, Jessica Ostrofsky could have been driving a brand new sports car. Susan Jacobs' Wheels of Success program helps low-income workers get their own cars. ""I'm so happy,"" she said with a laugh. ""Having this [car] is going to change my life drastically because it's going to make me totally independent."" Ostrofsky, 31, a single mother of three, had been leaving her house before dawn -- toting a stroller, car seat, diaper bag and purse -- to catch a bus. She would go first to her children's baby sitter and then to work. The trip took up to three hours. But on Labor Day, the St. Petersburg, Florida, resident and 19 others received their own cars, thanks to Susan Jacobs' Wheels of Success program. Since 2003, Wheels of Success has refurbished 280 donated cars for low-income individuals and families and helped another 280 clients with vehicle-related services. ""Receiving ... the car is more than just the car,"" said Jacobs. ""People literally see how it's going to change their life"" by knocking down an obstacle that had gotten in their way due to lack of transportation. Jacobs would know. The 59-year-old Tampa resident lost access to reliable transportation more than a decade ago when she ended a relationship and left her car behind. While staying with a friend who lived far from a bus line and across town from Jacobs' evening job, she had to hitch rides to work. That did not last long, Jacobs said, thanks to a used car dealership owner who loaned Jacobs three clunkers while she saved the money to buy her own car. But soon she saw others in a similar predicament. In 2000, as the manager of a staffing agency, Jacobs was struck by the high number of clients who lost jobs in which her office had placed them because they couldn't always get there. Others turned down positions and promotions because limited public transportation kept them from early or late shifts. Jacobs was laid off from her job at the staffing firm in 2001 and turned it into an opportunity to figure out how to ""keep working families working."" She founded Wheels of Success in 2003 with two donated cars. The organization gives low-cost, donated and refurbished vehicles to qualified full-time workers or those with job offers. Employers or social service agencies refer the applicants to the group. Once they receive their vehicles, they must make low monthly payments based on their personal budgets. Those contributions average $40 and go toward repairing cars for other recipients. ""These are used cars. They're not going to last forever,"" said Jacobs. ""What I tell people is, 'This probably isn't your dream car, but hopefully it's going to get you to your dream.' "" Jacobs' group is able to restore donated clunkers to roadworthy operation by partnering with local companies and corporations that help provide auto body work at significantly discounted rates. Wheels of Success cars come with a free, one-year membership to the American Automobile Association. The organization also helps clients with ongoing repair, licensing, insurance and replacement of a car when it dies.  Watch how Jacobs and her group provide working wheels for families » . Clients are required to complete a car maintenance class and donate three volunteer hours to Wheels of Success per month. This helps the group serve more clients and gives each recipient the ability to ""pay it forward,"" said Jacobs. On any given day, Jacobs reports about 100 qualified recipients on the waiting list for vehicles. About 60 new requests come in every other month. ""We would like nothing better than for there not to be a need for us,"" she said. ""But that isn't realistic in the near future and might not be realistic even long-term for people who have three children and day care."" And recipients agree. ""Susan Jacobs is actually saving my life [because] she's saving my job,"" said Ostrofsky, who had been consistently late arriving to work because of the inconsistency of her bus's arrival. ""In turn, she saves my apartment and saves me taking care of my children.""  Watch Ostrofsky receive her Wheels of Success car » . For Jacobs, seeing the results of her work inspires her.

Husien Shehada, at left with his brother, Samer, was shot dead by Miami Beach police on June 14. Four nights later, again in Miami Beach, Lawrence McCoy allegedly pistol-whipped a cab driver and led police on a chase. Police say shots were exchanged. McCoy, also 29, was killed. Officer Adam Tavss, a 34-year-old former history teacher with three years on the force, was involved in both police shootings, the first in Miami Beach since 2003. Although it is not yet clear whether Tavss fired one of the shots that killed McCoy, questions are being raised as to whether the officer was cleared for patrol duty too soon after the first shooting. Police and the Miami-Dade County state attorney's office are investigating the shootings. The inquiry is expected to last several more months. All the records and reports have been sealed.  Watch surveillance video of the first shooting » . The families of Shehada and McCoy are asking the Justice Department to investigate. Tavss, who is now assigned to desk duty, declined through his attorney to speak with CNN, citing the ongoing investigation. Miami Beach Police Chief Carlos Noriega has defended both shootings. ""It is important to note that the subjects in both cases had exhibited aggressive, violent, non-compliant and criminal behavior,"" the chief said in a statement to the media. Noriega added that officers ""are required to make split-second decisions based on a variety of factors and cannot afford to hesitate or be wrong."" The Miami Beach department's standard operating procedure for use of force, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, states that any officer involved in a fatal shooting must be assigned to administrative duties for at least 72 hours. The department also mandates psychological support. Tavss was removed from duty for 72 hours, evaluated and then cleared by Noriega to return to patrol, which is departmental policy. On his first day back out on the street, Tavss was involved in the second shooting. Each of the nation's 20,000 police departments sets its own policy for police involved in shootings and fatalities. Some departments keep the officers off the streets for a week or longer. In virtually all cases, psychological evaluation and counseling are mandatory.  Watch CNN's report on the shootings » . Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and an expert on police use of force and stress management, said she had never heard of an officer being involved in two shootings within four days. ""I think it's a gross error of judgment for any police department to maintain a rule that allows an officer who was involved in a fatal shooting to be back on the streets four days after the incident,"" Haberfeld said. A study by the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice found that officers involved in fatal shootings can be affected for months afterward. ""In the days, weeks and months that follow a shooting, officers may suffer adverse reactions such as sleep interruption, anxiety and depression,"" a report on the study said. Officers ""experienced a range of psychological, emotional and physiological reactions that distorted time, distance, sight and sound,"" the study concluded. In some cases, the study found, officers could not recall firing their weapons. But even experts are undecided on just how much time off the street is enough, because every incident and every police officer is different. ""It's hard for me to estimate whether it's weeks or a little bit more, but certainly not days; certainly not hours. It's just too irresponsible toward the officer and toward the society the officer needs to serve,"" Haberfeld said. Police officers across the country train on how to make difficult split-second decisions on the use of deadly force. The sheriff in neighboring Broward County uses an interactive video screen that places officers into scenarios they might face while on patrol. ""In less than half a second, your pulse may go from 60 to 160, 170, and your heart's beating out of your chest, and you have to make a split-second decision,"" Broward Sheriff's Sgt. Bill Pennypacker said. Witnesses, police and surveillance video obtained by CNN provide the following, sometimes conflicting, accounts of what happened during the two Miami Beach shootings: . Husien Shehada and his brother, Samer, had come from Virginia to spend a long weekend with their girlfriends in Miami Beach. Early on Sunday, June 14, they got into a scuffle with another group of men, who intervened after Samer Shehada allegedly assaulted his girlfriend. Investigators said they believe that the two brothers were looking for revenge against those men when somebody called 911, reporting that two men were walking down the street and that one of them might be carrying a machine gun. The callers said they could see the outline of a large gun underneath his white shirt, and he was carrying it in his left hand. In a color security camera tape released by the Miami Beach Police Department, it appears that one of the brothers was carrying something under his shirt, holding it with his left hand. Tavss and other officers approached the brothers in front of Twist, a popular South Beach nightclub. A grainy black and white videotape shows the brothers together and Husien Shehada falling to the ground. A police officer can then be seen approaching. Samer Shehada said he and his brother were cooperating. ""His hands were up for a good two seconds, three seconds,"" Samer Shehada said. ""He wasn't in the process of raising his hands. His hands were up."" One witness told CNN that when Tavss approached the brothers with his gun drawn, the brothers were belligerent. The witness, Derek Reynolds, was working security at the club that night. He said the two men cursed at police and wouldn't put their hands up. ""It got intense. ... They weren't cooperating,"" he said. ""One guy reached behind him, and he got shot."" Law enforcement sources say a coat hanger and a bottle were found at the scene, but no gun was found. Samer Shehada said that neither he nor his brother was carrying a coat hanger, much less a gun. After the shooting, Tavss was relieved of duty for 72 hours, per department policy. When he returned to street patrol, he was one of several officers who responded to a 911 call reporting that that a taxi driver had been pistol-whipped and his cab stolen. Police confronted Lawrence McCoy on a Miami Beach causeway. According to police, McCoy ran and fired at the officers. McCoy was shot dead by police. It is not yet known whether Tavss fired any shots. John Contini, an attorney representing the families of both men shot by police, said McCoy was shot nine to 11 times. No weapon was found on McCoy. Police found a gun several days later in Biscayne Bay, but they say they don't know if it belonged to McCoy. Lawrence McCoy Sr. said his son's civil rights were violated. ""Michael Vick was convicted and put in jail for two years for killing dogs -- for killing dogs. I want justice for my son,"" he said. Contini said Tavss should be in jail. He also questioned the policy that allowed him back on the street so quickly. ""In fairness to the officer, you don't put him on the street, with a gun and a badge, to be in this situation without allowing for a period of decompression -- for the officer's sake, to get some help,"" Contini said.","Miami Beach police officer Adam Tavss is involved in two police shootings .

"(CNN) -- Although Elizabeth Woodville lived centuries ago, author Philippa Gregory believes women today will find they have a commonality with her. Philippa Gregory took years to research and write ""The White Queen."" Gregory's new novel ""The White Queen"" focuses on the life of Woodville, who was Queen consort to England's Edward IV, and the events that came to be known as the Wars of the Roses. Gregory is herself often referred to in majestic terms as the ""queen of historical fiction."" She has enjoyed international success after a series of best-selling novels, including ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" which was made into a feature film starring Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. The new book, which was years in the making, has Gregory departing from the exploits of the Tudor family and delving into the lives of their predecessors, the Plantagenets. Woodville, a commoner, captured the heart of England's King Edward IV. She was also the mother of Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury, who came to be known as the ""Princes in the Tower."" Their disappearances, and presumed deaths, have long been an enduring mystery. That intrigue, and Woodville's fascinating life, appealed to the historian in Gregory. The British author talked to CNN about her new direction, why Americans can't get enough of historic kings and queens and why she loves living in the past. CNN: Your Tudor series has been so successful. What took you in this direction? Philippa Gregory: I think I felt like I had written a lot on the Tudors and although they are such fascinating characters and [there are] still some I would like to write about, I just got so interested in the back-story, the family that was there before the Tudors, and I thought I'd see if I could take the audience with me. I knew I wanted to do it so I thought I would take the chance. CNN: What drew you to Elizabeth Woodville? Gregory: She is, herself, such an extraordinary character and a spectator of extraordinary times. And, of course, she is the mother of the Princes in the Tower which is possibly the greatest mystery in English history.  Watch Gregory talk about her new novel » . CNN: Why do you think people are still so fascinated with the princes? Gregory: I think because it involves two completely innocent young boys. It really focuses on the absolute wickedness of Richard III, and of course that is debatable, so you've got some controversy there to start off there. It's very much about could Elizabeth have protected them or should she have done so. In a sense, it questions her as a mother and a queen. I think the debate about Richard III is probably the key thing. CNN: Do you think modern-day women will be able to relate to Elizabeth? Gregory: Oh yes. What we see in Elizabeth and what we see in some of the other historical heroines are women who are in an appalling situation. They have no legal rights, they have no financial rights, they have no security and the likelihood of them dying in childbirth was always very, very high. You were talking about a terribly dangerous life for women. Although women today have fantastic rights in comparison, I think we still often have a sense of being in a man's world and having to play by men's rules. I know women identify with that because they often write to me and say they draw great strength and courage from these women who are, in a sense, our heroines. CNN: You have such a huge fan base in the United States. What do you think it is about Americans which draws us to royalty? Gregory: I don't know that it's royalty. I thing a lot of people have a great deal of interest in the royal family, but in a sense the Tudors or even Plantagenets are so far from the modern royal family that I don't think it's that sort of snobbery. I think actually that a lot of American women find it quite hard to fit into modern, American society. They find the conflicts and difficulties of the past a very fruitful escape, so it's lovely just to stop worrying about now and go to somewhere else, but I think women also use the books as a type of role model of how to cope. The Plantagenet women, Elizabeth Woodville the White Queen, they are fighting mythic, epic battles to survive. We fight much more ordinary battles, but sometimes you need the same courage. CNN: What do you enjoy about writing historical fiction? Gregory: I love the research. I am a historian by profession so that's probably the biggest thing for me. The reason that I write historical fiction is so that I can set the story in the past and explore the past. I like the form of it as well. I'm quite a technical writer. I think about how it works and I think the challenge of making the past come alive for the reader is a huge one. CNN: Having had a book made into a film, does that affect your writing at all? Are you thinking about the fact that a new novel might become a movie? Gregory: No. One of the funny things is that getting the history right, doing intense amounts of research, trying to make the characters come alive, living with the characters and putting it all in first person, present tense which is technically quite challenging, all of that keeps me busy enough. I don't even think about the readers. I just think about how the novel is working as a novel. I never think about what will happen with it after I am done.","Philippa Gregory has found fame writing historical fiction .

"PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (CNN)  -- President Obama said Sunday the 34-nation Summit of the Americas was a ""very productive"" meeting that proved hemispheric progress is possible if countries set aside ""stale debates and old ideologies."" President Obama addresses reporters before leaving Trinidad for Washington on Sunday. Speaking to reporters at the conclusion of the summit, Obama cited a potential thaw in relations between the United States and longtime adversaries Cuba and Venezuela, but said the ultimate test ""is not simply words, but deeds."" Leaders did not ""see eye to eye"" on some important issues, but the meeting proved it is possible to ""disagree respectfully,"" the president said. Obama highlighted the importance of using American diplomacy and development aid in ""more intelligent ways.""  Watch Obama talk about summit » . He reached out to the Cuban government before the summit by lifting all restrictions on U.S. citizens wishing to visit or send remittances to relatives in Cuba. Cuba was not represented at the summit, but Obama noted that the leaders of other countries highlighted Cuba's program that sends ""thousands of doctors"" throughout the hemisphere. A number of countries depend heavily on Cuba's medical assistance program. ""It's a reminder ... that if our only interaction with many of these countries is drug interdiction -- if our only interaction is military -- then we may not be developing the connections that can over time increase our influence and have a beneficial effect,"" he said. Obama called Cuban President Raul Castro's recent indication of a willingness to discuss human rights issues ""a sign of progress."" But he said the Cuban government could send a much clearer, more positive signal by releasing political prisoners or reducing fees charged on remittances that Americans send to relatives in the country. Change in Cuba will not come quickly, but it is good for other countries to see that ""we are not dug in into policies that were formulated before I was born,"" Obama said. U.S. policy on Cuba has remained largely unchanged since 1962, when the U.S. government imposed a trade embargo.   Turning to Venezuela, Obama conceded Washington has vast differences with that country's president on economic and foreign policy issues. But he said the strategic interests of the United States would not be endangered by having a ""more constructive relationship"" with the oil-rich nation. Asked what an ""Obama doctrine"" would be, he declined to give a specific answer, but he outlined broad principles such as the importance of listening to other countries. The United States, Obama said, remains the most powerful nation in the world but cannot solve problems such as climate change, drugs and terrorism on its own. ""If you start with that approach, you are inclined to listen, and not just talk,"" he said. Obama, who was set to return to Washington on Sunday, added that the United States is at its best when it stands ""for universal ideals [such as] freedom of speech and religion."" ""If we confess to having strayed from [our] values, it strengthens our hand [and] allows us to speak with greater moral force and clarity,"" he said. The president was criticized over the weekend by several leading Republicans and former CIA director Michael Hayden for releasing four Bush-era memos outlining terror interrogation methods used against suspected al Qaeda operatives.

"GAZA CITY (CNN) -- A large explosion late Tuesday at a wedding party for relatives of a Fatah leader injured at least 50 people in Gaza, Palestinian medical sources said. A bomb Tuesday injured relatives of Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian Authority's national security adviser. Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan, the uncle of the groom, did not attend the wedding, according to witnesses. The cause of the explosion, which occurred at 11:10 p.m.  in Khan Younis, was not known. Dahlan is the Palestinian Authority's national security adviser. Details of Tuesday's explosion were not immediately clear. Dahlan's associates in recent years have been targeted by Hamas as tensions between the militant group and rival Fatah -- the Palestine Liberation Organization's largest faction -- escalated. In January 2007, Hamas gunmen tried to kill Dahlan's bodyguard. Dahlan was not present at the time of the attack. In that month alone, Fatah and Hamas militants abducted more than 50 members of their rival groups -- most of them in the West Bank town of Nablus -- according to Palestinian security sources. Dahlan's nephew was kidnapped the next month amid a fragile cease-fire between supporters of Hamas and Fatah. In late December 2006, Hamas accused Dahlan of orchestrating an assassination attempt on its leader Ismail Haniya. Haniya's son was injured in the attack. Dahlan has described himself to CNN in the past as being involved in directing Fatah's military response to Hamas' military ""provocation."" Dahlan is particularly disliked by Hamas because during his leadership of the Preventive Security Forces in the 1990s, Hamas members were apprehended and tortured. After a series of suicide bombings in Israel in 1996, Dahlan took a major part in the Palestinian Authority's effort to crack down on Hamas. CNN's Talal Abu-Rahma in Gaza City contributed to this report.","Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan is uncle of the groom .

"(WIRED) -- The U.S. Marine Corps has banned Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and other social media sites from its networks, effective immediately. The Marine Corps fears that social media sites such as Facebook could pose a security risk. ""These internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content and are particularly high risk due to information exposure, user generated content and targeting by adversaries,"" reads a Marine Corps order, issued Monday. ""The very nature of SNS [social network sites] creates a larger attack and exploitation window, exposes unnecessary information to adversaries and provides an easy conduit for information leakage that puts OPSEC [operational security], COMSEC [communications security], [and] personnel... at an elevated risk of compromise."" The Marines' ban will last a year. It was drawn up in response to a late July warning from U.S. Strategic Command, which told the rest of the military it was considering a Defense Department-wide ban on the Web 2.0 sites, due to network security concerns. Scams, worms, and Trojans often spread unchecked throughout social media sites, passed along from one online friend to the next. ""The mechanisms for social networking were never designed for security and filtering. They make it way too easy for people with bad intentions to push malicious code to unsuspecting users,"" a Stratcom source told Wired.com. Yet many within the Pentagon's highest ranks find value in the Web 2.0 tools. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has 4,000 followers on Twitter. The Department of Defense is getting ready to unveil a new home page, packed with social media tools. The Army recently ordered all U.S. bases to provide access to Facebook. Top generals now blog from the battlefield. ""OPSEC is paramount. We will have procedures in place to deal with that,"" Price Floyd, the Pentagon's newly-appointed social media czar, said. ""What we can't do is let security concerns trump doing business. We have to do business... We need to be everywhere men and women in uniform are and the public is. If that's MySpace and YouTube, that's where we need to be, too,"" Floyd said. The Marines say they will issue waivers to the Web 2.0 blockade, if a ""mission critical need"" can be proven.

"(CNN) -- Richard Strandlof said he survived the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq, killing four fellow Marines. He'd point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate, collateral damage from the explosion. Richard Strandlof says he didn't mean to cause harm when he lied about being a military veteran. None of it was true. On Friday, the FBI arrested him on the rare charge of ""stolen valor."" Strandlof, 32, was held ""for false claims about receipt of military decorations or medals,"" an FBI news release said. Charges had been filed in Denver, Colorado, the week before, the bureau said. ""The penalty for his crime is up to one year incarceration and a $100,000 fine,"" it said. Before his deception was revealed, crowds ate up his story. He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians. Inspiring and seemingly authentic, he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol. He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance. The whole thing was a lie, he admitted to CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this year.  Watch Strandlof discuss case in June. » . He wasn't at the Pentagon. He was never a Marine. He never served his country. He never graduated from the Naval Academy. He claimed his real name was Rick Duncan. Where was he on 9/11, the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand? ""I was in San Jose, California, watching it in horror on TV with a few other people,"" Strandlof told CNN. He was at a homeless shelter at the time. Strandlof denies being a pathological liar. He says he suffered from ""some severely underdiagnosed mental illness"" and he got caught up in the moment around ""people who are passionate and loved what they did."" He told CNN he had put on a ""production, which I'm sorry for."" ""Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that, and I myself don't know what I can do, short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives, to make that happen,"" Strandlof said. He said he's not sure exactly how he's hurt people. ""It's not for me to say, and time will tell,"" he said. Hal Bidlack, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, is one of those people. He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him. Bidlack -- who lost to incumbent Republican Doug Lamborn -- isn't too happy. ""Once one lie fell apart, the whole series of things ... just cascaded into an ocean of lies,"" he said. Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11, 2001. He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story. ""Now that we know he's a lying fraud,"" Bidlack said, ""I think he was just parroting my own story back to me."" ""There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time."" Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military. He says it's typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness. ""I don't buy that,"" Sterner said. ""What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself. I see this repeatedly. I've had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof's. ... What they're doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego."" Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases. He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity. ""Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did,"" he said. ""Because of Rick Strandlof, the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned."" Ryan Gallucci, a spokesman for AMVETS, agreed. ""Strandlof's actions dishonor the actual sacrifices of veterans,"" he told CNN Monday. ""Second, by commissioning his own advocacy group, Strandlof diverted philanthropy dollars for legitimate causes within the veterans community,"" Gallucci said. ""Personally, it just sickens me,"" Gallucci added. ""As a veteran of the war in Iraq, it's unfathomable that someone would propagate such a lie at a time when American men and women are actually putting their lives on the line, and American families are coping with the loss of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice."" According to the Denver Post, Strandlof came to authorities' attention first in 1997, when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad-check charges. The FBI was investigating him for fraud when he spoke to CNN -- a charge he denied. ""We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects. I did not enrich myself on this. I did not gain any money from this,"" he said. He has not been charged with fraud. That's not the point, said Sterner. ""The one thing he robbed from every veteran that comes out now is credibility."" Gallucci called Strandlof a ""con man"" and the case ""morally repugnant."" ""Strandlof's actions are exploitation plain and simple, and AMVETS is eager to see justice served,"" Gallucci said.

"(CNN) -- Hidden under a quaint resort 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, lies a treasure trove of potential energy that's free and available 24/7. ""Imagineer"" Bernie Karl and his wife, Connie, own Chena Hot Springs Resort near Fairbanks, Alaska. Alaskan entrepreneur Bernie Karl has pioneered modern technology to tap into one of Earth's oldest energy resources: hot water. Karl, 56, likes to call himself an ""imagineer."" Using imagination to fuel his engineering ambitions, this tenacious thinker and self-starter has figured out a way to generate electricity using water that's the temperature of a cup of coffee -- about 165 degrees Fahrenheit. ""There's more opportunity now than there has ever been in the history of man, but we have to reinvent ourselves,"" Karl said. Karl was determined to reinvent the way he consumed energy after he and his wife, Connie, purchased the Chena Hot Springs Resort from the state of Alaska in 1998. ""After we purchased the hot spring, I couldn't believe it, the swimming pool and the hot spring were being heated by diesel fuel, 1,000 gallons every month!"" Karl said. To slash costs and to use resources that were right under his nose, Karl invented a portable geothermal power plant. In a little more than three years, Karl and his wife have severed the facility's dependence on diesel fuel and have saved $625,000, he said. Karl's partnered with the Department of Energy to fund half of a $1.4 million exploration project to find and characterize the geothermal resources at Chena Hot Springs. ""It's a model for what you can do,"" said Karl. Karl developed his tenacity from growing up as the sixth child of 16 siblings on a farm outside of Peoria, Illinois. He said his parents taught him hard work, how to recycle his clothes and shoes, and how to compost food and farm wastes. In the late 1970s, Karl was active in gold mining in Alaska's Central District, and he established the state's largest recycling facility in 1984, he said. Many of  his ideas stem from finding alternative ways to use and reuse resources he already has at his fingertips. After acquiring the 400-acre resort, Karl began trapping water from the underground hot springs, which produce enough power to heat the facility's greenhouses year-round. Most recently, Karl has turned his invention into a separate business by contracting with Peppermill hotel and casino in Reno, Nevada, to build a similar system there. His portable geothermal generator units cost from $350,000 to $375,000, each with the potential to generate enough power for 250 average American homes per year. 'Hot taps' His energy-generating machine lies on a flatbed truck and can be hooked up to oil and gas wells or other heat-emitting sources to generate electricity. Karl adds a branch connection to an oil or gas pipeline, and the process begins when he ""hot taps"" into waste water coming through the pipes. The hot water enters the tubes of an evaporator encased in a common refrigerant found in many air conditioning systems. As the hot water passes through the evaporator, it begins to boil the refrigerant in the casing surrounding the tubes. The heat given off by the boiling refrigerant then causes an attached turbine to spin, which jump-starts a generator, producing electrical power. Next, cooling water enters from another source, recondensing the vapor refrigerant into a liquid. A pump pushes the liquid refrigerant back to the evaporator, so the cycle can start again. The difference in temperatures drives the entire ""binary system."" This setup works exactly the opposite of a refrigerator. ""Chena Hot Springs is home to the lowest-temperature geothermal resource to be used for commercial power production in the world,"" Karl said. ""Oil companies don't drill wells for water, but they have some 5,000 kilowatts of geothermal power at their disposal in unused oil wells. Let's pick the low-hanging fruit and use the wells we have for oil for geothermal power,"" he said. Citing a 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, Karl said harnessing just 2 percent of Earth's internal energy could provide 2,000 times more energy than the entire planet currently consumes -- all free of polluting greenhouse gas emissions. ""Everything goes back, there is no pollution, no smokestack,"" he said. ""We are going to go recycle oil wells and recycle water and put it back in the ground."" Sizzle from the center of the Earth . Though Karl's lower-temperature approach is new, for more than a century, people have been trying to generate electricity from the heat that sizzles from the center of the Earth -- using it to cook, bathe and for electricity. In fact, the word ""geothermal"" comes from the Greek words geo (Earth) and therme (heat). ""We've determined that heat mining can be economical in the short term, based on a global analysis of existing geothermal systems, an assessment of the total U.S. resource and continuing improvements in deep-drilling and reservoir stimulation technology,"" said MIT professor Jefferson W. Tester. In a 2007 study, professors at MIT found that mining the huge amounts of heat that reside as stored thermal energy in the Earth's hard rock crust could supply a substantial portion of the electricity the United States will need in the future, probably at competitive prices and with minimal environmental impact. ""... if we just drill deep enough, most of the U.S. can be transformed into a huge geothermal power zone while drastically reducing the nation's carbon footprint,"" the MIT report said. Widespread geothermal power fuels electricity in a couple dozen countries, with the small island nation of Iceland leading the pack. An unusual abundance of geothermal sources creates 30 percent of Iceland's energy, according to its National Energy Authority. ""Imagination is so important,"" said Karl, whose resort houses 65 employees and can house 210 guests at maximum capacity. ""If Bernie Karl, one of the smallest mom-and-pop operators in the world, can do these things, then why can't all of us?""","Resort owner makes electricity with water the temperature of a cup of coffee .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A potential victim became a compassionate counselor during a recent robbery attempt, changing the would-be criminal's mind -- and apparently his religion. Surveillance video shows storekeeper Mohammad Sohail holding a robber at bay with a shotgun. Storekeeper Mohammad Sohail was closing up his Long Island convenience store just after midnight on May 21 when -- as shown on the store's surveillance video -- a man came in wielding a baseball bat and demanding money. ""He said, 'Hurry up and give me the money, give me the money!' and I said, 'Hold on',"" Sohail recalled in a phone interview with CNN on Tuesday, after the store video and his story was carried on local TV. Sohail said he reached under the counter, grabbed his gun and told the robber to drop the bat and get down on his knees. ""He's crying like a baby,"" Sohail said. ""He says, 'Don't call police, don't shoot me, I have no money, I have no food in my house.' "" Amidst the man's apologies and pleas, Sohail said he felt a surge of compassion. He made the man promise never to rob anyone again and when he agreed, Sohail gave him $40 and a loaf of bread. ""When he gets $40, he's very impressed, he says, 'I want to be a Muslim just like you,' "" Sohail said, adding he had the would-be criminal recite an Islamic oath. ""I said 'Congratulations. You are now a Muslim and your name is Nawaz Sharif Zardari.'""

"FORT HOOD, Texas (CNN)  -- Families of tens of thousands of soldiers based at Fort Hood have one military wife to thank for a more normal routine at the base. A blunt conversation with an Army wife started Lt. Gen. Rick Lynch on the path toward his family-first policies. When Lt. Gen. Rick Lynch first took over as commander of the largest Army base in the United States, a soldier's wife approached him and gave him a talking to about how soldiers don't ""really"" get to spend time at home when they come home from war. ""She said 'General, don't talk to us about dwell time. Because my husband might as well be in Iraq,'"" Lynch told CNN last week. ""'He comes home after the kids go to bed, we never see him on weekends and you take him away to train all the time.'"" Lynch said that woman's comments ""really hit me in the gut."" In response, Lynch made ""focus on the family"" a key part of Fort Hood's environment. He insists that every soldier on a day schedule leave work in to be home for dinner by 6 p.m. On Thursday, many are told to leave by 3 p.m. so they can have the afternoon with the family. And no one at Fort Hood works weekends unless Lynch signs off on it. He likes to point out that when a soldier deploys overseas, the only thing he can't get is time with his family, so it's important to get it between deployments -- what the military calls ""dwell time."" Lynch's ""home by dinner"" order creates a daily traffic jam on the base in Killeen, Texas, as tens of thousands of soldiers leave at once. Master Sgt. Guadalupe Stratman enjoys Fort Hood's family-first attitude. She has a husband and three sons. When she's not cooking dinner after leaving the base, she's helping with homework or ""just watching them grow."" It's not just about keeping military spouses and children happy, it's about creating a more resilient soldier; one less likely to abuse drugs or alcohol, injure or kill himself in a traffic accident or fall to suicide, Lynch says. It's working. No soldier has been killed on the roads around Fort Hood in more than 200 days. And although the base has seen two suicides since the start of the year, that is much less than some other major Army bases. Lynch is taking other steps to battle stress and suicides at Fort Hood. He's opened a soldier ""Resiliency Campus"" -- a city-block-sized collection of buildings with programs and activities aimed at improving a soldier's mind, body and spirit. And there is a weekly meeting of the base's ""suicide prevention board,"" which Lynch usually chairs. This isn't to say that all the soldiers at Fort Hood are completely well-adjusted and ready for their next deployment. CNN spoke to one squad of soldiers who'd returned from a deployment to Fort Hood just a week before our visit. One soldier said he has ""anger issues. I get angry over a lot of little things."" Others are bothered by crowds or just driving around town. But even those young veterans, for whom the stress of being in a war zone continues after their return to their home base, have found ways to cope. The spend their off-hours together playing video games or just remembering what they went through together. ""Some of the roughest times we've had, we sit back and laugh,"" Pfc. Keven Abbott said. ""We are very well together -- you cannot bring us down.""  Watch CNN's Barbara Starr report on sorrows and joys of returning home » . The successful fight against stress at Fort Hood is getting noticed at the Pentagon. Among others, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has praised Lynch's programs. But just after CNN's visit to Fort Hood, the Defense Department sent out a news release announcing that Lynch would be moving on to his next job in the Army. What remains to be seen is whether his ideas about putting families first and creating ""resilient soldiers"" will carry on at Fort Hood after he leaves.","Lt. Gen.

"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- At least 21 people were killed and more than 80 others injured during three days of rioting here last week, a police spokeswoman said Monday. Ugandan police ride past a burning barricade in the Natete suburb of Kampala on Friday. Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said 663 people had been arrested and 86 people had been injured. President Yoweri Museveni is to address the violence in a speech to parliament slated for Tuesday afternoon. Though the mood on the streets in the capital city was calm Monday, tensions between Museveni and the Buganda kingdom -- headed by King Ronald Mutebi II, the ruler of the Baganda tribe -- have intensified in recent years. They erupted into violence last Thursday, when the government said it would not allow the king to travel to an area inhabited by a renegade rival group. Kings in the east African nation are limited to a ceremonial role overseeing traditional and cultural affairs. Government officials and the Buganda kingdom have been at odds for years, sparring over land, sovereignty and political power. After the travel ban, mostly young Bagandans took to the streets, stealing ammunition from a police station and confronting officers, accusing them of harassment. ""The government is wrong to undermine cultural institutions, which are the backbone of Uganda's heritage,"" said Mzamiru Balidha, a resident of Kampala. ""Cultural leaders must be left alone since they are not interfering in politics."" Rioters burned tires and cars, set buildings afire and looted stores. Streets in the capital were strewn with debris over the weekend, including torched cars and burned tires. By Sunday, police and the army were patrolling deserted streets as residents tried to return to normalcy after the protests. ""I'm happy to see that there is peace now,"" said Harry Sagara of Kampala. ""Now people can return to work."" A government official said Sunday that the two leaders have pledged to meet and address their differences. ""Both the central government and the king are still working out details of the meeting,"" said Daudi Migereko, the minister of parliamentary affairs. In Washington, the U.S. State Department cautioned Americans in Uganda about the potential for more violent demonstrations this week. ""U.S. citizens should be aware that even peaceful gatherings and demonstrations can turn unexpectedly violent,"" the State Department travel alert states. Bagandans are the dominant ethnic group and one of four ancient kingdoms in the nation.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British military marked a grim milestone Friday as the number of troops killed in Afghanistan surpassed the death toll in Iraq. A British Marine is shown in Arbroath, Scotland, last year on the eve of a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan.

The British military has lost 179 soldiers in Iraq. Five soldiers were killed Friday in two explosions that rocked the same patrol near the town of Sangin in Helmand province, where British troops are based. The Defence Ministry earlier announced the deaths of three other soldiers in Helmand.

"(CNN) -- English rugby coach Dean Richards has been banned from coaching for three years for his part in masterminding a fake blood injury to one of his players. English rugby coach Dean Richards admitted asking his player to fake an injury using artificial blood. In a scandal dubbed ""bloodgate"" the 46-year-old admitted to getting one of his players to use fake blood to feign injury in order to make an otherwise impossible substitution happen at a crucial time in a European Cup quarterfinal between his side Harlequins and Leinster. Sport is littered with competitive personalities, but some are prepared to go further than others in order to achieve victory. Do you agree with CNN's list of sport's top ten notorious rulebreakers? 1. Diego Maradona, football - For years Maradona shared the credit for his most remembered goal with a higher being. ""A little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God"" was his account of how he scored the opener in Argentina's 2-1 victory over England during the 1986 World Cup semi-final. However, in 2005 Maradona admitted that it was less divine intervention than retribution that was behind the now infamous goal. Referring to the British control of the Falkland Islands which lie just off Argentina and were the scene of a bitter war in 1982, he said: ""I don't for a second regret scoring that goal with my hand.. whoever robs a thief gets a 100-year pardon."" 2. Rosie Ruiz, the marathon - After taking gold-medal in the 1980 Boston Marathon and setting the third-fastest time ever recorded for a female runner in the process, many spectators noticed how remarkably sweat-free and relaxed the 23-year old Ruiz appeared as she took to the winner's podium. Race officials were also dismayed by the jubilant victor's absence from the numerous photographs taken during the competition, and none of the checkpoint monitors or fellow runners were able to recognize the young champion after the 26-mile race had ended. It was not long before a few members of the crowd came forward to reveal that they had seen Ruiz simply jump in during the last half-mile, where she duly sprinted to the finish line. 3. Carlos ""Panama"" Lewis, boxing - In the early 1980s ""Panama"" was regarded as one of the most formidable boxing trainers of his time. These days he is typically regarded as one of the sports murkiest operatives. Panama's lowly stature was secured during the 1983 fight between his boxer Lewis Resto and Billy Collins Jr. Before the fight Panama had soaked Resto's hands in plaster of Paris and removed the padding from his gloves. Resto punched Collins Jr to a pulp and, nine months later, Collins Jr - suffering from depression caused by the fight - died in a car accident that many believe was suicide. Diego Maradona scores against England for Argentina using what he called the ""hand of God."" 4. Spain's 2000 Paralympic team, basketball - The 2000 Sydney Paralympics witnessed the basketball team from Spain take the gold medal in the ""intellectual disability"" category. However, soon after Carlos Ribagorda, an undercover journalist, revealed that the players on Spain's team had not actually undergone the testing required to prove mental deficiency. It turned out that ten of the twelve players on the Spain basketball team had no such disability. The International Paralympic Committee subsequently decided to scrap the category due to the difficulties of assessing the disabilities of performers. 5. Michel Pollentier, cycling - In 1978 the Belgian rider was ahead of the rest of the field after the mountain stage of the Tour de France. He submitted a urine sample which came back clean from drugs, the only problem was it wasn't his urine! It transpired that Pollentier had used a sample given to him by his teammate that was delivered via a plastic pipe concealed in his shorts, he was subsequently thrown from the Tour. 6. Dwain Chambers, athletics - The British sprinter had high hopes of taking on the world's elite after showing early potential but his career was derailed when he tested positive for the banned substance THG in 2003.  Slapped with a two-year suspension and lifetime ban from the British Olympic Association (BOA) Chambers later revealed he was taking a cocktail of seven different drugs. 7. Boris Onishchenko, fencing -  As a fencer for the Soviet Union, Boris Onishchenko performed unbelievably for his nation's modern pentathlon team at the 1976 Olympics. And there was good reason as the British team, who complained to the organizers, suspected. It turns out the wily athlete used an illegal switch to trigger the system that registered a hit from his foil on his opponents, which guaranteed him victory. The illegal switch on his grip was discovered resulting in his disqualification from the Games. The British sprinter Dwain Chambers admitted to taking a cocktail of seven different drugs while competing. 8. Dora Ratjen, high jump - In the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin, Adolf Hitler was determined to prove his philosophy about the Aryan race -- that meant winning at any cost. Ratjen, who was known for her low voice and reluctance to share the shower room with the other female athletes, was the German entry for the women's high jump. After setting a new world record, Britain's Dorothy Tyler, the former holder, suggested to officials that Ratjen was a man. After some research Ratjen was found serving as a waiter called Hermann. Dora, born Hermann Ratjen, had in fact been a member of the Hitler Youth and said that the Nazis had made him participate as a woman. 9. Fred Lorz, the marathon - In the burning heat of the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, only 14 of the 32 starting marathon runners made the finish line. All the more credit then to Fred Lorz, the New Yorker who burst through the white tape after three hours and 13 minutes, to be announced the winner. Having bagged a photograph with the Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the President of the United States, Lorz was on his way to collect an apparently well-deserved gold medal. However, word soon spread that the American had spent nearly half the marathon sitting down...in a car. Despite claiming it was just a practical joke, Lorz received a lifetime ban. 10. Ben Johnson, 100 meters - Having taken gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and slicing four-hundredths of a second off the world record, Canada's 100m sprint champion took to the mic: ""I'd like to say my name is Benjamin Sinclair Johnson Jnr and this world record will last 50 years, maybe 100."" Only hours after the race had ended, a urine sample belonging to the sprinter was found to contain the anabolic steroid stanozolal resulting in the time being scrapped from the record books. Johnson protested his innocence but, after a two-year suspension, he was banned in 1993 for testing positive again - and this time it was for life.","English rugby coach Dean Richards banned for role in ""bloodgate""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Dominick Dunne, the former Hollywood producer and best-selling author known for his Vanity Fair essays on the courtroom travails of the rich and famous, died Wednesday in New York city after a long battle with bladder cancer. Dominick Dunne wrote five best selling books and covered high society crimes for Vanity Fair. Dunne, who described himself as ""a high-class Zelig,"" was 83. Called ""Nick"" by his friends, Dunne was putting the finishing touches on his final novel, which he said he planned to call ""Too Much Money,"" when his health took a turn for the worse. He flew to Germany earlier this month for another round of stem cell treatments at the same Bavarian clinic where the late Farrah Fawcett was treated. He was hospitalized upon his return to New York, then sent home. As a correspondent for Vanity Fair magazine, Dunne was a fixture at some of the most famous trials of our times -- Claus von Bulow, William Kennedy Smith, the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Michael Skakel and Phil Spector. He discovered his magazine writing career in his 50s, through personal tragedy -- his daughter's murder. He vented his anger at the legal system in ""Justice: A Father's Account of the Trial of his Daughter's Killer,"" following the murder trial of John Sweeney, the estranged boyfriend who strangled 22-year-old Dominique Dunne, in 1982. Sweeney spent fewer than three years in prison. Dunne's article was published by Vanity Fair and he accepted then-editor Tina Brown's offer to write full-time for the magazine. Calling himself a ""diarist,"" Dunne dropped bold-faced names as he spilled behind-the-scenes nuggets gleaned from courtrooms and dinner parties alike. ""It is fair to say that the halls of Vanity Fair will be lonelier without him and that, indeed, we will not see his like anytime soon, if ever again,"" said editor Graydon Carter in a tribute posted on the magazine's Web site. He bristled at one writer's oft-repeated description of him as ""Judith Krantz in pants."" He preferred to be known as a crime victim's advocate and frequently spoke at events sponsored by victims' groups. The fact he personally knew many of the people he wrote about set Dunne apart from other crime writers. Dunne wrote that he met music producer Phil Spector for dinner three times during the Simpson murder trial. ""He knew every detail of the trial and story,"" Dunne wrote. ""He carried a gun when we saw each other, but he never pulled it on me."" Spector later became a defendant in a trial Dunne covered. He spoke to CNN in June, while promoting the DVD release of a documentary of his life called ""After the Party."" At the time, he said he was feeling well, happy, and hopeful the treatments were working. ""I'm pro stem cell,"" he said. But even then, he seemed to know he was in a race against time. ""I want to have one more best seller, before I cool,"" Dunne said. ""It's wonderful to have a best seller."" He said his personal story puts the lie to the claim by another high society writer, the late F. Scott Fitzgerald, that there are no second acts in life. ""This is the third act,"" Dunne said. ""I have a novel coming out. I finally got it finished in the clinic ... I'm calling it 'Too Much Money.' That's a hooking title."" Dunne looked back on his life during the hour-long lunchtime phone chat. He said he had just one regret -- his failed marriage to his wife, Lenny, who died in 1997. The couple never formally divorced. ""I loved that marriage,"" he said. ""Lenny was the love of my life. And yet I ruined it. I wasn't formed yet. The regret is that I hurt her."" Marc Juris, truTV's executive vice president, recalled Dunne as ""a master storyteller ... who always kept his eye on the human story behind the crimes."" Besides hosting his own show on truTV, Dunne appeared frequently on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""Dominick Dunne was one of the finest people I've known,"" King said. ""He was a terrific writer, a raconteur, and a familiar face on 'Larry King Live' for many years. He was a wonderful human being."" In court, Dunne always dressed impeccably, wearing dark jackets and gray flannels, sharply starched shirts complete with cufflinks and club-style ties. He used a fountain pen to jot notes in small bound notebooks. He was unabashedly pro-prosecution, although he said he ""lost no sleep"" over Robert Blake's acquittal on a charge of killing his wife, and was troubled by Martha Stewart's conviction on lying to investigators about a stock deal. When Simpson's acquittal was announced in 1995, Dunne's jaw dropped and the courtroom cameras caught his expression. It became an iconic image. Simpson later was found liable in a wrongful death suit and ordered to pay more than $33 million to the victims' families. Dunne had been battling cancer for several years -- a fight that became widely known when he collapsed in court last year while covering Simpson's Las Vegas armed robbery trial. He wasn't in court to see Simpson sentenced to prison. Dunne's life story reads like one of his novels. He was born to a well-to-do family in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1925; his father was a cardiac specialist. Dunne attended preppy Williams College, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, winning the Bronze star. He later found work in New York as a stage manager for ""The Howdy Doody Show,"" a popular kids' show when television was in its infancy. He moved to Hollywood, rubbing elbows with the biggest names in show business during the 1960s, and became a movie producer. But he soon became addicted to alcohol and drugs, hit bottom and became his own worst nightmare -- a nobody. He sobered up and retired to a one-room cabin in Oregon to write his first novel, then headed back to New York with just a suitcase and his typewriter. In 1985, Dunne wrote his first best-seller, ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles,"" loosely based on a society killing. That success was followed by ""People Like Us,"" ""An Inconvenient Woman,"" ""A Season in Purgatory,"" and, following the Simpson trial, ""Another City, Not my Own."" His brother, the late John Gregory Dunne, was an accomplished author and was married to Joan Didion, a wit and famous writer. In fact, Dunne has said, he was so daunted by their talent that it probably delayed the start of his own writing career by decades. Asked if he believed in past lives, Dunne, ever the firm believer in second acts, said: ""I believe in future ones.""","Dunne had been receiving stem cell treatments in Europe for bladder cancer .

"(CNN) -- Around 1,000 people accused of being witches in Gambia have been locked up in secret detention centers and forced to drink a dangerous hallucinogenic potion, according to human rights organization Amnesty International. Amnesty claims Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, pictured in 2006, invited ""witch doctors"" to the West African nation. At least two people have died after drinking the liquid while many more have suffered serious kidney problems. Others suffered injuries as a result of being severely beaten, Amnesty said Wednesday as it called on authorities to ""put an immediate stop to the witch-hunting campaign."" Amnesty claimed Gambian President Yahya Jammeh had invited ""witch doctors"" -- believed to be from neighboring Guinea -- to the West African nation  following the death of his aunt. Jammeh, a former soldier who has ruled Gambia since leading a military coup in 1994, is reported to believe that witchcraft was involved in her death, according to Amnesty. CNN contacted State House, the presidential residence in the Gambian capital, Banjul, but no-one was available to comment. ""I have no information,"" a woman told CNN. Victims and their relatives tell Amnesty that ""witch doctors"" accompanied by police, soldiers and security forces have been visiting villages and seizing people accused of being witches by force and at gunpoint. Members of Jammeh's personal guard, known as ""green boys,"" are also alleged to have taken part in the campaign. In the most recent incident on March 9, 300 people from the village of Sintet were forced to go to a farm owned by Jammehk, Amnesty said. One of those seized said he had been held for five days and forced to drink ""dirty water"" containing poisonous herbs which caused instant diarrhoea and vomiting. ""I experienced and witnessed such abuse and humiliation. I cannot believe that this type of treatment is taking place in Gambia. It is from the dark ages,"" the victim told Amnesty. Hundreds of Gambians have also fled to neighboring Senegal following attacks on their villages, according to Amnesty. It also said it was concerned that a prominent opposition lawmaker, Halifa Sallah, who was arrested earlier this month after investigating the witchcraft claims for a newspaper, could be at risk of being tortured while in custody. Halifa, a former presidential candidate, heads the People's Democratic Organization of Independence and Socialism and is minority leader in Gambia's national assembly.","Amnesty International: 1,000 seized in Gambia in ""witch-hunt"" campaign .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Caring for a car has you a befuddled. The honeymoon's over, and bureaucratic tasks are beating out bliss. You're meeting with a prospective babysitter or housekeeper, a stranger you'll entrust with much of your life. Rory Tahari, with son Jeremey, hopes to make life's to-do's more manageable with a new book and iPhone app. How do you know what to do? Where should you go and when? What should you ask these people? You need a list! If figuring out the answers to these kinds of questions leaves you loopy, Rory Tahari has a new book that may have your name on it. ""Lists for Life: The Essential Guide to Getting Organized and Tackling Tough To-Dos"" is just what it says it is: a compilation of lists to help readers navigate everything they might need for weddings and funerals, household maintenance and vacations, divorces and diaper bags.  Watch Tahari discuss the book » . Along the same lines, she's behind a new iPhone application -- a travel packing list, available through the iTunes store -- that she said has been downloaded in about a dozen countries. ""It's just how my brain is wired. It's part of my DNA,"" said Tahari, vice chairwoman and creative director of Elie Tahari, the fashion design house bearing her husband's name. ""I don't know how to operate other than to make a list."" CNN sat down with Tahari to discuss when her list-making started, what she's passed on to her children (son Jeremey, 8, weighs in) and how being stuck in a snowstorm inspired her. Here are excerpts from that interview. CNN: You've earned the nickname ""The List Mistress,"" but when did this, dare I say, obsession start? Tahari: From a very young age, I was a compulsive list-maker. I was always organizing something or doing some kind of list. The first list I really remember making was taking an inventory of every piece of clothing in my closet and seeing how many different outfits I could make. I think I came up with 112 combinations. CNN: The book covers such a wide range of topics: weddings, the home, pregnancy, travel, medical, emergencies, divorce and more. How many of these lists are or were based on your own organizational needs? Tahari: Ninety percent of the book came from actual experiences I've lived through myself. The other 10 percent, I basically did the research. [She has a degree in journalism and is a former TV producer.] . I fell off a horse two years ago, and I broke my back. I'd never been hospitalized before, so I never knew what it was like to be hospitalized. If you have a friend or family member who's in the hospital, bring them a blanket. They're always going to be cold, and the blankets they give you in the hospital don't cut it. And the nurses? You need them; they don't need you. A little batch of cookies or brownies goes a long way with the nurses. And you know what? You'll have a lot better hospital stay. CNN: Some of these to-do lists seem more fitting and standard than others. How did you decide what would go in the book? Tahari: People say, ""Why the emergency chapter? If you're in the middle of an emergency, you're not going to grab the book."" Obviously, you're not going to have the book with you in the middle of the emergency. ... But I lived through at least three tornados in Atlanta [Georgia], one terrorist attack in New York and one blackout in New York. And after the blackout, I realized my family doesn't have a  plan. I wanted to at least stimulate the idea of having a plan. CNN: Can you give me an example of a topic you had to research? Tahari: Cars. I had to have help with cars. Although, in fourth or fifth grade, there was some crazy snowstorm in Atlanta [where she grew up]. I was stuck in carpool on the way home from school with eight people for eight hours. I had one Tootsie Roll in my backpack, and let me tell you, a Tootsie Roll between eight people did not go far. So I decided in the car section that I wanted to have an emergency road list, a check list of things to have in the car. I was stuck in the car for eight hours, starving to death. CNN: You've used list making to help friends figure out practical things they need to do, but do the lists you've made over the years ever venture into the emotional or psychological -- say, for example, pro-con lists for staying in a relationship? Tahari: This book is not an advice guide. It's a to-do list. There's not a lot of prose in the book. I just want to be told what to do. I don't really want to hear advice. I don't need to hear the story. Just tell me what to do. CNN: So, Jeremey, how organized are you? Jeremey: In school, I don't have such an organized desk because I'm always busy and don't have time to clean up. But I do make some kinds of lists. I sort of have a list in my head. I memorize it. CNN: How about when you go on a trip, Jeremey? Are you a good packer or unpacker? Jeremey: I would write down stuff on paper and then stick it on the drawers in the hotel [so he knows where everything is]. My dad, when he's packing, he just takes all the clothes and goes like this [imitating his dad's voice], ""Jeremey, help me throw in the clothes."" I try to fold them up and put them in. I'm like, ""Dad, you're not supposed to do that."" Tahari: I definitely think he is taking after me.","Figuring out to-do lists of life made easier with new book and iPhone app .

"(CNN)  -- Typhoon Morakot bore down on Taiwan Friday, packing 89 mph (143 kph) winds and threatening to soak the entire island when it makes landfall Saturday morning, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said. A man fights against strong winds in Hsintien, Taipei county, Taiwan, on Friday. As of 10 a.m. Friday (2 a.m. GMT), wind gusts were reaching 112 mph, and Morakot, a medium-strength typhoon, was moving west-northwest at 14 mph en route to landfall, the agency said. Already, mudslides and landslides were occurring on the land, as airlines canceled flights, and government offices, schools and the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed for the day, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. The storm was centered about 124 miles (200 km) southeast of Taipei and could wind up directly over the capital, said CNN meteorologist Kevin Corriveau. He predicted its impact would be massive. ""This storm has already dumped about 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in the central and southern part of the island, and they're still expecting another 500 (20 inches) to 800 millimeters (32 inches) of rain over the next 24 to 48 hours,"" he said.  Watch how the storm is affecting life on the island » . Drought in recent months has severely affected the area, leaving the ground so hard that it cannot absorb the rainfall, Corriveau said. However, the island tends to prepare well for typhoons, Corriveau added. ""They take it very seriously,"" Corriveau said. ""Just like Cuba is very good at handling hurricanes, Taiwan is very good at handling typhoons."" On Thursday, Taiwanese Premier Liu Chao-shiuan examined the island's emergency operation center and asked all personnel to stay on high alert over the next day, with the typhoon forecast to ""affect all regions of Taiwan,"" according to CNA. Taiwan and eastern China are particularly vulnerable to flash flooding and mudslides because of the proximity of the mountains to the sea.

"(CNN) -- Landslides unleashed by tropical depression Parma across the Philippine province of Benguet have killed at least 122 people and left 31 missing, officials said Friday. A boatman transports three empty wooden coffins on the edge of Laguna Lake east of Manila on Thursday. Four people had been found alive in debris, and at least 22 had been injured by landslides that started Thursday afternoon and continued all night, affecting several municipalities, said Elmer Foria, police senior superintendent. Parma, which had been downgraded from a typhoon, poured more rain onto sodden and already weakened ground. Flooding had inundated 32 towns and two cities, Dagupan and Urdaneta, according to Rocky Baraan, provincial administrator of Pangasinan. Some 35,000 people had fled to evacuation centers, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council. The worst-hit areas included Bayambang, Alcala and Basista, the news agency reported. People clambered onto rooftops as floodwaters rose, calling and texting for help. Rescue trucks were hampered by floodwaters that reach the roofs of single-story houses, Baraan said. About 16 rubber rescue boats had been deployed. Since the rains started in central Luzon, three dams in the Pangasinan area have been releasing vast amounts of water -- up to 10 million cubic meters per hour at one dam, dam officials said. Water passing through the three dams -- the Ambuklao, the Binga and the San Roque -- is rushing into the Agno River, which has been swollen since Thursday and affects seven towns in eastern Pangasinan, dam officials said. Water released from the San Roque dam has contributed to the flooding in eastern Pangasinan, acknowledged Alex Palada, division manager for flood forecasting and warning of the National Power Corporation. Dam officials had no choice but to maintain safe water levels, he added, noting that he alerted Pangasinan Governor Amado Espino. The governor started to evacuate residents Thursday when the Agno River started to rise, Palada said. In the last several days, water has become the Philippines' biggest enemy, as Parma, locally known as ""Pepeng,"" dumped as much as 36 inches (91.4 centimeters) of rain in some parts of the nation of islands, compounding misery in areas already flooded by earlier storm Ketsana. Parma was forecast to have winds of no greater than 39 mph (63 kph) by Friday. The U.S. Navy was expected to join rescue operations in Pangasinan, according to the agency. Journalist Lilibeth Frondoso and CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","Three dams in Pangasinan area release vast amounts of water, officials say .

"UTTAR PRADESH, India (CNN)  -- An Indian police office grabs two fists-full of a suspect's hair; twists and then lifts until the suspect's feet dangle off ground. The suspect: A 6-year-old girl accused of stealing 280 rupees or about 6 dollars. The incident resulted in one officer being fired, another suspended. Charges against the girl were dropped. It was all caught on tape in February of this year. Harcharand Singh and his wife. Mr Singh says their son, accused of thief, died in police custody. Two years earlier in another Indian state another caught on tape moment. A police officer watches as a crowd beats an accused thief. Then the policeman binds the suspect and ends up dragging him behind a motorcycle leaving large raw patches of skin on the suspect's body. The accused survived the thrashing. Two officers were fired in the incident but were later reinstated by a panel that blamed the crowd. Brutal police tactics are all too common in India according to the latest report by Human Rights Watch in India. Naureen Shah with Human Rights Watch says the report is based on interviews with 80 police, 60 alleged victims and other experts. ""The police are taking the law into their own hands."" Shah says. ""They are acting as a vigilante force and they're saying this is a bad guy instead of building a case against him we're going to kill him, we're going to take these harsh measure cause it has to get done."" ""Police administration are meant to protect, but they are becoming predators."" Harcharand Singh says. He is the father of a suspect he says died in police custody. Singh and his wife are dirt poor and partially blind. They sit on a bed with tears in their eyes as they speak about losing their son Pradeep. They say police hauled Pradeep away one night accusing him of being involved in a car theft and shooting. Days later they say he died in police custody. Police refused to comment on the case or the report. ""We are scared."" Mother Ram Vati Singh says through tears. ""What else can we do? We have no money so that we can leave or put up a fight with the police."" The case was one of dozens highlighted in the Human Rights Watch report used as yet another example of what they say is out of control police behavior.  Watch a report on abuse cases » . But the report also revealed something else. The terrible conditions police work and live in. Many live in police stations for days even months at a time unable to go home to see their families because they are expected to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Some work and live in tents in scorching temperatures. Their bathroom facilities are often wretched. Their cooking facilities sometimes made up of bricks with fire wood. The number of cases and pressure to solve them is intense. Police also say they are short staffed. One police official told us in his jurisdiction there are 70 police for a population of 250-thousand people, something CNN is unable to independently confirm. There are no computers for reports so police officers fill everything out by hand. Some departments even run out of paper to write the reports according to the Human Rights Watch report. Former Delhi Police Commissioner Ved Marwah says the conditions are dire. ""The policemen are treated very inhumanly and that's why he gets desensitized and brutalized by his living and working conditions an by his interaction with the common citizen and with his superiors and that desensitization is reflected in the way an average policeman deals with the public at large."" Marwah says. Marwah says there is also interference from politicians in police investigations. ""Politics plays a very negative role."" He says. Today's politicians, every politician there are good politicians and bad politicians, every politician looks upon it as a profession and he's there to make a quick buck and when he gets that control over the police, he uses an misuses not to ensure that the police enforces the rule of law, but to see that the police commits or doesn't commit a particular action to help him in his personal ends."" Efforts to reform police activities were ordered by India's supreme court three years ago. Marwah and Human Rights Watch both agree the ruling was never implemented. However the current government is promising changes. But Marwah says until it really happens, the abuses by and to police will continue unabated. ""Because ultimately the police, unlike the army, is absolutely under political control. He says ""If those who control the police have no will to reform it, then nothing is going to happen.""","Video shows girl being physically abused by police, rights group says .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Ameneh Bahrami is certain that one day she'll meet someone, fall in love and get married. But when her wedding day comes, her husband won't see her eyes, and she won't see her husband. Bahrami is blind, the victim of an acid attack by a spurned suitor. Ameneh Bahrami said her attacker pestered her with marriage demands. If she gets her way, her attacker will suffer the same fate. The 31-year-old Iranian is demanding the ancient punishment of ""an eye for an eye,"" and, in accordance with Islamic law, she wants to blind Majid Movahedi, the man who blinded her. ""I don't want to blind him for revenge,"" Bahrami said in her parents' Tehran apartment. ""I'm doing this to prevent it from happening to someone else."" Bahrami says she first crossed paths with Movahedi in 2002, when they attended the same university. She was a 24-year-old electronics student. He was 19. She never noticed him until they shared a class. He sat next to her one day and brushed up against her. Bahrami says she knew it wasn't an accident. ""I moved away from him,"" she said, ""but he brushed up against me again.""  Watch Bahrami return to the attack scene for the first time » . When Bahrami stood up in class and screamed for him to stop, Movahedi just looked at her in stunned silence. He wouldn't stay silent for long. Bahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi kept harassing her and making threats, even as he asked her to marry him. ""He told me he would kill me. He said, 'You have to say yes.' "" On a November afternoon in 2004, Movahedi's threats turned to violence. That day at 4:30 p.m., Bahrami left the medical engineering company where she worked. As she walked to the bus stop, she remembers sensing someone behind her. She turned around and was startled to see Movahedi. A moment later came the agonizing pain. Movahedi had thrown something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin. ""I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me!' "" The acid seeped into Bahrami's eyes and streamed down her face and into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms.  Watch how the still-pungent acid destroyed Bahrami's clothes » . Two weeks after the attack, Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court. He was convicted in 2005 and has been behind bars all along. Bahrami's lawyer, Ali Sarrafi, said Movahedi had never shown any remorse. ""He says he did it because he loved her,"" Sarrafi said. Attack victims in Iran usually accept ""blood money"": a fine in lieu of harsh punishment. With no insurance and mounting medical bills, Bahrami could've used the cash, but she said no. ""I told the judge I want an eye for an eye,"" Bahrami said. ""People like him should be made to feel my suffering.""  Watch how the acid destroyed Bahrami's eyes (includes graphic content) » . Bahrami's demand has outraged some human rights activists. Criticizing acid-attack victims is almost unheard of, but some Internet bloggers have condemned Bahrami's decision. ""We cannot condone such cruel punishment,"" wrote one blogger. ""To willingly inflict the same treatment on a person under court order is a violation of human rights."" Late last year, an Iranian court gave Bahrami what she asked for. It sentenced Movahedi to be blinded with drops of acid in each eye. This month, the courts rejected Movahedi's appeal. Bahrami's lawyer, Sarrafi, said the sentencing might be carried out in a matter of weeks. He said he doesn't think Bahrami will change her mind. Neither does Bahrami. ""If I don't do this and there is another acid attack, I will never forgive myself for as long as I live,"" she said. Bahrami is largely self-sufficient despite not being able to see. She can make a salad, prepare tea and walk up the five flights of stairs that lead to her parents' apartment. She has undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face, but she says there are many more to come. She can't afford to pay for her medical care, so she's using the Internet to raise money. She's lost her big brown eyes, but she likes to smile, especially when she imagines her wedding day. ""I always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown, and why not?""","Woman blinded, disfigured by acid wins case to have attacker also blinded by acid .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's decision to grant some benefits to the same-sex partners of federal employees is seen by some as his attempt to extend an olive branch to the gay and lesbian community, but critics say it's ""too little, too late."" Some critics say President Obama has let the gay community down. ""It seems to me at least to be a nice gesture, but a disappointment,"" said Richard Kim, a senior editor at The Nation magazine. The memorandum Obama signed Wednesday is not expected to grant health and retirement benefits to same-sex partners, as that is prohibited under the Defense of Marriage Act. ""It will absolutely be seen as something good -- but I think, for example, it not including full health insurance -- that is going to put a real microscope on that question. You know, why not?"" Kim said, adding that the memo applies only to federal employees, so most people will not be affected by it. Charles Moran, the spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, said the lack of full benefits in Thursday's memorandum shows a lack of commitment to the gay community. ""That's the part that just shows that the Obama administration really isn't serious about their promises to the gay and lesbian community. Things like the health benefits, things like retirement benefits and coverage for spouses. These are the core issues,"" Moran said. ""Why start the marathon if you're not serious about ending the race?"" he added. White House officials involved in discussions with gay-rights advocates say that Obama favors extending full health care benefits to same-sex couples but that will take legislation to accomplish. Moran said Obama has had multiple opportunities to fulfill his promises to the gay and lesbian community -- including by repealing the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and standing against the Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act. ""Here we are, several months after he's been inaugurated, and we've gotten basically nothing. So it is too little, too late,"" Moran said. White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama will keep his word. ""[Extending benefits to same-sex couples] is a matter of fairness. The president is committed to ensuring that fairness as well as working on and fulfilling other promises that he has made in the campaign around things like 'don't ask, don't tell,' "" Gibbs said. The president has faced sharp criticism over the Justice Department's filing in support of the Defense of Marriage Act, which opposes same-sex marriage. The act used the government's interest in opposing incestuous marriages to support its position against same-sex marriage. Openly gay Rep. Barney Frank said the Obama administration made a ""big mistake"" and is calling on the president to clearly explain his views on the matter. ""The wording they used was inappropriate,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told the Boston Herald in an interview published in the paper's Wednesday edition. Many gay activists have called on Frank and other gay members of Congress to speak out against the recent Department of Justice brief. The rancor threatens to disrupt a big Democratic National Committee gay fundraiser in Washington next week. Vice President Biden is the guest at next Thursday's DNC's LBGT Leadership Council 10th Annual Dinner in Washington. Critics are calling for Frank and other gay congressional leaders to boycott the dinner, for which tickets go for $1,000 to $30,000 a plate. Activist David Mixner and blogger Andy Towle, two well-known gay rights advocates, announced that they were pulling out, citing disappointment with the Defense of Marriage Act brief. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama and same-sex marriage . The president also rankled gay advocates before his inauguration when he named megachurch pastor the Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his swearing-in. Warren, in an interview with Belief.net, likened homosexuality to bestiality and incest. He also supported California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state. During the Warren controversy, Obama -- who frequently spoke in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the campaign but has said he opposes same-sex marriage -- declared himself ""a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans."" Given the support Obama received from the gay community during the campaign season, Kim said so far, the Obama administration has let gay and lesbian rights activists down. Obama got 70 percent of the vote from those who identified themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to CNN exit polls. ""I think there is an overwhelming feeling that he has not lived up to expectations on these matters,"" he said. But, he added, ""there's some sympathy for him -- there's the worst recession since the Great Depression, troops are in two different countries in the Middle East -- so there's a lot on his plate."" Kim said Obama's full agenda, however, shouldn't be used as an excuse to delay action on gay rights issues. If the administration waits until there is a news hole, then the issues will be subject to a lot of debate, he said. ""In the middle of the health care debate, saying we're going to do health care, we're going to fix the economy and then this other [gay rights] stuff -- of course it's right. It doesn't require a national debate,"" he said. ""This is stuff that's been debated forever. America does not need a huge national debate on some of these issues,"" Kim said. Kim said while Obama has disappointed the gay community, he still has some time to make good on his campaign promises. ""I think people will wait through the first two legislative sessions, but then after that some of this stuff does need to move to the front,"" he said.","NEW: White House officials: Obama favors full benefits, but legislation is needed .

"(CNN) -- The 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will include rugby union sevens, a shortened version of the 15-player game, and golf as sports, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced. The IOC announced Rio's successful bid for the 2016 Olympic Games last week. Two months ago the IOC's executive board voted to include the sports in the program, a proposal that was ratified by the body's members at a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Friday. Rugby sevens, a sport played with exactly the same rules as the regular version -- just with less players, garnered 81 votes in favor while eight were against and one abstained. Golf was voted in with 63 votes to 27, with two abstentions -- it means the number of ""Olympic"" sports has reached the IOC's stated maximum of 28. Blog: Money, money, money should be new Olympic motto. The vote was delayed as some IOC members cast doubt on the selection process that had seen the two sports put forward, but on announcing the result IOC president Jacques Rogge said: ""Time will show your decision was very wise."" The two disciplines will be part of the 2016 and 2020 Games as a result of the vote, a move that prompted IRB president Bernard Lapasset to tell reporters: ""This is an historic moment for our sport and for the global rugby community, who were united in their support."" Rugby's world governing body, the IRB, has promised to end its World Cup Sevens event in order to allow 12 men's and women's teams to take part in the competition. Similarly, the International Golf Federation (IGF) has said that of the 60 players who will compete in the men's and women's tournament over 72 holes, the world's top stars will all be present. The executive director of the IGF's Olympic Golf Committee, Ty Votaw,  was equally delighted. After coordinating the successful Olympic bid of his sport, he said: ""We are elated the IOC membership has accepted golf as an Olympic sport, and look forward to seeing the world's best golfers compete for gold at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro."" Softball, squash, baseball, karate and roller sports all bid to be accepted as Olympic sports but were turned down by the executive board two months ago. Golf previously featured at the Paris Games of 1900 and in St Louis in 1904, while Olympic medals could be won by rugby players who contested the 15-a-side format from 1900-24. Meanwhile, Rogge has been re-elected unopposed as president. The Belgian will serve his final four years, which takes him through the London 2012 Olympics before stepping down in 2013, after being re-elected by 88 votes to one.","The IOC have voted rugby union sevens and golf into the 2016 Olympic Games .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Explosions tore through two luxury hotels Friday morning in south Jakarta, Indonesia, killing at least eight people, a presidential spokesman said. Counter-terrorist police commandos secure the damaged Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta on Friday after the blasts. The number of injured was in the 40s, said Dino Patti Djalal, spokesman for President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. They were taken to area hospitals. Hours later, local television reported a car bombing in north Jakarta, but that report was immediately contradicted by various other media sources. Police sealed off the area around both hotel blasts, one in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and the other at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, about 50 meters away. Djalal said the attacks were coordinated. Forensics experts are collecting evidence at the ""disturbing scene,"" Djalal said. He said he had few details about the blasts, which occurred about 7:45 a.m. (8:45 p.m. Thursday ET) on Friday, Islam's holy day. ""What I can say is one of the most damaged areas that we looked at, where the bodies were, was a lounge area in the Marriott near the lobby,"" he said. ""That seems to be the epicenter of the bomb."" ""This is a blow to us, but I don't have any doubts that we will be able to uncover and find out the perpetrators,"" Djalal said. Police said the bomb at the Marriott likely came from the basement beneath the coffee shop on the ground floor, which would have been busy at breakfast time. In a Twitter post four hours after the blast, Marriott said: ""Police responded immediately, sealed off the area. Guests @ both hotels have been evacuated & have been moved to a secure location."" At the Ritz, windows were blown out on the second floor, as though the blast occurred from inside a hotel restaurant that would also have been crowded with a breakfast crowd, said witness Greg Woolstencroft. Another witness counted four foreigners among the wounded, according to state-run Antara New Agency. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel was to have accommodated soccer players from Britain's Manchester United, who were expected to arrive in Jakarta on Sunday.  Watch a report on suspects behind the blasts » . U.S. Embassy Press Attache Paul Belmont told CNN no U.S. casualties have been confirmed and that the embassy was monitoring the situation closely. The death toll may be higher than reported, said CNN contributor Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director of international operations. He said two U.S. businessmen were treated for minor injuries. ""There was a boom and the building shook, and then subsequently two more,"" said hotel guest Don Hammer, who was leaving his room in the Marriott when the blast occurred. ""The shocking part was entering the lobby, where the glass at the front of the hotel was all blown out and blood was spattered across the floor, but most people were leaving calmly."" Woolstencroft had just walked past the hotels and had gone to his nearby apartment when he heard an explosion. ""I looked out my window and I saw a huge cloud of brownish smoke go up,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I grabbed my iPhone to go downstairs ... and then the second bomb went off at the Ritz-Carlton, so I then ran around to the Ritz-Carlton and I was able to find that there had been a massive bomb that went off in this ... restaurant area and the explosion had blown out both sides of the hotel. ""I found inside the body of what appears to be a suicide bomber, it looked like someone who had been a suicide bomber or someone who had been very, very close to the explosion.  Watch an eyewitness report of the blasts » . ""I also noticed that there were a number of injured people being taken off to hospital, but I only noticed one dead person at this point and time, that's all I saw. There has been extensive damage to both buildings, and at this point and time of course all the authorities are blocking up all the area and starting an investigation."" He added, ""It's obviously targeted establishments where there are Westerners and expats ... I can only assume it's something to try and send a message."" The television executive said he had lived at the Ritz for a year before moving to his nearby apartment and had been impressed by the facility's security. ""I just don't know how someone could get in there with a bomb, given the level of security and screening that people have to go through,"" he said, citing armed guards at checkpoints and thorough searches of people, bags and vehicles. The Marriott was the site of a terrorist attack in August 2003 that killed 12 people. In that attack, an explosives-laden vehicle pulled into the motor lobby of the Marriott and exploded at the height of the lunch hour. Friday's attack ""was not nearly as bad,"" said John Aglionby, a reporter for the Financial Times who was at the site of both blasts. Former CNN producer John Towriss, who has spent many years in Jakarta, said the Marriott and Ritz often share employees and an underground passageway connects the two buildings that sit across the road from each other. Towriss said the Marriott has beefed up security since the 2003 attacks, making it impossible for people to drive up to the hotel in cars. Both hotels set up metal detectors and thick concrete barriers to prevent car bombers. ""I always thought I was safer at the Marriott because I thought it had already been bombed once,"" Towriss said. ""I thought that another hotel would be targeted.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Lucas didn't get to be a billionaire by delegating. George Lucas says he was ""completely surprised"" by ""Star Wars in Concert."" Holding fast to his vision -- and his marketing rights -- for the ""Star Wars"" empire has made it the biggest franchise in history, and made Lucas one of the most powerful people in entertainment. But while he's enthusiastic about the new touring show ""Star Wars In Concert,"" it wasn't his idea, and when I talked with him before the first Los Angeles performance this week, he kept giving the credit to others. ""Star Wars In Concert"" is built around John Williams' well-known scores from the films, performed by a symphony orchestra and choir, and accompanied by specially edited clips from all six movies, displayed on a mammoth LED screen.   Watch Lucas rave about the show » . Anthony Daniels, who has played and voiced the golden protocol droid ""C3PO"" in every film and most of the spinoffs, provides live narration -- and another reason for the ""Star Wars"" fans in the audience, especially those waving lightsabers and dressed as everything from sand people to Imperial stormtroopers, to cheer mightily, as they did the night I interviewed Lucas. iReporter praises the 'Force' of the show . George Lucas: I've seen some presentations of, you know, live orchestras with ""Star Wars"" clips, and that sort of thing. But this is so much more than that -- it's so much more emotional, because what they've done is taken the emotional content of the score ... one is obviously the Imperial March, one is obviously romantic ... and then they've cut all the pictures around that from all the movies, so that you get this really wide range of visuals going with the music, and it really is quite powerful when you see the depictions of all of the various Imperial shenanigans that were going on over the Imperial March. CNN: Obviously, when John Williams did the music for the original film, neither of you could have guessed your association would last so long, or that you'd be so identified with each other. How did he get involved originally? Lucas: What I did was, I was doing this space opera, and I was talking to Steve Spielberg and I said, ""Look, I've got to get somebody who really knows the old-fashioned music score, I really am doing some giant romantic action adventure, you know, throwback to the '30s, and who do you know that can do that?"" And he said, ""Oh, there's only one person who can do that and that's John Williams -- he did 'Jaws' and he's perfect."" And I said OK, and I met him, and we hit it off, you know, perfectly, and doing the first film was such a great experience -- he's so wonderful to work with -- that, you know, I'll never let him go. And Steve won't let him go either! CNN: How did this show come together? Lucas: Howard! [Lucas calls over Howard Roffman, the president of Lucas Licensing.] You're the man who did the whole thing -- I've got nothing to do with it. ... We would kid him about how his concert was going and he had to get Johnny [Williams] to buy in and me to buy in. Howard Roffman: Well, he always got it from the beginning, so he was an easy sell. CNN: But what was it he ""got""? How did you sell him on a new concept for his franchise? Roffman: I think he understood that the music was so powerful and the images are so powerful that when you put that together with a live orchestra on a big venue, I mean, who would not be thrilled to see that? CNN: It's a very different experience, being live. Lucas: It's very powerful. I was completely surprised by it. And I've seen other live orchestra performances with ""Star Wars"" images, but nothing like this -- I mean this really works, because it was edited specifically to bring out the emotion.","""Star Wars in Concert' features John Williams' music and scenes from films .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- An imperial ""dragon"" throne owned by a Chinese emperor set the world auction record for Chinese furniture Thursday, selling for about US $11 million. Nicolas Chow of Sotheby's, pictured, said mainland Chinese buyers were ""ready to pay the premium."" There was frenzied bidding among mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan collectors at the Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong. Thirty-six bids came in 10 minutes, with tension building as a new telephone bidder jumped into the competition. ""These mainland (China) buyers, mainland collectors are ready to pay the premium it takes to secure an object of this quality,"" said Nicolas Chow, international head of Chinese ceramics and art at Sotheby's. The winning bid of US $11,068,193 (HK $85,780,000) was by a private Shanghai businessman. It was nearly triple the estimate of US $3.9 million (HK $30 million), Sotheby's said.  Watch why the throne is so prized » . ""This is the place from which the emperor conducted his stately affairs and received foreign envoys and basically, this is a seat of power,"" Chow said. ""No one else should have sat down in this place."" The throne belonged to Emperor Qianlong, who ruled from 1736-1795. The 4.6 foot-long (140 centimeters) piece is considered rare and prized because of the zitan wood from which it was carved.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The man charged with murder in the shooting death of a guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum was denied bail Wednesday and will undergo psychiatric testing against his will. ""Your Constitution guarantees me a speedy and fair trial,"" James von Brunn said from his wheelchair. James von Brunn ignored the advice of the judge and his defense attorney and addressed the court during a hearing to fight any delays as prosecutors press their case. ""Your Constitution guarantees me a speedy and fair trial,"" he said from his wheelchair during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Reginald Walton. But Walton granted the defense request for a mental evaluation, which will take place within the next 30 days at a facility in Butner, North Carolina. Von Brunn, a self-avowed white supremacist, will remain in custody after the judge said there were no conditions for release that would protect the public. Federal prosecutor Nicole Waid said von Brunn is ""dangerous because this defendant has nothing to lose,"" and that he wants to be ""a martyr for his cause."" Von Brunn's attorney, public defender A.J. Kramer, did not challenge the government's request to deny bail, saying ""we don't have any evidence to offer at this time."" Kramer also convinced the judge to order a competency exam, which will include observations as to whether von Brunn understands the charges and can assist in his own defense. Prosecutors said four of the charges in the indictment are capital offenses and could mean the death penalty if he is convicted. Waid told the judge the government's evidence is ""overwhelming"" and includes security camera video from the June 10 attack, in which von Brunn is seen raising a gun and shooting guard Stephen Tyrone Johns, who had opened the door for him. As Johns stumbled back mortally wounded, Waid said, ""you can see the defendant fire two more times,"" before he is shot and wounded by other guards. Also seen on the tape is the weapon being taken from von Brunn's hands, the prosecutor said. During the discussions about psychiatric testing, von Brunn looked at spectators in the courtroom and shook his head as if to say ""no,"" when it became clear he would not be arraigned on the charges unless he is deemed competent. ""Mr. von Brunn, I advise that you not speak,"" the judge said, explaining that his attorney can best represent him. But von Brunn ignored his advice. ""I'm a United States citizen, and as a U.S. Naval officer, I swore to protect my country,"" he said. ""I take my vows very seriously."" The 89-year-old World War II veteran did not explain his remarks.","NEW: Bail denied for accused Holocaust Memorial Museum shooter .

"(CNN) -- To hear some Guatemalans tell it, three coordinated attacks that killed four prison officials in five hours Monday hardly raised anyone's pulse. Police arrests two suspects in one of the three attacks. They're used to this level of violence, said Fernando Carrera Castro, director of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies in Guatemala City. Although what happened is normal in Guatemala, Carrera said, that's not to say that citizens are not concerned. ""We're as scared as ever,"" he said Tuesday. Heather Berkman, a Central America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, also has come to expect the violence. ""What else is new?"" she said when asked about the killings. Samuel Logan, an expert on Latin American gangs, said all of Central America is under attack from organized crime cartels because the region is pinched between Colombia and Mexico, the two biggest sources of drugs in the area. U.S. interdiction efforts that have targeted the flow of drugs through the Caribbean Sea also have forced cartels to travel through the Central American isthmus, Logan said. Within Central America, he said, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have the worst problems. Among those three nations, Guatemala stands out. ""When you talk about a country being hollowed out by organized crime, Guatemala is at the top of the list,"" Logan said. There are two main reasons, he said: geography and an incompetent and corrupt government. ""Guatemala bunches right up against Mexico,"" Logan said. ""Any spillover effect is almost certainly going south."" Said Berkman, ""The narcos are coming down from Mexico."" In addition, Logan said, the federal government is not able to control large segments of the country. For example, Peten state in northern Guatemala, bordered on two sides by Mexico, is lawless, he said. Berkman made the same point. ""The narcos control about 40 percent of the territory down there, which is pretty amazing,"" she said. Berkman also pointed out that the government has reduced anti-crime spending in the 2010 budget because of the nation's dire economic situation. ""If you don't have resources, you can't pay for troops and supplies and intelligence,"" she said. Logan, who just wrote a book on the Mara Salvatrucha gang of Central America, said there are two main criminal elements in Guatemala: drug cartels that deal in large-scale exportation and street gangs that sell drugs at the retail level and are involved in other crimes, such as robbery and extortion. In some cases, they work together. When those criminals get arrested, they continue their activities on the inside. ""The prisons, in general, are centers of corruption,"" Carrera said. ""From inside prison, they direct kidnappings, extortion, drug trafficking."" Monday's attacks on the prison officials resulted from efforts to weed out corruption in the nation's prisons, Carrera said. Officials have been clamping down on what goods inmates can receive and the use of cell phones within prison walls. They also are transferring some top-level criminals to high-security prisons. ""What happened is a reaction from gangs who want control of the prisons,"" Carrera said. ""They're trying to show strength through force. To generate fear."" Interior Minister Raul Velasquez was quoted in several newspapers Tuesday as saying the attacks were in retaliation for the recent transfer of several gang leaders to high-security prisons. Two arrests have been made in Monday's shootings and the investigation continues, said Rudy Esquivel, spokesman for the Guatemalan prison system. ""This was a very structured job; very well-defined,"" Esquivel said from Guatemala City, the nation's capital. Killed were a prison assistant director, a warden and two guards. One guard and a shooting suspect were wounded, as were three citizens. One of the wounded was a woman in the eighth month of pregnancy, news accounts said. According to published reports in the Prensa Libre, La Hora, El Periodico de Guatemala and Siglo 21 newspapers, this is what happened: . The first attack occurred around 7 a.m. Monday in Guatemala City when two gunmen on a motorcycle fired an AK-47 assault rifle at three guards who were transporting a prisoner. One of the guards was killed and another wounded. A national civil police unit driving in front of the prison detail gave chase and captured the suspects, one of whom suffered a serious leg injury. The second attack happened 10 minutes later, when the warden at the prison in the city of Guastatoya, in central Guatemala, was gunned down while he ate in front of the Hospital General San Juan de Dios. The warden, Felix Gabriel Garcia Reyes, was at the hospital to pick up the body of a prisoner who had died after surgery. Two men and a pregnant 19-year-old woman were wounded in the attack. Witnesses told police four men in a green vehicle fired and fled. Authorities found an abandoned Mitsubishi nearby that matched the description. Inside, they found a 9 mm pistol and ammunition for other weapons. The third attack occurred around noon on the Inter-American Highway near the city of Chimaltenango, where Javier Bac Tzul, 40, was the prison's assistant director. He and his 31-year-old driver were killed as they returned to the prison after a trip to Guatemala City. Authorities said they found AK-47 shells at the scene. Chimaltenango Gov. Hector Lopez said a prison director and two assistant directors already have been killed in the state, Prensa Libre reported. Analyst Berkman sees little hope. ""It's a lose-lose situation, no matter how you look at it,"" she said.","Four killed in three orchestrated attacks, local papers say .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-three suspects, including nine American Airlines employees, were arrested Tuesday for allegedly transporting nearly $20 million worth of cocaine on flights into and out of Puerto Rico, federal authorities said. Manuel Santiago-Alvarado, an American Airlines control crew chief, is among the suspects arrested Tuesday. Most of the commercial flights carrying suitcases stuffed with illicit drugs came into San Juan, which was a transshipment point for drugs bound for cities on the U.S. mainland, authorities said. The drug trafficking organization headed by defendant Wilfredo Rodriguez Rosade had been operating since 1999, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, which participated in the long-running investigation. In a September 9 indictment unsealed Tuesday, Justice Department officials also moved to seize $18 million worth of property owned by the suspects, including seven homes, three businesses and an apartment complex. All but one of the arrests occurred in Puerto Rico. The lone arrest on the U.S. mainland was in Miami, Florida. Drug Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Javier Pena said the airline industry cooperated in the investigation. ""By denying the drug traffickers alternate smuggling routes, we disrupt the flow of drugs into Puerto Rico and discourage the use of the island as a transshipment point in the Caribbean,"" he said in a news release. The agency said that if they are convicted, the defendants taken into custody would face sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison and personal fines of up to $4 million. American Airlines issued a statement confirming some employees had been arrested, but could not confirm the number because of its privacy policy, spokesman Tim Wagner said in an e-mail. The airline has been working with authorities, he said. ""As a company, we hope that the actions of a few employees don't reflect negatively on the tens of thousands of ethical American Airlines employees who work hard to serve the public daily,"" Wagner wrote.","9 airline employees among those accused of smuggling $20 million in cocaine .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Beginning Saturday, many air travelers will be asked their birth dates and genders when making airline reservations. The new travel rules are the latest ""visible"" expansion of the Secure Flight program. It's the latest ""publicly visible"" expansion of Secure Flight, a program that transfers responsibility for checking air passengers' identities from the airlines to the federal government, the Transportation Security Administration said. The change keeps the agency on track to assume responsibility for ID checks on all domestic flights by early next year, according to the TSA. Currently, the airlines check passenger identifications against lists of suspected terrorists. But the 9/11 Commission said the job was better suited for the federal government, which compiles the ""terror watch lists."" Government control increases security, according to the TSA, while reducing the number of instances in which innocent people are mistakenly confused with possible terrorists having similar or identical names. In May, the federal government began the first public phase of ""Secure Flight"" when four small airlines began asking passengers to provide their names, as the names appeared on the government-issued IDs they would be traveling with, when making reservations. Since then, additional airlines have begun asking for full names, TSA spokeswoman Sterling Payne said, though she declined to say how many airlines are participating for security reasons. The new change requires travelers to provide three pieces of information when making reservations: the passenger's full name as it appears on the government-issued ID they will be using, their birth date and their gender. The airline will transmit that information to the TSA, which will compare it to a ""no-fly"" list of people prohibited from flying or a list of ""selectees"" who can fly after they pass additional physical screening. If passengers are not asked for this addition information, they should not be concerned, as it will not affect  their travel, the agency said. Early efforts to create the Secure Flight program were beset by problems, including program delays and complaints of privacy breaches. Finally, in 2006, after the TSA spent more than $130 million and four years on the system, then-TSA Director Kip Hawley ordered a complete overhaul of the program and dropped plans to check passengers' names against commercial databases, one of the most contentious features of the program. ""Secure Flight is a key tool in confirming that someone identified as a 'No Fly' does not receive a boarding pass,"" TSA acting Administrator Gale Rossides said in a statement Wednesday. ""Secure Flight will make travel safer and easier for passengers."" The TSA says it plans to vet 100 percent of passengers on all domestic commercial flights by early next year and 100 percent of passengers on all international commercial flights by the end of 2010.","Many travelers will be asked for birth dates, genders on reservation .

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on issues affecting communities across the country. Pope McLean Jr. tells CNN's John King that a lot of farms are hurting because of the global recession. LEXINGTON, Kentucky (CNN) -- Crestwood Farm is tucked into the rolling hillsides of Kentucky's legendary bluegrass country. Kipling and Unbridled Energy are among the stallions critical to the reputation -- and the bottom line -- of the McLean family business. And just how do the stallions prove their value? ""When their progeny does well on the race track,"" Pope McLean Jr. said. ""Can't bluff that. That's when they prove what they are worth."" Pope McLean Sr. got into the horse business in college and took over Crestwood Farm in 1970. His son worked on the farm while growing up. After college he took a job in the financial sector, but in 1991 he returned to Crestwood. His brother Marc returned a few years later, and their younger sister Grandison joined after she graduated from college. ""It's been pretty much a family business since that point,"" Pope McLean Jr. said during a tour of the 1,000 acre property. Kentucky is to horse racing what Michigan is to the domestic auto industry. Racing and breeding thoroughbreds is a multibillion-dollar business in the state and the source of some 100,000 jobs. But ""The Sport of Kings"" is hardly exempt from these painful economic times, and in fact is taking a severe blow in the global recession. ""It's truly an international industry, so we have people, a lot of buyers, from Europe come in. And they have dialed back,"" McLean said. ""Domestic buyers have dialed back their participation, as well. The good horses are still bringing decent money, but everyone has to lower their expectations."" At this year's Keeneland September Yearling Sale, which McLean calls the horse industry's version of the NBA draft, the gross was down more than 41 percent from last year, the largest year-to-year drop in the 66-year history of the auction. ""The prices are down, and our production costs increased with commodity prices going up and so forth, so it definitely puts a squeeze on commercial breeding operations,"" McLean said. ""A lot of farms are hurting. And then you have the credit squeeze that has hurt a lot of farms, too."" McLean sees another lean year next year, and then hopes for a rebound because of an odd twist to the laws of supply and demand. In 2008, when the stock market was plummeting, 30 percent fewer mares were bred, so the supply of horses available at auction the year after next will be smaller. ""I think people just decided to pull back,"" McLean said. ""So the supply of horses available at auction will be reduced and that should start to help market conditions."" At Crestwood, McLean predicts an ""about even"" year. ""We're down at bit,"" at the moment, he says. ""I feel pretty sure there will be quite a few farms that will go out of business."" Out of business is an all too common theme in Hazard, a coal country town in Eastern Kentucky's Appalachia region about 120 miles away from Lexington and horse country. Statewide, the unemployment rate in Kentucky is 11.1 percent. Hazard is the county seat in Perry County, where the jobless rate has been on a steady climb and is 12.7 percent. On Main Street, a clothing and novelty store is closing down, along with an adjacent print and copying shop. Fallout, locals say, from the closing of a uniform plant that had employed more than 140 people, and then a Weyerhaeuser lumber facility that employed 180. Joanne Caron knew there were problems when Weyerhaeuser canceled weekend shifts, ""but we didn't think it would be that drastic."" The bad news came suddenly in March when workers were told their jobs were being eliminated immediately. ""They called us in the conference room and said due to market conditions, you know, they had to shut us down."" Caron has been looking for work for seven months. Nothing. Her unemployment check is $746 every two weeks. She cashed in her Weyerhaeuser 401(k) and, despite the long-term risks, allows herself a small slice of that money every month, as well. ""My daughter likes to eat, and she likes clothes,"" Caron said with a shrug. ""And we like heat and air conditioning. That's the choices we have to make."" Her 19-year-old is enrolled at the local community college, where Joanne also plans to take classes in hopes of improving her job prospects. Two older daughters completed college over the past two years, one in Florida and other here in Kentucky, but neither has been able to find work. ""So everything I told them as they were growing up: go to college, get a degree so you can get a good job, it's just not working out that way."" Caron tries to keep her spirits up, dryly joking that ""you get to see everybody during the day because nobody's at work."" But the long search can be demoralizing. ""I worked all my life and now I'm collecting an unemployment check. I feel real uncomfortable about that, but there's no jobs available."" When Caron returned to the Weyerhaeuser plant for the first time, it made her feel sad. ""The last shift I worked was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Twelve hour shifts,"" she said as she looked through the fence, chained and padlocked shut. ""Sad to see it like this,"" Caron said. ""I made a lot of good friends working there. We had good times working in there. It wasn't a glamorous job, but we had fun and we got along, and I miss seeing those people every day.""","Horse racing industry is the source of some 100,000 jobs in Kentucky .

"(CNN) -- The world's top pound-for-pound fighter, Manny Pacquiao, will attempt to win a world title in a fourth division by taking on three-time world champion Miguel Cotto in his next bout. Manny Pacquiao will take on Miguel Cotto in his next fight scheduled for Novermber 18. The Filipino boxer will fight the 28-year-old Puerto Rican for the WBO welterweight title at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, America on November 14 it has been confirmed. Promoter Bob Arum, who represents both fighters, announced that although contracts still need to be signed, verbal agreements have been given: ""I'm very excited about this because it's a good fight for boxing [and] it wasn't difficult to do, because they both wanted the fight,"" Arum told the Los Angeles Times. Pacquiao is a national hero in the Philippines but has seen his popularity grow around the world since his comprehensive victory over British fighter Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas. The man dubbed the ""National Fist"" is currently rated by The Ring, the sport's most respected trade magazine, as the best boxer in the world. His career earnings stand at an estimated $50M and he stands to bank further millions with the Cotto fee, however, Arum has yet to announce how the purse will be split. Pacquiao has been in devastating form in recent times, racking up a string of victories in four different weight divisions. Mexico's super-featherweight Juan Manuel Marquez was dispatched by the ""Pac Man"" before the 30-year-old secured further wins against America's David Diaz (lightweight) and Oscar de la Hoya (welterweight) before a devastating show of force against British light-welterweight Ricky Hatton. Cotto survived a recent split decision result against Ghana's Joshua Clottey despite suffering a bad cut over one of his eyes during the bout and has only lost once in his career thus far to 31-year-old Mexican Antonio Margarito. Arum said a press tour with the fighters will start Sept. 9 in Los Angeles.","Manny Pacquiao will fight Puerto Rico's Miguel Cotto in his next fight .

"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from Jane Velez-Mitchell's new book ""iWant"" published by HCI Books. Velez-Mitchell anchors ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" on HLN nightly at 7 p.m. ET. Jane Velez-Mitchell writes about her journey from addiction and overconsumption to a simpler, honest life. This is the story of my ch . . . ch . . . changes, which took me from insanity to clarity, from egocentricity to altruism, from alcoholism to activism. These changes have marked an evolution in what I want from this life. I am what I want. What I seek to consume, possess, and achieve is a mirror that reflects my lusts and cravings, values and priorities, and moral boundaries or lack thereof. I am happy to say that what I want today is much less toxic and self-centered than what I used to want. It's taken decades of self-examination to peel back the layers and figure out what really makes me happy. And while I'm still searching for my ultimate bliss, I know for sure it's not what I once thought it was. It's not alcohol, cigarettes, money, food, sugar, or status symbols: I've consumed all of those in massive quantities, and they've just made me miserable. Now, I want what can't be tasted, smoked, worn, seen, or counted. It's the opposite of material. As sappy as it might sound, what I want is spiritual.  Watch Jane talk about her new book » . The shift from material to spiritual is a particular challenge in our culture. We have allowed ourselves to be defined by our consumption, instead of by our ability to move beyond it. To keep consumers consuming, the corporate culture has brainwashed us into thinking we can change ourselves by changing what we buy, which pills we pop, what type of booze we swill, what gated community we join, what kind of golf clubs we swing, and what kind of cancer sticks we dangle between our lips. We've been told that certain consumer choices say a lot about us, that they reveal our character. If we've stepped up to a more prestigious brand, we've changed for the better. Nonsense! We cannot consume our way into personal growth. Yet, millions of us have bought into this cynical concept of faux identity. If you keep buying the ""latest and the greatest"" but feel like you're stuck in the same place, you're just changing labels, and that's not changing. That's rearranging. Real change occurs on the emotional, psychological, and spiritual levels, not in a shopping mall, a car dealership, online, at the drugstore, at the liquor store, or at the fast-food joint. For too long, we have allowed ourselves to be manipulated by forces whose sole purpose is PROFIT and POWER. We have given advertisers leave to claim that inanimate objects have spiritual qualities. One ad, in perhaps the world's most prestigious newspaper, urges us to buy an expensive diamond by insisting that such a purchase will feed the soul, lift the spirit, and increase our resolve to achieve whatever we wish. Really? How exactly does a diamond feed the soul? It's absurd! This is false advertising. Today, as a culture, we are awash in false advertising. As a society, we've lent legitimacy to these patent lies by literally buying into them. As a result of this unnecessary, self-indulgent consumption, we've gone a long way toward destroying our natural environment with our waste. Perhaps most important, by obsessing about material things, we've cheated ourselves out of the most fundamental aspect of the human experience: real experiences that result in real growth. Unlike diamonds, meaningful experiences can actually feed the soul, resulting in self-development and self-knowledge. Authentic change has allowed me to gradually learn why I'm here experiencing this existence as well as what I am destined to contribute during my lifetime. For me, meaningful change has been about getting sober, becoming honest, and adopting a new attitude. Sobriety has allowed me to shift the criteria I use for all the decisions I make from an ego-based formula of what's in it for me to a more evolved formula based on compassion for other people, other living creatures, and our environment. It's an ongoing struggle, and there are many times when I fail. But I keep trying. This book is my story of how I've progressed from self-obsession to a life that I hope will count. In the tradition of the Twelve Steps created by Alcoholics Anonymous, I'm going to lay out what it was like, what happened to change me, and what it's like now. For thirty years as a television news reporter, I've been recounting other people's mostly sordid stories. Frankly, the prospect of airing my own dirty laundry scares the wits out of me. The very thought of this sparks a flood of memories, primarily featuring the many stupid and embarrassing things I've done over the years, especially before I got sober. My face burns at the prospect of sharing some of these memories with you. I know we're all only as sick as our secrets. By pouring out the intimate details of my personal history, I am trying to get healthier through honesty. Still, I can't help but wonder if you really have to know every single one of my secrets. Is that what is meant by ­rigorous honesty? These thoughts swirl through my mind as I ­huddle under my covers unable to sleep... ...There's so much to tell. But would you want to know everything about my personal struggles? You may simply be reading this book because you're interested in my life, and for that I thank you. But if you identify with my story, then we will both learn from my experience. That is the essence of all recovery programs. Many of the battles I'm fighting, the compulsions I'm struggling to conquer, are the same as those experienced by many of my friends, relatives, co­workers, and neighbors. Some struggle with overeating, with alcohol or drugs, with workaholism, with codependency, with compulsive spending, with gambling, with sex addiction, or with facing the truth about themselves -- whatever that truth may be. And virtually everyone I know, including myself, suffers from generic overconsumption -- a chronic craving for more of everything that is poisoning our lives, not to mention our oceans, skies, and forests. My friend once called himself a tornado of consumption. That description fits most Americans. Sadly, we're a nation of addicts. For a multitude of reasons -- our health, our finances, and our environment, among them -- we need to take immediate action to reduce our collective consumption levels. Unfortunately, addicts don't respond to reason or rationality. Just as you can't reason with a drunk who is on a binge, we are not going to lecture our way out of America's consumption mess. Fortunately, there are proven recovery methods out there that can help us get a handle on our addictive consumption. I've used them to deal with my plethora of addictions, and I will share these techniques with you while I tell you my story. From IWANT by Jane Velez-Mitchell. Available wherever books are sold.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Indian tourism authorities will be holding English classes for auto-rickshaw drivers in New Delhi as the city prepares to host the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Auto-rickshaw drivers are being taught English ahead of the Commenwealth Games. More than 40,000 natural gas-fueled auto-rickshaws, or motorized three-wheeled taxis, run on the Indian capital's dilapidated roads, according to the city government statistics. The city is expected to host around 100,000 tourists during the Commonwealth Games scheduled from October 3-14 in 2010. About 9,000 athletes and officials of 52 Commonwealth countries are likely to participate. Some 8,000 auto-rickshaw drivers will be enrolled in the training program that will involve classes in yoga, life skills, first aid, spoken English and psychometric tests, federal Tourism Secretary Sujit Banerjee announced Tuesday. Each trainee will be paid Rs 200, or about $4, daily for attending the program spread over 200 sessions for a year. Indian auto-rickshaw drivers have often been accused of overcharging, refusing short trips and misbehavior. Traffic authorities have in the past opened a range of avenues for passengers to lodge their complaints -- such as on help lines, via text messages or simply calling a telephone number printed on the three-wheeled cabs. ""The India image that we strive to convey to a foreign tourist depends, to a large degree, on how good the taxi/auto-rickshaw (driver) that he or she meets is in his demeanor and conduct,"" Banerjee remarked.","More than 40,000 auto-rickshaws ply roads of Indian capital .

"(CNN) -- Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic was Thursday found not guilty of war crimes  and crimes against humanity in Kosovo by a U.N. tribunal. Milan Milutinovic had was cleared of war crimes in Kosovo. Five other former high-ranking Serb officials -- Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, Nebojsa Pavkovic, Vladimir Lazarevic and Sreten Lukic -- were found guilty on all or some of the same charges. The judgment was the first by The Hague, Netherlands-based tribunal for crimes by the former Yugoslav and Serbian forces during a military campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians in 1999. Their crimes took place during a Serb-led military campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population during the first six months of 1999 before a NATO bombing campaign forced a halt to the operation. Sainovic, former Yugoslav deputy prime minister and Pavkovic, a former Yugoslav army general were each sentenced to 22 years in prison for crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Watch Milutinovic receive not guilty verdict » . Lazarevic, another ex-general and Ojdanic, who was chief of general staff, were each sentenced to 15 years on charges of forced deportation of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia had heard during the two year tribunal how military forces of the former Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia waged a campaign of terror against Kosovo Albanians. The court said Milutinovic didn't have ""direct individual control"" over the army and that ""in practice"" then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ""exercised actual command authority"" over the army during the NATO campaign. Milosevic eventually surrendered to Serbian authorities in 2001 and had been extradited to The Hague, where he was on trial between 2002 and 2006 for the alleged offences in Kosovo and for alleged crimes in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. He died from natural causes in March 2006 before the trial ended and before a judgment was made. He was the first sitting head of state to be charged for war crimes when he was indicted in 1999. Kosovo's government declared its independence from Serbia in February 2008 after being administered by the United Nations since 1999. The U.S., Britain and France have recognized Kosovo's independence, but China and Russia joined Serbia in opposing the move.","U.N. tribunal clears ex-Serb President Milan Milutinovic of war crimes .

"Editor's note: We asked readers to weigh in on CNN.com Live producer Jarrett Bellini's vacation destination, and you chose South Africa. Check back for a wrap-up of his trip. Jarrett Bellini explores South Africa's Cape of Good Hope. CAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNN) -- The very best travel days often happen when good karma and perfect timing collide. And, somehow, on this morning, it also took a bit of tequila. Of course, normally, the latter ingredient tends to be counterintuitive. But not here. I arrived at the reception desk-slash-bar of my hostel, Long Street Backpackers, at 8:40 in the morning to be picked up for a full day of shark-diving. Fun. Productive. Presumably safe. However, it was then that I learned that the seas were deemed too rough, and the tour was cancelled. Bugger. Next thing I know, a glass of tequila is slammed in front of me with a bit of sage bartender advice, ""Might as well."" Normally, one would simply decline and go about attempting to have a relatively human-like existence on planet Earth.  But at this place, there's really no backing out. In fact, unless you like spontaneous hat parties and have a thing for sleeping under tables, it's best not to hang out in the reception room. Fortunately, I'm a rather strong-willed individual, free-thinking and confident. So, naturally, I buckled under the pressure. What can I say? I like these people. They wear funny hats. But as I was sitting there with a few other hostel folks who, apparently, also found it completely fit to begin ruining their day before nine, a Dutch kid came into the room and offhandedly mentioned that he and two Dutch girls had a car and were driving out to the Cape of Good Hope. My ears perked up. ""Can I come?"" And just like that, I was rescued from the gates of hell. I love you, Holland! The Cape of Good Hope is the southwestern-most point of the African continent, and it's an absolute thing of beauty. Panoramic views paint the sky as waves crash against the rocky shore. Here, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans become one. But not really. A decorative sign in the gift shop boasts: Where Two Oceans Merge. However, the real currents actually come together a little farther east. It's still amazingly beautiful, so, you know ... whatever. And after a full day of hiking and exploring the Cape with my new friends, we arrived back at the hostel to find our other friends right where we left them. Their heads turned as I entered, and one of them yelled out, ""Jarrett! Shots!"" Might as well.","CNN.com's Jarrett Bellini traveled to South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Union workers armed with an estimated 1.5 million signatures converged on Washington on Wednesday, demanding that Congress pass their highest-priority legislation. Union chief Andy Stern wants workers to have another way to organize besides relying on a secret ballot. They are lobbying for the Employee Free Choice Act. The legislation would allow a company's employees to openly sign a card demanding a union and then, if a majority sign, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate. The act would also stiffen federal laws that bar employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union. But while the battle is just beginning on Capitol Hill, business owners like Dave Bego have been in the center of the fight for some time. Bego, of Indianapolis, Indiana, is the owner of EMS, a company that provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire by one of the nation's most powerful labor organizations, the Service Employees International Union. The 1.8 million-member SEIU argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years. But Bego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him.  Watch how company, union are at odds » . He said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. He said his workers don't want a union, because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues. ""We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],"" Bego said. ""They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don't you think they'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we'd still be in business? I don't think so."" But union workers CNN talked to said EMS employees are afraid to speak publicly because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was. She said EMS fired her after she complained about what she said were unsafe conditions. ""We're not the only ones,"" Brown said. ""There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same similarities or different similarities, but they're going through things that are not right and not safe."" That's why she supports the Employee Free Choice Act, she said. ""When polls show that 60 percent of the workers in America want to organize, yet only 7 percent belong to unions, you know something's broken,"" one of the bill's sponsors, Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, told Wednesday's union rally in Washington. The option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the ""card check"" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don't want to join. ""Card check is real simple,"" Bego said. ""They want to eliminate the secret ballot election. And that is kind of like saying, 'We're going to elect the president of our country by signing cards. We're going to go door to door and you're going to sign a card for who you want to be president.' "" Bego said if his employees want a union, they should be able to secretly vote for one. He offered to hold union elections at his company, but only if they were monitored by the National Labor Relations Board and involved secret ballots. He said the union did not respond, but continued the protests. He took out an ad in the Indianapolis Star, challenging SEIU to ""fish or cut bait."" Andy Stern, president of the SEIU and a major supporter of President Barack Obama, said the legislation provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union. ""This isn't necessarily an election,"" Stern said. ""This is people wanting to start an organization."" ""This is workers' choice,"" Stern said. ""They can have a secret ballot, or they can legally affirm by a majority of them signing cards."" Stern would appear to have the muscle to push the legislation through Congress. The SEIU was the largest contributor to Democratic campaigns this election, pumping $85 million into campaigns and get-out-the-vote drives. The union said 2,000 members temporarily gave up their jobs to work for Obama's election, and Stern said politicians who made the unions promises during the campaign now need to keep them. ""We can lobby, we can petition, we can use the same things we use in the electoral process to un-elect people,"" he said. Asked if elected officials should be afraid of him, Stern replied, ""Everyone should be scared"" of not living up to promises. CNN's Marcus Hooper contributed to this report.","Bill would let employees openly sign a card demanding a union .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The archbishops of Canterbury and York are recommending that churches stop sharing the chalice at communion over swine flu fears, the Church of England said Thursday. The Church of England's leaders are recommending parishoners don't share the chalice. The archbishops wrote a letter to all Church of England bishops with the recommendation. It follows government advice not to share ""common vessels"" for food or drink so as not to spread the virus. In the Anglican Church, worshippers commonly drink from the same chalice during communion. The chalice is wiped before the next person drinks from it. For churches that still wish to offer both bread and wine, the archbishops recommend the priest dip communion wafers in the chalice before handing them out to those taking communion. ""The Department of Health have recently advised us that 'in a pandemic it makes good sense to take precautions to limit the spread of disease by not sharing common vessels for food and drink,'"" the archbishops write in the letter. ""In the light of this advice, we recommend those presiding at Holy Communion suspend the administration of the chalice during this wave of pandemic flu. For those who still wish to offer in both kinds, we recommend the practice whereby the presiding minister, whose hands should have been washed with the appropriate alcohol-based rub before handling the elements and the vessels, personally intincts all wafers before placing them in the hands of communicants.""  Watch more on Australian vaccine trial » . The archbishops note that this practice is widely observed in Anglican churches throughout Africa. ""Communicants receiving in this way need to be confident that the clergy and all assistant ministers follow the relevant guidance on hygiene,"" they write.

"(CNN) -- From the time she was an 11-year-old, blue-eyed, freckle-faced blonde until she was a 29-year-old woman with two children, Jaycee Dugard was kept locked away in a backyard compound of sheds and tarps by a couple who police say abducted her. Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard. She was more than 160 miles from home, and her family had no idea where she was. Nobody else knew she was there except the couple who snatched her off the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991, and took her straight to the soundproof shed, police said. Dugard's pocket of Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard in Antioch, California, was so overgrown no one even knew it existed. The details about Dugard's time in captivity emerged Thursday after one of Northern California's most enduring mysteries was solved and the Garridos were arrested and accused of her kidnapping. Anyone who came across the couple's backyard, littered with garbage cans and a dishwasher, would assume that it ended at a 6-foot fence.  Watch aerial images of the backyard compound » . ""You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances,"" said Fred Kollar, undersheriff of El Dorado County. ""There was nothing that would cause you to question it. You can't see it from either adjoining property. It was presumably well arranged."" But tucked away beyond the tangle of bushes, high grass and trees was a blue tarp that concealed the only world Dugard had known since her abduction. Kollar said the property had ""a hidden backyard within a backyard."" It included several sheds no taller than 6 feet, two tents and several outbuildings, ""where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives."" It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard's kidnapping, Kollar said. The ""secondary"" backyard was inside the first and was ""screened from view."" One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. In it were sheds and tarps, a makeshift bathroom and shower, along with electricity supplied by extension cords. Kollar compared the primitive conditions to camping. Dugard lived for several years there by herself. The sheds were locked from the outside. She grew up and had her captor's children there, and raised them there. ""None of them have ever been to school, they've never been to a doctor,"" Kollar said. ""They were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house,"" he said. ""They were born there."" The children, both girls, are now 15 and 11. ""They are all in good health,"" Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing.

"(CNN) -- More than 1,100 people worldwide have died from swine flu since it emerged in Mexico and the U.S. in April, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. A young girl wears a mask at a hospital in Hanoi. Vietnam reported its first death from swine flu this week. As of July 31, the total number of victims killed by the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, stood at 1,154 -- an increase of 338 since WHO's previous update on July 27. The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed, spreading as widely in six weeks as common influenza viruses spread in the six months, according to WHO. WHO data showed the total number of laboratory confirmed cases at 162,380, but the number could be higher since individual cases no longer have to be tested or reported. The total number of countries and territories reporting at least one case of infection now stands at 168, with new cases reported in Azerbaijan, Gabon, Grenada, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Monaco, Nauru, Swaziland and Suriname. In the United States, federal health officials are worried about the upcoming flu season. They say nearly 160 million Americans may need to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus, but it won't be as simple as a single shot. In a background briefing with reporters on Tuesday, two senior administration officials said the vaccine, which is still in clinical trials, would require two shots. The first shot would be followed by a second shot three weeks later. Immunity to the virus would finally kick in two weeks after that. That means someone who is vaccinated by the time the program is expected to launch in late October won't get protection until late fall. On Tuesday, British-based pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline announced it had signed contracts with nine governments to provide 96 million doses of a H1N1 vaccine and was in ongoing discussions with governments to provide further supplies. GlaxoSmithKline has already signed deals worth $250 million in total to provide 195 million doses and plans to donate 50 million doses to the World Health Organization. ""First supplies of the vaccine will be available to governments from September onwards, with shipments expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010,"" GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement. ""The exact pace of delivery will be dependent on capacity and the yield of the influenza strain."" Details of the immunization program were revealed as part of the government's overall plan to deal with what is expected to be a difficult flu season. The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week issued sweeping guidelines for a vaccination campaign against the swine flu strain, identifying more than half the population as targets for the first round of vaccinations. The priority groups include pregnant women, health care and emergency services personnel, children, adolescents and young adults from six months to 24 years of age, household and caregiver contacts of children younger than six months and healthy adults with certain medical conditions. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to that of seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, aches and runny nose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A significant number of infected people have also reported diarrhea and vomiting.","WHO: Swine flu deaths up 338 in recent days to 1,154 in total worldwide .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Holly Williams is one of the only artists in country music male or female who doesn't have a stylist. But then again, she might be the only entertainer in Nashville who owns a clothing boutique. Holly Williams is daughter of musician Hank Williams Jr. and granddaughter of musician Hank Williams Sr. The chic women's store is named H. Audrey after her maternal grandmother, who was the first wife of the late country music icon Hank Williams. Holly's father is Bocephus -- the legendary hellraiser and three-time CMA Entertainer of the Year otherwise known as Hank Williams Jr. She got her height from him. With heels on, she's about 6-foot-3 -- all tanned legs and long, blonde hair. She looks like a star. And at 28, she wants to earn the right to be one. Williams just released her sophomore album, ""Here With Me"" (Mercury Nashville). Most of the 11 tracks are self-penned, and she sings them with emotional honesty in a smoky, soulful voice. The characters in her lyrics are friends, family and lovers from the past. She also has a man in her present: On July 24, she became engaged to Chris Coleman, the drummer in her band.  Watch Williams show off her talents » . Williams spoke with CNN about her new album and her family's legacy. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your new album was released the same day as your dad's new album. Was that planned? Holly Williams: It wasn't planned at all. About three weeks before my release, I was looking over to see who else was coming out that day, and it said, ""Hank Jr."" -- and I'm going, ""Is this something my manager planned?"" And it's just so random, because out of the 52 weeks of the year, it just happened. CNN: What did he think about the album? Williams: Well, this is embarrassing, but I haven't sent him a copy yet! I need to. He's heard two of the singles. He's always been a huge supporter of the songwriting, and just been a great encourager with me. CNN: What was it like when you were growing up? Williams: Well, my mom raised my sister and me. [My parents] split when we were 3 and 5, and he was touring 300 nights a year. We'd see him every few months when he was off the road, and we'd go up there and hunt and fish and be on the farm. But my mom did all the rules and curfews and all that. CNN: Your mother doesn't seem jaded by the music industry at all. Williams: Oh, she doesn't at all. They split in '83, so when they first got married in '77, he was still a struggling artist and doing small theater shows. My single out right now is called ""Mama"" that I wrote ... is kind of a thank-you song, because she was always the most positive influence -- had so much light. My dad always talks about what a great mom she was, and they're still close friends. CNN: What was it like for you going into the music industry? Was there a lot of pressure? Williams: The songwriting hit me at a very young age. Eight, 9, 10 is when I started writing. Went away from it for a few years, and at 17 picked up a guitar and it was just on from there. I'm 28 now, and I've been doing it for 10 years nonstop. I put out an EP myself when I was 20, and paid 200 bucks for my Web site, and traveled over in the U.K. alone with a backpack. And in the U.S., I just took my mom's Suburban and followed everyone from Train, John Mellencamp, Billy Bob Thornton -- everyone's bus -- and just did any show I could, whether they paid or not. Just played, played, played. CNN: Do you remember the first song you wrote when you were 8? Williams: I do. The first song I wrote was called ""Who Am I,"" and it's funny because it was very serious. I had a very happy childhood, but it was very introspective about this broken marriage, and I wanted Tiffany or Debbie Gibson to cut it. I remember just telling my mom, ""Just please call the publishing company. ... ""I was so ambitious. I remember making cassette tapes and mailing them to Music Row. CNN: What was the reaction from those tapes? Williams: I'm sure there was never any response. I'm sure people just laughed. I was not as talented as Taylor Swift when I was 15, 16. I could write a decent song, but I couldn't sing that well at that age. CNN: You have a love for rock 'n' roll. Why did you go into country with this album? Williams: Growing up in my house, you would assume I was growing up around country music with my dad being Hank Williams Jr. But he did not bring music home. He always said, ""I'm not Bocephus to you. I'm Daddy."" So I was really left to my own devices to find music on my own. And I really fell in love with the singer-songwriters of the '70s -- Tom Waits, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Carole King -- that whole era really struck me. And when I heard Hank Williams Sr.'s name mentioned from those people -- from Leonard Cohen to Bruce Springsteen -- that's what really brought me back around to learning more about my grandfather. My music is still based in that singer-songwriter tradition. Adding a fiddle and steel guitar makes it more country, and adding blazing electric guitars makes it more rock. I'm on a country label now. CNN: You also own a clothing boutique in Nashville called H. Audrey. Williams: Everything I have on, except my shoes, is from there. ... It's a struggle in this economy, but we make enough to pay our payroll and buy the clothes. And it's nice to fold jeans every now and again, and get my mind out of myself. CNN: When you're writing down your goals on your wish list, what is it you really want? Williams: I would love to sell a million records. I would love to play in arenas -- but what I really want to build is a core fanbase, and just hopefully build a place in the Williams family.","Country music scion Holly Williams has new album out, ""Here With Me""

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The United Nations has condemned Friday's rocket attack on Israel from southern Lebanon, and urged both sides ""to exercise maximum restraint."" Italian soldiers with UNIFIL and Lebanese security forces inspect a rocket site in Qlayleh, Lebanon, on Friday. Israel's military fired between 12 and 18 artillery shells into southern Lebanon Friday shortly after the rocket attack on northern Israel, according to the Israeli military and a Lebanese army official. There were no casualties in either incident. Rockets fired from Lebanon struck open spaces in the western Galilee region of northern Israel, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman said. There were no reports of damage. Israel retaliated by firing toward the source of the rocket fire, the IDF spokesman said. The shells landed near the southern Lebanese village of Qlayleh around 3 p.m. (8 a.m. ET), a Lebanese army official said. The IDF spokesman said the Israeli military considers the rocket-fire incident to be serious and holds Lebanon's government and military responsible. Israel Radio reported one rocket struck near the northern town of Nahariya and another landed near Gesher Haziv, a kibbutz, or collective community. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said residents near Nahariya heard several explosions, and the remnants of at least one rocket were found. There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a statement through his spokeswoman, condemning the attack. He said the United Nations mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL, ""is investigating the circumstances of the incident in close cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces."" There are an estimated 30,000 rockets in southern Lebanon, all under the control of Hezbollah militants. Israel fought a war against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon three years ago that is widely regarded as having empowered the Shiite militia.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For the first time since September 11, 2001, the rich chords of a chapel organ damaged in the terrorist attacks echoed through New York City's historic St. Paul's Chapel. Organist Marilyn Haskel rehearses for Easter services at St. Paul's Chapel in New York. In the months following the attacks, the chapel became a makeshift bunker for recovery and relief workers. Working round the clock, hundreds of volunteers transformed St. Paul's into a place for rest, meals, prayer and counseling for city firefighters, police and construction workers clearing the rubble just blocks away at Ground Zero. When St. Paul's Chapel reopened to the public on August 25, 2002, the organ was clogged with debris and could not be played. Organist Marilyn Haskel's rehearsal on Friday for Easter Sunday services marked the instrument's triumphant return to functionality after Mann & Trupiano organ builders of Brooklyn removed 2.5 gallons of dirt and debris in a thorough ""resuscitation."" ""When a pipe sounds we say that it 'speaks.' And if it doesn't 'speak' clearly, then the sound isn't as interesting and colorful,"" Haskel told CNN Friday morning. With its airways clear, ""This one is exactly right,"" she said. Haskel rehearsed two pieces: ""God's Paschal Lamb is Sacrificed for Us"" and ""Good Christians All Rejoice and Sing.""  Watch and listen to the rehearsal » . Built in stages between 1764 and 1796, the chapel is Manhattan's oldest continuously used public building. Designed in Georgian Classic-Revival style, it boasts handmade woodwork, carvings, and door hinges as well as 14 Waterford chandeliers installed in 1802. The chapel's original organ was built in London. In the years since, a number of instruments have called St. Paul's Chapel home. The 1,680-pipe instrument currently housed within the chapel's elaborate original 200-year-old mahogony case was built in 1964 by of Schlicker Organ Co. of Buffalo, New York. The chapel now serves as host to a series of 9/11 memorial exhibits. As Haskel played Friday morning, tourists from around the world browsed the displays. A man from the Bronx who assisted the New York Fire Department in the months after the attacks remembered a time when the chapel ""closed its door to souls and opened it to bodies"" and the organ fell silent under the clamor of refuge-seeking firemen, police officers and other workers. He said he was attending Friday morning's rehearsal to hear the organ played for the first time. ""The organ was not usable then,"" Haskel said of the months following the 9/11 attacks. ""For me, in being able to be here -- and meeting people who were here during 9/11 -- to be able to play organ music that should be happening in this room is a great honor,"" she said.","Organ in St. Paul's Chapel in New York had been silent since September 11, 2001 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A model who was slammed with derogatory terms by an anonymous blogger has the right to learn the identity of her online heckler, a judge ruled. Google complied with the court's ruling, submitting  the creator's IP address and e-mail address. In August 2008, a user of Blogger.com, Google's blogging service, created ""Skanks in NYC,"" a site that assailed Liskula Cohen, 37, a Canadian-born onetime cover girl who has appeared in Vogue and other fashion magazines. The blog featured photos of Cohen captioned with terms including ""psychotic,"" ""ho,"" and ""skank."" On Monday, New York Supreme Court Judge Joan Madden ruled that Google must hand over to Cohen any identifying information it possesses about the blog's creator. Steven Wagner, Cohen's attorney, said Google complied with the ruling Tuesday evening, submitting to his legal team the creator's IP address and e-mail address. Only a valid e-mail address is required to register for a blog on Blogger.com. Wagner said that once his legal team tracks the e-mail address to a name, the next step will be to sue Cohen's detractor for defamation. He said he suspected the creator of the blog is an acquaintance of Cohen. The blog has not been operational for months. The unidentified creator of the blog was represented in court by an attorney, Anne Salisbury, who said her client voluntarily took the blog down when Cohen initiated legal action against it. Salisbury suggested that Cohen is more interested in attracting publicity than restoring her reputation. She contended her client's blog would have languished harmlessly in obscurity had Cohen not filed suit. The site had negligible traffic and only five posts on it, all written on a single day, she said. In her ruling, the judge quoted a Virginia court that ruled in a similar case that nameless online taunters should be held accountable when their derision crosses a line. ""The protection of the right to communicate anonymously must be balanced against the need to assure that those persons who choose to abuse the opportunities presented by this medium can be made to answer for such transgressions,"" the judge said, quoting the Virginia decision. Cohen's attorney said he was ""happy that the court recognizes that the Internet is not a place where people can freely defame people."" But the blogger's attorney strongly disputed the judge's reasoning. Salisbury asserted that her client's invective was not unusual for the Internet, and that hyperbolic online name-calling is so rampant -- ""in comments sections, on Twitter, on blogs"" as to practically be part of the Web's DNA. She warned that Monday's ruling has ""potentially damaging implications for free speech on the Internet."" After the ruling, a Google spokesman expressed sympathy for targets of Internet insult-slinging, but said the company divulges user information only when ordered to do so by a court. ""We sympathize with anyone who may be the victim of cyberbullying. We also take great care to respect privacy concerns and will only provide information about a user in response to a subpoena or other court order,"" Google's Andrew Pederson said.","Judge orders Google to hand over blogger's identifying information to woman .

The winning bid of US $11,068,193 (HK $85,780,000) was by a private Shanghai businessman. It was nearly triple the estimate of US $3.9 million (HK $30 million), Sotheby's said.

""No one else should have sat down in this place."" The throne belonged to Emperor Qianlong, who ruled from 1736-1795. The 4.6 foot-long (140 centimeters) piece is considered rare and prized because of the zitan wood from which it was carved. It also features carved panels, curved legs and an elaborate ""Five Dragon"" carving on the front and back. The number five represents the ""five blessings"" of old age, wealth, health, virtue and peaceful death, according to Sotheby's. Other pieces that sold Thursday included a celadon ground butterfly vase. The Qianlong period piece sold for US $2.74 million (HK $21.3 million).

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- An angry, naked man commandeered a school bus full of teenage students Thursday in Atlanta, police said. The man drove the bus for less than a mile before a student confronted him and the bus crashed into a wall off the road, according to police. The incident started Thursday afternoon when the bus stopped to let students out, said Atlanta police officer James Polite. Arris Pitmon, 23, darted toward the bus and hoisted himself in through an open window, Polite said. Pitmon took control of the bus as the frightened driver ran to the back of it, the officer said. While the bus was moving, the man abandoned the steering wheel and walked toward the back of the bus, Polite added. A student then ran toward the steering wheel, prompting the man to fight the student. The unmanned bus continued until it left the roadway and crashed. Students fled the bus, many using the back door emergency exit, and onlookers subdued the man until police arrived. Some students were taken to area hospitals. Their conditions weren't available Thursday night. Chiquita Rogers told CNN affiliate WXIA that the man had tried to hit some of the students, including her 16-year-old, Donte. ""He pushed my son, and that's when my son hit him. I guess everybody started swinging, and everybody just started out the back door, jumping. I'm just grateful that my son is still alive, because it could have been worse."" Onlooker Corey Turner told WXIA, ""Children were jumping out the emergency door ... jumping off the bus. ... They were saying, 'Help, help, help! ... Somebody hijacked the bus.'""","Police: Arris Pitmon ran toward the bus and climbed in through an open window .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of the most unexpected controversies of the Obama administration came to a head Tuesday as the president delivered a hotly debated back-to-school speech to students across the country. President Obama speaks to students Tuesday at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia. Many conservatives expressed fear over the past week that the president's address would be used to push a partisan political agenda. Obama, however, avoided any mention of political initiatives. He repeatedly urged students to work hard and stay in school. ""There is no excuse for not trying,"" he told students at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia.  Watch Obama speak to the students » . ""This isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future."" Read text of Obama's speech to students (pdf) Several Cabinet officials are slated to deliver similar messages at various schools across the country throughout the day. In the past week, news of Obama's speech had upset some parents. ""Thinking about my kids in school having to listen to that just really upsets me,"" suburban Colorado mother Shanneen Barron told CNN Denver affiliate KMGH last week, before the text of the speech was released. ""I'm an American. They are Americans, and I don't feel that's OK. I feel very scared to be in this country with our leadership right now."" But Amy Veasley, a parent from the Dallas, Texas, area, said Monday that she was surprised by the controversy. ""The president of our country wants to call our students to action. I'm not sure why parents wouldn't want their students to hear out the leader of our country,"" she said. A Baltimore, Maryland, teacher who asked not to be identified bemoaned the fact that the country has ""become so polarized that we believe that our president is an enemy and not our leader."" During George W. Bush's presidency, she said, ""whether I disagreed or not, I still saw him as a leader."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's speech . White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday that ""it's a sad state of affairs that many in this country politically would rather start an 'Animal House' food fight rather than inspire kids to stay in school."" Some school administrators had decided to show the president's speech, but others decided against it. And others were leaving the decision in the hands of individual teachers. One school district in Toronto, Ohio, decided to air the speech live for students in the third grade and up but not show it to younger children, according to CNN affiliate WTOV. Nine out of 550 students attending the Toronto schools showing the speech chose not to watch it, WTOV noted. Toronto Superintendent Fred Burns said the parents of the nine children were concerned that the speech was too political.  Watch students respond to Obama's speech » . ""It's a very charismatic speech,"" Burns told WTOV. ""It's very much a speech to help kids get involved in education and finish school."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a possible contender for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, said Sunday that Obama's speech could disrupt an already-hectic first day of school for many students. ""I think there's concerns about the disruption,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" calling the scheduling of the speech a ""little ham-fisted"" by the White House.  Watch CNN's Ed Henry talk about school speech uproar » . Education Secretary Arne Duncan, however, noted that Obama's speech was not unprecedented. President George H.W. Bush delivered a nationally televised speech to students from a Washington school in fall 1991, encouraging them to say no to drugs and work hard. In November 1988, President Reagan delivered more politically charged remarks that were made available to students nationwide. Among other things, Reagan called taxes ""such a penalty on people that there's no incentive for them to prosper ... because they have to give so much to the government."" Some of the controversy over Obama's speech involved a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the address. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After pressure from conservatives, the White House distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals."" Duncan said Sunday that the passage was poorly worded. Some politically conservative figures said they had no problem with Obama speaking to students about education. ""I think there is a place for the president ... to talk to schoolchildren and encourage"" them, former first lady Laura Bush told CNN Monday. Parents should follow Obama's example and ""encourage their own children to stay in school and to study hard and to try to achieve the dream that they have,"" she added. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Obama's speech was a good idea if the message is a positive one about completing school. ""It is good to have the president of the United States say to young people across America, 'Stay in school, study, and do your homework,' "" Gingrich said. Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer accused Obama last week of trying to ""indoctrinate America's children to his socialist agenda."" ""Now that the White House got their hand in the cookie jar caught, they changed everything,"" he said Monday. After reading the text, he said, ""My kids will be watching the president's speech, as I hope all kids will.""","President Obama speaks to students about education's importance .

"(CNN) -- Hot dogs? Check. Fireworks? Check. Big Ben? Wait a minute... The American Society of Sydney, Australia, helps put together a July Fourth celebration on Sydney Harbour. There may not be international landmarks at your neighbor's Fourth of July barbecue, but for Americans living abroad, they're the perfect backdrop when celebrating independence. To global Yanks, it's just as important -- if not more so -- to throw an Independence Day party that feels just like home. From Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Rome, Italy, Fourth of July soirees are happening on Saturday in nearly every corner of the world. So if your globetrotting lands you in one of these cities over the weekend, consider squeezing an Independence Day celebration into your itinerary. July Fourth, eh? Canada Day occurs a mere three days before the Fourth, and our neighbor to the north lights up the sky for both. Held on the shores of Lake Ontario at the amusement park Ontario Place in Toronto, the Grand Finale for the Canada Dry Festival of Fire is an extensive fireworks display that draws between 15,000 and 20,000 people each year. Choreographed to a surprise playlist, ""the fireworks actually detonate to the beat of the songs, which are voted on by the listeners of [local radio station] CHFI,"" said Ontario Place spokesman Nick Kondrat. Tickets include an all-day pass to the park, so be sure not to miss the eclectic entertainment, like ""Salsa at Ontario Place,"" featuring live salsa music, dance competitions and lessons. Fireworks begin at 10:30 p.m. Visit the park's Web site for tickets. Americans in London Town . Time Out London lists this event as a ""must-do"" for Independence Day. Standing out from a slew of holiday gatherings, the 7th annual Fourth of July picnic, hosted by the American expatriate community, begins at 2 p.m. at London, England's, Battersea Park. To keep the kids happy, there will be red, white and blue bouncy castles as well as balloons and face-painting, according to the group's Web site. For the adults, plenty of barbecue will be available for purchase in addition to two fully stocked cash bars. Between softball games and paddleboat rentals at the nearby lake, there's plenty to do for the whole family. For a grand finale, a laser fireworks display starts at 9:45 p.m. Even better: Admission is free all day. When In Rome . A blowout event planned a year in advance, the American International Club of Rome's 20th celebration is a patriotic tribute: potato sack races for the kids, swing-dancing lessons with live music and all the s'mores, hot dogs and hamburgers you can stand, said the club manager and event coordinator, Nina Farrell. ""When you're away from home, it's really nice to get together and celebrate and be a little bit American,"" Farrell said. The celebration will kick off at 5 p.m. with Americans and Italians alike at Marymount International School, ending at midnight with the crackling of sparklers. (Sorry, no fireworks allowed on the school grounds.) For tickets, visit the AICR's Web site at http://www.aicrome.org/. Red, white and blue down under . Mary Botto believes it's the little things that help a person become acclimated, and the Fourth of July celebration the American Society of Sydney, Australia, helps pull together is one of them. Botto, the society's president, said this year's party will be held at the Hunters Hill Sailing Club, right on Sydney Harbour. The organization stays true to an American theme, from the food to the fireworks. The one piece of American tradition Botto's group can't replicate is warm weather: July is winter in Australia, so most of the festivities are indoors, except the fireworks, which start around 6 p.m. Everyone is welcome, and locals take part in the fun. ""Australia Day here is huge and I think Australians really respect the fact that we still celebrate even though we're not in our home country,"" Botto said. Tickets can be purchased at moshtix.com.au. Independence in Argentina . It doesn't take a bartender to know that beer is a top seller on Independence Day, and that's not just in the United States. Crack a cold one in Buenos Aires, where a burgeoning pub crawl is poised to take over the Paris of South America. Between the drinks, a diverse group of participants and the four frat boys from Georgia running the show, you'll feel right at home. The company, 12th Gate Inc., has spent the past two years rounding up tourists, expatriates and the stray 70-year-old into one big, pub-crawling group. Saturday marks their first Fourth of July event, and they've pulled out all the stops. ""We've been living here for awhile, and we miss home,"" said marketing and events planner Will Aquino. ""We have the means to throw a great party, and we are."" Instead of the usual pizza, the owners have upped the ante to provide more festive fare: hamburgers, hot dogs and red, white and blue Jell-O shots. You can even get a commemorative T-shirt with the $13 ticket price, which covers an hourlong open bar, food and transportation to three bars throughout the city. There won't be any fireworks, but participants will be supplied with sparklers and American flags. To secure a reservation, head to the 12th Gate Web site.","Americans abroad organize July Fourth celebrations in their adopted homes .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Records from a cell phone used by President-elect Obama were improperly breached, apparently by employees of the cell phone company, Verizon Wireless said Thursday. An Obama spokesman said the transition team was told  Verizon Wireless workers looked through billing records. ""This week we learned that a number of Verizon Wireless employees have, without authorization, accessed and viewed President-Elect Barack Obama's personal cell phone account,"" Lowell McAdam, Verizon Wireless president and CEO, said in a statement. ""All employees who have accessed the account -- whether authorized or not --- have been put on immediate leave, with pay."" The Obama transition team was notified Wednesday by Verizon of the breach, said team spokesman Robert Gibbs. He said the president-elect no longer uses the phone. McAdam said the device on the account was a simple voice flip-phone, not a BlackBerry or other smartphone designed for e-mail or other data services, so none of Obama's e-mail could have been accessed. Verizon Wireless, meanwhile, has launched an internal probe to determine whether Obama's information was simply shared among employees or whether ""the information of our customer had in any way been compromised outside our company, and this investigation continues,"" McAdam said in an internal company e-mail obtained by CNN. ""Employees with legitimate business needs for access will be returned to their positions, while employees who have accessed the account improperly and without legitimate business justification will face appropriate disciplinary action,"" McAdam said, ""up to and including termination."" The company has alerted ""the appropriate federal law enforcement authorities,"" McAdam said. Gibbs said that while the Secret Service has been notified, he is not aware of any criminal investigation. He said he believes it was billing records that were accessed. Gibbs said that anyone viewing the records likely would have been able to see phone numbers and the frequency of calls Obama made, but that ""nobody was monitoring voicemail or anything like that.""

"Editor's note: Ivan Watson is CNN's correspondent based in Istanbul, Turkey. The Bamiyan Valley is a visually and archaeologically stunning part of Afghanistan. The region hopes to build its tourism industry. (CNN) -- Thursday is ""Chinese night"" at the Hotel Silk Road in Afghanistan's Bamiyan province. Hungry guests sip cans of Coke and nonalcoholic beer and pick at a buffet that includes General Tsao's chicken, egg drop soup and slices of sweet green melon grown in nearby fields. When a vegetarian diner arrives, the hotel's Japanese owner, Hiromi Yasui, runs back to the kitchen to whip up a dish of spinach, garlic and steamed rice. ""This is the most clean kitchen in Bamiyan,"" she boasts in heavily accented English, as she directs her staff of Afghan assistants in fluent Dari. Yasui proudly points to an electric dishwasher, perhaps the only one of its kind in this battle-scarred Afghan province. The Hotel Silk Road has been open for less than two years. The green concrete walls of this compound jar somewhat with the brown, mud brick architecture of Bamiyan Valley. But the hotel is probably the largest foreign private investment in Bamiyan's fledgling tourism industry since the overthrow of the Taliban eight years ago.  See photos of the Bamiyan Province » . Aid workers say tourism is one of the greatest economic hopes for reviving this isolated, yet visually -- and archaeologically -- stunning part of Afghanistan, a region that has seen little infrastructure development over the last eight years, even though Bamiyan is one of the safest parts of the country.  Tour the Bamiyan Valley's caves » . ""The natural resources and cultural resources here are probably the single best place for economic development to happen, around revitalizing the tourism industry here,"" says Bob Thelen, the representative for the Aga Khan Development Network in Bamiyan. The nonprofit organization has been working with the government of New Zealand to distribute $1.2 million over a three-year period to develop eco-tourism as an industry in Bamiyan. Bamiyan first attracted widespread international attention in 2001, when Taliban militants spent weeks blowing up two giant statues of Buddha. For more than 1,500 years, these colossal figures -- one was 53 meters (174 feet) high, the other 35 meters (115 feet) -- stood like sentries overlooking this alpine valley. Today, the massive caves where the Buddhas once stood are huge, empty pockets carved into cliffs that dominate the countryside. Despite the loss of these archaeological treasures, the cave network of monasteries that honeycomb the cliffs, as well as Bamiyan's breathtaking mountains and alpine lakes, continue to attract a trickle of both Afghan and foreign tourists. Hotel Silk Road owner Yasui spotted Bamiyan's potential when she first traveled here as a photojournalist in 1996. ""Before the war, this was a touristic place,"" she says. ""More than 7,000 cars a day visited here."" In the '60s and '70s, Afghanistan was a Central Asian stop on the Hippie Trail, a destination favored by hash-smoking Western visitors driving Volkswagen vans. But the Soviet invasion of 1979 plunged the country into a decades-long spiral of conflict. Bamiyan became the site of horrific massacres during the civil war of the 1990s and the subsequent rise of the Taliban. The Taliban's overthrow in 2001 seemed to open the door to new opportunity. In 2002, with the help of her Afghan husband and a Japanese investor who fronted hundreds of thousands of dollars, Yasui purchased a plot of land next to a bend in the river that runs through the valley. The couple then spent the next five years building their hotel. ""I like Afghanistan, I like Bamiyan,"" Yasui explains. ""[But in the past,] I didn't want to stay more than three days, because there was no shower, no place to sleep."" Yasui's hotel opened in 2007. Rooms cost $100 a night, pricing them far out of the range of most Afghans. Guests must remove their shoes at the entrance and wear slippers, in accordance with Yasui's strict standards of hygiene. ""The furniture has all been imported from Pakistan,"" Yasui said. ""I bought the water glasses from the PX [American military supermarket] in Kabul."" Yasui is not the only hotelier in Bamiyan. In 2003, an Afghan businessman named Raziq got a jump-start on the local tourism industry, when he and several partners rented a house on a plateau offering a spectacular view of the Buddha cliffs. The building had been housing American special forces soldiers. Raziq and his partners rechristened it the Roof of Bamiyan Hotel. Raziq, an ethnic Hazara who learned American-accented English catering to foreigners on Kabul's touristic Chicken Street, says he got his inspiration to open a hotel after he saw female Western backpackers paying to sleep on the floor of a grimy tea shop in Bamiyan's dusty bazaar. Over the last year, the Afghan government declared Bamiyan's Band-i-Amir lake, which sits 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) above sea level, the country's first national park. The New Zealand-funded eco-tourism project, in conjunction with the Aga Khan Foundation, also recently trained 22 young male and female Afghans to be professional tour guides. The three-month course included ""the relevant topics for this area, geology, archaeology, history, hospitality, English, communication skills,"" said Thelen, of the Aga Khan Development Network. One of these guides is former Roof of Bamiyan employee Jawad Wafa. Though only 23 years old, this ambitious young Afghan plans to launch a tourism and logistics company, complete with a fleet of rental vehicles and guides. ""The first thing we need to have more tourists in Bamiyan, we need security and peace. The second one is roads,"" Wafa says. Eight years after the overthrow of the Taliban, the entire province of Bamiyan has barely 3 kilometers (about 2 miles) of paved roads. Travel here from Kabul requires at least seven hours driving on a bone-jarring dirt track. But even this isolated oasis is feeling the threat of the mounting violence spreading across the country. ""Every time there is a bomb in Kabul, visitors cancel reservations,"" says Raziq, operator of the Roof of Bamiyan Hotel. And in recent months, troops from New Zealand have documented a spike in insurgent attacks, mostly along Bamiyan's border with Baghlan province, a region where Taliban insurgents have grown increasingly active. ""As much as on the one hand you can promote Bamiyan and other pockets throughout Afghanistan as secure and peaceful, there's always the very real threat of violence,"" Thelen said. Tour operators saw a dramatic drop in foreign visitors this summer, due to the uncertainty and violence surrounding the August 20 presidential elections. In fact, the handful of people seen touring the remains of the Buddha statues last week were mostly American aid workers. They were sent by their organizations from less secure parts of Afghanistan, to take temporary shelter within the mountain walls of Bamiyan Valley.","Bamiyan is one of the safest parts of Afghanistan .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A soldier who survived a Taliban attack that killed nine U.S. troops in Afghanistan last month described a scene of ""pure chaos"" in which he watched buddies die. Army Spc. Tyler Stafford is recovering from wounds he suffered in the July 13 attack. Army Spc. Tyler Stafford and fellow soldiers in the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team were establishing an outpost near the village of Wanat when about 200 Taliban militants attacked July 13. ""They had 200-plus guys all shooting at us -- I mean, pure chaos,"" Stafford said. ""You could hear guys screaming."" Nine Americans were killed and 12 -- including Stafford -- were wounded in the deadliest attack on U.S. forces in Afghanistan in three years. Afghan sources said that up to 100 militants were killed in the attack. Stafford, who is recovering at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, said he and his fellow soldiers were facing Taliban fighters on three sides when the attack began. The Americans were outmanned and outgunned. A NATO spokesman said the defense of the outpost was ""heroic."" Once he was wounded, Stafford called out to his friend, Cpl. Matthew Phillips. ""I yelled to him, I was like, 'Phillips, man I need help. I'm hit.' ... I looked at him and I called him about four or five times. I was like, 'Phillips. Phillips. Are you all right, Phillips?' And he never moved. ""That's the first one of my buddies I've ever seen die."" A short distance away was Cpl. Jonathan Ayers. ""He never once stopped shooting,"" Stafford said. ""I thought that was completely amazing. He never, I mean, he finally was killed by [rocket-propelled grenades] and gunfire, but he never once stopped shooting back at them."" Lt. Jonathan Brostrom and Cpl. Jason Hovater were killed when they ran through a hail of Taliban gunfire in an attempt to carry more ammunition to their fellow soldiers, Stafford said. ""They knew our guys were in trouble, and when the Airborne's in trouble, you don't leave them to die; you go help them,"" Stafford said. ""They brought what they could."" The Americans were running low on ammunition, and some of them were so badly wounded they were unable to move, Stafford said. Help did not come for an hour, he said. Stafford eventually was helicoptered to safety. He said he looked back at the scene below while aboard the chopper. ""It's like one of the those movies out of like Vietnam that you see with all these special effects and everything's on fire,"" he recalled. ""Smoke in the air, and that's all you see is tracer rounds going back and forth ... just, 'boom, boom, boom.' "" The other Americans who died were Sgt. Israel Garcia, Cpl. Gunnar Zwilling, Spc. Sergio Abad, Cpl. Pruitt Rainey and Cpl. Jason Bogar. ""The way they served each other -- you're fighting for the guy on your back, the guy that's in the foxhole next to you, when that kind of stuff happens. We all love each other very much,"" Stafford said.","Survivor of attack that killed nine U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan recalls ""chaos""

"(CNN) -- Allies of Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Wednesday defeated an attempt by opposition leaders to impeach her on large-scale corruption charges -- the fourth such attempt in four years. Protesters display slogans in front of the House of Representatives in Manila on Tuesday. The House Justice Committee dismissed the impeachment complaint by 42-8 votes, saying that it was ""insufficient in substance,"" the state-run Philippines News Agency reported. The complaint alleged that Arroyo and her husband were directly involved in an Internet broadband deal with a Chinese firm. The deal was ultimately scrapped amid allegations of corruption. ""I'm not saying that there is no substance (to the complaint), but it was insufficient,"" Deputy House Speaker Pablo Garcia told the committee before the vote. ""The allegations are not allegations of fact. They are conclusions, opinion, inferences, and even arguments,"" Garcia said, according to the news agency. Arroyo first took office in 2001. Since then, she has survived four impeachment attempts and periodic rumors of coup. She won re-election in 2004, but opposition parties called into question the legitimacy of that race. During the vote count, Arroyo was tape-recorded talking to a senior election official, which opposition leaders charge is evidence she manipulated the outcome. The president has denied any wrongdoing. The first of the impeachment charges were brought against Arroyo in 2005 for vote-tampering. Congress rejected the charges. The opposition then tried to impeach Arroyo in 2006 and 2007 -- and Congress dismissed those attempts as well. Her six-year term ends in 2010.","Complaint alleged that Arroyo and husband were involved in deal with Chinese firm .

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN) -- The government of de facto Honduran President Roberto Micheletti is not ready to sign a proposed agreement to end the country's ongoing political crisis, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno said in Honduras. Interim President Roberto Micheletti is reaching out to Costan Rican President Oscar Arias for a solution. His remarks came on Tuesday at the conclusion of a two-day visit by a delegation of the Organization of American States. ""Although the commission concludes that progress was made during its visit, it must recognize that there still no disposition toward full acceptance of the San Jose Accord on the part of Mr. Micheletti or his supporters,"" Stagno said. The proposed San Jose Accord aims to resolve nearly two months of political turmoil that Honduras has faced following the June 28 coup that ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. The delegation, which consisted of seven foreign ministers and included the participation of OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza, met with representatives of all branches of government, presidential candidates, the military, clergy, businessmen and representatives of various sectors of Honduran society. ""The majority of the actors expressed their conformity with the foundations of the San Jose Accord, although many of them expressed concerns about the same,"" Stagno said. The biggest obstacles were two points in the proposed agreement: one calling for Zelaya's return to power, and another calling for a temporary political amnesty for both sides. The delegation also spoke with Zelaya supporters, including his wife, who said that the ousted president was willing to accept the San Jose Accord and abide by it immediately. Originally, Zelaya's negotiators had walked away from the proposal, offered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, citing the intransigence of Micheletti's team. In support of the OAS delegation, the United States announced Tuesday that many visas for Hondurans would be suspended. The United Nations and the European Union have condemned the coup and have refused to recognize the provisional government led by former congressional leader Micheletti. Micheletti has insisted that Zelaya was not overthrown but instead was replaced through constitutional means. The Honduran political crisis stems from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution, even though the country's congress had outlawed the vote and the Honduran Supreme Court had ruled it illegal.","Proposed San Jose Accord aims to resolve nearly two months of political turmoil .

"(CNN)  -- A 61-year-old pastor who was killed in a rural Oklahoma church was found lying behind the altar with her arms outstretched, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Carol Daniels, a 61-year-old pastor, was found nude behind the altar of a church in Anadarko, Oklahoma. It was one of the latest details to emerge in the killing of Carol Daniels, whose nude body was found in the Christ Holy Sanctified Church in Anadarko, Oklahoma, in a crime scene the district attorney described as ""horrific."" Her clothes were taken from the scene, and a dissolving agent had been sprayed around her body, the source said. An FBI profiler was brought in during the weekend to assist investigators, Steve Neuman, a spokesman for the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, said Monday. Authorities also have increased to $15,000 a reward for information. Daniels, from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was found inside the church August 23. She died from ""multiple sharp-force injuries,"" according to a preliminary autopsy report obtained by CNN. Sharp-force injuries mean cuts or stab wounds. Diagrams in the autopsy notes show Daniels suffered injuries to the side and back of her neck, her back and her left breast. She also suffered wounds to her hands, a typical spot for defensive wounds resulting from attempts to ward off an attack. In addition, the autopsy notes say a portion of Daniels' hair appeared singed or burned. The medical examiner classified her death as a homicide. Daniels' son, Alvin Daniels, told CNN that she traveled many Sundays to Anadarko, about 50 miles southwest of her home, to the church ""in case people came to worship.""  Watch what the son has to say to Nancy Grace » . District Attorney Bret Burns has called the crime scene the worst he'd seen in 17 years as a prosecutor but gave no further explanation. Jessica Brown, a spokeswoman for Oklahoma's State Bureau of Investigation, said last week the body was ""staged"" after the killing, but declined to elaborate. Meanwhile, Neuman said, video surveillance from a convenience store near the church is being analyzed, a process that started Friday. He declined to comment on the condition of Daniels' body when found. Alvin Daniels told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" that his mother was ""always joking with us and always taking care of us, even giving her last dollar, even if she didn't have it."" He said she took precautions at the church. ""She was very cautious for the most part, and she would usually leave the door open in case people came to worship,"" he said. The death has unnerved religious leaders in Anadarko, said Ted Mercer, pastor of Grace Christian Fellowship, which is about three blocks from the church where Daniels' body was found. CNN's Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.","Pastor Carol Daniels' clothes were removed from the crime scene, source says .

"(CNN) -- Nancy Reagan, wife of the late President Ronald Reagan, is hospitalized in California after suffering a broken pelvis, according to spokeswoman Joanne Drake. Former first lady Nancy Reagan is shown at an event in the nation's capital in September. Reagan, 87, is in the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Drake said in a written statement Wednesday. The former first lady fell last week at her home, Drake said, but admitted herself to the hospital only after experiencing ""persistent pain."" Tests revealed a fractured pelvis and sacrum -- the triangular bone within the pelvis. Reagan will remain hospitalized for a few days until ""doctors are satisfied with her progress,"" Drake said. Reagan's anticipated recovery time is six to eight weeks, including physical therapy and a modified schedule. ""Mrs. Reagan is in good spirits, especially comforted to be receiving care from talented doctors in a world-class hospital named in honor of her late husband,"" the statement said. She previously was hospitalized for two days in February following a fall at her home in suburban Los Angeles. President Reagan died in June 2004 after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. Since his death, Nancy Reagan has remained involved with the national Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute in Chicago, Illinois. However, she has appeared in public only rarely in recent years.","NEW: Nancy Reagan reported ""in good spirits"" at hospital .

"(CNN) -- The battle raging over President Obama's health care plan has spread from across the aisles in Congress to across the country. A Tampa, Florida, health care reform meeting sparks noisy exchanges between attendees. Senators this week joined their colleagues from the House at town hall meetings as they spent their August recess in their home districts. But disruptive protests are turning town hall meetings into shouting matches and drowning out discussion over what is and isn't in health care plans in the House and Senate. Videos of the protests have been circulating on the Internet, showing raucous crowds heckling their congressmen, and carrying posters with devil horns drawn on lawmakers' heads, swastikas or Obama with Adolf Hitler's mustache.  Read more about the proposed plans » . Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who had a town hall meeting disrupted by angry protesters earlier this month, said he had never experienced such emotion in his 15 years of holding such forums. Democratic Rep. Brad Miller of North Carolina even had a death threat phoned into his office. A caller said that if Miller supported Obama's plan, it could cost him his life, Miller told CNN. ""Of course we want a full debate. Of course we want people who have dissenting views from the administration and Congress to have a full hearing. But that's not what this is about. That's not the intent of most of these people. It's not the way the press is covering it,"" Mark Halperin, editor-at-large and senior political analyst for TIME magazine, said on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" The protesters' gimmicks, Halperin said, are grabbing the public and media's attention, and valid arguments over the cost and content of the proposals are being put on the back burner. ""There needs to be a debate in America on whether we should have universal health care. There needs to be a debate on the president's ideas. If these protesters have ideas, great. Let's hear them. But if they're just stunts to cause a disruption that gets the media tripped in every time, again, I think it's bad for the country whether you want the president's plan or not,"" he said.  Watch what Halperin says about the town hall turmoil » . Obama's health care battle has been compared to former President Bill Clinton's failed effort more than 15 years ago, but CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said the climate toward health care reform was actually more negative back then. Clinton's plan had less public support than Obama's, and Clinton himself was less popular than Obama, Schneider said. Clinton's plan also barely got off the ground when it went to Congress, and Obama's proposals have already been through a few congressional committees. So why didn't lawmakers experience the same backlash during the Clinton years? ""Three reasons,"" Schneider said. First of all, ""the calendar."" Clinton proposed his plan in September 1993, and by the time Congress went on recess in August of the following year, the plan was dead.  Learn more about global health care systems » . Secondly, people didn't use the Internet the way they use it today, ""so you didn't have the viral communications that rally people to attend town halls."" And finally, experience. ""Conservatives are emboldened by what happened to the Clinton plan. They want to relive 1994,"" Schneider said. Democrats have accused conservative groups of manufacturing the outrage, while others say the uproar is a reflection of the opposition to Obama's plans. ""These are average Americans that are concerned about this long litany of borrowing and spending and bailouts and government takeover of one industry after another. And this government takeover of health care is just the last straw for many Americans,"" Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana, told ""Fox News"" on Monday. As the emotion has intensified, misinformation has spread about what is and isn't in current health care proposals. ""People are just getting information that's flat wrong,"" Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, told CNN on Monday as a town hall meeting she held came to an end. One of the allegations that picked up traction in recent days is that Obama's plan encourages euthanasia. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin fueled the charge on her Facebook page Friday, writing that ""the sick, the elderly, and the disabled"" would suffer as doctors have to ""ration care."" In her post, the former Republican vice presidential candidate said Obama's health care plan would create a ""death panel"" that would weigh whether her parents or son Trig were ""worthy of health care."" Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean told CNN on Sunday that Palin had deliberately fabricated the charges. ""About euthanasia, they're just totally erroneous. She just made that up,"" he said. ""Just like the 'Bridge to Nowhere' that she supposedly didn't support. ""There's nothing like euthanasia in the bill. I practiced medicine for a long time, and of course you have to have end-of-life discussions -- the patients want that. ... Euthanasia's not in this bill."" McCaskill said she hoped Monday that she was able to correct some of false information out there. ""The notion that I would ever, or that our government would ever do anything to cut short or dismiss the quality of life for our seniors is so offensive to me as an American. ... There's no rationing of health care that's being proposed for our elderly,"" she said. ""Hopefully, I was able to reassure people that -- not in America. That's not going to happen."" In his weekend radio address, Obama sought to dispel what he called ""the outlandish rumors that reform will promote euthanasia, cut Medicaid or bring about a government takeover of health care. That's simply not true."" The White House on Monday launched what it calls a Health Insurance Reform Reality Check Web site designed to combat what the administration considers misinformation about the issue. The Web page features Obama aides discussing various aspects of health care reform.","Town hall meetings across the country have turned into shouting matches .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Dolores O'Riordan is singing ""Linger"" while playing a gleaming white guitar that's almost half her size. Dolores O'Riordan says the Cranberries are planning a tour, scheduled to begin in November. As the diminutive musician hums her way through the song's familiar intro, she smiles and nods her head a little as though she's just remembered an important kiss or something sweet one of her children told her. We weren't expecting her to play ""Linger,"" arguably the Cranberries' most beautiful hit and the one that gave the Irish rock band its leg up to global stardom in the early '90s. In truth, we weren't expecting O'Riordan to perform anything at all, but when somebody shows up for an interview handling a guitar, you've got to ask for a tune. Come on! So when O'Riordan, 37, started to pluck away at that spine-tingling song that harks back to her days as the moody-cum-boisterous 'Berries lead singer -- wait, she didn't want to play something from her brand new solo album instead? -- I almost tripped over in my haste to get out of the way so our cameraman could capture the moment. O'Riordan's nostalgia, it turns out, has a purpose.  Watch O'Riordan talk about the chills she had making her album » . During our interview, which took place the same day O'Riordan's second solo disc ""The Baggage"" was released in the U.S., she officially shared the news that the Cranberries are to regroup. Technically, she says, they never split up and have merely been on hiatus since 2003. But there's no need to let that linger. Here's what you need to know, berry by berry (sorry): . The weight of ""No Baggage"" Some might argue that solo Dolores sounds no different from front woman Dolores, but being in control of all her material allows O'Riordan to get personal as she does on ""No Baggage"" (Rounder Records). The song ""Skeleton"" deals with not being able to outrun the skeletons in your closet. ""Lunatic"" addresses the hassles of fame. Give lead single ""The Journey"" a spin, and check out the music video to see some lovely scenery from the Emerald Isle. It was filmed around Dublin Bay on a chilly, windy day. When she takes off her musician hat ... O'Riordan has four kids and divides her time between her homes in Dublin, Ireland, and Ontario, Canada (check out the ""No Baggage"" album cover for a peek at the lake outside the latter residence). She's been married to her manager, Don Burton, for 15 years, and in that time has never taken off her wedding ring. Even if she wanted to she couldn't. It's stuck on her finger. She also wears ... Funky shoes. In the '90's, O'Riordan was known for her chunky Doc Marten boots, but she showed up to our interview in sequin and gem-encrusted Converse sneakers (""They're deadly, aren't they?""). She bought them on the Champs Elysees in Paris, France, which she says is one of her favorite places to shop. TV isn't normal ... She's relaxed and goofy in interviews, though she admits that live television gives her the willies. The Cranberries went on hiatus because ... Says O'Riordan: ""We all had little children. We all had personal challenges going on in our life. I wanted to know who the heck I was if I wasn't in a Cranberry."" She wants to be ""in a Cranberry"" again because ... A performance with fellow 'Berries Noel and Mike Hogan at an event in Dublin in January proved to be a bit of a wake-up call: ""It made me realize that I actually feel really comfortable with them, more so than anyone."" The Cranberries will ripen ... The Cranberries tour is slated to kick off in November in North America. But it won't be an all-out greatest hits fest. Expect O'Riordan to mix her solo work into the set list. The band plans to work on a new album together in 2010. Oh, and did you know ... ?

"Editor's note: We asked readers to weigh in on CNN.com Live producer Jarrett Bellini's vacation destination, and you chose South Africa. Check back for updates on his trip. CNN.com's Jarrett Bellini tours vineyards outside Cape Town, South Africa. CAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNN) -- I'm not a wine drinker. Before today's excursion, in fact, I could only tell you that on the face of the planet there existed three types of wine: red, white and Carlo Rossi.  The reds are good with meat.  The whites go with fish.  And, according to what I learned from my dad, Carlo Rossi goes with a glass of ice. So, exploring South Africa's wine country, just a short drive from Cape Town, seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day.  I mean, it was that or go to a museum. Our guide, Jack, was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, but without being a pretentious jerk.  Really, as far as he is concerned, the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy.  I didn't ask, but was curious if that applied to Boone's Farm? Throughout the day, we hit four wineries, tasting 23 bottles in all.  I know because I kept hash marks on my hand.  I'm pretty classy. Now, despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat, I can't say that I'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than I was this morning when I woke up.  However, I did manage to get a solid buzz.  And that should be worth something. Even without the wine, a visit to South Africa's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler's to-do list. It's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful. If you need an added incentive, there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11. I personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution. He didn't seem to care. He also didn't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese. But I thanked him anyway. What can I say? I'm not a wine drinker.","CNN.com's Jarrett Bellini is traveling in South Africa .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In 1994, universal health care was a key policy plan for then-President Bill Clinton. It eventually failed. In 1993, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary  Clinton listen to a man's story about health care problems. Now, 15 years later, another Democratic president is taking on the challenge, but facing an uphill battle from not only from Republicans, but from members of his own party. Will failing to reform health care have the same consequences for Obama's administration as it did for Clinton's? Like Obama, Clinton came into office with reforming the nation's health care system as one of his top priorities. Then-first lady Hillary Clinton, who headed the administration's task force on reforming the system, delivered a 1,000-page plan that was dubbed ""Hillary Care,"" which required Americans and permanent resident aliens to enroll in a health plan. Other provisions included Americans below a certain income level paying nothing for care. Republicans decried the plan as overcomplicated and used it to tag the administration as big government-loving, tax-and-spend liberals. The plan's failure emboldened Republicans and led to huge Democratic losses in the 1994 midterm elections, allowing the GOP to take control of Congress and stymie other Clinton initiatives. Now, 15 years later, Obama potentially faces a similar fate. Obama seeks the overhaul to ensure that health insurance is available to the 46 million Americans currently without coverage while preventing costs to both the government and individuals from continuing to climb.  Watch more on the health care debate » . The president had set a deadline for passage of a bill before the August congressional recess, but in an interview Monday with PBS's Jim Lehrer, the president said that if Congress tells him it's ""going to spill over by a few days or a week,"" that's fine. iReport.com: Weigh in on the health care debate . A senior White House official adds that while there is a ""long way to go"" in coming up with legislation, there is a true effort being made to devise a bipartisan plan.  See how the plans compare » . ""[The Senate] is working in a bipartisan way and despite all of the cacophony of attacks you've heard from some Republicans, I think you've got to give some credit to the Republicans on the finance committee who are making right now a good faith effort, despite pressure, probably from their own party, to work with Democrats to try to come up with something that people can get behind,"" said White House Communications Director Anita Dunn on Wednesday. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, says in order for health care reform to get passed, it will take a well-coordinated bipartisan effort. ""I think the president is right. He really does want a bipartisan effort. And that's what it's going to take for it to be for the American people. But the approach to it is kind of like a doctor practicing bad medicine where you fix only symptoms and don't treat the disease. ... the disease is only going to get worse."" But the battle over health care reform is weighed down by complex problems, competing interests, a $1 trillion price tag, conservative Democrats in sticker shock and Republicans sensing an opportunity to regain some of the power they lost in the 2006 congressional elections. Conservative Bill Kristol wrote in his blog that there is an opportunity to inflict political damage to the president and that opponents shouldn't compromise: . ""My advice, for what it's worth: Resist the temptation,"" Kristol wrote. ""This is no time to pull punches. Go for the kill."" The White House has so far resisted another idea for raising revenue -- creating a tax on the medical benefits provided by employers. Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said he likes the idea, but Obama said it could be too disruptive to a system in which 180 million Americans have health coverage provided by their employers. But while Obama has remained mostly popular in national polls so far, support for his health care plan has begun to wane. A CNN Poll of Polls released Wednesday indicates that less than half the country approves of how he's handling the issue. Forty-seven percent in the poll approve of how the president is dealing with health care reform, with 44 percent disapproving. The poll averaged the three most recent national surveys that asked about Obama's performance on health care: USA Today/Gallup (July 17-19); ABC/Washington Post (July 15-18) and CBS News (July 9-12). Meanwhile, Coburn -- a fierce opponent of the current plans being worked up in Congress -- says that Congress needs to slow down. ""Getting this right is better than meeting a political deadline ... I want him to back off the timeline,"" he said. ""Let's start over ... let's fix it all and do it in a way that the American people won't charge it to their grandkids."" CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who has worked under several administrations, including Clinton's, says there's is concern that Obama may be trying to ram health care legislation through Congress as he did with the economic stimulus plan. ""And they [Americans] don't have a lot of confidence in the past effort in the stimulus plan to put together something comprehensive and -- 'here we go again' ... something that looks like it's being thrown together to many people in the public. So they're not confident that they want it. And Coburn's argument -- along with nearly all congressional Republicans' -- could pose a risk to Obama's political capital with Americans. Gergen agrees. ""I think he's got two other problems: One is that he doesn't have a firm plan to sell. ... Second thing is, from his point of view, there are many in the public that'd like to hear from him and also like to see just how he's negotiating the plan,"" he said. ""What they look for is a leadership that says, 'Here's where we're going to go,' not a leadership that says, 'I'm urging Congress to make more progress' "" Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who Obama had tapped to be Health and Human Services director and the point person on health care reform before tax problems derailed his nomination, said getting health care reform passed now will be a major factor in defining Obama's presidency. ""Because he's made it such an issue, and because he has invested so much personal time and effort, this will, more than stimulus and more than anything he has done so far, be a measure of his clout and of his success early on,"" Daschle was quoted in the New York Times. ""And because it is early on, it will define his subsequent years.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- She stood by her husband throughout the contentious 2008 presidential campaign and during heated health care reform debates during his presidency. First lady Michelle Obama listens to remarks during a health care forum at the White House on Friday. Now, as the debate is reaching a fever pitch, first lady Michelle Obama is weighing in on the issue by focusing on how health care can affect families. ""What she's doing is putting a personal and human face on the issue ... there's nothing more crucial,"" said Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn. ""Everybody gets sick, and everybody has someone in the family that gets sick."" ""I think if you can humanize it and personalize it, it suddenly brings it home to people -- especially those who are screaming and yelling about the government taking over,"" Quinn said. On Friday, the first lady, a former hospital administrator, spoke about the issue to a crowd at the White House, highlighting her own family's experience with health care. In one touching moment, Obama recalled when daughter Sasha exhibited signs of potentially deadly meningitis when she was 4 months old. ""We didn't know what, but he [the doctor] told us she could have meningitis, so we were terrified. He said get to the emergency room right away,"" she said. ""Fortunately, things worked out."" ""But it is that moment in our lives that flashes through my head every time we engage in this health insurance conversation. It's that moment in my life, because I think about what on earth would we have done if we had not had insurance."" Mrs. Obama not only faced the issue as a mother, but also as a daughter. ""My father has multiple sclerosis. He contracted it in his 20s. ... He was able to get up and go to work every day, even though it got harder for him as he got sicker and more debilitated. And I find myself thinking what would we had done as a family on the south side of Chicago if my father hadn't had insurance.""  Watch more of Michelle Obama's message » . Quinn says that personal story is critical in the health care debate -- something that has been lacking in the president's message so far, which has often been deemed by pundits as too policy-oriented and too surgical in nature. ""What she's doing is she's humanizing the issue. And I think that has been missing in their [White House] campaign,"" she says. ""He's been so focused on the details and the strategy and the money that the individual problems and issues have seemed to have gotten lost in the fray."" Gloria Borger, a CNN senior political analyst, agreed. ""I think she's always been a great asset to him,"" she said. ""She can help in this health care debate by not getting involved in the minutiae of the bills, but essentially emphasizing the reason we need health care reform. And that's what she will stick to."" Michelle Obama was a lightning rod -- both good and bad -- throughout her husband's presidential campaign. Now, in her role as first lady, she has garnered greater support among American voters from both parties. A national survey by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press in April found that the first lady's positive ratings have increased since her husband took office. The poll found that 76 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her, which is up from 68 percent in January. ""Much of the change has come among Republicans, especially Republican women,"" the organization noted. ""About two-thirds of Republican women [67 percent] have a favorable impression of Michelle Obama, a gain of 21 points since January."" But a first lady's involvement in health care reform is nothing new. In the early '90s, first lady Hillary Clinton spearheaded the Clinton administration's push for reform, holding meetings, testifying before congressional committees and, in general, taking charge of the issue. ""Hillary Clinton was the architect of health care reform,"" Borger said. As for whether Michelle Obama is mirroring Clinton's role, the answer from both Borger and Quinn is absolutely not. ""I don't see any parallels at all. ... The Clintons came in, and they had run on the platform of buy one, get one free, a co-presidency and all of that. And she took over this huge thing herself. Bill wasn't doing it,"" Quinn said. She said the president, not Michelle Obama, was the was the one who pushed health care reform in his early domestic agenda. ""He promised in his campaign, and then he's the one that did it. This is not Michelle's plan. She hasn't been doing the town meetings and the national press conferences,"" she added. Borger said that the first lady is playing a completely different role. ""It's a much more supportive role, and it's a role out of the policy arena, but more in the arena of just why we ought to think we need reform.""","First lady Michelle Obama delivers remarks on health care reform Friday .

"HOHENWALD, Tennessee (CNN) -- A pair of African elephants tramps through lush vegetation, stopping to scoop dust with their trunks and toss it onto their backs for protection from the summer sun. Tarra, who was a year old when Buckley met her, was the inspiration for The Elephant Sanctuary. Meanwhile, two others submerge their massive forms to splash and dip in the waters of a muddy pond. It's a scene that could have been pulled from a nature documentary. But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee. It's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia. But for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived. Tarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store. Shirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show. And Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles. ""We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,"" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary. Founded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants. It's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity. But Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo. Visitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible. ""In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,"" Buckley said. ""People have their own emotions, that energy,"" Buckley said. ""If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy. For Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra. Studying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. ""I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,"" she said. ""When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them. ""And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants."" From years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born. ""We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,"" Blais said. At the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff. They share space with deer, wild turkey, raccoons, skunks and other native Tennessee animals. Life in a circus, and in most zoos, is abusive to elephants, highly intelligent and social animals who, in the wild, may roam dozens of miles in a single day, the pair said. Research has shown that elephants, like humans, can suffer post-traumatic stress disorder after living in harsh or abusive conditions.  Watch more on life at the Elephant Sanctuary. » . ""Typically, when elephants are in captivity, they're under a lot of stress,"" Blais said. ""Their entire life is abnormal; it's unnatural, and that can often lead to aggression. ""Some will resign themselves and just kind of end up in this blank space, and others will act out, just venting their frustrations, but it's because of what captivity offers or what captivity doesn't offer them."" The elephants generally arrive at the sanctuary in one of two ways: Either the government finds that an owner is abusing the animals and seizes them, or the owners approach the sanctuary on their own, wanting a better life for the animals. In their 14-year history, Blais and Buckley say, they've been able to raise enough funds to keep expanding the sanctuary and its facilities. But tough economic times are taking a toll this year, and for the first time, they are nervous they'll bring in less money than they spend. But the mission of providing a home for the elephants they love will continue, they say. ""We feel incredibly fortunate to be doing what we do,"" Buckley said. ""It's hard work, it's long days, it's long weeks, but you're not going to hear us complain about it, because we're fortunate, and we know that.

"(CNN) -- Television pioneer and longtime CBS executive Don Hewitt, the creator of ""60 Minutes,"" has died, the network said Wednesday. He was 86. Don Hewitt joined CBS News in 1948. Hewitt, who had been battling pancreatic cancer, died at his home in Bridgehampton, New York, surrounded by his family, CBS said. The winner of eight Emmy and two Peabody awards, Hewitt began working for CBS News as an associate director in 1948. He was executive producer of ""60 Minutes"" when it premiered on CBS on September 24, 1968. Hewitt stepped down in June 2004, but the program remains on the air and is the number-one news program, according to CBS News' Web site. ""In the history of journalism, there have been few who were as creative, dynamic and versatile as Don Hewitt,"" said CBS Corp. President Leslie Moonves. ""The depth and breadth of his accomplishments are impossible to measure, because since the very beginnings of our business, he quite literally invented so many of the vehicles by which we now communicate the news.""  Watch how Hewitt innovated television news » . ""He was bursting with passion for what we do: telling stories,"" said Jon Klein, president of CNN, who previously worked at CBS and oversaw ""60 Minutes."" Klein recalled his first day on the job as a 37-year-old, when Hewitt took him to lunch and told him, ""Listen, kid. It's very simple. I have 10 ideas a day. Nine of them are terrible. Your job is to tell me which one is great."" ""Don Hewitt didn't need a boss,"" Klein said. ""What he needed was somebody to bounce ideas off of."" ""It is a sad and difficult time for all of us who work at '60 Minutes,' "" Jeff Fager, the program's current executive producer, said in a CBS statement. ""Don was a giant figure in our lives and will always have an impact on this broadcast -- there's a part of him in every one of us, and it affects every decision we make. He will be remembered as a brilliant editor and storyteller, an irrepressible force who changed journalism forever."" Born in 1922 in New York, Hewitt started his career in newspapers. ""His picture experience prompted a friend in 1948 to tell him about television, where CBS News had a job opening,"" according to a CBS statement. He told reporters years later his response was: ""Whatavision?"" He directed the first television network newscast on May 3, 1948, featuring Douglas Edwards, the network said. In 1960, he was named executive producer of ""The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite,"" a position he held for five years. In 1963, the Cronkite broadcast became the first to go to a half-hour format. Hewitt's innovations included the use of cue cards for news readers -- an early version of the electronic teleprompter that is used today, CBS said. In addition, he was the first to use ""supers"" -- captions and other written information superimposed on the lower third of the television screen, Klein said. And he was the first to use the film ""double"" -- cutting back and forth between projectors, CBS said. Hewitt also produced and directed coverage for the three main television networks for the first-ever televised presidential debate in 1960 between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. ""Critics have long maintained that Kennedy won the debate because he looked better,"" CBS said. Hewitt recalled that he offered makeup to Kennedy first, but he refused, and Nixon followed suit. ""But the suntanned Kennedy was a vigorous contrast to Nixon, whose pasty complexion put his five o'clock shadow in high relief,"" CBS said. In hindsight, Hewitt recalled the incident as ""the first step in the dangerous dance between politicians and the special interests that provide the big money to buy the now-crucial political television advertising,"" CBS said. Hewitt was removed from his post at ""The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite"" after what CBS refers to as ""the NBC playbook incident,"" according to CBS. Hewitt found a lost copy of NBC's coverage playbook at the 1964 Republican Convention and pocketed it, intending to use it to scoop his competitors. He gave it back ""after an NBC producer, it is said, threatened to throw him out a hotel window,"" CBS said. Following his removal from the news program, Hewitt ""knew he was off the frontlines,"" according to CBS News. ""Exiled with time on his hands, Hewitt then slowly emerged with the idea for what would become the most successful television program in history."" Hewitt has publicly said that the lowest point for ""60 Minutes"" was the Jeffrey Wigand story -- an interview with the highest-ranking tobacco executive to become a whistleblower. The interview was held back by CBS management out of fear of a $10 billion lawsuit that could bankrupt the company, according to the network statement. ""The initial spiking of the interview, in which Wigand revealed tobacco executives knew and covered up the fact that tobacco caused disease, led to an unusual '60 Minutes' segment,"" CBS' statement said. ""A portion of it, with Wigand disguised, was broadcast, followed by an unprecedented rebuke of management read on the air by Mike Wallace."" The interview was aired in its entirety a few months later, in February 1997. A movie about the incident, ""The Insider"" was made the following year. Hewitt said he felt he had no choice but to comply with management, opting to ""fight another day"" instead of quit, CBS said. But he later acknowledged in a documentary he was not proud of his actions at the time. He often told reporters inquiring about the secret of ""60 Minutes"" that it was four words every child knows: ""Tell me a story."" Hewitt authored two books -- ""Tell Me a Story: Fifty Years,"" and ""Minute by Minute."" Hewitt won every major award in television journalism and was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1990. After leaving ""60 Minutes"" in 2004, Hewitt was named executive producer of CBS News, where his duties included brainstorming ideas for television news and working on specials, the network said. As recently as 2007, Hewitt was executive producer of the first-ever network television special coverage of the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Show on NBC. Hewitt is survived by his wife of 30 years, Marilyn Berger, along with his children and grandchildren, CBS said. His funeral will be private.","Television news pioneer, 86, was battling pancreatic cancer .

"SANTIAGO, Chile (CNN) -- Arrest warrants for more than 120 former soldiers and agents of Chile's National Intelligence Directorate were issued Tuesday for alleged human rights violations during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, CNN Chile reported. Nearly 2,300 people disappeared during the rule of Augusto Pinochet, 1973-1990, say government reports. The scale of the order by Judge Victor Montiglio makes this the largest human rights prosecution case in Chile's history. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled from 1973-1990, after which Chile returned to civilian rule under a democratically elected government. Government investigations conducted after Pinochet left power say nearly 2,300 people disappeared during the dictatorship and another 30,000 were tortured. At least 51 of the warrants were in connection with a disinformation campaign in the 1970s known as Operation Colombo that historians say was aimed at hiding human rights abuses. Other warrants were linked to Operation Condor, which involved a network of secret police agencies in the region that targeted political opponents in the mid- and late-1970s, and a plot against communist leaders known as the Calle Conferencia case. About half of those named in the warrants were facing charges related to the Pinochet regime for the first time. The warrants included former military and police officers who were members of Pinochet's feared intelligence service, known as DINA.","Arrest warrants for more than 120 former soldiers and agents issued Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The suspect in the killing of Yale pharmacology graduate student Annie Le appeared in court in New Haven, Connecticut, Tuesday, but did not enter a plea, his attorney told CNN. Raymond J. Clark III appears in court Tuesday in New Haven, Connecticut, where he is charged with murder. Raymond Clark III, 24, a lab technician at Yale, is charged with murder in Le's death. Tuesday's scheduled hearing was continued until October 20. It is standard procedure for defendants in murder cases not to enter a plea until a later stage in the case, public defender Beth Merkin told CNN. Clark eventually will plead not guilty, she said. Clark, of Branford, Connecticut, is being held in lieu of $3 million bail. The body of Le, 24, was found inside a wall of a Yale lab building on September 12 -- the day she was to be married. She had been strangled, the Connecticut medical examiner's office determined. Clark is not a Yale student, but has worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004. He lived with his girlfriend, who also is a Yale lab technician, according to New Haven police.  Follow a timeline of the case » . A Yale faculty member described Clark's job as maintaining colonies for animals used in research. The lab is in the basement of the building where Le's body was found. A motive in Le's killing was unclear, but police said they were treating the case as workplace violence. Yale has announced a memorial service for Le on October 12. The university is also establishing a scholarship in her memory. Le was buried in California on September 26.

"(CNN) -- You can't get through a conversation with Jesse Dayton without hearing a reference to Texas at least once. Musician Jesse Dayton has branched out to a new fanbase by collaborating with Rob Zombie. He wears the name Beaumont, his birthplace, like a badge of honor and he rolls through a set list of stories about his musical collaborations in the Lone Star state with humble pride. Dayton has earned a hard core following in Texas. But his recent collaborations with rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie have earned him an unexpected fan base -- among horror movie fans. Most recently, Dayton joined Zombie to record a soundtrack for the movie ""Halloween II"" as Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures -- a gig that also earned him some time on screen.  Watch Dayton discuss his new project » . Dayton spoke to CNN recently about his career and newfound fan base. The following is a portion of that interview: . CNN: You have a lot of appreciation for Waylon Jennings. Dayton: I was actually on a talk show in Nashville [Tennessee] and Waylon was cooking with his wife, Jessi Colter. They were watching the show I was on because Kris Kristofferson was on. They saw me and called me the next morning and said, ""Waylon cut his finger. He wants you to come down here."" So it was a total fluke. Waylon was like my Elvis, especially growing up. My earliest memories were my mom's 8-track in the parlor listening to Willie [Nelson] and Waylon. CNN: You are not really part of the Nashville music scene. Why? Dayton: I'm not intentionally staying away from what's going on in Nashville. I'm just being myself. Texas is like a whole other planet. Bob Wills got kicked off the Grand Ole Opry. Willie Nelson didn't get on the radio until he left Nashville. There's a long history of that. I don't put down Nashville. They're just doing what they're supposed to do, which is sell as many records as they can. But we've just learned that there's a whole crowd of people out there that love Johnny Cash but aren't into what they're playing on country radio. That's been the crowd we're attracting. The cool thing we love about having a cult following is that radio and record companies can never take that away from us. It's something we went out and earned one fan at a time. I love looking out in the crowd and seeing one guy with a cowboy hat on, one guy with long hair from the Rob Zombie camp and maybe some rockabilly kids. CNN: What is the story behind your collaboration with Rob Zombie in 2005? Dayton: He said, ""Hey man, we're making the ultimate white trash horror movie called 'The Devil's Rejects.' We think your music would be perfect for it"" which is kind of a left-handed compliment, I guess. CNN: Now you're appearing in ""Halloween II"" and recorded a soundtrack for the movie? Dayton: It's really fun for me. We're taking on this whole identity of this band. The record's going to be called ""Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures."" [Zombie] would call me and say, ""Hey, I got this idea for this song called 'Doctor Demon and the Robot Girl' "" or [he would ask me to write] a sort of '60s country thing-meets Tom Jones. CNN: Are you a good actor? Dayton: Elvis said, ""The only thing worse than seeing a bad movie is being in one."" I think the only thing worse than watching a bad actor is being one. I don't take it seriously at all. I'm just a musician who's there for color. If I can show up and be myself and not have to act? Perfect.","Country musician Jesse Dayton has gained fans among lovers of horror films .

"(CNN) -- It may have a fairy tale ending -- a story of perseverance and second chances that's playing out live on the public stage of online networking. Brianna Karp's trailer now sits outside a friend's home near Los Angeles . But 24-year-old Brianna Karp's story started as a nightmare. In a rocky economy, Karp was laid off from her Irvine, California, job as an executive assistant in July 2008. She got by for a while on temp jobs and unemployment benefits. But when her savings dried up, she was no longer able to afford her rent. The only answer she saw then was a trailer she'd inherited from her father -- a man she barely knew who had recently committed suicide. ""I was left with a truck and this camper, which I was going to sell but coincidentally this happened to me,"" she said. ""I thought, 'Well, I have this.' "" Karp, who writes that she is also estranged from her mother, ended up camped in a Los Angeles-area Walmart parking lot. ""The first night, I think, in the Walmart parking lot was the scariest,"" she told CNN. ""I was panicking, and I was just afraid."" For comfort, she had her mastiff named Fezzik. And she had her laptop computer. As she spent five months looking for jobs and blasting out resumes, often spending hour after hour at a coffee shop to take advantage of its free Wi-Fi connection, she also started blogging. The result, the Girl's Guide to Homelessness, chronicled the ups and downs of her new life. She reminisced about adopting her dog, named for a character from the movie ""The Princess Bride,"" and mulled the pros and cons of having a pet while homeless. She recounted details from failed job interviews and offered tips for other homeless women. ""I was trying to stay positive and cheerful,"" Karp said. ""I started writing the blog in a tongue-in-cheek way to kind of laugh about my circumstances, keep them chronicled. I didn't think anyone would actually read it.""  Watch CNN's Ted Rowland's report on Brianna. » . But people did, including Matt Barnes, formerly homeless himself and running a Web site about his own homelessness issues in Scotland. He asked her to write for his site and would eventually become Brianna's boyfriend. Another big break came through a shot at the weird world of reality television. Karp applied for a show that would offer contestants the chance at a job with Elle magazine advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. She was granted an audition for the show and, by her own account, totally botched it. ""I went back and blogged about bombing the interview and made fun of myself,"" she said. On a lark, she then wrote to Carroll via her column. ""Dear E. Jean: I'm currently homeless and living in a Wal-Mart parking lot,"" her e-mail began. ""I'm educated, I have never done drugs and I'm not mentally ill. I have a strong employment history and am a career executive assistant. The instability sucks, but I'm rocking it as best as I can."" She told Carroll about her poor interview for the show and finished the note with the question, ""How does one get another shot when one screws up a job interview? -- Homeless, but Not Hopeless."" Carroll said she was floored by the note. ""[The phrase] 'I'm living in a Walmart parking lot' hooked me,"" she said. ""I thought, she's so ready to work, obviously she can write, she's got some skills."" Her response appeared in the August issue of Elle -- she offered Karp an internship and a chance to write a fashion blog for the magazine. ""I think she's a new voice,"" Carroll said. ""She's a voice we haven't heard, and I'm excited for her future."" Not that all of her troubles were instantly over. Last month, she wrote, Walmart finally had her trailer towed, and she has now parked her mobile home at a friend's house outside Los Angeles. She's also still seeking that elusive full-time job, while hoping her newfound high profile will help spread the word about homelessness, and how it can happen to the most unlikely people. ""If you saw me walking down the street, you wouldn't assume I live in a parking lot,"" she writes on the blog. ""In short, I am just like you, except without the convenience of a permanent address."" CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","24-year-old went from being executive assistant to homelessness after layoff .

"(CNN) -- California corrections officials released a startling new prison mug shot of Grammy-winning music legend Phil Spector, convicted last month of second-degree murder and serving 19 years to life in prison. Phil Spector's prison mug shot, taken June 5, shows him without a hairpiece. Spector, 69, is being held at North Kern State Prison, where he is being evaluated before receiving a permanent prison assignment, corrections spokesman Gordon Hinkle said. The process could take up to 70 days. The mug shot, which shows a bald-pated Spector, was taken on June 5 as part of the routine intake process. California prison inmates are not permitted to wear wigs under Title 15, Article 5, Section 3062 of the state's prison regulations, which addresses inmate hygiene. Corrections officials also are concerned that wigs can be used to hide contraband. A judge in Los Angeles sentenced Spector last month to the maximum sentence for second-degree murder in the February 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson. Spector, 69, won't be eligible for parole until he is 88 years old. Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth.  View a timeline of the case » . Spector's retrial began in October and ended in April. It took jurors 30 hours to convict him. His first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial when the jury deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of conviction after 15 days of deliberations. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie ""Barbarian Queen"" and appeared in many other films, including ""Deathstalker,"" ""Blind Date,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and the spoof ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. At both trials, Spector's attorneys argued Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and her flagging Hollywood career. They said she grabbed a .38-caliber pistol and killed herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and testified he threatened them with firearms. His driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw Spector leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, ""I think I killed somebody."" Spector's professional trademark was the ""Wall of Sound,"" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label, named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill, in the early 1960s.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A proposed health-care compromise by the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee lacks a government-run insurance option favored by Democrats and would tax the most expensive health insurance plans, a source close to the discussions told CNN Monday. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, is the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As expected, the proposal from Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, excludes the public insurance option to compete with private insurers. However, it would allow for the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives -- an idea that some moderate Democrats and Republicans have expressed possible interest in supporting. The potential compromise proposal was sent to key Finance Committee negotiators Saturday night. It is considered a last-ditch effort to secure Republican votes for a health-care bill as President Obama pushes the issue with a planned speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night. So far, none of the three Republican senators involved in talks with Baucus on the compromise have indicated whether they support the version he is proposing. Congressional liberals are pushing strongly for inclusion of a public option; conservatives are sharply opposed. Obama has said he supports a public option but has not clearly indicated he will veto a bill that fails to include it. On Monday, Obama reiterated his support for a public option in a Labor Day speech to a union gathering in Cincinnati. He outlined Democratic health-care proposals that include a public option as part of a menu of insurance choices, including private health-care plans, that the legislation would create. ""I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs,"" Obama said to loud cheers. The president also indicated he would push hard for the House and Senate to move forward on passing health-care legislation in his upcoming address to Congress. ""The Congress and the country have been engaged in a vigorous debate for many months,"" Obama said. ""And the debate has been good, and that's important because we have to get this right. ""But every debate at some point comes to an end,"" he continued, to growing applause. ""At some point, it's time to decide. At some point, it's time to act. And Ohio, it's time to act to get this done."" Baucus' bill would cost less than $900 billion over 10 years, according to the source who spoke to CNN. The price tag is at least $100 billion less than any other health-care reform bill under consideration by Congress, the source said. As with other reform proposals, the bill would bar insurance companies from dropping a policyholder in the event of illness as long as that person has paid his or her premium in full. It adds new protections for people with pre-existing conditions and establishes tax credits to help low and middle-income families purchase insurance coverage, the source noted. It creates health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to buy insurance. The bill would be paid for, in part, by a new tax on health insurance companies that provide high-end ""Cadillac"" insurance plans, the source added. Supporters of such a tax -- initially proposed by Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and other Democrats several weeks ago -- say will it help curb the cost of health care by discouraging employers from offering such plans. They also argue that consumers, in turn, will be discouraged from overusing the health care system.  Watch senators discuss health care talks » . Critics claim the new tax will cause insurance companies to raise rates on all of their customers, even those without more expensive plans. The so-called ""Gang of Six"" Senate negotiators -- a group of three Democrats and three Republicans on the Finance Committee -- is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the proposal. The source, while stressing that the proposed bill is not a final product, said it closely reflects the group's work and areas of agreement. Obama's planned speech to Congress reflects how overhauling the nation's ailing health-care system has become his top domestic priority. He laced his speech Monday with references to health care costs rising at three times the rate of wages, and insurance industry practices that deny coverage for pre-existing conditions or prevent people from obtaining coverage if they lose their jobs. Multiple sources told CNN Friday that the administration is preparing for the possibility of delivering its own legislation to Capitol Hill sometime after the president's address. One source called the possibility of new legislation a ""contingency"" approach if efforts by Baucus to craft a deal fall through. A big open question is whether two Republican members of the Gang of Six -- Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming -- will support the bipartisan proposal. White House and Democratic leadership sources have said for some time they do not think Grassley and Enzi will sign on. A source close to the White House said Friday that the administration is leaning toward dropping the public option, and continues to zero in on trying to convince moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, another of the Senate Finance Committee negotiators, to come on board. Snowe and the White House have been discussing a trigger provision that would mandate creation of a public health insurance option if specific thresholds for expanded coverage and other changes are not met. Support by Snowe would improve the chances of the Senate's Democratic majority to compile the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster against a health care bill. The Senate Finance Committee is the last of five congressional committees needed to approve health-care legislation before it can be taken up by the full Senate and House of Representatives. Different forms of the legislation proposed by Democrats have already cleared three House committees, as well as the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. CNN's Ted Barrett and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Compromise lacks a government-run insurance option favored by some Democrats .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Claudette is expected to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle by early Monday, and the storm's outer bands already were pounding the area with heavy rain Sunday evening. Tropical Storm Claudette is seen off the coast of Destin, Florida, on Sunday afternoon. Claudette appeared on track to hit somewhere between Destin, Florida, and Panama City Beach, Florida, late Sunday or early Monday before moving through the panhandle and into southern Alabama, CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said. Heavy rain from Claudette was hitting some of the Florida Panhandle counties Sunday, and some coastal areas there had the potential for localized flooding, said John Cherry, spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management. ""What we're just mainly asking is residents to stay off the roads tonight, and if you do approach a flooded area on a roadway, turn around,"" Cherry said. Shortly before 11 p.m. ET, the center of Claudette, with maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, was in the Gulf of Mexico about 25 miles west of Panama City, Florida, and about 70 miles east-southeast of Pensacola, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving northwest at about 12 mph. A tropical storm warning was in effect from the Alabama-Florida border east to the Aucilla River. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the next 24 hours. The storm could bring 3 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 10 inches, across portions of the Florida Panhandle, central and southern Alabama and extreme southwestern Georgia. Storm surges and isolated tornadoes also were possible across portions of North Florida.  Authorities urged voluntary evacuations in the low-lying Alligator Point area of Florida's Franklin County because of concerns about possible flooding, said Mike Stone, spokesman for the Florida Emergency Operations Center. He said he knew of no other evacuations in the state. Mariners in the Panhandle and Big Bend areas of Florida should stay at harbor, the Florida Division of Emergency Management said in a statement. Meanwhile, two other severe storms were in the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday. Tropical Depression Ana, which was downgraded from a tropical storm Sunday afternoon, was moving across the Leeward Islands late Sunday, while Tropical Storm Bill was gaining strength as it followed behind Ana.  iReport.com: Are you in Claudette's path? Ana was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Guadeloupe shortly before 11 p.m. ET Sunday. It was expected to enter the northeastern Caribbean Sea and weaken as it approaches the Dominican Republic on Monday, the center said. It was moving east near 26 mph, and its maximum sustained winds were close to 35 mph, the center said. Tropical storm watches were in effect for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, St. Barthelemey, and part of the Dominican Republic. Ana was expected to drop 2 to 4 inches of rain over the Leeward Islands, with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches possible over mountainous terrain, the hurricane center said. Tropical Storm Bill -- which is forecast to become a hurricane on Monday -- was in the Atlantic heading west-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph. The storm's center was about 1,320 miles (2,120 kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles shortly before 11 p.m. ET Sunday.","Tropical Storm Claudette expected to hit land by Monday morning .

Gwendolyn Beauregard said Fiore was a close friend of her two sons, and she met the future model when Fiore was just 11. Despite the close ties -- ""she called me mommy and she was my daughter"" -- Beauregard was in the dark about Fiore's marriage to Ryan Jenkins. The marriage reportedly was annulled a few weeks after their Las Vegas, Nevada, wedding. An arrest warrant for murder has been issued for Jenkins, a reality TV contestant. Authorities believe he's fled to Canada. Fiore's body was found Saturday, stuffed into a suitcase and left in a Dumpster in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim in Orange County, California. Interviewed from San Francisco, California, Beauregard told King all she knew about Jenkins was his initial meeting with Fiore. ""She didn't tell me that she married him. She told me [about] the day that they met, which was St. Patrick's Day,"" Beauregard said. ""She called me the day after and she said: 'Mommy, I met the most perfect guy in the world and -- and his name is Ryan.' And she just went on and on and on about Ryan and how perfect he was. And that was all I knew."" Beauregard told King she's never met Ryan Jenkins. Mike Fleeman, the West Coast editor of People.com, described more details of Fiore's whirlwind courtship with Jenkins to King. ""They met in Las Vegas. Two days later [in March], they got married at the Little White Wedding Chapel. That's, of course, where Britney Spears got married,"" Fleeman told King. ""It was a quickie wedding. We today talked to somebody who was at the wedding. One of the witnesses was an employee of the chapel. A lot of people were shocked that both of them were married. They kept it under wraps. And the marriage had a lot of problems almost from the very beginning,"" Fleeman said. Fleeman told King that Jenkins was arrested and charged with domestic assault against Fiore in Nevada in June and that Jenkins was supposed to go to trial in December. Beauregard told King that Fiore, who was 28 when she died, started modeling in her early 20s. Despite their deep bond, Beauregard said Fiore had ties with her biological mother, Lisa Lepore. ""She was close to her mother, as well, but it was a different type of closeness."" Adding to the horror of the slaying was that Fiore's teeth had been extracted and her fingers removed. Criminal profiler Pat Brown told Larry King that act provided key crucial evidence early in the investigation. ""It was very clear from the very beginning, when they found her body in a piece of luggage, that we weren't dealing with a serial killer. I knew it was somebody who knew her and [that her killer] wanted to make sure that she was not identified,"" Brown said. ""This is why he [the suspect[ ended up cutting off her fingers ... taking out her teeth. He even got smart. He watched too many crime shows and thought he would get rid of all ID, took away her clothes, put her in the luggage, probably because it's one way to get her of an apartment. And throw it a Dumpster and hope that time will take care of it, she'll decompose, they'll never be able to identify her,"" Brown said. Jenkins has appeared on VH1 shows ""Megan Wants a Millionaire"" and ""I Love Money 3."" ""This is a very arrogant man,"" Brown said. ""Megan said it right on the show. She said he's a manipulator. He is. He has evidence of psychopathy there."" The brutality of the crime has hit Fiore's circle of friends hard. ""Ryan Jenkins is an animal,"" said Robert Hasman, a family friend who said Fiore had been his girlfriend for 2 1/2 years.  Watch Hasman speak out » . ""What he has done to Jasmine is unspeakable. It's just not right."" He described her as ""a beautiful person who was a very caring individual."" Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said on ""Larry King Live"" that Jenkins is the only suspect. ""There is no indication that anybody else might be involved,"" he said. ""We believe he's armed because there's a handgun missing from his apartment, which is the last place he was before ... he fled. So it appears that he's armed. And he's certainly dangerous because he's desperate,"" Rackauckas said.","Gwendolyn Beauregard says she had mother-daughter relationship with slain model .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people attending Comic-Con in San Diego, California, will transform into zombies on Thursday. A ""zombie walk"" at Comic-Con will promote the upcoming ""Zombieland"" movie. They'll converge in a ""zombie walk"" through the San Diego Convention Center to promote Woody Harrelson's upcoming post-apocalyptic comedy, ""Zombieland."" Comic-Con is an annual gathering of 125,000 people whose interests include comic book and science fiction film and TV, anime, toys and video games. Major movie studios and TV networks use the convention to launch their latest productions. Zombie movies have been on the rise in recent years, and the type of zombies on the big screen has been evolving with the times. George Romero's 1968 film ""Night of the Living Dead"" -- followed by ""Dawn of the Dead"" -- popularized zombies ""based on the original Haitian voodoo kind of zombie, the supernatural being, the walking dead or the undead,"" said ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer. Zombie films made ""a seismic shift in zombies with Danny Boyle's film '28 Days Later,' where it became a more viral-based thing, a diseased population, as opposed to from the grave,"" Fleischer said. In ""Zombieland,"" living people are infected by a fast-spreading virus that turns them into ""this other being"" that is fast, ferocious and flesh-eating, he said. ""These modern zombies are reflective of some of the perils of what can happen with overpopulation and disease control and how quickly things can spread and become a problem."" iReport.com: Going to Comic-Con? Fleischer, along with screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, consulted a disease expert ""to get to the bottom of what the modern pandemic would be,"" he said. ""When swine flu happened, it was after we finished shooting, but it just really reminded me of how these things can spread so quickly and a whole population can be devastated,"" he said. While about 500 extras were hired to be zombies in Fleischer's movie, even more Comic-Con participants could take part in Thursday's zombie walk. Sony has hired professional makeup artists to get them ready. Fleischer said those portraying a modern zombie should think like ""a rabid dog."" Don't lumber along like Frankenstein's monster, but move with ""a real furious anger and intensity"" and ""a lot of grunting and snarling and growling,"" he said. ""Zombies don't talk."" Hunger is a modern zombie's chief motivation, he said: ""I think that they're definitely cannibalistic. They want to eat people."" What does a modern zombie wear? Fleischer's zombies come as they are, whether in a work uniform or dressed for the mall. ""It's as if you were at the mall and some zombies attacked and everyone there got turned into a zombie,"" he said. ""They'd be wearing the same clothes that they had before. They'd be dressed in the same way."" Fleischer developed a list of 150 types of zombies for his film, including construction workers, moms, a punk rocker and preppie zombies. ""They're just people who got infected, like a modern pandemic,"" he said. ""Zombieland"" -- which hits theaters October 9 -- brings out the humor in killing zombies, which is Harrelson's specialty. ""They're not easy to kill, so sometimes you've got to get them more than once,"" Fleischer said. ""You've got to make sure you get them because they'll keep coming if you don't."" Harrelson blamed post-traumatic stress from filming for his scuffle with a TMZ photographer at an airport the day after shooting wrapped in Georgia in April. ""With my daughter at the airport I was startled by a paparazzo who I quite understandably mistook for a zombie,"" Harrelson said. While Harrelson will be at Comic-Con to promote the movie, it was not known if he would be kept away from Thursday's zombie walk.","Some Comic-Con attendees will become zombies to celebrate new film .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A European Union delegation met Saturday with Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who said the parties had established a ""good rapport."" President Mugabe and his wife, Grace, arrive for a ZANU PF party youth conference on Friday. ""There was no animosity, it was quite friendly,"" Mugabe said. Gunilla Carlsson, the Swedish minister for International Development Cooperation, said the parties ""definitely made some progress."" ""Of course we didn't agree with everything Mr. Mugabe said, but it was a correct meeting and we exchanged views,"" Carlsson, who is heading the mission, told CNN's Rosemary Church. The delegation met with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai later on Saturday. Carlsson spokesman Peter Larsson had said earlier that ""there was no sense of any hostility from Mugabe."" Larsson was referring to remarks the Zimbabwean president made Friday, when he condemned ""bloody whites"" for meddling in his country's affairs. Carlsson is heading the mission to Zimbabwe. ""Sanctions or no sanctions, Zimbabwe remains ours,"" .Mugabe told his ZANU-PF party's youth conference in Harare on Friday. ""Who said the British and the Americans should rule over others? That's why we say, down with you. We have not invited these bloody whites. They want to poke their nose into our own affairs. Refuse that,"" he said. The European Union imposed travel bans on Mugabe and his representatives in 2002. The bans were imposed after accusations of human rights violations and election fraud. In addition to travel restrictions, the European Union has frozen the assets of more than 200 Zimbabweans for allegedly violating human rights, according to Sweden, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU this year. On Saturday, Mugabe again addressed ""sanctions,"" saying he was dismayed that they were not lifted after meeting with the EU delegation. ""I have always been disappointed with sanctions on Zimbabwe,"" he said, adding that the EU delegation ""thought things were not working, yet we did all the things we were asked to do"" under a power-sharing agreement signed in September last year. Larsson said there was no discussion about the restrictions at the meeting. Under the agreement, which was to end months of turmoil and violence that followed the country's March 2008 presidential elections, Mugabe retained his office, and opposition leader Tsvangirai became prime minister. The agreement -- the Global Political Agreement-- spelled out a number of fundamental democratic reforms, but so far there has been no progress toward them, Carlsson said in a statement ahead of the meetings with Mugabe and Tsvangirai. ""There have not yet been clear positive developments in all areas. I am still concerned at the lack of democratic development,"" she said then. After meeting with Tsvangirai, Carlsson told CNN that ""Tsvangirai's government is working hard towards the implementation of the political agreement."" She added, ""After such a long time of oppression, it is of course hard to move forward and change will take some time. But the EU is committed to follow up on this progress and encourage change.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The H1N1 flu virus could cause up to 90,000 U.S. deaths, mainly among children and young adults, if it resurges this fall as expected, according to a report released Monday by a presidential advisory panel. The report urges speedier production of the H1N1 vaccine and the availability of some doses by September. The H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu virus, could infect between 30 percent and 50 percent of the American population during the fall and winter and lead to as many as 1.8 million U.S. hospital admissions, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reported. The report says 30,000 to 90,000 deaths are projected as part of a ""plausible scenario"" involving large outbreaks at schools, inadequate antiviral supplies and the virus peaking before vaccinations have time to be effective. Up to 40,000 U.S. deaths are linked to seasonal flu each year, with most of the fatalities occurring among people over 65. With seasonal flu and H1N1, this fall is expected to bring more influenza deaths and place ""enormous stress"" on intensive care units nationwide, which normally operate near capacity, the report says. An H1N1 resurgence may happen as early as September, at the beginning of the school year, and infections may peak in mid-October, according to the report. However, the H1N1 vaccine isn't expected to be available until mid-October, and even then it will take several weeks for vaccinated individuals to develop immunity, the report says.  Watch more on H1N1 predictions for this fall » . The potential ""mismatch in timing"" could significantly diminish the usefulness of the H1N1 vaccine, the report says. ""Even with the best efforts, this will cause some illness, some severe illness and unfortunately, some deaths,"" Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday. ""But a lot so far has gone remarkably right,"" Frieden said. ""There's a vaccine well on its way to being distributed, diagnostic tests available in well over 100 laboratories, treatments pre-positioned around the country ... and guidance issued for health care providers, schools, businesses and other communities."" Among the report's recommendations are for government agencies to: . • Prepare several ""planning scenarios"" to determine demand for supplies and care. • Set up surveillance systems to track information about influenza-like illnesses. • Develop plans to protect the public's most vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and those with pre-existing medical conditions. • Speed up the production of the H1N1 vaccine and have an initial batch -- enough to vaccinate up to 40 million people, especially those who are at risk of serious disease -- by mid-September. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the government's preparation and guidance for the public was based on the need to strike a balance ""on a continuum of being paralyzed with fear versus complacency."" So far, clinical trials for the H1N1 vaccine have not indicated adverse side effects beyond what are experienced with the seasonal flu vaccine, Sebelius said. However, there would be no formal decision to launch a vaccination campaign until those trials were complete, she said. That decision would be hers, she said, and she emphasized that any vaccination program would be strictly voluntary. Pregnant women, health care workers and parents or guardians of infants under 6 months of age are among the most vulnerable segments of the population, Sebelius has said. Adults under the age of 65 with an underlying health condition -- such as asthma -- are also considered to be more at risk from the H1N1 virus. H1N1 preparation guidelines for the nation's businesses and school systems were released three weeks ago. The plans are available at the Web site www.flu.gov. The H1N1 vaccine would require two shots, the second three weeks after the first. Immunity to the virus would not kick in until two weeks after the second shot. The World Health Organization declared the H1N1 virus a global pandemic on June 11. More than 1,490 people around the world have died from the virus since it emerged this spring, a WHO official said last week. CNN's Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","Panel: Up to 50 percent of U.S. population could be infected this fall, winter .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- The lower house of Argentina's Congress has approved a controversial media law that spells out media ownership rules and calls for the creation of a regulatory agency. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed Grupo Clarin for her low approval ratings. The measure passed Thursday by a vote of 147 to 4, but the wide margin does not reflect the heated debate over it. Lawmakers opposed to the measure protested by walking out of the chamber and not voting. Some even threatened to turn to the courts to challenge the legitimacy of the vote. The goal of the so-called Audio-Visual Communication law is to regulate television and radio broadcasters and increase competition in the media industry, according to a draft of the bill. Opponents say it targets media critical of the current government and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, especially the media giant Grupo Clarin. This bill is ""for everyone who wants to live in a more democratic and more pluralistic Argentina,"" Fernandez de Kirchner said in a speech last month. The newspaper Clarin has been highly critical of her leadership and that of her husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner. Although the proposed legislation would not affect newspapers, Grupo Clarin's other business interests in cable, television and radio would be forced to be sold off or restructured. ""[Cristina] Kirchner saw [Clarin] as a limit to her power, and this was the origin of the conflict,"" Argentine political analyst Rosendo Fraga said. Argentina's case is just one of a number of fights between the presidency and the media in Latin America. ""At this moment, in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina, the presidents have conflicts with the private media and seek to dominate them, although each country is a different case,"" Fraga said. Among the changes proposed in the bill, a company that owns a cable business would not be allowed to own any over-the-air broadcast channels. Also, the owner of a cable company would be allowed to have only one channel on that system. In its current form, Grupo Clarin would be in violation of both limits, among others. ""It hits other media groups, but Clarin is the one it hurts,"" said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group. The reform would also redistribute broadcast frequencies into thirds: one-third for private media, one-third for the government and one-third for nongovernmental organizations and other civil groups. ""More control of the media by the government, this is the main motivation,"" Kerner said. Journalism advocacy groups have raised concerns, focusing on a proposed requirement that broadcasters renew licenses every two years. ""We are extremely concerned at the opportunity created under the current draft legislation for political pressure on broadcasters,"" International Press Institute Director David Dadge said in a statement. ""We urge Argentinean legislators not to pass this bill in its current form."" If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said. ""Freedom of expression cannot turn into freedom of extortion,"" she said during an August 27 speech. ""The right to information means the right to all information, not to the concealment of part of the information and the distortion and manipulation of the other part."" Grupo Clarin has about two-thirds of the cable market in Argentina, but its other products don't come close to monopolistic figures, Fraga said. Both Kirchners have blamed Clarin's critical reports for their low approval ratings. The ruling party was dealt a strong defeat during recent midterm elections. In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said. Last month, the government pushed the nation's soccer association to rescind a contract it had with Clarin to broadcast games. The government reached into its coffers and offered the association double what Clarin was paying for rights to broadcast the games. This month, 200 tax agents made a surprise raid on the newspaper's offices, ostensibly to check employment records, editor Ricardo Kirschbaum said. But the agents left after three hours, empty-handed. ""Their real mission was to intimidate,"" Kirschbaum said. The editor bristles at the characterization of the bill as part of conflict between his newspaper and the government. The Kirchners ""have a hostile stance, not just against Clarin but against all the press,"" he said. ""They are the proponents of 'democratizing' the media through this law, and this is how they regard the media? It's paradoxical.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It's the year 2000, and Eric Olsen is a medieval knight sheathed in armor with sword in hand. Tracey and Mac Carlson were married in January after meeting at the 2006 Dragon*Con. The 27-year-old is waiting in a line at Dragon*Con, an annual science fiction costume and convention extravaganza that appeals to comic book nerds, horror movie buffs and anyone with a liking for the fantasy side of pop culture. He spots a red-headed princess in a blue ball gown, reminiscent of a Walt Disney fairy-tale, about 15 feet behind him. She is stunning. Is she single? Will she talk to me? What do I say? By the time Olsen rationalizes his jittery thoughts, he has already asked the princess, Sandra Frazer, 19, out to breakfast. Forget about the drunken bar scene or painful blind dates. As Dragon*Con concludes this week, some single attendees are finding themselves coupled with someone who understands their passion for science fiction and fantasy.  Watch Dragon*Con participants talk romance » . When Olsen and Frazer finished their first date, the seeds of love had already been planted. They dated long distance for a year before Olsen proposed the following year at a Dragon*Con costume competition. Frazer, in a leather Catwoman jumpsuit, accepted the ring. ""I've never cared about football or any of the normal guy stuff,"" said Olsen, a home health care director who enjoys obscure sci-fi television shows and elaborate costuming. ""I met someone who shared my same geeky interests, and that's hard to find."" Pat Henry, chairman for Dragon*Con, said his staff sees romances blossom at the convention each year. Hundreds of proposals have occurred at the event since it began two decades ago. Requests roll in by phone several times a month from couples eager to hold their weddings at Dragon*Con, their meeting place. Share your sci-fi convention love story with CNN.com . The likelihood of finding a partner who enjoys alien movies or X-men comics isn't bad: Dragon*Con has evolved from a small gathering of a few thousand participants to a legendary event that reels in about 35,000 people from all over the world. It's one of the largest science fiction, fantasy and cult media conventions in the world. ""The chances are in favor of the females,"" joked Henry, who noted the convention participants are mostly men, though the number of female participants has increased over the years. ""The other thing is if you marry a geek, you know you can keep them at home with the latest science fiction books or video games."" The convention -- four days of panels, events and parties -- offers bountiful opportunities to let the singles mingle. It's an adult playpen where geekiness is revered. The panels debate the science of Michael Crichton books and dissect the ""Star Wars"" scripts. Parties include a Buffy Prom for fans of the 1990s Joss Whedon television teen drama ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the Miss Klingon Empire Beauty pageant themed after ""Star Trek"". Perhaps the best-known event is the Dragon*Con parade, a Halloween party for grownups, some of whom have spent the entire year preparing their costumes. At this year's spectacle, a gray Saturday morning was lit up by a colorful throng of fairies with pink wings, elves in spandex, pirates in corsets and Jedi soldiers flashing lightsabers. What better way to strike up a conversation than while people are watching together? ""You can't settle,"" said Dragon*Con attendee Dino Andrade, who created Soulgeek.com, a dating Web site for fantasy convention attendees and sci-fi nerds. ""You can't be with somebody who's going to hope that someday you're going to grow out of this."" Three years ago at Dragon*Con, Tracey Carlson was smoking outside one morning in her Batman pajamas when her future husband approached her. During their first dinner date at the convention, the two slipped into a deep discussion about ""Babylon 5,"" a sci-fi television series by J. Michael Straczynski. ""I've had friends set me up with total strangers, but it's hard to keep the conversation going if the person isn't into what you are,"" said husband Mac Carlson. They were married in January and their reception cake depicted Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" one of Tracey Carlson's favorite movies. But romance at Dragon*Con can be short-lived and have downsides, said Kelly Rowles, a 25-year-old from Pennsylvania who runs a blog called Convention Fans. Attending her fifth Dragon*Con this year, Rowles has noticed the convention is more likely to produce hookups than serious relationships, and some participants meet compatible singles who live hundreds of miles away. Accountant Petrona Zickgraf, 43, of New Jersey, understands the long distance challenge. She met her boyfriend at a movie screening at Dragon*Con last year, and he lives 250 miles from her in Virginia. They visit each other regularly to share their affinity for science fiction, but they also share other interests such as hiking and visiting museums. ""Let's just say one of us will move soon,"" said Zickgraf, who was outfitted as comic book heroine Vampirella in a revealing pleather jumpsuit. She and her boyfriend, arms wrapped around each other, were celebrating their one-year anniversary at Dragon*Con this weekend. Sometimes, all it takes to meet your soul mate is the right rooming situation. Katie Marcinkowski, a high school English teacher from New York, attended for the first time last year because she enjoyed science fiction novels. She filed a request for roommates on a Dragon*Con LiveJournal Web page, a popular choice among attendees who want to save money by splitting a hotel room. Assigned to her room was 23-year-old Kellan Potts of Tennessee, who has since become her boyfriend. They share a fondness for ""Torchwood,"" a British sci-fi show about extraterrestrials. ""You don't meet the kind of people who like the same kind of stuff out in the real world,"" said Marcinkowski, dressed in a suede warrior woman costume and holding hands with her boyfriend at the convention this year. ""I can't go up to guys and say I like sci-fi and fantasy. They will look at you and say, 'You're weird.' ""","Romance blooms each year at Dragon*Con, a convention for sci-fi fantasy geeks .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Kenneth Bacon, a former reporter and Pentagon spokesman who later served as a top advocate of displaced people all over the world, died Saturday, according to Refugees International. He was 64. Kenneth Bacon was ""one of the great voices in humanitarian advocacy,"" says Joel Charny of Refugees International. Bacon had served as the president of Washington-based Refugees International since 2001, the group said in a statement Saturday. The former Wall Street Journal reporter died Saturday morning from an aggressive melanoma that spread to his brain, the statement said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Bacon, who was Pentagon spokesman during the Clinton administration, a ""great humanitarian leader."" ""Most Americans remember Ken as the unflappable civilian voice of the Department of Defense, where he served with distinction as spokesperson for many years,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""But for millions of the world's most vulnerable people -- refugees and other victims of conflict -- Ken was an invaluable source of hope, inspiration and support. Refugees International credited Bacon for doubling the group's size under his leadership and helping it get increased protection and assistance for displaced people in Sudan's Darfur region, Iraq, Pakistan and other troubled areas. In the last months of his life, Bacon shifted his focus toward the issue of climate displacement, the group said. ""Ken would walk the corridors of power one day and then meet with refugees in the most remote areas of Darfur the next. His unique mixture of expertise in the media, military affairs, and U.S. government policy, added to his compassion for vulnerable refugees, made him one of the great voices in humanitarian advocacy,"" said Joel Charny, acting president of Refugees International. ""Ken always saw the best in people. His ability to connect with nearly everyone he met made it possible for him to convince officials at the highest levels of government and the United Nations to make the necessary changes to save lives and protect people from harm."" In 1994, Bacon became the Defense Department's assistant secretary of public affairs and Pentagon spokesman. He was known for his no-nonsense manner and his signature bow ties. ""I first got to know Ken Bacon several years ago when he was the chief Pentagon spokesman. Ken did the job the way its supposed to be done: holding press conferences, answering questions, providing facts, information and context,"" said CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr. ""I know he was often bemused to watch the new era of spin and message, since he so passionately believed that facts stand on their own merit. ""Later, Ken became an extraordinary advocate for refugees and displaced persons around the world,"" she added. ""I could ring him up to ask a question about any remote area of the world where people were suffering and he could explain with breadth and depth what was going on."" Before working at the Defense Department, Bacon for more than 25 years served as a reporter and editor at the Wall Street Journal, where his assignments included the covering the Pentagon, the newspaper reported. ""He came to the Journal in 1965 and scored a rare (for an intern) page-one story about an automated car-repair system that one overheated mechanic described as 'the greatest thing since girls,' "" the newspaper said in a story posted on its Web site. He is survived by his wife, Darcy, two daughters, two grandchildren, his brother and his father. Refugees International said a memorial service would be held in September.","Bacon, 64, died from an aggressive melanoma that spread to his brain .

"(WIRED) -- Got a few grand to spare for a $3,000 phone? Yeah, we didn't think so. Nobody does -- and that's a problem for the makers of luxury phones, such as Motorola, Bang & Olufson, LG and Vertu. Vertu makes phones starting at $6,000 and going up in price. After years of chasing the ultra-wealthy with exclusive devices that carry designer logos and promise craftsmanship from materials such as sapphire and stainless steel, luxury phone makers are now pulling back. ""The culture has shifted away from conspicuous consumption, so if you are going to have a super expensive product this may not be the time for it,"" says Avi Greengart, research director for consumer devices at Current Analysis. Motorola has already gotten the memo. Earlier this week, the company reportedly canceled the Ivory E18, a device tentatively priced around $3,000. The phone had met with lack of interest from telecom carriers. Motorola declined to comment. If that sounds like an obvious outcome, perhaps it shouldn't. In the last few years, luxury phones had turned into an attractive new business, as designer houses rushed to get a foothold in the tech sector. Prada collaborated with LG to launch two LG Prada phones in Europe and Asia. Last September, Samsung launched the M75500 Night Effect phone, which carried the Emporio Armani insignia. A month later, Motorola offered a $2,000 phone, called the Aura, which was fashioned out of stainless steel and sported a 62-carat sapphire crystal lens. And then there's Vertu, a company that makes true luxury phones, the cheapest of which costs about $6,000. The recession put a spoke in those plans. And it's not just the 401Ks of middle-class Americans that have been in peril. In Russia, many newly-minted billionaires saw their fortunes slip away with falling oil prices. By the first quarter this year, the U.S. economy had shrunk 5.5 percent. Even 50 Cent has complained about losing more than a few Benjamins on the stock market. And just like that, the crystal dominoes started to fall. Last October, Bang & Olufsen, whose phones retailed in Europe for more than $1,500, shuttered its cellphone business as it decided to trim its costs and get out of non-profitable ventures. Motorola is the latest to pull back its luxury line. Luxury phones have never been a big phenomenon in North America, says Greengart. Their manufacturers have had better luck in emerging markets. But now even in those countries, where once 8 percent GDP growth seemed conservative, wealthy consumers are feeling the pinch. ""Super expensive, bling bling phones are big in markets where conspicuous consumption is a way to tell your countrymen you have arrived,"" says Greengart. ""But now, it's a very different economy for everyone."" Many of the troubles that the uber-expensive phones face are because they are created by companies whose main expertise is in targeting a mass market, says Frank Nuovo, former chief of design for Nokia and current head of Vertu. ""I didn't start this business to soak the phones in diamonds and jewels,"" says Nuovo. ""The concept is same as a fine watch or a fabulous car. To be a true luxury product, you have to look at making something that doesn't have an 18-month shelf life."" True luxury, as Nuovo defines it, doesn't apply to a mere $2,000 phone: A Vertu device, soaked in platinum, can run up to $70,000. The company's one-off phones, designed in collaboration with luxury jewels house Boucheron, cost even more. Nuovo may have inadvertently hit on the real problem with luxury phones: Phones are still a very feature-driven products. They are products where the rapid advances in technology can rend older models obsolete very quickly. ""Phones aren't like a handbag where the fundamental utility remains the same and the design changes all the time,"" says Greengart. But Nuovo isn't convinced. ""Take watches and cars,"" he says. ""They all run the same but everyone has a unique way of delivering them stylistically. We can do the same with phones."" Despite the bumps on the road now, Nuovo says the luxury phones will bounce back and find an audience. ""It is no different than a fine watch or a car,"" he says. ""If you take people who value something that is made extraordinarily well there will always be a group interested in it."" Vertu is determined to prove that. It will launch its latest handset the Carbon Fibre Ascent Ti in August. The phone is made of high-gloss carbon fiber and has a sandblasted titanium surface. The price tag? $9,800.

"(CNN) -- Legendary American boxer Muhammad Ali has visited the birth place of his ancestors in Ireland, prompting thousands of well-wishers to line the streets of the town. Muhammad Ali on a nine-day visit to Europe that included a stopover to his ancestoral home in Ireland. The scenes were reminiscent of a presidential visit as the 67-year-old former three-times world heavyweight champion traveled to Ennis, County Clare to see the hometown of his forebear. The visit was commemorated by the town council with the unveiling of a plaque at the home of his great grandfather and by making Ali the first honorary ""freeman"" of the town. Abe Grady -- the grandfather of Ali's mother Odessa Lee Grady -- lived in the town of Ennis,  before emigrating to the United States in 1860 where he married an African-American emancipated slave. Watch as Muhammad Ali visits Ireland » . Ali -- who was crowned Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated in 1999 -- had his Irish heritage uncovered by genealogists in 2002. ""Now that we know Muhammad is an Ennis man, we will be back,"" Ali's wife Lonnie told Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper. The small County Clare- town of 23 thousand put on an open-air concert, closed schools early and had special screenings of the Ali v George Foreman documentary ""When We Were Kings"" to welcome the ""Louisville Lip."" Ali -- who has been a Parkinson's Disease sufferer since 1984 -- did not speak to those who had gathered but shadow-boxed to spectators and cameras before meeting his distant relatives. ""It was incredible. We've had so much rain and yet today it was beautiful. The rain held off wherever Muhammad Ali went."" Frankie Neylon, the town's mayor said. Ali fought in Ireland only once during his career, beating Al Blue Lewis in a non-title bout at Dublin's Croke Park in 1972. The visit to Ireland was part of a nine-day tour of Europe that Ali had undertaken to raise money to fight Parkinson's Disease and for the Ali Center.","Muhammad Ali visits his ancestral home of Ennis, Ireland .

"DALLAS, Texas (CNN)  -- The minute you walk into Mustang Barbers you immediately smell the scent of aftershave lotion and your grandfather's cologne. Mustang Barbers in Dallas, Texas, is usually buzzing with hair-cutting activity. The sounds of hair clippers buzzing and hair dryers blowing fill this hardwood-floor barber shop. Mustang Barbers is an old-fashioned barber shop. Men come from all walks of life to get their haircuts from one of Mustang's 10 barbers. While some men wait their turn in the barber's chair, they get a shoeshine and read the morning newspaper. The old saying ""the more things change, the more things stay the same"" couldn't be more true at Mustang Barbers. The shop has been around this Dallas neighborhood for 40 years. Its owner, Phil McAllister, has been cutting hair for more than 35 years. He comes from a family of barbers. His father, A.E. McAllister, was a barber for 61 years and worked at Mustang Barbers into his 90s. Phil's son, Wes McAllister, 28, also works there. ""Once my wife lets me retire,"" says Phil McAllister, ""my son will take over the business."" Barbering has been around for centuries, and this old profession doesn't seem be going away anytime soon. The barbers at Mustang Barbers really enjoy cutting hair and making small talk with their customers. Straight-razor shaves also are available. ""My clients are my friends,"" say McAllister. Fathers bring their sons, and sons come with their grandfathers. This American career has been passed from generation to generation. ""I've cut grandfather's hair, his son's hair and his grandson's hair,"" says barber Carolyn Wilson, who has been cutting hair for 17 years. ""Some ladies want to just cut women's hair, but I just want to cut men's hair,"" says Wilson. ""I just like to make them feel good about themselves.""  Watch the comings and goings at the shop » . Todd Blalock, 36, has only been cutting for five years. ""I'm gonna do this forever,"" he says. Blalock was a musician and a Mustang Barbers customer for years. Then he decided to change careers and become a barber. He is glad to see young people decide to become barbers. ""There's opportunity for youth to revitalize barbering, to show it's strong and still here."" Barbering is not for everyone. ""You have to be thick-skinned,"" says McAllister. ""There's lots of teasing."" If want to know the latest talk of the town, a dirty joke or just the hottest sports opinion, this barber shop is the place to visit. ""We pretty much rake [each other] over the coals all day long,"" says Blalock. Mustang Barbers has stayed in business by keeping it simple for 40 years. ""The techniques are all the same,"" McAllister explains. ""Once you know the basics, you go from there."" In a fast-paced world of ever-changing technology, Blalock is glad that places like Mustang Barbers are still around. ""Everything in the world changes so quickly, there's something about a place that has stayed the same,"" he says. Wilson agrees. ""Barbering will never go away,"" she says. ""It's been around forever and always will be.""","Hair clippers buzzing, hair dryers blowing at old-fashioned barber shop .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Van Jones defies environmentalist stereotypes. He's not the earthy-crunchy, Birkenstock-wearing type. Nor is he a contemporary and corporate version -- a hedge fund-fueled entrepreneur looking to make millions by building wind farms and solar-powered corporate headquarters. ""We want to bring green jobs to people who don't have hope,"" says Van Jones, the president's ""green jobs"" chief. The new special adviser for ""green jobs"" -- those jobs that help reduce energy consumption and lessen environmental impact -- at the White House Council on Environmental Quality is in some ways like President Obama himself: an African-American community activist and organizer who has rocketed to the highest levels of government. Jones says it was death, of all things, that set him on his current career path as a green-jobs guru. In describing his turn from social activist to environmentalist, Jones recounted his experiences with young people in Oakland, California. ""I got involved in this work because I got tired of going to funerals. I got tired of seeing young people without any hope,"" Jones told CNN. ""I wanted them to have a better future. I said, 'Why don't we get these young people trained in green jobs so they can be a part of all these companies that are getting started?' "" So Jones, a Yale Law School graduate and longtime community activist, started an organization called ""Green For All"" in Oakland. The mission was to figure out how to train underprivileged young people in green-jobs skills, such as installing solar panels and retrofitting houses to make them more energy efficient.  Watch more on Van Jones' career » . ""People talk about global warming. ... I want to cool the Earth down. I also want to calm the block down,"" said Jones. Jones' efforts earned him national recognition and grabbed the attention of Obama's advisers. Now, he is the president's pitchman for green jobs, helping to coordinate government agencies focused on delivering millions of green jobs to the ailing U.S. economy. ""I see myself as the green-jobs handyman. My job is to make sure that the president's desire that we have literally millions of green jobs in our country actually turns into reality,"" said Jones. Yet even in places like Michigan, where unemployment is a whopping 15 percent -- well above the national average of 9.5 percent -- Jones understands there's skepticism about his message. CNN followed Jones on a recent visit to Lansing, Michigan, where he told attendees at a green-jobs conference that saving the planet and saving jobs can go hand in hand. ""You say, 'Oh no, oh no -- you're gonna talk about the caulking gun. Oh no!' "" Jones joked with the crowd. Critics, though, have serious concerns about the ""green collar"" agenda. They argue that those green jobs -- retrofitting homes to make them more energy-efficient, for instance -- will be mostly low-level and low-paying. Jones dismisses that. ""You take somebody and maybe this summer they're putting up solar panels,"" Jones said. ""Well guess what, this is a growing part of our economy -- the next summer they can be a manager, the next summer, maybe they can be an owner, an investor, an inventor."" While Jones tries to spread his green message, he's also trying to practice what he preaches. That means taking public transportation, including a bus and train ride, to get to his office just across the street from the White House. He says those rides give him valuable opportunities to hear unvarnished views. Describing his work as a member of the executive branch, Jones said, ""Everybody that comes talk to us, they've already got an agenda, they've got their game face on. [On] public transportation, people are themselves."" As for who Jones is, he gave CNN a brief look at his new office at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. On the walls hang pictures of his heroes, each Jones described with a different strength. Basketball legend Michael Jordan: dedication and commitment. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali: fighting spirit. Finally, pointing to a picture above his desk, Jones' tone grew softer. ""This is Bobby Kennedy the day before he was killed. In Watts, talking to some of the poorest people in California. And look at him. I mean, he's just present,"" Jones said, his eyes focused on Kennedy's image. ""We want to bring green jobs to these kind of folks. We want to bring green jobs to people who don't have hope.""","Van Jones says death set him on career path: ""I got tired of going to funerals""

"Editor's note: Jared L. Cohon is president of Carnegie Mellon University. Jared Cohon says Pittsburgh shows the power of education and innovation to revive an economy in crisis. (CNN) -- This week the international community is converging on my chosen hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as heads of state gather for the G20 summit. Pittsburgh may seem like an unlikely choice for such a high-profile event, but a closer look shows why this city personifies the transformative power of education and research, and how the practical application of innovation can drive growth and improvement in quality of life the world over. Pittsburgh is a city that was largely written off as a rusted industrial center. But as heads of state from around the world tour the city this week, they will see running trails replacing former industrial railways and they will find green hotels and LEED-certified buildings rising where abandoned steel mills once stood. These changes are creating jobs, bringing new commerce and making Pittsburgh the most livable city in the United States, according to the Economist magazine. President Obama has praised our city as a ""bold example"" of the new green economy. A significant part of Pittsburgh's renaissance can be attributed to its two major research universities: Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. Having one such institution is an advantage in today's global economy; having two (very close to each other) puts Pittsburgh in a very small group of American cities. The shape of today's research university, with its heavy dependence on federally sponsored research, can be traced to World War II and its immediate aftermath, with a major boost a decade later when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. But what began as a response to national security threats has turned into the engine of America's -- and the world's -- prosperity. As my colleague, the Dean of Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering, Pradeep Khosla has written, the industries that have fueled economic growth have come out of the American research university enterprise. Biotechnology, nanotechnology, digital communications, and computers and software that have improved our quality of life and economic standing all have their origins in research universities. The companies that apply this research create jobs and fuel economic growth and wealth generation in ways that the world has never before experienced. According to one report prepared for the White House, 50 percent of the growth in the American economy in the last 40 years has been due to investments in research and development. Obviously, the private sector is a major driver of R&D, but federally funded research at universities throughout the United States plays a key role. The presence of a major research university does not, by itself, guarantee economic progress beyond the direct jobs that the university creates. Realizing the full potential of a university depends on effectively tapping into the brilliance and ingenuity of its faculty and students and the innovations they create. Technology commercialization -- shaping a bright idea into a commercially successful product -- has been described as a ""contact sport"". It requires an innovative and entrepreneurial campus culture and an ecosystem surrounding it that supports technology-based economic development with facilities, money and people who know how to take ideas to the market. More than a decade ago, Carnegie Mellon embraced Pittsburgh's economic development as one of its institutional strategic priorities. We changed our technology transfer policies to make it easier and faster for our faculty and alumni to create local companies based on our technology. We joined forces with the University of Pittsburgh and partnered with state and local government and industry to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem on which we all rely. Today, there are more than 200 Pittsburgh companies commercializing Carnegie Mellon technology. Our economic development efforts have also included company attraction. With state and local government support, we built a building on campus for global technology companies, which see value in being so close to our faculty and students. There are now hundreds of new jobs in that building, created by Intel, Google and Apple. Disney set up their first research lab here, but they're across the street -- the new building is full. The success of the American research university has been, and continues to be, studied by many developing and developed countries that want to advance technology, secure a stronger position for themselves in global markets and raise the standard of living for their citizens. It is clear that the U.S. model must be replicated in many countries in order for the world to be a better place. During the last decade, in pursuit of another of our strategic priorities, Carnegie Mellon has partnered with several countries, including Qatar, Portugal, Greece, Australia and Japan, among others, to establish high-caliber education and research programs. Countries that can successfully replicate the U.S. research university enterprise will secure for themselves a strong position for the future, for they will be the source of the next wave of economic expansion in the world. We are living in one of the most intellectually exciting eras in history. From medicine to energy, to robotics and computing, many fields of science are experiencing a revolution that will change our understanding of what is possible. These revolutions are occurring on the campuses and laboratories of research universities every day around the world. As world leaders arrive here in Pittsburgh, they must keep in mind the importance of research and education, historically and in addressing today's most challenging issues. As they contemplate stimulus plans and regulation of the financial industry, and enjoy Pittsburgh's beauty and impressive progress, they must also resolve to sustain and, in most countries, grow their systems of higher education, including and especially their research universities. Research universities are at the heart of Pittsburgh's transformation, and they are a key to our collective future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jared L. Cohon.","Jared Cohon: Pittsburgh economy has been reinvented through innovation .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korea will hold three days of talks on reunions for families torn apart by the Korean War and divisions between the two countries, South Korea's Unification Ministry said Tuesday. North Korean Yun Young-Seob hugs his South Korean sister Yun Bok-Seob at a 2007 reunion in North Korea. The talks, which begin Wednesday, will be the first on the subject in almost two years. The International Red Cross said it was sending delegates to mediate the talks, which will be held at the Mount Keumgang resort in North Korea. North Korea was also to schedule an early-October reunion for families across the peninsula who where separated in the aftermath of the Korean War, KCNA reported earlier this month. Rapprochement talks between the two sides have hit a wall since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun. Tuesday's announcement was the latest sign of potential thawing in the icy relationship between the two Koreas, which have technically remained in conflict since the Korean War ended in 1953. The Korean conflict ended in a truce, but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Lee met last week, prior to the funeral of former South Korean President Kim Dai-jung, with a visiting North Korean delegation, who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries. Although the president reiterated his firm stance on North Korea, South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday. The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. South Korea condemned the action, calling the launches ""provocative"" and ""unwise."" South Korea is expected to make a second attempt to launch its first satellite later Tuesday after aborting a launch last week when a piece of equipment malfunctioned minutes before launch. Earlier this month, South Korea responded positively, but cautiously, to a joint agreement announced Monday between North Korea and the South's Hyundai Group to resume cross-border tourism, ease border controls and facilitate cross-border family reunions. Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung said that the two sides needed to reach an agreement through direct talks. A Hyundai subsidiary handles all tourism and business projects between the Koreas. The announcement of the agreement followed a weekend meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Hyundai chairwoman Hyun Jeong-eun. Under the agreement, South Korean tourists would again be able to travel north across the border to Mt. Keumgang, a popular resort in the communist nation, North Korea's state-run KCNA reported. Tours to Keumgang were halted in July 2008 after North Korean soldiers killed a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted area.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother and his three children receive an allowance totaling more than $86,000 a month, according to court documents released Thursday. Michael Jackson's estate provides $86,000 a month for Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren. The money given them by the Michael Jackson estate is in addition to the maintenance of the home -- which is owned by the estate -- in Encino, California, where Katherine Jackson lives with her grandchildren, the papers said. The Los Angeles County judge overseeing the probate of Jackson's will ordered that the petitions for their monthly allowance be made public -- although with some details removed. Those papers were released Thursday. Katherine Jackson was granted custody of her son's three children soon after Jackson's June 25 death. She and the children were named beneficiaries, along with unnamed charities, in Jackson's 2002 will. Control of the estate's assets, however, was given to lawyer John Branca and John McClain, a former music industry executive. Jackson named them as trustees in his will. The petitions filed by Branca and McClain in July, and later approved by Judge Mitchell Beckloff, outlined $26,804 in monthly expenses for Katherine Jackson. The largest amount from that, $4,722, pays for an assistant for her. Another $3,500 each month is budgeted for clothing for Katherine Jackson, who is 79 years old. She's also given $2,000 each for a housekeeper and driver. She has a $1,500 entertainment allowance each month, the documents said. The details of the children's budget are mostly blacked out at their lawyer's request. Margaret Lodise told the judge there was concern someone could use the financial information to pose as one of the children online. She told CNN the family was aware of people posing as Jackson children with Twitter accounts. The documents did reveal the three children get a combined $60,000 a month from their father's estate. They pay $14,600 a month for salaries and payroll taxes for people who take care of them, according to the petition. Michael Jackson's children get $13,260 each month for entertainment and related expenses, the papers said. The petition estimated Michael Jackson's estate is worth at least $500 million and is growing. Major deals have been reached in the past month that are expected to add tens of millions of dollars to the estate, including a movie and music deal with Sony.","Money from Jackson estate is in addition to the maintenance of the home .

"(CNN) -- A pint-sized version of the Tyrannosaurus rex, with similarly powerful legs, razor-sharp teeth and tiny arms, roamed China some 125 million years ago, said scientists who remain startled by the discovery. An adult Raptorex was about 9 feet tall and weighed about 150 pounds, scientists say. The predator, nicknamed Raptorex, lived about 60 million years before the T. rex and was slightly larger than the human male, scientists said. The findings, to be released Friday in the journal Science, are based on fossilized remains discovered in lake beds in northeastern China. They show a dinosaur with many of the specialized physical features of Tyrannosaurus rex at a fraction of its size. ""The most interesting and important thing about this new fossil is that It is completely unexpected,"" said Stephen Brusatte, co-author of the article, in a conference call with reporters. ""It's becoming harder and harder to find fossils like this that totally throw us for a curve,"" added Brusatte, a paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History. Scientists who have studied the fossilized animal, which was 5 to 6 years old when it died, believe it was an ancestor of the fearsome T. Rex. ""Raptorex really is a pivotal moment in the history of the group where most of the biological meaningful features about Tyrannosaurs came into being,"" said lead author Paul Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago. ""And the surprising fact is that they came into being in such a small animal,"" he added. Based on estimates of other similar-sized theropods, or ""beast-footed"" dinosaurs, Sereno and his colleagues estimate an adult Raptorex was about 9 feet tall and weighed about 143 pounds. By contrast, the Tyrannosaurus rex, which topped the prehistoric food chain  until dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago, was believed to weigh at least five tons. Scientists hypothesize that Raptorex ran its prey down, using its enlarged skull, powerful jaws and sharp teeth to dispatch animals much larger than itself. Like the T. rex, the Raptorex also had tiny forelimbs, they said. ""We can say that these features did not evolve as a consequence of large body size but rather evolved as an efficient set of predatory weapons in an animal that was 1/100th the size of Tyrannosaurus rex and that lived 60 million years before Tyrannosaurus rex,"" Brusatte said. After the remains were discovered, they were smuggled out of China and into the United States, where they were eventually purchased by a Massachusetts collector, Henry Kriegstein, who donated them to science. Sereno was later asked to identify the fossil. ""I hope that this is a pathway that other important specimens that do find their way out of the ground in the dark of night do not get lost to science,"" Sereno said. The Raptorex fossil will eventually be returned to China, where it will be put on display near the excavation site, scientists said.","Scientists discover a fossil they believe was a tiny version of the T. rex .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The days are getting shorter, the nights colder, but that doesn't mean that your electricity bill needs to go through the roof. In a unique experiment, the residents of Britain's Scilly Isles are hoping to show that reducing your electricity consumption doesn't have to be difficult. The Isles of Scilly is switching off power to promote energy efficiency. As part of E-Day, homes, schools and businesses on the Scilly Isles are switching off all non-essential electrical equipment to promote energy saving. The results of the experiment are being posted online in real-time. E-Day organizer, Matt Prescott said: ""The Isles of Scilly are like a miner's canary for the rest of the UK, because of their vulnerability to sea level rise, to violent storms rolling off the Atlantic and to any major changes in the Gulf Stream."" The islands, which lie 28 miles off Land's End, the UK's most westerly point, are connected to the UK mainland by a single electricity cable which means that power usage in the experiment can be measured efficiently. All of the 2000-strong community who are spread across five islands have been encouraged to join in. The energy savings made will be compared against the previous day's usage with updates appearing online regularly. The E-Day Web site keeps track of costs and kWh usage providing up-to-the-minute information about how much electricity is being used in island-wide as well as individually monitoring Five Islands School on St Mary's Island and the electricity consumption of one family. ""We've fitted the family and the school with special energy monitors so they can accurately monitor what appliances use the most electricity,"" Prescott told CNN. Studies suggest that families who use these sorts of energy monitors can cut their electricity bills by up to 20 percent. At the time of writing, the family's consumption had dropped dramatically, down 35 percent on the previous day, which Prescott estimates is a saving of around £300 ($475) on their annual electricity bill. Sadly the figures for the school and the island as a whole weren't quite so impressive. The school was up six percent on the previous day, while the island as a whole saw a two percent rise in usage. Prescott put these small rises down to the notoriously fickle British weather. ""Yesterday was lovely and sunny,"" he said. ""So far, today it has been rainy."" The damp and gloom have meant more lights being switched on but despite these meteorological setbacks, Prescott remained upbeat about the success of the experiment. ""Before the family left home this morning they turned off everything they could, so their reduction in usage is a fantastic result,"" he said. Visitors to the the E-Day Web site can also play the""5 Things"" game to find out what all sorts of household appliances cost to run and how much they cost you and the environment. ""The E-Day experiment will hopefully prove that the small things can make a big difference, especially when we work together and try to save energy,"" Prescott said. Prescott is also the founder of ""Ban the Bulb"" -- an energy efficiency campaign which is helping phase out the use of incandescent light bulbs in 30 countries. The event has been organized as part of a four-day Earth Summit event which has seen the Isles of Scilly play host to fellow islanders from Samoa, The Galapagos Islands, Madagascar and the Carteret Islands -- whose inhabitants are some of the first people being displaced by rising sea-levels.","UK's Scilly Isles take part in a day-long experiment monitoring electricity consumption .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN)  -- Indonesia is no stranger to bombings such as the one that rocked two luxury hotels in Jakarta on Friday. Indonesian counter-terrorist police commandos secure the damaged Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta. As authorities sift through the rubble of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels, which were struck by bombs that killed at least eight people, some could not help but think about past bombings in the Southeast Asian country. In 2002, a bombing at two night clubs on the island of Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. More than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta. Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces. The bombing was blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah -- a terror group with ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network. The group is suspected in other bombings. Many of those convicted in the plot were sentenced to death or life in prison. In August 2003, the same JW Marriott Hotel that was attacked Friday was bombed, killing 12. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta was targeted in 2004. A powerful car bomb shook Jakarta's central business district, blowing a hole through the embassy's security gate, killing at least eight people and wounding about 168. A year later, three suicide bombers targeted two tourist spots on the resort island of Bali. The bombings -- two at the cafes near Jimbaran Beach and one at a restaurant in Kuta's main square -- killed 19 people and wounded at least 132, according to hospital officials. Despite the string of bombings, presidential spokesman Dino Patti Djalal said Indonesia has made strides in addressing terrorist groups.  Watch an eyewitness report of the blasts » . ""We have made significant progress in curbing the activities of terrorists,"" the spokesman said.  Watch a report on suspects behind the blasts » .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- President Obama deserves an A+ for his agenda for education reform. His decision to nominate Arne Duncan as U.S. education secretary was inspired, and his comments on holding the system accountable are honest, refreshing and insightful. Obama showed that again this week with a powerful speech at James C. Wright Middle School in Madison, Wisconsin. He announced that, in the coming weeks, states would be able to compete for their share of more than $4 billion in funding through the administration's Race to the Top initiative. But in order to do that, he said, the states have to demonstrate that they're serious about increasing accountability by doing things like tearing down ""firewall laws"" that prevent districts from factoring in student performance when evaluating teachers. That sinister brainchild was brought to you by politically influential teachers' unions who make it their solemn mission to protect their members from the scrutiny and standards that everyday people have to put up in their jobs. Obama's not having any of it. ""If you are committed to real change in the way you educate your children,"" he told his audience, ""if you're willing to hold yourselves more accountable, and if you develop a strong plan to improve the quality of education in your state, then we'll offer you a big grant to help you make that plan a reality."" Like no president in recent memory -- except maybe George W. Bush, who diagnosed that schools are often afflicted with ""the soft bigotry of low expectations"" -- Obama gets it. What Obama ""gets"" is that America's public schools often underperform and help cheat students out of brighter futures for three main reasons: . 1) There are low expectations, not just for students but also for parents, schools and whole communities that are written off as not able to compete academically. Too many educators let themselves off the hook by telling themselves that poor kids from struggling backgrounds are somehow incapable of learning as well as kids from wealthier communities. 2) Too many educators and politicians treat public schools as if they exist for the benefit of the adults who teach there rather than the kids who are supposed to learn there. Because teachers have unions and students don't, everything -- including the length of the school year -- is geared for the convenience of the work force and not the clientele. 3) Those intent on preserving the status quo resist tooth and nail any attempt to hold them accountable by linking teachers to the performance of their students or, in an idea that Louisiana is trying and that Duncan smiles upon and would like to see spread to other states, tracing back teachers to the schools of education that produced them. Obama understands all that. And, it seems, the president learned it during his stint as a community organizer in Chicago, Illinois. It was there that he went to bat for low-income black parents who, like scores of parents who send their kids to underperforming schools throughout America, are caught in a frustrating and almost comical paradox. They're turned away, shunned, treated with condescension and even insulted by self-serving public school ""edu-crats"" who treat these institutions like their own private offices where they don't want to be bothered by anyone who doesn't have a teaching or administrative credential. Then, incredibly, the parents are blamed for not participating and involving themselves more in that hostile environment and when many of them thought that teaching their kids was the job of, well, teachers. It's been my experience that many teachers don't really care whether parents go to the PTA or help their kids with homework. They just want a constant foil, someone to blame when students flounder and the schools underperform. And, when that happens, in any public school in America, suddenly there's not a mirror to be found. It's always someone else's fault. I know what you're thinking. Teachers love to portray columnists, analysts and pundits as clueless about the real world of teaching unless we've actually taught in the classroom. Been there, done that. Before I ever started writing a column, I taught for nearly five years in a poor farming town in central California where most of the students were the children of Mexican farm workers. And I learned more about education there than I did from taking graduate courses at Harvard. I bet that a lot of public school teachers -- many of whom, according to exit polls, vote Democratic -- are already missing the Bush administration. At least when they were battling the accountability law known as No Child Left Behind, they could say it was someone else's idea put in place by a president who other people elected. Now, they must confront the unpleasantness that comes with a reform effort being pushed by an administration that many of them support. One way to square that circle is try to make Duncan out to be the problem, as if the education secretary has gone rogue. Recently, I heard from a professor of education at a state university in San Diego who bristled at the former college basketball player's call for reforming teachers' colleges. ""Mr. Obama,"" she wrote, ""please fire Arne Duncan and let him go back to the basketball court."" Cute. Smug but cute. Trouble is, this week, Obama made clear that, when it comes to fixing our schools, he and the education secretary are on the same team. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette says Obama targets ""firewall laws"" with school funding initiative .

"(CNN) -- Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday for their World Cup qualifier against Cyprus next week, despite being under the cloud of a drug test controversy. Fabioo Cannavaro's proudest moment came in 2006 when he led Italy to World Cup glory. It was revealed on Thursday that the 36-year-old Juventus defender recently failed a drug test after taking a medicine that contained the banned substance cortisone. Cannavaro was interviewed by the Italian Olympic Committee's (CONI) anti-doping prosecutor Ettore Torri on Thursday night in Turin but national coach Marcello Lippi does not expect his star to be absent from the squad. ""I have not spoken to Cannavaro,"" Lippi told reporters. ""Will he be here with us on Sunday? Of course he will. ""I have not spoken to Cannavaro,"" added national team doctor Enrico Castellacci. ""But he is calm and serene. This is just a bureaucratic case."" Juventus claimed the defender needed cortisone treatment for an insect sting in August. The player requested an exemption from taking drugs tests on the grounds of having taken a medication in an emergency situation but his request did not include a document necessary to complete the application. While awaiting a decision, Cannavaro took an anti-doping test after a Serie A game at Roma which returned a positive result. ""When he came to the national team, after the Roma game, he told us what had happened and he told us that without the medicine that contained cortisone he would have had a reaction, an anaphylactic shock,"" Castellacci said. ""We asked Juventus for all the necessary documents regarding the medicine taken by Cannavaro and all the communication is in our possession."" Cannavaro will not travel to Dublin for Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Ireland as he serves a one-match ban, but is expected to lead the Azzurri in Wednesday's qualifier against Cyprus in Parma.","Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday to face Cyprus .

"(Parenting.com) -- A dad looks at how long it really takes a kid to sleep alone: . Getting the baby to sleep is a challenge for many parents. 1:28 a.m. Every couple of hours, Jack (2 weeks) cries. My wife feeds him, then hands him to me to change his diaper. It's an equitable division of labor, but I wish I could sleep. 2:15 a.m. Jack (1 month) is sleeping between me and my wife because this way she can nurse while she dozes. I'm happy, but so tired. He's on his back, and there are no pillows or blankets around him, but I'm wide-awake, thinking about SIDS. He's like a little hot-water bottle. His breath is sweet and milky against my face. 10 p.m. I'm lying on a tiny crib mattress on the floor next to the crib. We're trying to get Jack (9 months) to sleep through the night. His mother and I take turns lying next to him on the floor and holding his hand through the slats. I miss my wife. 1:36 a.m. Jack (12 months) is sleeping in between us, again. Lying next to his crib didn't work -- Jack kept crying, waking both of us. This way, we all get some sleep. Parenting.com: Dad's in charge? Uh oh. 4:27 a.m. I'm wide-awake because Jack (15 months) kicked me in the groin. I have to get up to drive my wife to New York, then turn around and drive back home with Jack, all on about three hours of sleep. I decide that while his mother is gone, I will Ferberize him. Parenting.com: Ferberizing is not what you think it is . 9:13 p.m. Jack (15 months and a day) is in his crib, crying, crying, crying. 10:11 p.m. Jack (15 months and a week) is in his crib, alone and asleep. Ferberizing worked. Suddenly I have a great idea -- let's have another baby! But this would require that my wife and I stay awake for longer than ten seconds once our heads hit the pillows. 12:02 a.m. In bed with my wife, I'm feeling romantic, but then Jack (18 months) cries out. He has a fever. We give him kids' Motrin and bring him back into bed with us. He's burning up. 11:21 p.m. Jack (18 months and a week) is no longer sick, but now he's back in our bed, every night. It's once again the only way he'll go down. 7 a.m. I realize that for the first time, Jack (22 months) has finally slept through the night. Now we have to get him out of diapers and back in his own room. 11:41 p.m. We are lying in an H formation. Jack (2 years) is nestled into his mother's chest, perpendicular to us, with his feet lodged against my throat, trying to push me off the bed. Freud was right about Oedipus. Parenting.com: Why good dads make moms jealous . 4:25 a.m. Jack (3 years) has kicked the covers off me again and I wake up, shivering. I pull the covers up. He kicks them off. I pull them up. He kicks them off. I go downstairs, turn on the TV, and fall asleep on the couch. 2:15 p.m. I'm sound asleep, dreaming. Unfortunately, I'm at work. Tomorrow is Jack's fourth birthday. Last night in bed, he said, ""Hey, why do I have to sleep in the middle?"" 7:30 p.m. I am lying in the new twin bed we bought Jack (4 1/4 years), to show him how it works. We made a big deal of it, his very own Big Boy Bed, and we let him pick out the dinosaur sheets and the dinosaur comforter. All is ready. 12:05 a.m. I'm in this big empty bed, alone. We told Jack that on his fifth birthday he'd have to sleep in his own bed, because that's what big boys do, and he agreed. He wants very much to be a big boy. On his birthday, my wife lay down with him at 8:30 and fell sound asleep. 5:02 a.m. I get up and peek in on Jack (5 1/2). He's been sleeping alone in his room for almost a month now. I get back into bed with my wife and snuggle up next to her. At least I think it's her -- it's been a while. She feels good against my skin, but now I miss Jack. I miss getting kicked in the throat. I miss getting the covers pulled off of me. Where's my little boy? How did he grow up so fast? 9:42 p.m. Hearing a noise, my wife and I go upstairs to check on Jack (6). He says he was having a bad dream. We lie down with him, three of us in a twin bed. It's crowded, but if we brought him into our bed again, we'd never get him out. His breath is still sweet and milky on my cheek. How could this not be okay? This is my family. Try a FREE TRIAL issue of Parenting Magazine - CLICK HERE! Copyright 2009 The Parenting Group.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Script didn't follow the script. The Script includes, from left to right, Glen Power, Danny O'Donoghue and Mark Sheehan. In the standard showbiz treatment, a group -- say, three plucky, working-class music-mad young men from Dublin, Ireland -- travel to the grand shores of the U.S. of A. They form a band, grab the ear of a noted producer and, with a lucky break or two, are soon opening for the stars who inspired them so many years before. If the story needs a rousing climax, they return as conquering heroes to their homeland, pick up the local paper and find that their new single has gone straight to No. 1. Applause, joyful tears, roll credits. Well, it wasn't quite like that. In the case of The Script -- vocalist/keyboardist Danny O'Donoghue, multi-instrumentalist Mark Sheehan and drummer Glen Power -- O'Donoghue and Sheehan traveled to the States and spent several years as struggling writers and producers. Drummer Power, another Dubliner, had bummed around music scenes for years; he'd met O'Donoghue and Sheehan not long before the pair packed it in and returned to Dublin, plying their trade and looking for breaks. Descriptions of the trio as ""an overnight success"" thus leave them skeptical. If that's the case, said Sheehan before a concert at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia, ""It was the longest night of our lives.""  Watch an interview with The Script » . On the other hand, when success did strike, it struck hard and relatively quickly. When O'Donoghue and Sheehan returned to Dublin, they decided to form a band. They recruited Power, noting their ""great strength together"" -- in Power's words -- after jamming together. The Script's first single, ""We Cry,"" hit the UK Top 20 in the spring of 2008, and the second, ""The Man Who Can't Be Moved,"" hit No. 1. The group's self-titled debut came out in August 2008 in Britain. In December 2008, they played the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, and, in March of this year, opened for U2. (Their album was finally released in the U.S. that same month.) They've spent this summer as Paul McCartney's opening act, which was what brought them to Piedmont Park. Touring with the former Beatle ""feels like a master class for us,"" said Sheehan. The three, all around 30, finish each other's sentences like the old friends they are and display a savvy about the music business. That's only fitting, as O'Donoghue and Sheehan spent their years in America learning the trade alongside producers such as Teddy Riley and the Neptunes. Sheehan says the group is looking for the sweet spot between the ""rock climate"" they grew up in and the hip-hop and R&B sounds that dominate American popular music. ""[With our experience,] we're hashing it out, and I think we've found it,"" he said. (Asked about their own influences, they rattle off hip-hop artists such as Missy Elliott, Jay-Z and Kanye West.) The Script appears to have a happy ending, just as an old tale of rising stars would have it. But the three are quick to point out that aspiring musicians should, well, write their own story. ""If there's a message to younger musicians, to me, it's 'don't give up,' "" says O'Donoghue. ""Magic can happen.""","Musicians spent several years as struggling writers and producers in the U.S.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- In what feels like a box-office weekend from ""The Twilight Zone,"" a low-budget and critically acclaimed movie with no stars and an unknown director managed to top the charts. ""District 9,"" the alien action pic produced by Peter Jackson, crushed the competition grossing $37 million. ""District 9,"" the alien action pic produced by Peter Jackson and directed by the 29-year-old Neill Blomkamp ? who shot the film in Johannesburg, South Africa, of all places -- crushed the competition by grossing $37 million, according to early estimates. Audiences clearly enjoyed what they saw too: ""District 9"" has already soared to No. 78 on IMDb's top 250 movies list, although it'll obviously drop some as the initial euphoria wears off. Second place went to ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"" which dropped 59 percent in its second weekend but still managed to recruit $22.5 million. The $175 million action movie should pass $100 million domestically by Monday. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" materialized into third place with $19.2 million in its debut weekend, proving that there is a market for watching Eric Bana disappear. Rounding out the top 5 were ""Julie & Julia"" (No. 4 with $12.4 million) and ""G-Force"" (No. 5 with $6.9 million), respectively. Also opening wide was a trio of movies that failed to make a significant dent on the box office. ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,"" a cars-salesmen comedy starring Jeremy Piven, barely registered on the mercury thermometer by earning $5.4 million. ""Ponyo,"" the 10th film by Japan's animation auteur Hayao Miyazaki, grossed $3.5 million on 927 screens. While that amount represents Miyazaki's best opening weekend in America, it's still fish feed compared to ""Ponyo's"" worldwide gross of $187 million. The music comedy ""Bandslam"" won't be getting any requests for encores after making only $2.3 million from more than 2,000 screens ? even the promise of seeing the ""Taylor Lautner takes off his shirt"" trailer of The ""Twilight"" Saga: New Moon couldn't save the Vanessa Hudgens movie. In limited release, the Jimmy Page/The Edge/Jack White music documentary ""It Might Get Loud"" opened promisingly, grossing $101,000 from just seven theaters.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Two sentences inscribed above the refurbished entrance hall of Moscow's Kurskaya metro station are causing great agitation for survivors of Russian labor camps.Yuri Fidelgoldsh, who had five ribs removed after imprisonment six decades ago, is one of the offended survivors. This slogan at a Moscow metro station has stirred controversy: ""Stalin reared us on loyalty to the people."" ""Stalin reared us on loyalty to the people,"" says the inscription above the pristine marble floors of the metro station. ""He inspired us to labor and to heroism."" Fidelgoldsh, now 82, doesn't use the metro station much, but he has been there to see the restoration. When he invokes the name ""Stalin,"" he gets angry. ""For people who were imprisoned, punished and whose parents were killed, this is still in their hearts,"" Fidelgoldsh says. Kremlin critics are outraged by the restored motto at the station. They say it's the latest attempt by the government to rehabilitate the image of Joseph Stalin, the late Soviet leader largely responsible for the division of Europe, the deaths of nearly 20 million people and the creator of the Eastern Bloc. ""I have no positive emotions towards Stalin,"" Fidelgoldsh adds. ""He's a college dropout who went into politics and became a leader of a party which fit his needs. He didn't exactly impress me with his 'great' mind."" Watch report on the rehabilitation of Stalin's image » . The phrase at the metro station came from the original Soviet national anthem, written in 1944 by Sergey Mikhalkov. During the de-Stalinization process that began under Nikita Khrushchev after Stalin's death in 1953, statues and other vestiges of his immense cult of personality were removed. In 1977, Mikhalkov rewrote the anthem to delete references to Stalin, and the metro station removed the original inscription of his words. The entrance hall to the station underwent extensive renovation over the past year, complete with new columns and polished marble floors. It's located on the main metro line around the city's center, through which tens of thousands of commuters pass every day. On a recent day, a woman named Nadia said she had no problem with the slogan honoring Stalin. She grew up after the fall of the Soviet Union and during the prosperous Putin years. ""I think we shouldn't be ashamed because this is a part of our history. We have to somehow accept the history,"" said Nadia, who didn't want to give her last name. The Kremlin declined comment for this story. Pavel Suharnikov, the press director for Moscow Metro, said, ""We do not wish to discuss this matter anymore, but I will say that I don't see any political motivation behind the restoration of Kurskaya."" Travelers at the metro station first saw the words hailing Stalin at the start of 1950, when the station opened as one of the grand post-World War II constructions. It was contracted by Stalin himself. ""This metro station was built by prisoners of gulags who were in there for no reason, just because. They were the ones building this station. I think all of this is simply wrong,"" says Valeri M. Shevchenko, a musician, whose father suffered at the hands of Stalin's regime. ""They came in the morning, Stalin's police, took everyone outside and shot my grandfather in front of his family. My grandmother and her eight children, including my father who was 8 at the time, were sent to work camps. Only three children survived."" As Shevchenko looks around the metro station today, he shakes his head. Irina Sherbakova, Moscow director of the Russian-based International Memorial Society, says this new ""re-Stalinization"" is a step back for democracy in Russia. ""It's clear that our nation has declined to accept democracy and individual freedoms, as a principle."" The Memorial Society is a community of dozens of human rights organizations in different regions of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Georgia that formed in 1990. It is responsible for preservation of the societal memory of the severe political persecution of the Soviet Union. The return of the anthem line at Kurskaya may prove to be culturally dividing. According to the Memorial Society, more than 40 percent of citizens favor Stalin's rehabilitation. ""That means people don't care about what was happening to their ancestors. There are no plaques on our buildings and in our schools. It's not at all about restoration and preserving the memory,"" says Sherbakova. Fidelgoldsh, the gulag survivor, was arrested by Stalin's militia on the streets of Moscow in 1948. A friend of his had admitted under questioning -- with a promise to be released -- that they had privately criticized Stalin's regime. The two, along with another friend, were charged with anti-Soviet agitations and forming an anti-Soviet group. They were sent to a labor camp near Magadan, in eastern Russia. Fidelgoldsh was imprisoned for eight years. The friend who turned him in spent the next 30 years in various camps and prisons, where he eventually died. Fidelgoldsh shows a picture of himself at the time of his illness, which was taken by camp authorities and sent to his mother to show that her son was alive and well. He looks weak and pale. ""I nearly starved a few times. They gave me a small loaf of bread daily, but I couldn't survive on that, and quickly became too thin and weak to perform,"" Fidelgoldsh says. ""Eventually, I became sick with tuberculoses and spat blood."" Sherbakova, the Kremlin critic, says it's a slippery slope when a nation like Russia appears to be rewriting history. ""No matter what our politicians may say and do, unless they are willing to accept the past for what it was and treat it properly, the current generations, who are growing up with World War II as a thing of the past, are under threat of repeating the same tragic mistakes,"" Sherbakova says. Joseph Stalin became the general secretary of the Communist Party in 1922. When Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, Stalin essentially installed himself as the Soviet heir. Stalin purged the party of ""enemies"" in what was known as the Great Terror of the 1930s. Tens of thousands of people were executed and millions were forced into the gulag labor system. CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","Newly restored slogan at Moscow metro station hails Stalin, draws criticism .

"(CNN) -- You don't need to be a teenage boy to realize how scary girls can be. Girls know it too. Megan Fox plays a demonic cheerleader in ""Jennifer's Body,"" written by Diablo ""Juno"" Cody. Certainly Diablo Cody does. The Academy Award-winning ""Juno"" scribe proves as much in her second screenplay, a horror comedy about BFFs Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried). These bosom buddies have a relationship that stretches back to the sandbox. They're inseparable opposites: Jennifer is a babe, head cheerleader and a bit of a snot. Needy is nerdy, conventional and a soft touch. Except that when we first meet her, she's locked up in the local mental hospital, kicking back at the guards and muttering darkly about the murders that put her here. Looking back, she dates this disastrous turn of events to the day Jennifer talked her into seeing an up-and-coming indie band at the roadhouse. The gig ends in a deadly inferno that claims the lives of several schoolmates, then Jennifer drives off with the band for an al fresco after-party involving satanic rites and virgin sacrifice. She survives on a technicality, but shows up later that night at Needy's place covered in blood, barfing blue goo and craving fresh flesh. In the days after the tragedy the entire school seems to be suffering from post-traumatic stress. Only Jennifer seems unfazed by the community's second sucker punch: the gruesome fate of the star quarterback in the woods. What's a girl to do if her best friend turns into a heartless boy-eating demon? Needy cleans up the mess and hopes it's just a phase. The last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was ""Twilight,"" which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller. Directed by Karyn Kusama, who made ""Girlfight"" and ""Aeon Flux,"" ""Jennifer's Body"" isn't anything like that. It's a much edgier, snappier, bloodier film, aimed primarily at young hipsters and horror fans -- plus anyone else curious to see Megan Fox get nasty. (That's got to include a sizable chunk of the audience, surely?) So smoldering hot that at one point she coolly sets fire to her tongue, Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's not hard to imagine she can have anyone who takes her fancy -- even Needy is not immune to her charms. Ironically, though, Jennifer is really the needy one here, while her friend eventually finds the self-possession to stand up to her. Similarly, you might come for Fox, but it's Amanda Seyfried's expressive range and toughness that leaves a more lasting impression. The ""Mamma Mia"" starlet is destined for good things. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Jennifer's Body"" The bitingly smart, funny teen-speak is carried over from ""Juno,"" along with sharp pop culture references and a sassy feminist attitude, but the million-dollar question has to be: Is it scary? Only occasionally, I'm afraid. The gore scenes come with weird little flourishes: Jennifer's mounting body count attracts a crowd of curious woodland creatures, sounding a sweetly sick echo of ""Bambi,"" and a climactic showdown is set in a spectacularly fetid abandoned swimming pool (don't they drain those things?). But the jokiness does tend to undercut the terror. I suspect the film will prove too freaky for ""Juno"" boosters, and could have used more straight-ahead scares and sustained suspense to appease the hardcore horror geeks. That said, this entertainingly oddball offering does twist fresh kinks into a genre that's always crying out for new blood.

"If you want to know where American food traditions are headed, look back. Many of today's most healthful eating trends bear a strong resemblance to yesterday's: Nearby farms offering nutritious, peak-of-season produce; slow-cooked dinners that foster leisurely family meals; an emphasis on meatless dishes and minimally processed foods. Sales of organic food have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s, the USDA says. ""It used to be that packaging and convenience were all the rage. But today, food lovers also want to know where their food comes from and how to prepare it in the simplest, most natural way possible,"" says Fern Gale Estrow, M.S., R.D., a community nutritionist based in New York City. ""People still want and need to save time in the kitchen, but they're not willing to sacrifice taste and nutrition to get it."" Fortunately, these five food trends provide exactly that -- flavorful, nutrient-rich meals that are easy to prepare and can help you fulfill many of your dietary requirements. Flexitarianism . Like vegetarians, ""flexitarians"" eat a primarily plant-based diet composed of grains, vegetables, and fruits, but they occasionally obtain protein from lean meat, fish, poultry, or dairy. A quarter of Americans fit the description, consuming meatless meals at least four days a week, according to the American Dietetic Association. Why it's here to stay: Flexitarianism is exactly what dietitians, nutritional researchers, and public health advocates have been recommending for years. ""It's about eating a varied diet that's low in saturated fat and high in fiber,"" says Milton Stokes, M.P.H., R.D., chief dietitian at St. Barnabas Hospital in New York City, and an ADA spokesperson. Because the emphasis is on produce rather than protein, flexitarians are more likely than most Americans to meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the vitamins and minerals they contain. CookingLight.com: Take our quiz on correct serving sizes . What it means for you: Studies show that people who follow this approach to eating generally weigh less and have lower rates of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. In one large study from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 9,600 people over a 19-year period and found those who consumed fruits and vegetables at least three times daily lowered their risk of stroke by 42 percent, and their risk of cardiovascular disease by 27 percent. Locally grown foods . As people seek fresher foods, they have begun to connect with local family farms. Community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs and farmers' markets give consumers direct access to produce, meats, cheeses, breads, honey, and other foods that are produced in nearby communities. In the past 10 years, the number of local farmers' markets has more than doubled -- it is up from 1,755 to 3,706, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Marketing Service. Why it's here to stay: Because they are so fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables often have a nutritional edge over produce raised on ""factory"" farms. The latter, which constitutes most of the produce grown in the United States, is picked about four to seven days before it arrives on supermarket shelves, and shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before it's sold, according to Local Harvest, a nonprofit agricultural research group. All that downtime takes a toll. USDA researchers have found that if it's not handled properly, produce can lose up to half its nutrients in transit. Water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C are particularly vulnerable. What it means for you: ""Buying food from local vendors gives you input,"" says Gail Feenstra, R.D., food systems analyst at the University of California at Davis' Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program. ""You can find out how things were grown. You can also request varieties of fruits and vegetables that wouldn't be available elsewhere."" And then there's the most important reason of all: Because of its freshness, locally grown food tastes better than produce designed to be shipped. ""Growers' priority is on taste and texture versus transportation,"" Feenstra says. Functional foods . Functional foods are enriched with nutrients that may not be inherent to a given food. Familiar examples include orange juice fortified with calcium or milk fortified with vitamins A and D. As sales of these foods have soared in recent years, more functional foods have reached the market, such as eggs and pastas with omega-3 fatty acids, sterol-fortified chocolates and high-fiber, high-protein flours. Why it's here to stay: These foods help many people fill nutritional gaps. ""For example, if you're lactose intolerant, you might find it difficult to meet your calcium quota,"" Stokes says. ""Calcium-fortified juice eliminates that problem, especially if a glass is already part of your daily diet."" Likewise, if you dislike seafood, you can obtain extra omega-3s from eggs or pasta. CookingLight.com: Remembering real portion sizes . What it means for you: Functional foods are one helpful element in maintaining a balanced diet, not a substitute for it. ""Calcium-fortified orange juice won't supply other nutrients that a dairy source would provide, like protein,"" Estrow says. ""That's why it's best to rely on whole foods, which provide multiple nutrients that act synergistically."" In the end, it's fine to reap added nutrients from a functional food, but remember to fulfill the majority of your needs with naturally rich sources. Organic food . These are foods produced following a government-regulated practice of growing and processing that minimizes exposure to pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals used in traditional farming. Organic food is one of the country's fastest-growing market segments; sales have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. Why it's here to stay: Some organic foods may provide a nutrition boost. A research review of 41 studies conducted by the University of California at Davis found that, on average, organic produce contains as much as 27 percent more vitamin C, 21 percent more iron, and 29 percent more magnesium compared with traditionally grown foods. The kinds of packaged organic foods that now fuel the category's growth, such as cookies, baked goods, and boxed meals, also benefit from a similar perception of healthfulness. What it means for you: ""An organic stamp isn't necessarily a guarantee of nutritional quality, but it is a sure sign that the food is less adulterated,"" Stokes says. An organic cookie, for example, may have just as many calories and grams of saturated fat as a nonorganic cookie. But in the case of produce crops that are commonly treated with high concentrations of pesticides, such as peaches, apples, and strawberries, choosing organic can minimize your exposure to these chemicals, according to tests conducted by researchers from the Environmental Working Group in Washington, D.C. CookingLight.com: All-star foods that fight for health . Slow food . Launched in Italy 20 years ago by restaurateur Carlo Petrini, ""slow food"" was originally designed to protest the encroachment of fast food on the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle. The trend's principles -- choosing locally grown and produced items, preparing them in traditional ways, and eating with friends and family -- celebrate a relaxed approach to living that provides a welcome contrast to the fast-paced, eat-on-the-run lives many people lead. Why it's here to stay: As with locally grown food, freshness is a key component of the slow food trend. ""Investing the time to choose what's fresh that day will ensure that night's meal will be at its peak nutritionally,"" Stokes says. This principle applies whether you're making a family recipe or dining in a restaurant where the chef selects ingredients based on their seasonal availability. Family togetherness is also an important aspect of the trend. ""Slow food is all about cherishing the eating experience and getting back to what food used to be: a vehicle for drawing people together,"" explains Sara Firebaugh, assistant director of Slow Food USA. What it means for you: Healthful whole foods are a great start, but slow food goes a step beyond good nutrition -- and it's a difficult one to quantify. No scientific studies have conclusively proven that friends and family make better dinner companions than televisions, but the benefits are clear. ""Slow food embraces the psychological component in food choices, meal preparation, and the act of eating,"" Estrow says. ""A healthful diet isn't just about what you eat but how you eat it.""

"MIAMI BEACH, Florida (CNN)  -- On the grainy, silent black and white video, it's hard to tell exactly what happened the night of June 14 in Miami Beach. But one thing is certain: A tourist, Husien Shehada, can be seen falling to the ground, shot by a police officer. Shehada, 29, later died. Husien Shehada, at left with his brother, Samer, was shot dead by Miami Beach police on June 14. Four nights later, again in Miami Beach, Lawrence McCoy allegedly pistol-whipped a cab driver and led police on a chase. Police say shots were exchanged. McCoy, also 29, was killed. Officer Adam Tavss, a 34-year-old former history teacher with three years on the force, was involved in both police shootings, the first in Miami Beach since 2003. Although it is not yet clear whether Tavss fired one of the shots that killed McCoy, questions are being raised as to whether the officer was cleared for patrol duty too soon after the first shooting. Police and the Miami-Dade County state attorney's office are investigating the shootings. The inquiry is expected to last several more months. All the records and reports have been sealed.  Watch surveillance video of the first shooting » . The families of Shehada and McCoy are asking the Justice Department to investigate. Tavss, who is now assigned to desk duty, declined through his attorney to speak with CNN, citing the ongoing investigation. Miami Beach Police Chief Carlos Noriega has defended both shootings. ""It is important to note that the subjects in both cases had exhibited aggressive, violent, non-compliant and criminal behavior,"" the chief said in a statement to the media. Noriega added that officers ""are required to make split-second decisions based on a variety of factors and cannot afford to hesitate or be wrong."" The Miami Beach department's standard operating procedure for use of force, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, states that any officer involved in a fatal shooting must be assigned to administrative duties for at least 72 hours. The department also mandates psychological support. Tavss was removed from duty for 72 hours, evaluated and then cleared by Noriega to return to patrol, which is departmental policy. On his first day back out on the street, Tavss was involved in the second shooting. Each of the nation's 20,000 police departments sets its own policy for police involved in shootings and fatalities. Some departments keep the officers off the streets for a week or longer. In virtually all cases, psychological evaluation and counseling are mandatory.  Watch CNN's report on the shootings » . Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and an expert on police use of force and stress management, said she had never heard of an officer being involved in two shootings within four days. ""I think it's a gross error of judgment for any police department to maintain a rule that allows an officer who was involved in a fatal shooting to be back on the streets four days after the incident,"" Haberfeld said. A study by the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice found that officers involved in fatal shootings can be affected for months afterward. ""In the days, weeks and months that follow a shooting, officers may suffer adverse reactions such as sleep interruption, anxiety and depression,"" a report on the study said. Officers ""experienced a range of psychological, emotional and physiological reactions that distorted time, distance, sight and sound,"" the study concluded. In some cases, the study found, officers could not recall firing their weapons. But even experts are undecided on just how much time off the street is enough, because every incident and every police officer is different. ""It's hard for me to estimate whether it's weeks or a little bit more, but certainly not days; certainly not hours. It's just too irresponsible toward the officer and toward the society the officer needs to serve,"" Haberfeld said. Police officers across the country train on how to make difficult split-second decisions on the use of deadly force. The sheriff in neighboring Broward County uses an interactive video screen that places officers into scenarios they might face while on patrol. ""In less than half a second, your pulse may go from 60 to 160, 170, and your heart's beating out of your chest, and you have to make a split-second decision,"" Broward Sheriff's Sgt. Bill Pennypacker said. Witnesses, police and surveillance video obtained by CNN provide the following, sometimes conflicting, accounts of what happened during the two Miami Beach shootings: . Husien Shehada and his brother, Samer, had come from Virginia to spend a long weekend with their girlfriends in Miami Beach. Early on Sunday, June 14, they got into a scuffle with another group of men, who intervened after Samer Shehada allegedly assaulted his girlfriend. Investigators said they believe that the two brothers were looking for revenge against those men when somebody called 911, reporting that two men were walking down the street and that one of them might be carrying a machine gun. The callers said they could see the outline of a large gun underneath his white shirt, and he was carrying it in his left hand. In a color security camera tape released by the Miami Beach Police Department, it appears that one of the brothers was carrying something under his shirt, holding it with his left hand. Tavss and other officers approached the brothers in front of Twist, a popular South Beach nightclub. A grainy black and white videotape shows the brothers together and Husien Shehada falling to the ground. A police officer can then be seen approaching. Samer Shehada said he and his brother were cooperating. ""His hands were up for a good two seconds, three seconds,"" Samer Shehada said. ""He wasn't in the process of raising his hands. His hands were up."" One witness told CNN that when Tavss approached the brothers with his gun drawn, the brothers were belligerent. The witness, Derek Reynolds, was working security at the club that night. He said the two men cursed at police and wouldn't put their hands up. ""It got intense. ... They weren't cooperating,"" he said. ""One guy reached behind him, and he got shot."" Law enforcement sources say a coat hanger and a bottle were found at the scene, but no gun was found. Samer Shehada said that neither he nor his brother was carrying a coat hanger, much less a gun. After the shooting, Tavss was relieved of duty for 72 hours, per department policy. When he returned to street patrol, he was one of several officers who responded to a 911 call reporting that that a taxi driver had been pistol-whipped and his cab stolen. Police confronted Lawrence McCoy on a Miami Beach causeway. According to police, McCoy ran and fired at the officers. McCoy was shot dead by police. It is not yet known whether Tavss fired any shots. John Contini, an attorney representing the families of both men shot by police, said McCoy was shot nine to 11 times. No weapon was found on McCoy. Police found a gun several days later in Biscayne Bay, but they say they don't know if it belonged to McCoy. Lawrence McCoy Sr. said his son's civil rights were violated. ""Michael Vick was convicted and put in jail for two years for killing dogs -- for killing dogs. I want justice for my son,"" he said. Contini said Tavss should be in jail. He also questioned the policy that allowed him back on the street so quickly. ""In fairness to the officer, you don't put him on the street, with a gun and a badge, to be in this situation without allowing for a period of decompression -- for the officer's sake, to get some help,"" Contini said.","Miami Beach police officer Adam Tavss is involved in two police shootings .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's state oil company rejected criticism from a leading human rights group Wednesday, calling an Amnesty International report ""inaccurate."" File image of Shell's oil and gas terminal on Bonny Island in southern Nigeria's Niger Delta. ""We have issues with the report,"" said Levi Ajuonoma, a spokesman for Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Amnesty said Tuesday that pollution and environmental impacts from the oil industry in the Niger Delta are creating a ""human rights tragedy"" in which local people suffer poor health and loss of livelihood. Governments and oil companies are failing to be accountable for the problems, Amnesty said in its report, called ""Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta."" But the state oil company said it was local communities who cause much of the environmental damage by vandalizing pipelines for monetary gain. ""We take environmental damage very seriously,"" Ajuonoma said. ""Pipeline damage is a major cause of pollution,"" he argued, blaming ""communities who... vandalize pipelines and make claims on the oil company operating in the area."" Amnesty leveled a wide range of charges in its report. ""People living in the Niger Delta have to drink, cook with and wash in polluted water,"" said Audrey Gaughran, who co-authored the report. ""They eat fish contaminated with oil and other toxins -- if they are lucky enough to be able to still find fish. The land they farm on is being destroyed. ""After oil spills, the air they breathe smells of oil, gas and other pollutants. People complain of breathing problems and skin lesions, and yet neither the government nor the oil companies monitor the human impacts of oil pollution."" The report looks at oil spills, gas flaring, waste dumping and other environmental impacts from the oil industry. The majority of the evidence in the report relates to Shell, the main oil company operating in the region. ""Despite its public claims to be a socially and environmentally responsible corporation, Shell continues to directly harm human rights through its failure to adequately prevent and mitigate pollution and environmental damage in the Niger Delta,"" Gaughran said. A Shell spokesman said the company shares Amnesty's concern for the people in the Niger Delta but disputes the group's assessment of its corporate accountability. ""We feel that the root causes of the Niger Delta's humanitarian issues are poverty, corruption, crime, militancy, and violence. This report does not acknowledge these issues to any substantive degree, but concentrates on oil and gas issues in isolation, and as such, its value is limited,"" said a spokesman at the company's headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands, who asked not to be identified per company policy. ""This report brings no new insights or analysis to help oil companies such as SPDC improve managing the issues of the Niger Delta,"" the Shell spokesman said. ""Instead, in parts it draws wide-ranging and superficial conclusions from a number of these deeply complex issues, offering little underlying analysis to support those conclusions."" SPDC is the Shell Petroleum Development Company, the national oil and gas company in Nigeria. Shell owns a 30-percent stake in the company while the Nigerian government owns 55 percent. The Niger Delta is a region in Nigeria consisting of nine oil-producing states. It has a land area of about 46,500 square miles (75,000 square km) -- about the same size as the Czech Republic or the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). An area of rich biological diversity, the region contains the world's third-largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest, according to the UNDP. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rainforest, the UNDP says. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says. Amnesty says the majority of people living in the Niger Delta depend on the natural environment for their food and livelihood, particularly through agriculture and fisheries. Shell said it is not responsible for some 80 percent of the pollution in the oil-rich area, because that pollution is the result of attacks and sabotage of Shell operations in the Niger Delta. ""Over the past four weeks alone we had eight attacks,"" he said. ""These attacks had a substantial impact on the environment, and assets, and most importantly for the people that live and work there."" About 85 percent of the oil spills from Shell operations are the result of attacks and sabotage, he said. Nigeria's main militant group, the Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on the region's oil infrastructure in recent months. MEND said Sunday it had attacked an offshore facility and that it was engulfed in flames. Last week, the group said it had destroyed a pipeline owned and operated by the Italian gas company Agip. Also last week, MEND claimed to have destroyed Shell's main trunk line in Bayelsa state and a Chevron oil station in the region. MEND demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be invested in the Niger Delta instead of enriching those whom the militants consider to be corrupt politicians. Last year, a series of MEND attacks forced Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as much as 40 percent. Amnesty's report acknowledged that armed groups and communities have worsened the pollution problem by vandalizing oil infrastructure or stealing oil, but it said the scale of the problem is not clear. Shell said plans are under way to deal with the problem of gas flaring, which happens when crude oil is brought to the surface along with the large volumes of gas that have been trapped with it. The gas used to be burned off safely in a process called flaring, but that process is now considered a waste of resources and revenue for the government, Shell says. A $3 billion program to reduce the gas flares has already been able to cut them by 30 percent, the company said. The Amnesty report also pointed the finger at governments and said they have failed to be held accountable for the situation of the people. The Niger Delta covers 185 different local government areas, according to the United Nations Development Program. ""The government must address the human impact of oil industry pollution,"" said Gaughran, of Amnesty. ""They have a duty to protect their citizens from human rights abuse or harm by businesses and they are failing in that duty."" Shell supports ""collaborative solutions"" between communities, governments, corporations and non-profit groups as the only way to address the problems listed in the Amnesty report, the spokesman said. ""The SPDC definitely shares Amnesty International's concern that the people in the Niger Delta haven't benefited from the extraction of the oil and gas as they should,"" the spokesman said, ""but this has been the opinion of the SPDC for a number of years.""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian officials on Monday located a Russian cargo ship that has been missing for more than two weeks after it was believed to have been hijacked, a top official said. The Arctic Sea had been missing since July 31. The Arctic Sea was located 300 miles (483 km) from Cape Verde, an island nation a few hundred miles from the coast of western Africa, said Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov. The crew ""is alive and well,"" he said. ""The crew members have been moved to our anti-submarine warfare ship Ladny where they are answering questions,"" Serdyukov said. ""The questioning aims to clarify all circumstances of how the ship disappeared and why did it not send any [emergency] signals."" The Arctic Sea, which sails under a Maltese flag, had not been heard from since July 31. It was carrying a 6,500-ton cargo of timber from Finland to Algeria when it reported trouble on July 24 off the coast of Sweden. It was scheduled to arrive in North Africa on August 4. On Friday, the ship was reported to be in international waters north of Cape Verde. The news came from Portugal's state news agency, which quoted Cape Verde's defense director, Pedro Reis. The U.S. military also had a report last week that the ship had been seen a few hundred miles from Cape Verde, two military sources told CNN, but the United States had no independent verification of those reports. The U.S. military was not involved in the search. At the time, Russia's ambassador to Cape Verde, however, denied that the Arctic Sea had been spotted near the island nation. On July 24, the ship's 15-member crew had told authorities that eight to 12 people armed with guns and pistols boarded the vessel about 3 a.m. that day, masked and wearing uniforms with the word ""police"" written on them, the Malta Maritime Authority said. ""During [the attackers'] stay onboard, the members of the crew were allegedly assaulted, tied, gagged and blindfolded and some of them were seriously injured,"" the maritime authority said in a written statement. Swedish police reached the ship by phone on July 31 and spoke with someone they believe to be the captain, police spokeswoman Maria Lonegard said. It was the last known communication with the vessel, which was believed to be off the coast of France at that time. On Saturday Finnish police told CNN that a ransom demand had been issued to the ship's owners, Solchart Management, for the return of the vessel.","Missing cargo ship Arctic Star found weeks after disappearing .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Gunmen shot and killed 17 patients and wounded two others in a drug rehabilitation center in northern Mexico late Wednesday, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez said Thursday. Police gather at the rehab facility where 17 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, late Wednesday. Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said authorities believe a rival drug gang attacked the men at the El Aviane rehab facility. ""At the very least, it was one organized crime group thinking that another group was operating in that place,"" Reyes told CNN. Wednesday night's shootings, he said, are similar to an attack at a drug facility in March that left 20 patients dead. A Mexican civic group said last week that Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, had the most slayings per capita in 2008 of any city in the world.  Watch scene at rehab center after shootings » . More than 1,420 people have been killed in Juarez this year, Reyes told CNN on Monday. About 1,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2008, Reyes said. The latest Juarez killings came on the same day that gunmen shot dead the No. 2 security official and three others in Michoacan, the home state of Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Jose Manuel Revuelta Lopez, the deputy public safety secretary of Mexico's Michoacan state, was killed in a shootout that also claimed the lives of two of his bodyguards and a bystander caught in the crossfire, said Jesus Humberto Adame Ortiz, spokesman for the state. Revuelta was leaving his office at 5:15 p.m. in the state capital, Morelia, when the shooting occurred, Adame said. An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since Calderon declared war on drug cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. More than 11,000 people have since died, about 1,000 of them police. The offensive against the government has been especially fierce in Michoacan. In July, La Familia Michoacana drug cartel was accused of assaults in a half-dozen cities across the state and of torturing and killing 12 off-duty federal agents and dumping their bodies on a remote road. That violence was thought to have been retaliation for the arrest of a La Familia leader. In Juarez, much of the violence is being committed by the rival Sinaloa and Juarez drug cartels, which are fighting for lucrative routes into the United States as well as local street sales, Reyes said. The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, he said. In the past 45 days, 10 percent of those killed in Juarez had been deported from the United States in the past two years, Reyes said. ""We don't have the statistics to know if they were criminals from the United States or not,"" he told CNN. ""We know they were deported from the U.S. Most of them come from U.S. jails. They end up in the city of Juarez, and that's a problem generated for us, but also for the United States."" Most deportees are simply Mexicans who crossed the border illegally, but some hardened criminals get involved with the gangs, which have networks in the United States, Reyes said. According to a report released last week by the Mexican Citizens Council for Public Security watchdog group, Juarez had an estimated rate of 130 killings per 100,000 people. The city has a population of around 1.5 million. By comparison, the homicide rate in New Orleans, Louisiana, the deadliest city in the United States in 2008, was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents, based on preliminary FBI figures. CNN's Arthur Brice and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: Ciudad Juarez mayor says authorities believe drug gang attacked rehab center .

"(CNN) -- Fate, police say, saved baby Grace from being tossed out with the trash. Baby Grace was born aboard a Pacific Blue flight to New Zealand from Samoa. Were it not for a cleaning lady who chanced upon the newborn waving a feeble arm from a blue trash bag in an airplane bathroom, Grace would have met the fate her mother apparently intended for her, authorities said. On Wednesday, police in New Zealand charged the 29-year-old woman with abandonment and assault -- for giving birth to the child on an international flight and then leaving her, without alerting anyone, in a toilet bin amid bloodied paper towels. The woman, whose name was not released, faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. The case has made headlines in the island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The woman is a kiwi fruit picker who was returning from Samoa when she walked off a Pacific Blue flight in Auckland on Thursday, reported the New Zealand Press Association, a cooperative of the country's newspapers. Watch more on incident . About 20 minutes later, a cleaning lady discovered the baby in a restroom inside the Boeing 737. Her fellow custodians wrapped the baby in a blanket and handed her to authorities. About the same time, police spotted the mother in the airport, ""looking pale and bloodstained"" after she said she had mislaid her passport, said TV New Zealand, a CNN affiliate. Su'a William Sio, a Kiwi lawmaker of Samoan descent, said cultural stigma and the shame of bearing a child out of wedlock were two reasons why a mother might abandon her child. ""This is mostly derived firstly by fear,"" he told the New Zealand Herald newspaper. ""Fear that they've done something wrong and fear of shame of the 'unmarried' mother bringing to the family."" Grace did not suffer significant injuries or long-term damage, police told reporters. She is in the care of government officials who are looking at long-term arrangements that would be best for her.","Woman, 29, gave birth to the baby girl on a flight from Samoa .

"NAZARETH, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Traveling through the rolling hills of Pennsylvania's farmland, one can almost hear the music of days gone by. The factory of C.F. Martin Guitars in Pennsylvania produces instruments used all over the world. The sounds of an old guitar seem fitting for the rustic buildings and small towns that you pass through. It's almost as if you're being drawn in, closer and closer to where the sound originates: C.F. Martin Guitars in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Walking through the front doors of the factory, nicely tucked into a residential neighborhood, the floors are shiny, the smell of ""newness"" in the air, but somehow it feels old. It feels like you're stepping into a part of history. And you have. Martin Guitars was established in 1833 when C.F. Martin, along with his family, immigrated to New York from Germany. Upon visiting some friends in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, the Martin family decided to trade in the hustle and bustle of New York for the open space and German heritage of rural Pennsylvania. The story of Martin Guitars is not just one of building acoustic instruments, but also one of family. The company has passed the business down from one Martin to the next. While many guitar makers have been sold to corporations, Christian Martin IV, the company's current owner, speaks of the responsibility he feels as the fourth-generation family owner. ""Although other guitar makers may have the name, and they certainly do appreciate the history and the heritage, in my case, it's in my blood."" Chris Martin describes the business as ""focused on one thing, and we don't get distracted easily."" The one thing is perfecting the art of guitar making, and, musicians say, Martin Guitars has done it better than most. Christian Martin says that what makes his family's line of guitars so popular is the firm belief that the ""guitar is really meant to complement the singer, not to overshadow the person playing it."" This idea has been the catalyst for some of America's most beloved singer/songwriters for choosing Martin Guitars. Among the artists who have chosen Martin Guitars as their ""tool"" are Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, David Crosby and John Mayer. Country music icons Hank Williams and Johnny Cash also were Martin men. ""You never know if six months from now Eric Clapton or somebody will be playing the guitar you just worked on,"" says George Molchany, a final inspector at Martin Guitars.  Watch how the guitars are crafted » . A tour of the new 84,000-square-foot factory is overwhelming, to say the least. Each stop on the tour is a mix between old and new, hands-on craftsmanship and machined process. The hand sanding of the body of a guitar has been replaced with a belt driven sander; the cutting of the edges of the guitar is done with a router that fills the building with so much noise it is often hard to hear the person talking right next to you. It's a sign that Martin Guitars has changed with the times. Automation has provided the company with more productivity, but if you look in certain corners of the factory, it is still a very hands-on process. ""It's tedious. Very much so,"" says Willard ""Buddy"" Silvius, a neck fitter at Martin who has been with the company for more than 43 years. ""You have to get the feel of the wood. You have to know exactly how much you have to chisel off to get the neck to where you want it to fit."" Chris Martin says that although the plant has been modernized to produce more guitars, ""there are factories in Asia that make as many guitars in one month as we do in one year."" According to Chris Martin, the reason that Martin Guitars has been able to hold off the effects of the troubled economy is because of detailed records that date back nearly two centuries. ""Every time we celebrated a 25th anniversary, within a year or two, the economy was in shambles. I use that as a way to communicate with my colleagues to say that 'the odds are that we're going to survive this one, too, because we've survived all the others.'"" Martin Guitars celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2008. He jokingly adds that ""within a year or two of our 200th anniversary, the economy's going to be in shambles."" There is a sense of community within the walls of the factory. Each station that you visit is one in which pride is a shared commodity mostly due to the fact that Martin Guitars employs more than 500 people locally. It's a place where it's hard to find someone who doesn't know your name and, furthermore, exactly what part of the guitar you're building. Perhaps it is that sense of heritage and community that makes Martin Guitars one of the premier guitar builders. It could be the responsibility of the family name, the desire for perfection on every instrument. What Chris Martin will tell you is that each instrument that comes out of the factory is unique. ""People choose Martins because they're reliable, they're durable, they have a richness of sound that most other guitars do not. I can't tell you the number of people that tell me the Martin guitar that they own is the best one we ever made.""","C.F. Martin Guitars has been producing instruments since 1833 .

"(CNN) -- The United States will withdraw another 4,000 troops in Iraq by the end of October, the U.S. military commander in Iraq said in prepared testimony for a congressional hearing Wednesday. The top military commander in Iraq says the U.S. is on track to end its combat mission in Iraq by next year. U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno is expected to tell the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee that there has been a significant drop in violence in Iraq recently, according to the statement obtained by CNN. President Obama has said the U.S. combat mission in Iraq will end by August 31, 2010. Obama also said he plans to keep a range of 35,000 to 50,000 support troops on the ground in Iraq after combat troops are out. ""We have approximately 124,000 troops and 11 Combat Teams operating in Iraq today. By the end of October, I believe we will be down to 120,000 troops in Iraq,"" Odierno said in the remarks. Odierno said statistics show violence has dropped in Iraq. ""Overall attacks have decreased 85 percent over the past two years from 4,064 in August 2007 to 594 in August 2009, with 563 in September so far,"" Odierno said. ""In that same time period, U.S. military deaths have decreased by 93 percent, Iraqi Security Force deaths have decreased 79 percent."" Odierno said there were still security questions. ""Although security is improving, it is not yet enduring. There still remain underlying, unresolved sources of potential conflict,"" Odierno said. Odierno pointed to the August 19 bombings in Baghdad that targeted the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs that killed more than 100 people as an example of ongoing challenges in Iraq. However, Odierno gave a vote of confidence to the Iraqi forces who had taken over security for Baghdad after U.S. forces handed over control. ""The Iraqis wanted to be in charge; they wanted the responsibilities; and they have demonstrated that they are capable,"" he said.","Thousands more troops in Iraq expected to return to U.S. in October .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The person who leaked British lawmakers' controversial expense claims earlier this year, triggering a national scandal, was motivated by outrage at apparent equipment shortages for British troops, a newspaper said Friday. The mole was angry at apparent equipment shortages for British troops deployed around the world. The mole was one of 20 people employed to process and censor the expenses claims before their scheduled official release in July, according to The Daily Telegraph. The man leaked the claims to the Telegraph, which printed them in a series of front-page articles in May. The articles brought public embarrassment to Parliament and even forced some lawmakers to resign. The 20 employees going through the claims were guarded by British soldiers to ensure nothing was leaked. The soldiers were working there in between tours of duty in order to earn extra money to pay for badly needed military equipment, the Telegraph said. One of the soldiers had taken on the temporary work to earn enough money to buy a lightweight Kevlar protective vest similar to the ones used by U.S. troops, while another soldier was trying to earn money for desert boots, gloves, and sunglasses, the Telegraph said. Hearing the soldiers' stories while at the same time looking through what were revealed as excessive claims made by lawmakers, prompted the mole to take action, the newspaper said. ""It's not easy to watch footage on the television news of a coffin draped in a Union Jack and then come in to work the next day and see on your computer screen what (members of Parliament) are taking for themselves,"" the mole told the Telegraph. ""Hearing from the serving soldiers about how they were having to work there to earn enough money to buy themselves decent equipment, while the MPs could find public money to buy themselves all sorts of extravagances, only added to the feeling that the public should know what was going on."" Watch report on what prompted outrage » . The Telegraph does not name the man who leaked the claims. He tells his story in a book, ""No Expenses Spared,"" released Friday about the scandal written by two Telegraph reporters. Speaking in the book, the mole says he is ""bloody glad"" he released the information, but is disappointed in the reaction from lawmakers so far. Controversial claims detailed by the newspaper included thousands of dollars' worth of interest on a mortgage that had already been paid, money spent to clean a moat on a country estate, and more than $1,000 spent on a small house on a pond for ducks. More than a dozen members of Parliament caught up in the scandal promised to step down in the next election. It led Prime Minister Gordon Brown to reshuffle his Cabinet and forced the speaker of the House of Commons to resign, the first time that had happened since 1695. Claims for allowances for second homes -- which most lawmakers have because they need to be in London for parliamentary business -- were a big point of controversy. The Telegraph exposed how some lawmakers ""flipped"" the designation of their main and second homes to avoid taxes or make big allowance claims. Many lawmakers defended their claims as being within the rules. But even where that was the case, the public criticized lawmakers for greed and for taking advantage. The reports forced the government to release the claims in June, a month earlier than planned. But unlike the information revealed by the Telegraph, the officially released documents were redacted, with key details blocked from view. Parliament said the edits were made to protect the security and privacy of lawmakers, their staffs and third parties. The issue of equipment shortages for British troops has been simmering for years. Some relatives of fallen soldiers have blamed their loved ones' deaths on a lack of proper gear in the battlefield. This month, the widow and father-in-law of Sjt. Paul McAleese, killed by a bomb in Afghanistan, said the soldier had voiced concerns about safety conditions at his base in Wishtan. The father-in-law, Stephen Minter, wrote a letter to Brown detailing what he believed to be a lack of equipment for British troops. In July, Sasha Buckley, the childhood sweetheart of Rifleman Daniel Hume, who was killed in Afghanistan, voiced the same concerns to the Daily Mail newspaper. ""The real tragedy is that he won't be the last soldier killed out there,"" she told the paper. ""There will be many more coming home unless the government give them the support they need. That means more equipment now -- soldiers like Dan deserve better."" The Ministry of Defence has maintained that soldiers are properly equipped. In a statement Friday, a ministry spokesman said providing the best equipment for British troops is the top priority. ""Every soldier who deploys to Afghanistan receives Osprey body armor and a Mark 6a helmet,"" the spokesman said in a statement. ""They also receive a black bag containing all their operational requirements. Valued at £3,500 ($5,600), it contains everything a soldier will need from boots and socks to camel backs (strap-on water bottles). Commanders now have a variety of helicopters, protected patrol vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and other key equipments at their disposal, and we are committed to ensuring that their needs are met, both in the short and long term. Since 2006, we have delivered equipment valued at more than 10 billion pounds ($16 billion) to the armed forces.""","Mole one of 20 people employed to process and censor MPs' expenses .

"(CNN) -- Iran's supreme leader on Sunday blasted U.S. plans to overhaul the setup for a missile defense shield in Europe, calling the Obama administration's intentions ""anti-Iranian,"" state-run media reported. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the U.S. president is following ""anti-Islamic and anti-Iranian"" policies. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also called Western concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions -- which Tehran says are only for energy purposes -- ""purely a fabrication by the United States,"" according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. ""This is something that is in the doctrine of anti-Iranianism, since the policy and the 30-year-old history of the Islamic Republic has proven that Iran wants to live in peace and under the spirit of equality and fraternity, with its Muslim neighbors and the rest of the world,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said. On Thursday, President Obama said the United States is significantly overhauling Bush-era plans for a missile defense shield in Europe, based partly on the latest analysis of Iran's offensive capabilities. The ""new missile defense architecture in Europe"" will be ready faster, work with existing technology and provide better missile defense than the program proposed by former President George W. Bush, Obama said. Obama said the change of gears was based on an ""updated intelligence assessment"" about Iran's ability to hit Europe with missiles. The Islamic republic's ""short- and medium-range"" missiles pose the most current threat, he said, and ""this new ballistic missile defense will best address"" that threat. Khamenei, speaking on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, a festive end to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, countered by comparing Obama to his predecessor. ""America, under its former president, spared no efforts against the Muslim world as well as against Iran,"" Khamenei said. ""Even the current administration -- with the apparently friendly words and messages -- follows that same anti-Islamic and anti-Iranian policy of the past."" The Bush-era proposal called for the United States to set up a radar site in the Czech Republic and 10 missile interceptors in Poland to counter the threat of Iran launching long-range missiles at America's allies in Europe. The new system will have ""hundreds"" of missile interceptors instead, a Pentagon official said last week. It also will have mobile radars, including some in space, ""that can move to wherever the threat actually emanates and wherever we feel we need to defend ourselves,"" said Gen. James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","New U.S. plan is ""anti-Iranian,"" Khamenei says, according to state-run media .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- An Italian mafia boss used his pet crocodile to threaten people and extort money, authorities said. The caiman was 1.1 meters long (3.6 feet), the Italian Forest Service said. Antonio Cristofaro kept the 40-kilogram (88-pound) reptile on a terrace of his home near Naples and fed it live rats and rabbits, according to LAV, an Italian animal rights group. Authorities discovered the animal during a search for weapons at Cristofaro's home, LAV said. The crocodile was found on September 18 but the news was only made public Wednesday, the group said. The crocodile was 1.1 meters long (3.6 feet), the Italian Forest Service said, and was capable of pulling off a man's limb with one bite. It lived atop Cristofaro's condominium in Caserta, less than an hour northeast of Naples, the Forest Service said. Cristofaro used the crocodile to intimidate people, notably entrepreneurs, to pay him more money, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. The crocodile is of a type known as a caiman, commonly found in Latin America. It is protected under the Washington Convention, which regulates the international trade of endangered animals, and is considered too dangerous to own as a pet, the Forest Service said. Police charged Cristofaro with illegal possession of animals, ANSA said. It was not clear whether he had been arrested. The Forest Service is now holding the reptile at an animal center near Rome, ANSA reported. Cristofaro, who the Forest Service said comes from a mafia family, already had a criminal record for weapons-related charges, resisting police, and extortion, ANSA reported. Authorities found a flak jacket during a search of Cristofaro's house, the Forest Service said. It was not the first time the Forest Service discovered an illegal crocodile at someone's home, the Forest Service said. In August 2008 in Naples, authorities found a 2-meter-long (6.5-foot-long) crocodile at the home of a man known for drug dealing, they said. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Italian mafia boss kept 40-kg reptile at his home near Naples to threaten people .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Claudette was gaining strength Sunday as it churned in the Gulf of Mexico toward the Florida Panhandle, the National Hurricane Center said. A satellite image from 2 p.m. ET Sunday shows a tropical storm nearing the Florida Panhandle. At 2 p.m. ET, Claudette's winds had picked up to near 50 mph, based on observations by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. The center of the storm was about 40 miles south of Apalachicola, Florida, and about 160 miles from Pensacola, the center said. It was moving at about 14 mph, putting it on course to hit land by Sunday evening. A tropical storm warning was in effect from the Alabama-Florida border east to the Suwannee River. A tropical storm warning means that weather conditions will likely deteriorate in the next 24 hours. The storm could bring 3 to 5 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 10 inches, and storm surges across portions of North Florida. Meanwhile, two other tropical storms were in the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday. Tropical Storm Ana was moving west but losing strength, forecasters said, while Tropical Storm Bill was gaining strength as it followed behind Ana. Ana was about 240 miles (385 kilometers) east of Dominica at 2 p.m. ET Sunday. It was expected to arrive at the Leeward Islands by late Sunday or early Monday, the center said. It was moving about 25 mph, and its maximum sustained winds were close to 40 mph, the center said. Tropical storm watches were in effect for Dominica, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemey. Tropical Storm Bill -- which could become a hurricane on Monday -- should be watched closely as it heads west-northwest in the Atlantic, possibly toward Florida, CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said. The storm was 1,555 miles east of the Lesser Antilles at 11 a.m. ET Sunday. Bill may reach Category 3 status as it bears down on the Leeward Islands Wednesday or Thursday, he said.","Tropical Storm Claudette's winds pick up to 50 mph .
