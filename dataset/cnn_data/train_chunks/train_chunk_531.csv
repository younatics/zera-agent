Sir Patrick Stewart has spoken of how he tried to protect his mother from the terrible beatings she suffered at the hands of his father. Stewart said the violence was so bad his mother Gladys would often be left 'bleeding on the floor' after his war-hero father Alf came home drunk. He and his brother Trevor would lay awake until their father returned from the pub so they would be ready to break up a fight. The actor, 72, said the stage became a 'refuge' from his home and he felt safer . acting than he did in his own house. Insight: Patrick Stewart discovered more about his father Alf in Who Do You Think You Are? and now believes he was shell-shocked . Protective: Patrick Stewart, pictured as a baby with his mother Gladys, would try and intervene when his father became violent . When the rows were at their worst, the two children would . have to run to the phone box to call the police but Stewart said . officers never treated the matter seriously. Even when they came to the family's one-up one-down home in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, the police still did not take action. He told The Independent on . Sunday that policemen would tell his mother it needed two people to create an argument or blamed her for upsetting her husband. Stewart said: 'Which is a . way of saying he must have been justified to be violent, and we know . there is no justification for being violent. None whatsoever.' He said he used acting as a way of escaping the terror at home. The X-Men star credits his English teacher Cecil Dormand with starting his career by putting him a play at the age of 12. He said: 'The first time that I walked on stage in my school dining hall I felt safer than I had ever felt in my life. Looking back, the reason I was always so comfortable on stage - the reason I have never had stage fright in my life - is because the stage is where I live.' Since finding fame on the British stage and on screen, Stewart has raised awareness on domestic violence and supports the charity Refuge. He said the work is for his mother as she had nowhere to turn and the domestic violence charity would have given her 'an option or a choice'. Stewart participated in a memorable Who Do You Think You Are in an attempt to understand what lay behind his father's violence. First love: Stewart achieved worldwide fame in roles such as Star Trek's Jean-Luc Piccard, left, but has since returned to Britain to concentrate on the theatre in roles such as Macbeth, right . The actor now believes he suffered shell-shock and became increasingly bitter when his career declined following the war. But despite this insight, the vivid memories of the violence remain. Stewart said even as a child he was able to judge when a fight between his parents had got so bad that he had to intervene and put his body in between his parents. He said: 'Now, it is really sad when a child becomes an expert on those kind of issues.' After rising through the threatre ranks, Stewart found worldwide fame in America through his role as Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek. But he returned to Britain in 2004 to nurture his first love and saviour from his childhood home - the stage - and said the past eight years have been the happiest of his life.","Actor tried to intervene during vicious rows between mother and father .

The new version of Apple's iTunes has just been released after a series of delays - but some are asking whether the music player may have had its day. iTunes 11 is said to be one of the biggest steps forward the software has ever made, and its revamped design and new features have largely received rave reviews. However, critics have pointed out that the programme is unable to access streaming music online, and suggested that this could harm the firm in the battle against newer services such as Spotify and Pandora. Scroll down for video . New look: The iTunes re-design has been widely hailed as a massive step forward . Mini-player: The programme offers an unobtrusive way to listen to music while doing other things . The tech giant's flagship media software has come a long way since its launch as a simple music playback system in 2001. It is now the hub which controls devices such as iPods, iPhones and iPads, and is used to access Apple's huge store of music, video and e-books for sale online. Previous versions of iTunes have come under fire over the last few years for being increasingly slow and difficult to use - but version 11, released on Thursday, apparently remedies many of those flaws. Reviewers at top tech websites praised the software's overhaul - Gizmodo described it as 'lightning quick', while TechCrunch said it 'feels new and looks great'. Mode: It is now easier to browse around the music of any one artist . Multiple devices: But iTunes 11 does not allow users to access music streaming services . In the new era of cloud computing, iTunes 11 is closely integrated with Apple's online services. The programme encourages users to download music instantly from artists they already listen to, automatically uploads files to Apple's iCloud service and enables you to keep your place in any book, podcast or video even when switching devices. But it has no capacity to access the nearly infinite libraries of streaming music which millions of web users now depend upon - and some say that could prove a fatal flaw for the future of iTunes. Services like Spotify, Pandora and Rdio all give users the ability to listen to a collection of music far larger than any single person would ever be able to download, for the price of a monthly subscription. Their popularity has even led some music fans to dump their own collection altogether - making iTunes completely redundant. Multimedia: Apple hopes to persuade users not to confine themselves to accessing music with the software . New logo: Apple has stream-lined the icon it uses to represent iTunes . So the fact that Apple provides no capability for users to unite streaming music with a permanent collection could be its fatal flaw, according to some experts. Gizmodo boss Joe Brown tweeted: 'iTunes 11 installed, and. uh... I don't have any locally stored music anymore. All on @rdio and @spotify.' While web designer Jason Schuller quipped: 'iTunes 11 installed, opened, closed... back to Spotify.' There are rumours that iTunes is set to add internet radio stations, which would be personalised to users' individual tastes, but until they launch them the service could have trouble finding a foothold in the fast-changing media landscape.","Venerable music player could be beaten by Spotify and Pandora .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:42 EST, 1 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:42 EST, 2 December 2012 . A Marine who guarded Bradley Manning has denied intimidating the Army private while he was held in a brig after being arrested for allegedly sending U.S. secrets to WikiLeaks in the biggest security breach in American history. Jonathan Cline recounted an incident where Manning had an apparent anxiety attack while being escorted to a recreation area - but said his own behaviour had nothing to do with the breakdown, adding that he was surprised to be told that 'we intimidated him or something like that'. However, he also admitted that guards had become annoyed when a protest in Manning's favour stopped them returning home on time, though another guard insisted this had not changed the way they treated the prisoner. The defense claims the nine months Manning - who is charged with sending U.S. secrets to WikiLeaks in the biggest security breach in American history - spent in virtual isolation, sometimes without clothing, amounted to illegal pretrial punishment. His turn on the stand: Bradley Manning seen arriving at a courthouse at military base Fort Meade, Maryland before testifying about the treatment he received during his two-years in prison . Manning and his attorneys want all the charges dismissed. Cline testified on the fifth day of a pretrial hearing at Fort Meade, near Baltimore. He was called as a prosecution witness to talk about a Jan. 18, 2011, incident in which Manning hid behind an exercise machine and wept after he was scolded by another guard for failing to respond properly to a command. Later that day, the brig commander, Chief Warrant Officer 4 James Averhart, added 'suicide risk' to Manning's maximum-custody conditions. That was after they had what Manning described as a heated argument about the incident. Cline testified that some brig workers were annoyed that a pro-Manning protest a day earlier had closed Quantico's main gate, forcing them to take alternate routes home. Goal: Manning is trying to avoid trial in the WikiLeaks case by arguing he was punished enough when he was locked up alone in a small cell for nearly nine months at a brig in Quantico, Virginia, and had to sleep naked for several nights . Cline said he wasn't personally affected . by it. Defense attorney David Coombs has implied the guards took out . their irritation on Manning by bullying him. Cline and another former guard, Marine Lance Cpl. Joshua Tankersly, both testified that except for the Jan. 18 incident, Manning was always compliant and respectful. Another former brig worker, Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. William Fuller, testified that Manning was often uncommunicative and withdrawn, possibly signaling a suicide risk. Fuller testified that before Jan. 18, he had considered recommending to Averhart that Manning be removed from 'prevention-of-injury,' or POI, status because of his improved behavior. Manning was on either POI or even more restrictive 'suicide risk' status during his entire stay at Quantico in maximum custody. His behavior Jan. 18 'gave us cause for concern,' Fuller said. 'That kind of reset things, unfortunately.' The noose: This artist rendering shows Army Pfc. Bradley Manning being shown a bedsheet as he testified in his pretrial Wikileaks hearing . Manning was at Quantico from July 2010 . to April 2011. Then he was moved to pretrial confinement at Fort . Leavenworth, Kan. He has been held in medium custody since arriving . there. The 24-year-old native of Crescent, Okla., worked as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010. He is charged with 22 offenses, including aiding the enemy and violating federal espionage and computer security laws. He could get life in prison. He is accused of sending to the website WikiLeaks more than 250,000 diplomatic cables, classified memos, Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, Guantanamo Bay prison records and a 2007 video clip of a U.S. helicopter crew gunning down 11 men. It was later determined that one of those men was a news photographer. The Pentagon said its troops mistook camera equipment for weapons. Taking the stand on Thursday, Manning said that he lost all hope when he was detained for weeks in a segregation tent in Camp Arifjan, an Army installation in Kuwait where he was stationed. Smile: Manning was decidedly more excited when he appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday (pictured) Manning said he remembers thinking 'I'm going to die, I'm stuck inside this cage.' Wearing his dress uniform, he appeared . nervous, stuttering over his words as he tried to answer questions from . a defense attorney about his arrest in Baghdad in May 2010. He was . testifying only about his arrest and confinement and not about how he . leaked classified documents to Wikileaks. Seated . in the witness booth, he swiveled back and forth and gestured with his . hands as he described the layout of his confinement quarters overseas. 'I was in a pretty stressed situation...I was getting very little information' from his attorney while he was being held, he said, noting that he felt increasingly ‘hopeless’. 'I had pretty much given up. My world had just shrunk,' Manning said, explaining how he had suicidal thoughts while being held by authorities. Manning is trying to avoid trial in the WikiLeaks case by arguing he was punished enough when he was locked up alone in a small cell for nearly nine months at a brig in Quantico, Virginia, and had to sleep naked for several nights. Controversial: Supporters stood outside the Maryland military courthouse where he was due to appear Tuesday . 'I totally started to fall apart,' the 24-year-old said. The . military contends the treatment was proper, given Manning's . classification then as a maximum-security detainee who posed a risk of . injury to himself or others. Earlier . Thursday, a military judge accepted the terms under which Manning would . plead guilty to eight charges for sending classified documents to the . secret-spilling WikiLeaks website. Colonel Denise Lind's ruling doesn't mean the pleas have been formally accepted. That could happen in December. But Lind approved the language of the offenses to which Manning would admit. She said those offenses carry a total maximum prison term of 16 years. Manning made the offer as a way of accepting responsibility for the leak. Make or break: If a judge rules he was tortured then the entire trial could be abandoned, though that is not expected to happen . Government officials have not said whether they would continue prosecuting him for the other 14 counts he faces, including aiding the enemy. That offense carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Under the proposal, Manning would admit to willfully sending the following material: a battlefield video file, some classified memos, more than 20 Iraq war logs, more than 20 Afghanistan war logs and other classified materials. He would also plead guilty to wrongfully storing classified information. Meanwhile, Manning's lawyers are arguing that the charges against the soldier should be dismissed because of how he was treated while confined at Quantico. Other prospective witnesses include a military psychiatrist who examined Manning at Quantico, and the former commander of the confinement facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Manning was later moved there, re-evaluated and given a medium-security classification.","Comes days after Manning testified about the treatment he received both in Kuwait holding area and once he returned to Virginia in the U.S.

Gary Rintel loved his collie Astro so much he cloned him into two more pooches - and now neighbors claim the duplicate doggies are running wild over Manhattan's Upper West Side. Area residents complain the dogs are left to roam Central Park without a leash, and are prone to attacking people. Though there's a leash law in New York City, Rintel - who also turned his beloved dog into a fur hat - admits he doesn't pay it any heed and has paid $2,000 in tickets over the last year as he often lingers a block behind the dogs on walks. Double trouble: Gary Rintel is seen walking his cloned dogs Retro and Cosmo towards Central Park without a leash amid residents' complaints that the dogs are prone to attack people . Law: Rintel told reporters he doesn't care about the Central Park leash law and is happy to let his collie's run free . 'This . is a tragedy waiting to happen,' said an unidentified man who told the New York Post the dogs . charged at his puppy and bit his him. 'The city knows about this . problem and does nothing. The law has no teeth, so to speak.' Central Park mandates that dogs be on leashes between 9am and 9pm. Rintel, who made a hat out of Astro's fur after the dog passed away in 2006, does not care. 'If you were a dog, would you want to live with a rope around your . neck?' he asked. 'I don’t think most people care about their . dogs’ happiness. Sometimes I’m guilty of breaking that law.' Rintel regularly takes the collies for three-hour walks through the park to chase after rats and squirrels. Would this face hurt you? Residents say two cloned collies are biting people in Central Park (file photo) Cloned: The first commercially cloned dogs were announced at National Seoul University in 2009, shortly before Rintel paid $140,000 to clone his beloved Asto . Calling himself a trust-fund layabout and a single writer, Rintel made headlines on a reality show about his love of Astro, a short-haired collie/great Pyrenees mix. Rintel paid paid $140,000 four years ago for a lab to insert Astro's frozen DNA into a donor egg to be placed into a surrogate. 40 months later, Cosmo and Retro were born. Their master may love them, but so far he's the only one. 'The . second I see that guy, I make sure to cross the street,' said Jarrod . Mittan, 29. 'He ignores his dogs as they’re bounding down the sidewalk, . and he screams at them as though they understand what he’s saying.' 'They look like lions in the jungle. They roam free,' one unnamed super complained. 'We . call them the clones,' said a dog owner who claims Cosmo and Retro . attacked his black Lab puppy in Central Park. He said that when he tried to break it up, one of the clones bit his hand. Send in the clones: Five puppies were cloned from Trakr, a German Shepherd search-and-rescue dog in 2009 . In that case at least, Rintel supposedly apologized. 'The . guy said to me, ‘I’m sorry, my dogs have never done anything like that . before,’' the victim said. 'Then he walked away — with the dogs . still off the leash!' Even Rintel's former dog-walker, Melinda Pillon, said once the malicious mutts were off the leash she saw them bite a cyclist. Despite the complaints Rintel called them 'good boys' and said the walker wasn’t . paying attention. He also denied that the Labrador’s owner had been bitten. 'It seems like dirty pool to manufacture an incident . just because you’re upset my dog jumped on yours,' he said. 'They’re not threatening or . dangerous dogs.

A young boy with a rare lung disease has run around with his pet dog for the first time, after a student designed a lightweight backpack for his vital oxygen supply. Lenny Yule, 11, from Linwood, . Renfrewshire, has interstitial lung disease which has scarred his organs. He has to carry around a . tank of liquid oxygen when away from home in case he is short of breath. His original bag was designed to be used by older patients and restricted his movement as it was far too large for him. Lenny from Linwood, Renfrewshire, now enjoys running with his dog, thanks to his redesigned backpack . Hannah Jenkins fits the rucksack on Lenny. It was designed to prevent it swinging side to side when he runs . Design student Hannah Jenkins, 21, came up with a solution to . Lenny's problem after his problem was flagged up by Yorkhill Children's Hospital to the company 4c Design where she was interning. Using a commercially available bag which is more size-appropriate for Lenny, she included padded, flexible straps for a comfortable fit and hidden straps in a back pocket which allow the backpack to be hung from a larger school bag and side straps to prevent side-to-side movement. Miss Jenkins also put velcro over the Helios oxygen tank to prevent movement when the bag is worn while running and a front pocket to store tubing which connects to the tank. 'The straps on the backpack that Lenny was having to use were too long to fit his frame,' the Glasgow School of Art student said. 'So the oxygen tank hit off of his lower back as he ran and it swayed from side to side. This made playing football, running around with his pet dog and even walking to school very uncomfortable.' The backpack included padded, flexible straps for a comfortable fit and hidden straps in a back pocket which allow the backpack to be hung from a larger school bag . Lenny’s mother Edel said: 'Lenny loved being involved with the design process for the new backpack and his ideas and suggestions where taken on board. Hannah was very patient with him and gave him what he wanted and needed with a new lightweight comfortable bag. 'We have always insisted that Lenny be active and we would never let having an oxygen tank stop him living a full and healthy lifestyle. 'He no longer has to take the backpack off to play football or be on his scooter, both of which would have previously involved a lot of bumping around with the old bag, and this means he can do these activities for longer. 'Lenny is a very confident boy and this backpack means that he can shine just that little bit more.The kindness of all the team at 4c and all the hard work that Hannah has put in is amazing and they have made our boy have one less thing to worry about in his life. We could never thank them enough.' Lenny’s family are involved with the charity Child Lung Foundation which raises awareness of rare lung diseases as well as supporting the families of children affected. The blueprint for Miss Jenkins’s design will be given to the foundation so it can create backpacks for other children who need to carry oxygen. Robin Smith, from Glasgow-based 4c Design, said: 'We had become aware of Lenny’s situation through the strong connection we have built with Yorkhill Children’s Hospital for whom we had done some charitable work in the past. 'Given the rareness of Lenny’s condition it was not possible for the NHS to create a piece of equipment specifically for him, so we were delighted to take on the challenge.'","Lenny's original bag was designed to be used by older patients and restricted his movement as it was far too large for him .

Amanda Knox's much anticipated tell-all memoir of the four years she spent in an Italian jail for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher will be published on April 30th next year according to publisher HarperCollins. Titled 'Waiting to be Heard', the book will allow the 25-year-old the opportunity to give her version of the story which made international headlines on both sides of the Atlantic and which she reportedly received $4 million for. Acquitted of the brutal 2007 murder of Kercher along with her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito in 2011, Knox is pictured on the front cover in an intense, unsmiling pose which was taken earlier this year. The cover design of 'Waiting to be Heard' which will be released on April 30th 2013 . The murder made headlines around the world and the pair were famously photographed kissing and cuddling outside the scene of the crime - and in the ensuing trial Knox was portrayed as man-hungry earning her the moniker 'Foxy Knoxy'. The book deal was announced in February of last year after months of intense negotiations and battling between 20 publishers, eager to sign up the former language student to tell of her ordeal in the Italian justice system. At the time, the deal was said to distress the family of Meredith Kercher, the British student who lived with Knox in Perugia and who was found in a pool of blood on their apartment floor on November 2nd 2007.

According to HarperCollins, 'Knox will give a full and unflinching account of the events that led to her arrest in Perugia,' said a spokesman for the publishing giant. The same spokesman added that Knox will speak about her 'struggles with the complexities of the Italian judicial system' and will include excerpts from journals that she kept in prison. ‘Knox will talk about her harrowing experience at the hands of the Italian police and later prison guards and inmates,’ said the spokesman. HarperCollins is promising she will ‘reveal never before-told details surrounding her case’ about ‘the most challenging time of her young life’. The mammoth payday for Knox was negotiated by Washington attorney Robert Barnett, who has worked for President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush.

The company should be able to recoup some of its investment by selling TV interview rights on the back of the book. Broadcasters are banned from paying for interviews but they routinely get around it by buying the rights to the interviewee’s book instead.

Innocent: U.S. citizen Amanda Knox, left, and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, of Italy, outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead (file photo) That was a fictionalised account of Nicole Brown Simpson's murder that was cancelled in 2006 by HarperCollins in response to public outrage. After Casey Anthony was cleared last year of killing her two-year-old daughter, several publishers said they would not consider a book by her. ‘I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody,’ a publisher who had no intention of bidding on the story told the New York Times earlier this month. ‘It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way.’ 'Waiting to be Heard' will come out two months later than originally scheduled. The date was changed out of deference to a court in Italy that scheduled a March 25th hearing for the prosecution's appeal of the former exchange student's acquittal in the 2007 murder of her British roommate. Italian prosecutor Giovanni Galati has said he is ‘very convinced’ that Sollecito and Knox were responsible for Miss Kercher's death in November 2007. But the Italian appeals court in October said the guilty verdicts against the pair were not corroborated by any evidence. It added that the court hadn't proven they were in the house when Miss Kercher was killed. Tears in court: Amanda Knox after being acquitted last year . A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate trial of sexually assaulting and stabbing Miss Kercher. His 16-year sentence, reduced in appeal from an initial 30 years, was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010. In September, Raffaele Sollecito released his own book in which he detailed how he had sex with former girlfriend Amanda Knox the first night they met. Italian Sollecito, 28, was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher, but the pair were freed last October after their convictions were overturned due to a lack of evidence. In Honour Bound: My Journey To Hell And Back With Amanda Knox, the bespectacled computer studies graduate reveals his true feelings for the 25-year-old blonde American, who he met just a week before tragic Meredith was found semi naked and with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her house. He also describes the moment he met Knox again for the first time after they were sensationally cleared of the murder last year due to a lack of evidence - after spending four years in jail and being convicted in 2009. Dressed down: Amanda Knox and her boyfriend James Terrano wear casual clothes for their romantic stroll in Seattle, Washington earlier this year . Sollecito said: 'I wasn't just nervous about setting eyes on her again. I felt I was suffering from some sort of associative disorder, in which it became difficult for me to focus on my genuine and continuing fondness for Amanda without being overwhelmed by an instinctive, involuntary revulsion at everything the courts and the media had thrown at her. 'Two different Amandas - the real one, and the distorted, she-devil version I had read about and seen on television nonstop for four years seemed somehow blurred in my unconscious mind.' Knox and Sollecito were held by police just five days after the 2007 murder because of their odd behaviour - initially they could not remember clearly what they were doing as they had been smoking marijuana the night of the killing and detectives watched in amazement as the pair kissed and cuddled in front of Meredith's grief stricken friends while they waited to be interviewed. Comfortable: The pair reportedly share an apartment in Seattle's Chinatown . Knox performed cartwheels in the police station and sat on Sollecito's lap - and they were also later filmed buying lingerie, the American promising her boyfriend she would wear it later while they had 'wild sex.' In his book Sollecito admits their behaviour was 'odd' but at the same time he hits out at the sloppy police investigation which was so crucial in clearing them after experts revealed at the appeal evidence was unreliable as it had been poorly handled and was contaminated. He admitted they also had no real alibi as the couple were smoking marijuana the night of the murder and they only had 'each other' to explain what they were doing the night of the killing. And in April, John Kercher, the father of Meredith said that the media's attention was all on Amanda Knox and not his daughter, the real victim . 'The media’s glare throughout the trial and appeal process has been fixed almost entirely on Amanda Knox. Books have been written about her and there has even been a television film focusing on her. It has seemed as if Meredith has been all but forgotten.' Since November last year, Knox has been dating James Terrano and the couple were reported to still be going strong together this fall.","Book will be released on April 30th 2013 by publisher HarperCollins .

Not one person was shot, stabbed or slashed in New York on Monday - the first time in living memory such low figures have been recorded in the city in one day. New York is on course for its lowest murder rate in more than 50 years after a range of initiatives have helped cut gun crime. Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne, the New York Police Department's spokesman, told the New York Daily News he could not remember the last time no one was shot or stabbed in one day. He said: 'Nice way to start the week.' Search: An armed plan-clothes detective searches a suspect in New York. The controversial stop and frisk policy has been credited with falling murder rates (file picture) While, no one was deliberately shot in that time, a 16-year-old did have to go to hospital on Monday evening after accidentally shooting himself in his right thigh. But police later determined the teen accidentally shot himself and was not involved in a crime. A total of 472 murders were reported in New York last year. That has fallen to 366 so far this year, which experts called an 'almost impossible figure'. However, it is still high when compared to London, which has a similar population size of about 8.1 million. Last year, there were just 117 homicides in the capital. In New York about five people are shot a day but that number has dropped significantly since 1994 when 4,967 people were shot in the year - or almost 14 a day. NYPD historian Tom Reppetto said in 1990 2,245 murders were reported in New York. Critics: The stop and frisk policy has proved controversial. In June, thousands of people took to the streets to protest against what they see as the unfair targeting of black and Latino residents, pictured . He told New York Daily News: 'There were shootings galore. We lived in a town where people were afraid to come out of their houses, where babies slept in bathtubs to avoid getting shot, where nursery schools ran drills - 'When you hear the shots, drop down. 'They're going to come in with the fewest number of murders since about 1960. It's an almost impossible figure, but their programmes have been fabulously successful in stopping crime.' Among the police initiatives credited with tackling crime is stop and frisk, which the New York Daily News reports has led to criminals carrying knives instead of guns because it carries a lesser penalty. However, the policy has proved controversial. In June, thousands of protestors marched silently through the city to demonstrate against stop and frisk, which organisers say unfairly targets black and Latino residents. New York's shooting and stabbing-free streak lasted until 11.20am on Tuesday when a 27-year-old man was shot in Brooklyn at 11.20am. It was the first shooting in the city since Sunday shortly before 10.30pm when a man suffered gunshot wounds to the head.","New York Police Department spokesman said first time they can remember such low figures in one day .

Nicolas Sarkozy has been called in to stop France’s right-wing opposition descending into civil war. Yesterday, the former president met Francois Fillon, one of the two men locked in an increasingly vicious dispute over who will succeed him as leader of the conservative UMP. Mr Fillon is mounting a legal challenge to rival Jean-Francois Cope’s razor-thin victory. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy (right) leaves his car in Paris after a lunch meeting with his former Prime Minister Francois Fillon . The meeting came hours after Alain . Juppe, a centre-right veteran and former prime minister, abandoned his . bid to mediate a solution following fruitless talks with the warring UMP . rivals and said Sarkozy could be the party's last hope. The dispute, described by conservative daily Le Figaro as 'live suicide', threatens to tear apart a party whose mission when founded a decade ago was to tie together the centrist and harder right factions that Fillon and Cope stand for. 'It seems clear that (Sarkozy) is the only person today with enough authority to propose a solution where I cannot see one,' Juppe told RTL radio. 'It's in his hands.' Two-thirds of UMP supporters want Sarkozy to run in the 2017 presidential election despite his vow to quit politics when he lost power in May, and analysts see the current feud increasing the chances of his staging a comeback. Fillon, who was prime minister under Sarkozy but has a more centrist stance, made no comment as he arrived for their talks. Cope, a disciple of Sarkozy with hardline views on issues like immigration, told BFM television that Fillon's decision to take legal action was the wrong way to end the quarrel.

Newly-elected French President Francois Hollande acknowledges his supporters at Place de la Bastille, Paris, after victory over Mr Sarkozy . The botched contest to find a successor . to Sarkozy, which descended into chaos as both camps accused each other . of ballot-stuffing, has made a laughing stock of a party that held the . presidency for a decade until the Socialists' May election win. It is turning into a boon for President Francois Hollande as he grapples with a flatlining economy and slumping ratings. 'It is hard to see how the UMP continues as a party after this,' Arthur Goldhammer, an expert at the Centre for European Studies at Harvard University, wrote in his French politics blog. 'Clearly this is a saga that will not play out in a day.' The debacle has exposed a deep split over the party's gradual shift to the right on issues such as immigration and religion that could now reshape the political landscape. 'This bad soap opera has to end because democracy needs an operational opposition.' Socialist Party on Twitter . At worst, analysts predict a break-up of a party that former President Jacques Chirac founded to keep the right on a centrist path set by General Charles de Gaulle after World War Two. Even if the party can hold together, the feud risks distracting the UMP for months from its role as the main opposition party, benefiting both the left and the far-right ahead of local elections in 2014. 'This bad soap opera has to end because democracy needs an operational opposition,' the Socialist Party said in a tweet. Le Figaro urged Fillon and Cope in a front-page editorial to 'stop the massacre' and said the 'pitiful spectacle' of their week-long sparring was an insult to politics. Hollande had been due to meet Cope, as UMP leader, on Monday to discuss institutional changes but the meeting was postponed after Cope rejected Juppe's suggestion of forming a new, more neutral, committee to determine the result of the Nov. 18 vote. The UMP appeals committee was due to give its latest verdict on Monday or Tuesday on the vote, which Cope says he won by 98 votes out of nearly 175,000 cast. Fillon says he would have won by 26 votes had about 1,000 overseas ballots not been excluded. Juppe said it was possible the UMP could hold a fresh vote, an idea backed by 71 percent of the public according to an opinion poll published in the weekly Journal du Dimanche on Sunday. Cope said the idea made no sense. Cope, who has said he would put his presidential ambitions on hold if Sarkozy decided to run in 2017, also said he believed his mentor had no intention of interfering in the vote.","Crisis threatens to tear Sarkozy's conservative opposition party apart .

Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici has insisted the government's plan to reduce unemployment and restore growth would bear fruit . France's government has shrugged off the latest downgrade of its credit rating, saying that it just needs time for reforms to the sluggish economy to take root. In a setback for President Francois Hollande's Socialist administration, Moody's Investors Service stripped Europe's second largest economy of it of its prized AAA credit rating yesterday over concerns that its rigid labour market and exposure to Europe's financial crisis were threatening its prospects for economic growth. This is the second ratings downgrade to have hit France this year: Standard & Poor's agency lowered its score in January. The third leading agency, Fitch, still ranks France at the AAA-rating but warned it could still be downgraded. Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici insisted that France's credibility remains strong and that the government's plan to reduce unemployment and restore growth would bear fruit. France has come under scrutiny as its £1.6trillion economy has stagnated, with many leading French companies laying off workers. Meanwhile, Hollande has struggled to reassure economists that his attempts to revive the French economy will be successful. Hollande's administration has laid out a series of deficit-reduction targets, vowing to bring it in line with European rules next year. It has also unveiled a plan to improve the competitiveness of its economy, by giving companies £18billion in tax rebates, reducing red tape for businesses, and providing small companies with extra support to compete abroad. However, many economists say that the greatest threat to France's economy is its stringent labour rules, which make firing difficult and expensive and thus deter hiring. The country has been losing global business for years to more dynamic economies like China's, while fighting unemployment of 10.8per cent and concerns about the future of the eurozone. The French government is currently leading negotiations between businesses and unions in the hopes of reforming labour rules by the end of the year. Moscovici pleaded for time today, arguing that the government had inherited a difficult economic and budgetary situation from former President Nicolas Sarkozy. He said the government is convinced it is now on the right path but that its reforms just need to take effect. 'It takes time to reverse the flow of things. It takes courageous decisions, and that's what we're promising to do,' he told reporters. To the ratings agencies, critics and investors, he said: 'Judge us on our results.' Issue: France has been losing global business for years . to more dynamic economies like China's, while fighting unemployment of . 10.8per cent and concerns about the future of the eurozone . France and Germany, which underpin the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro, have taken the lead in finding solutions to the continent's debt crisis. Any slip in France's clout could endanger its ability to lead negotiations. In an early sign of how the rating could affect the eurozone ability to solve its financial crisis, its bailout fund was forced to cancel a bond auction today. Officials with the European Financial Stability Facility said the downgrade caused a technical problem since the EFSF's rating is now higher than that of France, which is a major backer of the fund. EFSF CFO Christophe Frankel did not say how the glitch would be resolved but said he thought it was a possibility. The EFSF has been replaced by the European Stability Mechanism, but is still handling the bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Moscovici also insisted that relations with Germany remained strong. There have been reports recently that Germany is concerned about the health of the French economy. But German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble seemed unconcerned about the downgrade. 'We have received the news that, overnight, our most important partner got a little admonition from a rating agency,' Schaeuble said in the German Parliament. 'The rating for France is still very stable, so that we avoid any dramatisation.' Many leading French companies have laid off workers as the economy stagnates. Here union workers hold a Poster reading 'Austerity for salary and Pensions, . Enough' during a protest in January . Moody's itself said that the rating remains as high as it does - now Aa1, just a notch below triple-A -because of the size of the French economy and the government's commitment to make structural reforms. It kept the rating's outlook at negative, meaning it could face future downgrades. The downgrade, like S&P's before it, appeared to be having a limited effect on France's borrowing costs. The yield, or interest rate, on the benchmark 10-year bond was up 0.05 percentage points to 2.01 per cent this afternoon. Germany's was up the same rate to 1.39 per cent. Moscovici said he expected the country to continue to be able to borrow at those historically low rates because of the seriousness of its reform package. Analysts warned, however, that French banks could next face downgrades, since they are significant holders of French government debt and ultimately backed by the government. Lee McDarby, analyst at Investec Corporate Treasury, said: 'The move was widely expected by markets but still proves a blow to France's new government headed by Francois Hollande, who will face increased pressure to find ways to generate growth.' The Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly down as US investors were mellowed by the mood in Europe.","Moody's Investors Service stripped Europe's second largest economy of it of its prized AAA credit rating .

Hero: Steven Izegbu, 28, saw the assault from his home over the road and wrestled the attacker to the ground. Mr Izegbu had become a British citizen just hours before . A man grieving the death of his wife daubed 'I love you' in blood on a church wall as he attacked parishioners during a violent rampage, a court heard today. Malcolm Holland, 56, armed himself with a meat cleaver and a lock knife before launching the attack at St Barnabas Church in St Paul’s Cray, near Orpington, Kent, last July. Wearing a Halloween mask, he smashed up cars, broke into the church hall and assaulted two singers from the local music group, Croydon Crown Court heard. He was finally stopped by a have-a-go hero who had become a British citizen only hours earlier. Holland, who already had a history of mental illness before the death of his wife last year, said to his victims: 'My wife was taken away from me, where was your God?' A judge today spared him a prison sentence, deciding instead to section him under the Mental Health Act. Nicholas Dunham, prosecuting, told the court that Holland began the attack by damaging windows and assaulting the church rector’s husband. Shouting 'My wife died of cancer and you did nothing about it', he smashed up two cars parked outside the rector’s house. He then broke the glass in the church’s front door, causing members of local ladies’ barbershop chorus Velvet Harmony, who were practising there, to barricade themselves inside a hall. The judge heard that Holland burst into the church hall where the women were hiding and set upon Yvonne Burr, who is in her 80s.  Mrs Burr tried to defend herself with a walking stick but Holland punched her in the face and then kicked her after knocking her to the ground. Heroine: Gillian Page was left bruised after she bravely tried to to stop Malcolm Holland attacking Yvonne Burr, 84 . When fellow group member Gillian Page, in her 60s, came to Mrs Burr’s rescue, she was also assaulted and left with bruises. The rampage only came to an end when local man Stephen Izegbu, 28, confronted Holland.  Mr Izegbu had been made a British citizen hours earlier. 'Mr Izegbu’s home overlooks the church and, when he saw the attack on the elderly ladies, he rushed across to intervene,' Mr Dunham told the court. 'After being hit on the head with a crutch, which caused heavy bleeding, he wrestled Mr Holland to the ground and kept him there, screaming and shouting, until the police arrived.' Officers inspecting the scene found the words “I love you” painted in blood on the wall. Police also recovered a meat cleaver and a lock knife which Holland admitted were his but did not use in the attack. Judge . Daniel Flahive sentenced Holland to serve a hospital order under the . Mental Health Act in addition to a restriction order after hearing . evidence from the doctor who is treating him. The . court heard that Holland, who has a son, began suffering anxiety and . depression after being taken hostage during a robbery at a petrol . station. The sentence means he will be sectioned in hospital until those treating him consider that he is no longer a risk to the public. Crime scene: St Barnabas Church in St Paul's Cray, south-east London, was cordoned off after the attack in July . Smashed windows: The church rectory suffered damage in the terrifying attack which left several people injured . The judge also praised Mr Izegbu, saying: 'The bravery he showed should be marked and if it is possible he should be paid £500 from public funds.' Holland, of Silverdale Road, St Paul’s Cray, had already admitted one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, four counts of assault by beating, three counts of damaging property and two charges of having an article with a blade or point. Eiran Reilly, for the defence, told the court that his client could not remember the incident and had been drinking after failing to sort out problems with his benefits when it happened.","Malcolm Holland, 56, went to church armed with meat cleaver and knife .

Western Europe's lemmings were killed off five times during the last Ice Age because of their inability to deal with rapid climate change, say scientists. Other small mammal species may have met a similar fate, experts believe. The finding casts further doubt on claims that humans were largely to blame for the disappearance of large Ice Age animals such as the woolly mammoth, giant deer and cave bear. Regional extinctions: Research has shown that . Western Europe's lemmings, like this Norway lemming pictured in Sweden, were killed off five times during the last Ice . Age because of fluctuations in temperature . It suggests that a series of short-lived warm periods led to inhospitable environments for many cold-adapted animals, leading to the collapse of local ecosystems. Scientists analysed DNA from caves in Belgium and the UK to track the evolution of the collared lemming over a period of 50,000 years. Previously experts thought the lemming, and other small mammals, only vanished from more southern regions when the climate began to warm around 10,000 years ago. Scientists have found that the 'greening' of the Arctic many not be solely caused by global warming, as previously believed, but the environmental impact of lemmings, whose presence causes lichens to be replaced by grasses and sedge. Scientists still do not know what the net effects of this greening might be on climate. They fear greenhouse gas being released by  bacteria responsible for plant decomposition. But, on the other hand, the plants act as important 'sink' soaking carbon up from the atmosphere. A U.S. study last year found that when lemmings are absent, the Arctic tundra is likely to be more barren and covered in lichens and moss. But where lemmings live there is a surprising increase in grass and sedge. One reason for the trend may be the waste products of large numbers of lemmings fertilising the soil, say the researchers. 'By focusing on a small mammal, we could . remove the possibility that humans were having any significant impact . on their population size - lemmings are just too numerous and prolific,' said lead researcher Dr Ian Barnes, from Royal Holloway, University of . London. 'So any changes in the population had to be linked to wider environmental changes.' Colleague Dr Selina Brace, also from Royal Holloway, said: 'While lemmings have an undeserved reputation for leaping off cliffs, in reality they are critical prey species for many arctic animals, and removing them from the ecosystem would have massive knock-on effects for predators.' Scientists have known for a long time that the Ice Ages led to diversification and speciation in many animals. However, the new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is one of the first to demonstrate that climatic change during the last Ice Age was an important driver of extinction. During this period, lemmings in western Europe were wiped out five times. Each extinction was followed by a recolonisation of genetically different lemmings. 'That the lemmings in western Europe became extinct five times during the last Ice Age is unparalleled among mammals,' said co-author Eleftheria Palkopoulou, from the Swedish Museum of Natural History. 'We were really surprised by this finding.'",Finding casts doubt on whether humans were responsible for extinctions of larger Ice Age mammals like mammoths and cave bears .

Federal investigators have arrived at the burned out U.S. consulate in Libya - three weeks after the terror strike that led to the deaths of four Americans. Libyan officials said the team, which included several FBI agents, arrived at the compound early this morning. A Libyan defense ministry official told . AFP: 'An American investigative committee visited the site where the U.S. ambassador was killed.' Remains of the consulate: American investigators, including FBI agents, arrived at the facility to begin their investigation into the attack . U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, as well as fellow Americans Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty perished in the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. On Saturday, the Obama . administration admitted that it knew within 24 hours that the strike . was a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged . by an anti-Islam film. A commander in the rebel Libyan Shield brigade, who did not want to be identified, added: 'About 20 Americans dressed in civilian clothing came and we were asked to protect them until they leave Benghazi.' The investigative crew arrived as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged a full and open inquiry into the attack, amid demands from Congress for speedy answers to questions about the security of the mission and concerns that the FBI probe into the incident has been delayed. Flames: The White House has admitted they knew the deadly assault, pictured, was an act of terrorism within 24 hours .

Two House leaders have asserted that the Obama administration denied repeated requests from U.S. diplomats in Libya to enhance security at the mission. Clinton promised 'a process that is as transparent as possible' although she stressed that 'it will take time.' Casualty: U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the consulate attack . Previous inquiries into attacks on diplomatic missions have taken months to complete. But faced with Republicans in Congress impatient for full details of any possible negligence before November's presidential election, Clinton pledged that the State Department would share information as appropriate with lawmakers as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Sensitive documents detailing U.S. operations in Libya remain left behind at the U.S. consulate more than three weeks after the attack which killed ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The documents - some still scattered across the floors of the looted compound - include information about weapons collection efforts, emergency evacuation protocols, the complete itinerary of Ambassador Stevens' trip, and the names, photographs, phone numbers and other personal information of Libyans who were contracted to secure the U.S. mission. In the days following the attack on September 11, looters were free to roam the remains of the embassy and other highly sensitive documents are expected to have been taken. The compound in Benghazi is now locked, but only two private security guards - paid for by the Libyan owner of the complex - watch over the site, the Washington Post reported. The compound consists of two adjoining villa complexes and in some parts is only protected by an eight foot high wall. President Obama has ordered both the CIA and the Pentagon to hunt down the terrorists who attacked the consulate. It's unclear what the president plans to do once the perpetrators of . the assault in Benghazi are found, but he has mobilized the . military's Joint Special Operations Command to help carry out the . mission. In the open: A collection of highly sensitive documents have remained left behind at the burned out consulate building . JSOC and the CIA teamed up to send Navy SEAL commandos into Pakistan in 2011 for a raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The White House plans for retaliation come after it was revealed that security officials missed key signs that the consulate and Stevens were in danger. The New York Times . reported that Obama has now ordered intelligence operatives to gather . 'target packages' on the perpetrators and track them down in Benghazi or . wherever they might have fled. 'They are putting together . information on where these individuals live, who their family members . and their associates are, and their entire pattern of life,' one US . official said. Once the targets and their locations . are confirmed, Obama could order any number of actions - from drone . strikes to commando raids to joint operations with the Libyans. The Times reported that the operations is focusing on at least a dozen targets, though the exact number is not known. Assault: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks . As with the raid that took out Osama bin Laden, Obama would likely make the final call on an raids or strikes to kill or capture the perpetrators. The consulate, located in the city of . Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the . attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 . terror attacks. The Daily Beast reported that various whistleblowers have come forward since the attack to testify about prior attacks and a series of threats, which are described in a letter from Rep Darrel Issa and Rep Jason Chaffetz to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The letter, obtained by the site, says that both the consulate and Stevens were prime terror targets because threats had been made against both on Facebook. One such post mentioned the route that Stevens took on his morning jog, prompting the diplomat to briefly stop running for his own safety. Deadly attack: The consulate was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack, which occurred on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks . Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . The letter also mentions two separate . bombings on the consulate - one on April 6 (when two former security . guards hurled improvised explosives at the building) and another on June . 6. Neither attack resulted in deaths or injuries. The revelations came as the White House announced it was pulling all U.S. personnel out of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city. Bomb attacks on the facility on April 6 and June 6 . Specific threats on Facebook threatening Ambassador Chris Stevens . Officials initially claimed that attack was a protest gone wrong, despite clues that it was a planned terrorist act . White House admitted last week that it knew the attack was terrorism, despite first statements on Benghazi assault . State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told The Washington Post: 'Everybody who was in Benghazi and posted there has been withdrawn.' Yesterday, new evidence suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was involved in the attack, despite initial claims by officials that it was a protest gone wrong. Stevens and three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods and Glen Doherty - perished in the assault. Confusion over what sparked the Benghazi violence may have stemmed from the CIA, which distributed 'talking points' to top officials on September 14. The unclassified documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, said in part: 'The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex.' 'There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.' Likely working off the CIA document, . government officials like UN Ambassador Susan Rice and White House Press . Secretary Jay Carney, said there was little evidence the violence was . planned. However, the document went on to say that the 'assessment may change as additional information is collected' and that the investigation is 'on-going.'

An angry mother-of-four plans to boycott her six-year-old son’s school carol concert after children, including his own brother and sister, were barred from attending over fears about background noise. Melanie Whitehead, 40, has branded teachers at Eldwick Primary School, in Bingley, West Yorkshire, 'anti-children' over the ban and said she and her husband will not go to son Miles' show. The Scrooge-esque rule means her two other children at the school, Scarlett, four, and Samuel, eight, will not be able to watch him perform. The siblings will be barred from the concert at Bingley Parish Church after parents were asked not to bring their children. Samuel Whitehead (left) and sister Scarlett (centre) have been banned from going to brother Miles's (right) Christmas concert by his school Eldwick Primary School in Bigley, West Yorkshire. Mother Melanie, has branded the school 'anti-children' Scarlett and Samuel will also be stopped from enjoying each others' performances in their own Christmas concerts at the school itself. Mrs Whitehead said the bizarre no-children-allowed rule is taking the festive spirit out of Christmas and has pulled Miles out of the concert on December 10 as a result. In a letter to parents head teacher Janice Kershaw stated children and babies 'will not be allowed in the concert because any background noise could make it difficult to hear the performers'. She said 'fire regulations' also meant the school had to restrict the numbers. Mrs Whitehead said: 'The church performance shocked me the most, I said Miles isn’t going to that one. He is not going, he is going to the rehearsal in the afternoon but he is not going to perform. Why should he? 'If we can’t go as a family to church to see him, I don’t see why we should go without our children and we can’t let our son perform without his parents being able to go and see him. 'I can even slightly understand how a school can put their own conditions in place but to restrict attendance at a church? I’m not even sure why that has happened. 'We will go to the other two but they are during school time, but for the evening one Miles isn’t going to.' Eldwick Primary School, in Bingley, West Yorkshire. Teachers have issued a no-children allowed rule for upcoming carol concerts . She said daughter Scarlett and son Samuel have never been in the same room to see each other perform. 'Its like a pantomime about people who can’t bring children to a nativity play,'she said. 'If Sam was playing Joseph, Scarlett couldn’t go in and see him. 'It all just doesn’t seem very Christmassy does it? Just seems a bit mean. It should be about the children after all. 'I don’t understand the mindset of it - the school is almost anti-children at Christmas.' Letter from Eldwick Primary School head teacher Janice Kershaw banning children from attending . Head teacher Janice Kershaw said she would love to welcome children of all ages at Christmas but was prevented by practicalities such as fire regulations. She said: 'We have a small school hall and of course it would lovely if we could accommodate everyone at Christmas.' The letter sent to Mrs Whitehead and her solicitor-husband Robert, 42, states: 'Admission to the Concert will be for adults only on a ticket basis only, due to fire regulations. There will be a maximum of two tickets per family. 'We hope you will appreciate that other children and babies will not be allowed in the Concert because any background noise could make it difficult to hear the performers. 'We hope we have given adequate time to make alternative arrangements for their care.' Melanie Whitehead has said she will boycott the carol concert at Bingley Parish Church . Mrs Whitehead said she was wanted the school to 'rethink' its attitude to families and young children she said were being 'discriminated against' by the rule. She said: 'People just want to enjoy Christmas and have a more relaxed attitude towards it. 'There is a line you draw and sometimes a teacher or a school thinks they are in charge completely. 'You can’t tell a parent how to be a parent, the children should be allowed in and if they make a noise the parent can take them out or a teacher can then say take him out. 'You can’t just take the decision out of their hands, no kids in case they make any noise. Its common sense, it makes no sense to me. 'It’s something you read one year and think ""You what? Are they having a laugh?"". Then you write a letter one year and expect it to be changed and nothing happened. 'They were lovely and understood my concerns and understand that Christmas is about family but nothing changed. 'I think the children are missing out on an important part of Christmas, its something you look forward to and had become a dreadful worry.' Melanie, of Bingley, said that she can remember one concert she and her husband had to 'tag-team', taking turns looking after Scarlett outside the door and popping in to watch the concert. 'If they changed the regulations and allowed young children in the church concert of course we would lift the boycott and go, we would love to go, it’s Christmas,' she said. 'The fact of the matter is that they won’t. 'It is bad enough tackling companies who are not child-friendly in every day life, for a school to have this attitude, at Christmas, is just ludicrous.' The deputy head for Eldwick Primary School said headteacher Mrs Kershaw did not want to make any further comment at this point.","Siblings banned from watching one another sing as school issues no children allowed rule .

Thousands of kidney dialysis patients could receive faster, safer treatment thanks to a new implant being trialled at St George’s Hospital in London and Central Manchester University Hospital. About 55,000 patients in the UK suffering with end-stage kidney failure rely on dialysis machines to filter waste and excess water from their blood. Until now this required regular operations by a specialist surgeon, who has had to join a vein with a nearby major artery to provide sufficient blood flow in the vein for the dialysis machine to operate. Eventually scar tissue would build up, . forcing doctors to place a catheter directly into the major vena cava . vein in the heart in a highly risky operation. But a new tube, called an Optiflow, may offer a solution. Firstly, blood flow is temporarily . stopped in a specific vein and artery to fit the tube, which is made . from silicone. The chosen vein is then cut and the narrow end of the . tube is inserted inside the vein. This end has tiny grips on the outside . of it to ensure the tube is fixed tightly. A small hole is then punched in the . nearby artery, into which the larger end of the tube is inserted. This . end features two small flanges to prevent the tube becoming dislodged . too. Blood flow is re-established so that the vein can be connected . directly to a dialysis machine. Savior: 55,000 people in Britain need dialysis due to failing kidneys . The Optiflow tube remains in place permanently, or until a successful kidney transplant takes place. Eric Chemla, Consultant Renal Transplant and Vascular Surgeon at St George’s, who was the first surgeon in Europe to fit the tube, says: ‘There has  been a huge rise in the demand for dialysis in recent years because of lifestyle-related illnesses such as diabetes. ‘This device has the potential to improve and save the lives of so many and, depending on long-term results, should be rolled out nationally by 2013.’","55,000 people in the UK rely on regular kidney dialysis ."

Few Triple-A titles can live up to their hype, and none carry more expectation than the Halo series. But where many have failed, Halo 4 succeeds, by not only meeting fans' demands, but exceeding them in almost every way possible. Standing tall:  The Master Chief's animation has been overhauled to make him move more realistically - especially noticeable in the game's frequent cut-scenes . Once again, you are put in control of the Master Chief, who has been floating in space on a wrecked warship called the Forward Unto Dawn. It's not long before events take him and long-standing AI, Cortana, to a mysterious Planet called Requiem - inhabited by a species called Forerunners. Without giving too much away, what follows is an emotional, gripping, often dark yet frequently charming single-player campaign like nothing experienced before. Gameplay, however, is slightly more familiar. Developers 343, who have taken over from Bungie, have stayed true to the original, offering highly-kinetic gunplay. Levels are often multi-layered, giving you the freedom to attack enemy strong points how you want. There's a vast array of weapons available, too, from the rapid-firing SAW to the traditional assault rifle and shotgun, plus some brilliantly designed Forerunner weapons. Stunning: Halo 4 is a remarkable technical achievement, boasting graphics never before seen on the aging console . Similar to Halo: Reach, the Master Chief can equip power ups such as shields, sentry guns and Promethean Vision. Each one is cleverly knitted into the game's narrative and not just thrown in without an explanation. But perhaps Halo 4's greatest achievement are its visuals and artistic design. The 2001 Xbox original stretched the console to its limit - boasting 'hyper realistic' environments and varied, Intricately-detailed levels. Sadly, Halo's reputation of being an aesthetic powerhouse has dimmed over the years - with Halo 3, especially, lacking the visual panache many were expecting. Thankfully, Halo 4 has done things differently and is the best-looking game on the console. Textures burst with detail, and vistas are so well-imagined and epic in scale that it's often tempting to stop just to soak up the sights. Indeed, it's a shame that it's towards the end of the console's life that we are treated to the immense graphical feats in can achieve. The visual flair extends to the character models, too. All humans have lost that googly-eyed, cartoon-look, replaced by NPCs who are capable of showing emotion. Deep: The relationship between Cortana and the Master Chief reaches new levels . The Covenant are well-detailed beasts packed with character - a far cry from the clumsy lumps of Blue and Red in Halo 3. And the Promethean enemies, are multi-layered, beautifully animated creations - exposing their vibrant exo-skeletons when shot, before disintegrating into a splendid ball of orange light. Thankfully, AI has also been improved. Marines no longer gleefully run you over with their Warthogs, or drive you off a cliff when you're in a gunner seat. Covenant and Prometheans display behaviour with an awareness of hierarchy. If a Promethean Knight or Red Elite is killed, for example, the pack of grunts will panic, disperse, or light plasma grenades and charge at you. There's overarching sense of character in Halo 4, which was only touched on in Halo: Reach. The main reason behind this is that the Master Chief now speaks. This allows the player to peek through a window into the relationship between him and Cortana for the first time - revealing a more human side to the character that was perhaps presented as no more than a ruthless cyborg in the earlier outings. Interestingly, multiplayer has a hint of Call of Duty about it. There are lots of new perks available as you rise up the levels – including new armor, weapons and abilities. A blast: Multiplayer, as per usual in Halo games, is strong,  and has been slightly influenced by Call of Duty . There is also Spartan Ops which offers a series of short-length missions that are playable with up to four players. Five missions are available from launch, with more promised in the future. The short film that accompanies each episode stops it from feeling like an after-thought, too. Magical from start to finish, forget game of the year - this is the game of the century.

Speaking to The Sun newspaper, Sara described how she had sex twice with the 33-year-old actor. She said: 'We had sex twice. Everything felt natural. We were having a good time. He was good, but it . wasn't weird or perverted or creepy. 'He had good endurance. We were up for a while. It was about two hours.'

Samsung gearing up for battle with its Japanese rivals with an Android-powered digital camera that allows users to wirelessly upload pictures to the Internet. The South Korean tech giant's Galaxy camera lets users connect to a mobile network or Wi-Fi to share photographs and video without having to use a computer as a go-between. While it's not the first to the market, analysts say Samsung's financial and marketing clout suggest it could be the biggest threat yet to Japanese domination of the digital camera industry. Scroll down for video . Android functionality: The Samsung Galaxy Camera, which runs off Google's mobile OS. The device launched in Japan today, a direct attempt to take on the Japanese firms which dominate the camera industry . That sector, which research firm Lucintel says will grow to be worth $46billion by 2017, is currently under the sway of a few big brands including Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and Olympus. The Galaxy camera, which is available in the UK for £349, features a 4.8-inch LCD touchscreen and a 21x optical zoom lens. Users can send photos instantly to other mobile devices via a 4G network, access the Internet, email and social network sites, edit photos and even play games. The easy-to-use camera, and the quality of the pictures, is aimed at mid-market 'pro-sumers' - not quite professional photographers but those who don't mind paying a premium for user options not yet available on a smartphone - such as an optical, rather than digital, zoom, better flash, and image stabilisation. The appeal of high picture quality cameras with wireless connection has grown as social media services like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter drive a boom in rapid shoot-and-share photos. Discreet: From the front the Galaxy Camera looks like any other compact . Analysts nevertheless say the company is set for a tough battle with more established Japanese firms. 'Samsung has a tough row to hoe against the likes of Canon and Nikon in the camera brand equity landscape,' said Liz Cutting, senior imaging analyst at research firm NPD Group. 'Yet as a brand known more in the . connected electronic device arena, Samsung has a unique opportunity to . transfer strength from adjacent categories into the dedicated camera . world.' The Korean group, which is currently . battling for mobile gadget supremacy against Apple, is already a global . market leader in televisions, smartphones and memory chips. Samsung last year brought its camera and digital imaging business - one of its smallest - under the supervision of JK Shin, who heads a mobile business that generated 70 per cent of Samsung's $7.4 billion third-quarter profit. 'Our camera business is quickly evolving ... and I think it will be able to set a new landmark for Samsung,' Shin said at a launch event in Seoul today. 'The product will open a new chapter in communications - visual communications,' he said, noting good reviews for the Samsung Galaxy camera which went on sale in Europe and the U.S. earlier this month. However, traditional digital camera makers are not taking the new challenge lying down. Canon, considered a leader in profitability in corporate Japan with its aggressive cost cutting, saw its compact camera sales eroded in the most recent quarter by smartphones. In response it has just introduced its first mirrorless camera to tap into a growing market for small, interchangeable-lens cameras that rival Nikon entered last year. Nikon has also recently introduced an Android-embedded Wi-Fi only camera.","The Galaxy Camera uploads pictures straight to the Internet using WiFi of mobile networks .

Becky Evans-Woodward went to her nearby 'walk-in' minor injuries and illness unit after her heart starting racing. Already having suffered five heart attacks she thought she was having another and was taken to the Wycombe Hospital in Buckinghamshire, by her concerned husband rather than waiting for an ambulance.

However, when they arrived staff said she had not been referred to them by a doctor or been brought in by an ambulance and they could not accept her as a patient. Her husband Alvin was advised to go outside and dial 999 for an ambulance. The pair remained outside waiting for paramedics who immediately treated the 33-year-old before taking her back into the hospital where she had been refused treatment minutes earlier. Mrs Evans-Woodward’s husband said he was trying to get his wife the fastest treatment possible and felt calling an ambulance to their remote home, in the village of Great Missenden, would take too long. Mrs Evans-Woodward has already suffered five heart attacks, one serious, in 2008 and has problems with a blocked artery which leads to her heartbeat unexpectedly rising sharply. Mr Evans- Edwards instead took her to Wycombe Hospital where there is a cardiac unit. Staff at the minor injuries unit refused to admit her and suggested she go to Stoke Mandeville Hospital 15 miles away for a ECG examination. Mr Evans- Woodward, 44 years, said: 'I couldn’t believe it. There are so many procedures. “I said ""Why don’t you just cut the red tape and give me the referral otherwise my wife is going to die"".' Having been told to call an ambulance the couple waited in the hospital’s ambulance bay for the paramedics to arrive. He said they looked 'slightly flummoxed' by the situation but took her into a hospital corridor to treat her.

Should you lose 19 stone in just two years, there's naturally going to be a bit of excess skin left over at the end. And one 44-year-old grandmother-of-four from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, was left with three whole feet of it, after shrinking from 31 stone to just 12. But Amanda Smith, a full-time carer who has six children, has now undergone pioneering surgery to remove the 10lbs of saggy skin so she can wear a Christmas party dress for the first time - and is now confident enough to undress in front of her partner Barry, who had never before seen her naked. Amanda before her dramatic diet, left, when she weighed 31 stone, and now, right, weighing a slender 12 stone . Ms Smith tipped the scales at 31-stone by feasting on takeaways, chips and cream cakes after the birth of her son 11 years ago. She paid £7,000 for a gastric band in 2009 and shed an incredible 19 stone in two years, but was left with large flaps of skin - which weighed 10lbs - all over her body. She underwent a nine-hour operation to have the skin removed on the NHS in January, and now weighs 12 stone. She has also dropped 11 dress sizes to a size 12. Amanda has now revealed how the surgery has made her so confident she is able to wear a figure-hugging party dress - as well as a bikini - for the first time in her life. Dramatic photos revealing the extent of Amanda's excess skin before the operation in January . Amanda, following her pioneering operation to remove excess skin, with her partner Brian Minchin . She said: 'It's alright feeling great after you've lost weight but I could see the skin when I took my clothes off. 'I took one look at myself in the mirror once and it was just disgusting to me. I was too ashamed to show my body when I was fat but even when I lost all the weight it was just as disgusting.' Amanda admitted she has never owned a swimming costume or a bikini in her life, and that even when she was a child she would ask her mother to write notes as excuses so she didn't have to do swimming at school. Amanda in the aftermath of the operation to remove 3ft of excess skin, left, and now, in the black lacy party dress she plans to wear this Christmas, right . She added: 'And I would always keep a towel around my body in the changing rooms for PE. But this summer just gone I went to Crete with my partner and it was the first time I had worn a bikini ever. 'It felt so nice but I was still a bit self-conscious because I have a few scars from the operation. 'After the operation you have to wear a sports bra and tight fitting pants for three or four months which I did. But after that I could wear a slim fitting dress for the first time.' The dress was a gift from her partner, Brian Minchin, who bought it for her to celebrate her dramatic weight-loss. Amanda had never before worn a swimsuit - even as a child she would ask her mother to write notes excusing her from swimming lessons . Since recovering from the operation, Amanda - a full-time carer - says she is a 'changed woman' and can finally undress for her partner - who had never seen her naked . She said: 'It is black and lacy with cream underneath, and I have still got it now. I remember thinking ""that will never fit me"", but it did. I'm going to wear it for Christmas parties as well. I love it. 'It is still unreal to me. I still go into shops and think that there's no way something will fit me. 'I had never worn a pair of jeans in my life because I was so fat or because of the rolls of skin but now I can.' Amanda, who has six children and four grandchildren, lives with her engineer partner Brian Minchin, 42. Amanda says she has always been very overweight, even since she was a toddler, and that every time one of her six children was born her weight shot up even more . She added: 'I've always been very overweight from when I was a toddler all the way through to adult life. And every time I had a child it got even worse. 'One . day I sat and thought I want to see my grand kids grow up. I didn't . have a medical condition but I was out of breath just walking up the . stairs. 'I knew I needed to do it. My BMI was 57, I was morbidly obese, I was a heart attack waiting to happen.' Initially, Amanda dieted on her own and lost six stone - but she then struggled to lose any more for six months. But since recovering from the . operation she says she is a 'changed woman', and can finally undress for . her partner - who had never seen her naked before. She . added: 'My partner Brian had never seen me without any clothes at all. I'd never strip off in front of him because of my body. 'It . completely changed my mentality about things. Now I'm comfortable . enough to take my top off in front of him whereas before I would go into . the bathroom and look the door.' Amanda lost 19 stone in just two years, so then had pioneering surgery to lose 10lbs of excess skin . The consultant plastic surgeon who conducted the nine-hour operation to remove 10lbs of Amanda's skin, Sanjay Azad, 47, said: 'It was a big operation. The big companies in the US do it all in one operation because it is better for the patient. There was a lot of extra skin there and it was quite a difficult operation.'","Amanda Smith, from Swadlincote, Derbys, weighed 31 stone .

Suffolk Strangler Steve Wright has sparked anger by launching a third bid for freedom as his victims' families mark the anniversary of his twisted killing spree. Wright, 54, murdered five prostitutes in the Ipswich area over five days in December 2006 and was jailed for life in 2008. Brother David, 53, who regularly visits Wright in Long Larton prison, Worcestershire, has confirmed he is lining up a fresh attempt to overturn the conviction. Appeal: David Wright, right, confirmed his killer brother Steve, left, is to launch a fresh bid for freedom . The case could cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, with Wright being entitled to legal aid. Brian Clennell, 63, whose 24-year-old daughter Paula was Wright's fifth victim, told The Sun: 'Are we never going to be allowed to grieve? This brings it all up again. 'The Government pleads poverty yet money can always be found if you are a criminal for appeals like this.' But David said: 'Steve's innocent and I've got the evidence. He hasn't shown any regret because he hasn't done anything wrong.' Victims: Top l-r Anneli Sarah Alderton, Gemma Adams, Paula Clennell, below Annette Nicholls and Tania Nicol . He also described his brother's luxury lifestyle behind bars, which includes daily gym visits and a television and PlayStation in his cell. Forklift driver Wright picked up his victims - Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clenell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29 - while his girlfriend was working nightshifts. He strangled or asphyxiated them when they were incapacitated with massive doses of heroin, and their bodies were stripped and dumped in remote countryside. Killing spree: The remote woodland at Levington, near Ipswich, where Paula Clennell's naked body was found . At his Ipswich Crown Court trial in 2008, Wright admitted having sex with four of the five victims but denied killing any them. He was told he would spend the rest of his life in jail. The former QE2 steward dropped his first appeal in 2009 and later that year had his second bid thrown out by the courts. During the six-week trial, forensic evidence revealed that Wright's DNA was on three of the murdered women and fibres linked him to all five victims. Evidence: Gloves seized from Steve Wright's Mondeo after his arrest . There was also CCTV footage of him cruising the red-light district by car. Wright told jurors he visited prostitutes after his sex life with partner Pamela Wright became 'almost non-existent'.","Steve Wright's bid for freedom would cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds .

Ali Haydor, 22, punched Daniel Stringer-Prince, 17, at least twice before a gang of youths continued the assault, repeatedly kicking and punching the victim in the head. Student Daniel and a friend were attacked by a group of Asian youths who had been involved in a snowball fight with a group of white teenagers. Attacked: Daniel Stringer-Prince was kicked and punched in the head by a gang of youths . Detective Inspector Dave Moores said of the attack: . ‘What started off as quite a trivial matter of people throwing . snowballs, was escalated much further by others including Haydor, who . subjected one of the victims to a wholly undeserved and violent attack. ‘This man has now been left with . lasting injuries, including damage to his sight in one eye, but the . consequences of this assault could have been far worse. Judge Leslie Hull QC said to Haydor: ‘You punched him . at least twice about his face. That served as an invitation for the rest . of the group to then set about him, kicking him in his head and his . body. It only came to an end when a car drove up alongside.’ Haydor, of Croft Street in Hyde, showed . no reaction as he was jailed for two years at Manchester’s Minshull . Street Crown Court. Jailed: Ali Haydor (pictured left) was sentenced to two years in prison for attacking MrStringer-Prince (right) The families of Mr Stringer-Prince and his friend who were injured in the attack said: ‘We are pleased with today’s result at court and that our son’s attacker is now behind bars for what he did. ‘We can now start to try and put this behind us and are focusing on trying to get life back to normal for Daniel as soon as possible after he has undergone his remaining surgeries.’ The teenage victim believed the attack . was racially motivated but following a police investigation Haydor was . simply charged with assault, which he admitted. Prosecutor Barry Darby did not suggest the case was racially motivated in his opening address to the court. The teenage victim Daniel pictured before he was assaulted. He believed the attack was racially motivated . Detective Inspector Moores said: ‘People . in the Hyde area were horrified at news of this attack and in the days . afterwards, the community came forward with information that helped us . piece together the events of that night. Both the police and the . victim’s families were extremely grateful for that support. ‘Today, . Haydor has been sentenced for his mindless and violent behaviour and I . hope his victims can take some comfort in seeing him put behind bars for . the suffering he has caused. ‘Since . the incident happened in February, the communities of Hyde have come . together to show their solidarity and strong community spirit.

A string of complaints have been made by workers who keep injuring themselves as they go through the moving doors at the revamped Broadcasting House in London's West End. The complaints include one from BBC 'project technologist' Rob Pobjoy who says he hurts either his toes or heel depending on how fast he walks through the spinning entrance. Hazard: Staff have been complaining about the new revolving doors at the BBC's Broadcasting House HQ . Mr Pobjoy said: 'Most days on my way in and out of New Broadcasting House, I often find my heel being pushed by the revolving door. 'As far as I'm aware, I walk at a normal pace. Yet, it seems to me that if I attempt to keep pace, I seem to be going too fast, resulting in my toes kicking the door.' He added: 'It is my belief that the compartment is too small.' Another BBC worker, Ian Jolly, who works in the BBC's newsroom, said that despite 'going through doors all of his life', the revolving doors were 'over-engineered'. Writing in the BBC's internal Aerial magazine he said: 'I've been going through doors all my life. 'In fact, I'm pretty good at it, but I've clearly lost my touch now I'm working at Broadcasting House. 'I've been told my problem is that I 'go through the door too late'. 'Funny, as it's never been an issue before - could it be the BBC's over-engineered, electronic revolving doors that are at fault?' In a spin: Employees say they keep hitting their toes or heels on the electronic doors . One BBC worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'The revolving doors are a bit of a pain - they seem to have a mind of their own. 'However, as long as the Director General's job doesn't become a revolving door and we get a bit of stability after George [Entwistle] then everyone will be happy.' The revamped headquarters, which cost around £1bn to redesign, saw more than 6,000 staff from Audio and Music and News and Vision departments move in at the start of the year. Another employee said each compartment is 'just that little bit too small', and added: 'You have to time it perfectly to make sure you don’t come a cropper. 'When new members of staff come here they regularly comment on the doors being difficult to judge. After a while you learn to master the doors, but you shouldn’t have to really.' He said the problem appeared to be that staff 'misjudged' the speed of the doors, with some staff saying they go to fast and others saying they go to slow. He added: 'You hit your toes and if you try to hang back your heel takes the brunt.' The BBC declined to comment.",Employees at the revamped Broadcasting House in London have been hitting their toes and heels because compartments are 'too small'

An NHS Direct adviser was overheard by his bosses telling a sick child 'life was full of s***' and joking that he would put a patient's 'windows in', a tribunal heard. Michael McCarthy, a nurse who answered calls from patients at the NHS hotline, was placed under review after making clinical mistakes in 2009. While listening in to random calls, bosses overheard the nurse, with nearly 30 years experience, making a catalogue of inappropriate comments and mistakes, the panel was told. Hearing: The tribunal has been taking place at the NMC in London's Aldwych . In a call from 'child A' McCarthy was heard saying: 'I'm sure my boss or whoever is listening to these kind of phone calls would shout at me for using rude words but you know life is full of s***.' He also told the youngster he wished he had a magic wand so he could give her what she wanted and then repeated it to the youngster's mother, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard. Aja Hall, for the NMC, said: 'You will hear from a manager, who will state it is never appropriate to use words such as s***. 'She will also say it was unhelpful to use words such as magic wand to a caller who was seeking help and assistance.' McCarthy is also charged with exploring the symptoms of an asthmatic patient's depression when she phoned the hotline concerned about her breathing difficulties. He was heard saying to this patient: 'Well as long as you make me one last promise, if you don't ring the doctor I will do your windows in.' McCarthy then adds: 'I was kidding about that.' He is also failed to properly respond when the distressed mother of a sick child told him her daughter was 'floppy'. Ms Hall said: 'This call was made by a mother with a very sick young child. 'He didn't seem to be listening to the child's mother because on numerous occasions she uses the word floppy and he uses the word back to her. Advice: McCarthy had been working at the NHS Hotline . 'He didn't appreciate how serious a case was being presented to him.' McCarthy, who is not attending the hearing in central London, is also accused of referring a child's case to social services without warning the mother, or seeking her consent. 'McCarthy never suggested to the mother in the telephone call that he intended to contact social services,' Ms Hall continued. 'He should have, but didn't, ask her for her consent to share this information with social services. 'Nursing advisers are instructed they must get the necessary consent from the mother or father before they pass these details on.' The former mental health nurse, described as 'unsafe' by the inspectors who audited his calls, also failed to speak to a man threatening to harm himself, instead assessing her partner who called in. Ms Hall said: 'Mr McCarthy took a call from the partner of an alcoholic. 'At the time of the call or just before it he was threatening to harm himself. 'What is very clear from the transcript of the call is he under takes an assessment of the caller rather than her partner. 'Throughout the phone call Mr McCarthy did not ask to speak to Patient E.' McCarthy, who qualified as a nurse in 1982, sent the panel a letter informing them he has left the profession. He has entered no plea to the charges, which could see him struck off from the nursing register if proved. The hearing continues.",Michael McCarthy was answering calls at the NHS hotline in Cheshire when he was overheard by bosses making a catalogue of inappropriate comments .

Junior civil servants in the Foreign Office took an average of nearly five working weeks in sick days last year, it has been revealed. The official figures show the Department for Business Innovation and Skills was not far behind. But the most junior officials in William Hague’s department took 24.4 days off through sickness – a rate that has more than doubled in the last four years and the highest across Whitehall. Bad figures: William Hague's Foreign Office and Vince Cable's Department for Business Innovation and Skills had the highest number of sick days taken by junior civil servants with 24.4 and 19.6 respectively . Meanwhile junior staff at Vince Cable’s business department called in sick for more than 19.6 days in the year between March 2011 and March 2012. The cost of Whitehall sick days is estimated to be around £150million a year at a time when ministers are overseeing swingeing departmental budget cuts. Many state officials receive six months’ full pay if they are sick followed by six months’ half pay – a benefit virtually unheard of in the private sector. The generous sickness absence rates mean a public sector employee costs an average of £784 a day when they call in sick, compared with £524 in the private sector. The figures show that in general, sick leave is highest among the more junior staff including administrative staff and assistants. Well-paid illness: A public sector employee costs an average of £784 per sick day compared with £524 in the private sector . They also reveal that across all civil service grades, average sickness absence is on the way up in several departments. In the Department for Work and Pensions, . led by Iain Duncan Smith, the average number of sick days has doubled in . four years from 2.6 in 2007/08 to 4.79 in 2011/12. Eric Pickles’s Department for Communities and Local Government has seen an increase from an average of 5.3 sick days in 2007/08 to 6.7 in 2011/12. However, the administrative grades in the department took off an average of 12.1 days – up from 10.1 four years earlier. Other departments, including the Treasury and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, have also seen significant rises in the average number of sick days over the last five years. The figures were released following a parliamentary question by Labour MP Chris Ruane. Sickness . in 2011/12 was highest in the Northern Ireland Office, where staff . across all grades took an average of 10.4 days a year. And at the Department for Transport . the average was 7.9 – considerably higher than the sick rate of 5.8 days . in the private sector. Sick numbers: The Department for Work and Pensions, headed by Iain Duncan Smith, has seen the average number of sick days double in the last four years . The Ministry of Justice, which last year was exposed in the Mail as being the worst performing department for sickness absence, was not able to supply figures in response to the question. Ed Davey’s Department of Energy and Climate Change reported the lowest number of sick days, with just three days taken off on average. Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is time to end the Whitehall culture that simply shrugs its shoulders at this waste of taxpayers’ money.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We have been taking a much more rigorous approach to monitoring and reporting sick absence... ‘In certain cases officers have been dismissed where they have exceeded acceptable limits.’","Foreign Office junior civil servants took 24.4 sick days off in one year .

A grandmother's semi-detached house has been transformed into a winter wonderland after her builder sons spent weeks decorating it with tens of thousands of Christmas lights. This year, the 16th year running that the Paul and Lee Brailsford, 33, have decorated their mother's house, the display is even bigger and brighter after they bought lights worth thousands for just £700. And the finishing touch is a £150 snow machine which pumps out dozens of litres of snow at the flick of a switch, blanketing the Bristol house and garden in minutes. Worth every penny: Sienna Brailsford, 7, enjoys the £20,000 Christmas decorations at her grandmother's house in Bristol . Animated celebrities Wallace and Gromit turned on the lights in front of 1,000 people at the brick-built property in Brentry, Bristol, this weekend. Father-of-two Lee, 35, said: 'We have tens of thousands of lights worth at least £20,000. 'I just love the fact that we are bringing the local community together. We have lived here since we were five and everyone has known us since we were small. 'Everyone loves seeing the lights, it gives them a real boost. Times are really hard at the moment: we are builders so we are really feeling it this year. 'But if we can bring a smile to people’s faces then it is a real inspiration to us.' The brothers began decorating their 56-year-old mother Rosemary’s home in October this year with thousands of extra lights after stockpiling £700 of them in the New Year sales. Up in lights: The Christmas display features a traditional religious stable scene with Mary and Joseph, as well as candles, snowmen, and plenty of reindeer . Months of preparation: Brothers Lee and Paul Brailsford said they had to put the decorations up in half the usual time this year because the weather has been so bad . The men have their own homes just a few doors down from their mother, but she hosts the display as she has the biggest house. They spend months carefully putting up thousands of lights and lining the area with reindeer, snowmen and Santas. A train is even fixed on to the roof of the house and outlined in twinkling rope lights. Watch the electricity bill: Running the lights until the New Year will cost the Brailsfords £700 . Guaranteed snow: Already more than 1,000 visitors have come to look at the Christmas scene by brothers Lee, left, and Paul Brailsford, shown here with Paul's children Sienna, seven, and Harrison, three . Dream come true: Paul Brailsford and son Harrison, three, enjoy the snow machine outside the house in Bristol . Lee said his boys Jordan, 14 and Liam, 11, and Paul’s children, Sienna, seven and Harrison, three, love seeing their grandmother's home covered in lights. He added: 'It has been really hard this year as the weather has been so bad. We’ve literally had half the amount of time to set it up so it has been a rush. 'It does look fantastic though.' The brothers began decorating their mother's house when they found some Christmas lights reduced in the January sales. It has now become a local highlight with thousands of people visiting the display each year. The brothers began raising money when they realised how popular the display was, and have now raised more than £12,000 for charity. Lee said the display cost an extra £700 in electricity, running from 4.45pm until 10.15pm every day until January 2 .

Tragic: Rose Medlock died after falling from her armchair at a residential home during a game of sit-down football . A frail pensioner who was moved into a care home for her own safety died after she broke six ribs when she fell from her chair during a game of football, an inquest heard. Carers failed to spot Rose Medlock's injuries until the following morning when she was rushed to hospital. However the 72-year-old died just weeks later as a result of the injury aggravating a lung condition, which caused pneumonia. Today, her husband John, 85, of Foleshill, Coventry, said the care home should have treated his wife of 47 years sooner. The inquest heard she fell from her armchair during a game of sit down football at Beechwood Gardens residential care home in Earlsdon, West Midlands. Rose had been moved into the home by social workers four months before the accident because they deemed her too weak to be cared at home her husband. The inquest at Coventry Magistrate's Court on Friday ruled Rose died as a result of the fall on August 7, this year and recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mr Medlock, a retired musician who is partially sighted, said: 'It’s negligence. If she was at home with me, she’d still be alive. It’s shocking. 'Rose didn’t want to leave but social services said I couldn’t look after her because of my disabilities. 'They said she’d be best in the home, that she’d be there for at least 20 years and I could see her every day. 'She didn’t want to leave, she was insistent, but I thought it would be for the best. 'The reason they gave was that she had short term memory problems, I think they thought she had the onset of Alzheimer’s. 'But I didn’t think she did, she was just a day dreamer. 'They were scared she would fall down the stairs because our bedroom was upstairs. 'Social services forced her to move out of her own home claiming it was for her own good and she dies on her own four months later. I’m furious.' Devastated: John Medlock said his wife Rose would still be alive if she had been allowed to stay at home with him . The day after the fall, Rose was taken to University Hospital Coventry. She was discharged from hospital after three weeks but died just six days later on August 27. Mr Medlock said: 'I don’t know much about the fall. All they told me was she was playing football and fell over. 'I think they were kicking a ball around from a sitting position. All I know is she fell over and they took her to hospital the next day. 'I love her and miss her so much. I want justice for Rose. 'I just want to make sure no one else goes through what I have.' Care assistant at the home Alexandra Robertson, who was overseeing the ball game, told the inquest Rose collapsed on the floor after moving out of her armchair. Happy: John and Rose Medlock, pictured on their wedding day in 1965, had been married for 47 years . She said that after suffering the fall Rose 'sat up in the chair, laughing with the residents'. She told the hearing they did check her body but there was only one small red mark and Rose 'wasn't in any pain'. However, she said when Rose returned from hospital she was far weaker. Ms Robertson said: 'She wasn’t the Rose that we knew before. 'She was happy to stay in bed and be cared for that way. She was kept comfortable and had regular visits. 'She wasn’t a big eater and had refused all her food.' When asked about her injuries, care manager Joan Stubbs said: 'Accidents do happen as much as we try to stop them.' Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a verdict of accidental death caused by bronchial pneumonia, fractured ribs and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Speaking after the hearing, Rose’s sister Wynn Allen, 77, from Bedworth, said: 'I visited the Saturday before she died at the care home and she was all laid out, like she was ready to die, and she was gasping for every morsel of breath. 'She had nothing to eat and her mouth was open, it didn’t move. There was no need for that. There was no care. When she was with John she had everything she needed.' The care home refused to comment today.","Rose Medlock developed pneumonia after the rib injury aggravated a lung condition .

The Israeli ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office yesterday for a dressing-down over his country's settlement policy. Middle East minister Alistair Burt told Daniel Taub that Israel will kill the prospects of a two-state solution to the peace process if it builds 3,000 homes on a tract of land called E1 near Jerusalem. Foreign Secretary William Hague is planning talks wth US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and European allies to get Israel to back down. Building work: A Palestinian man works at a new housing development in the Jewish West Bank settlement near Jerusalem . Plans: Israel has a master plan to build 3,600 apartments and 10 hotels on the section of territory east of Jerusalem known as E1 . Worthless: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the vote is meaningless . Officials described reports that the . British ambassador could be withdrawn if the scheme for 3,000 new homes . in the West Bank and East Jerusalem goes ahead as 'speculation'. However, . a Foreign Office spokesman made clear that they believe the Israeli . government should think again before going ahead with the plan which . threatens to wreck any prospect of reviving the stalled Middle East . peace process. 'The Foreign Secretary has . consistently made clear that settlement building, such as the recent . Israeli government decision to build 3,000 new Israeli housing units, . threatens a two-state solution and make progress through negotiations . harder to achieve,' he said. 'We have called on the Israeli . government to re-consider. We have told the Israeli government that if . they go ahead with their decision there will be a strong reaction.' Today France summoned Israel's envoy in Paris for a meeting but played down reports it could recall its ambassador to Israel. 'The ambassador has been summoned in order to express our disapproval,' foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot said. The Israeli embassy also confirmed the meeting. 'There are other ways in which we can express our disapproval,' said the official who made it clear Paris was looking at other ways of putting pressure on Netanyahu. The British issued a . statement saying they had made clear they would not support strong . Israeli retaliation to a U.N. vote last week that gave the Palestinians . de facto recognition of statehood. A diplomatic source, who declined to be named, said London would decide later in the day whether to recall its ambassador. Such a move by both London and Paris would represent a severe diplomatic reproach to Netanyahu. Building in the area, known as E1, . would sever the link between the West Bank and east Jerusalem, the . sector of the holy city the Palestinians claim for a future capital, and . cut off the northern part of the West Bank form its southern flank. The Palestinians claim such a scenario would essentially kill any hope for the creation of a viable state. Israel's Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israeli Army Radio he was not aware of any recall of a British ambassador. 'I did not hear of this, either via . the foreign ministry or the prime minister's office. Therefore I have a . hard time believing it is true,' he said. Homecoming: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, waves to the crowd during celebrations for their successful bid to win U.N. statehood recognition in the West Bank city of Ramallah yesterday . Palestinians hold pictures of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, as they celebrate their successful bid to win U.N. statehood recognition in the West Bank city of Ramallah . Netanyahu . has brushed off world condemnation of his latest settlement plans, . which were announced on Friday just hours after the United Nations voted . overwhelming to upgrade the Palestinians' diplomatic status. The United Nations General Assembly . last week overwhelmingly endorsed an independent Palestinian state in . the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel . captured in the 1967 war. The move to upgrade the Palestinians to a nonmember observer state does not change much on the ground, but it carries deep potential significance. The vote amounted to an international endorsement of the Palestinian position on future border arrangements with Israel and an overwhelming condemnation of Israeli settlements in the areas claimed by the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects a return to Israel's 1967 lines. Israel remains in control in parts of the West Bank and considers east Jerusalem, the Palestinians' hoped-for capital, an integral part of its capital. Resounding endorsement: Palestinians wave a flag and a Quran in celebration . Abbas has returned home to a hero's welcome after winning a resounding endorsement for Palestinian independence at the United Nations . Some 5,000 people gathered outside the headquarters of President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah . 'We will carry on building in Jerusalem and in all the places that are on the map of Israel's strategic interests,' Netanyahu said on Sunday at a weekly cabinet meeting. Besides authorising 3,000 new homes in and around Jerusalem, the Israeli government also agreed to expedite planning work for thousands more homes on barren land near Jerusalem that critics say would kill off Palestinian hopes of creating a viable state. On Sunday, the Israeli government delivered another blow, saying it would withhold more than $100 million in funds it transfers to the Palestinians each month. Instead, it said the money - taxes and customs duties that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians - would be used to pay off its debts to Israeli companies, including $200 million owed to the state-run Israel Electric Corp., government officials said. The monthly transfers are crucial for the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority to pay salaries to its tens of thousands of civil servants and security forces. Israel has taken similar measures in the past before eventually releasing the money.

Outside the headquarters of President Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah, some 5,000 people thronged a square, hoisted Palestinian flags and cheered their leader's return from New York. Large posters of the Palestinian leader, whose popularity had plummeted in recent months, adorned nearby buildings. 'We now have a state,' Abbas said to wild applause.

But within weeks she ends the engagement, writing again to her father: ‘I feel relieved too, although also sad because he does love me and in many ways I love him and have had some very happy days with him.’ Her stage and screen career took off the following year. Mr Welby, the son of a German merchant, was a colourful character and whisky bootlegger known to lie about his aristocratic connections to get closer to the rich and powerful. His marriage to Jane Portal, Justin’s mother and a former private secretary to Winston Churchill, ended after she sued him for adultery in 1959. Mr Welby died of a heart attack in 1977, when his son was 21 and studying at Cambridge. The Rt Rev Welby, 56, who is due to take over as Archbishop of Canterbury in the New Year, has previously admitted that he knew little about his father, who was alcohol dependant. The bishop and Miss Redgrave were unavailable for comment.","Actress was 23 when she accepted the proposal of Gavin Welby in 1960 .

Drowned: Arianna Alioto, 18, died last week during a training session at Northern Michigan University . An investigation has been launched into how a standout soccer player drowned during a team workout at Northern Michigan University. Arianna Alioto, who suffered from epilepsy, was with other teammates when she somehow drowned. Tragically, the last message she put out on her Twitter account read: 'It's crazy how things can change so fast.' Stunned college friends held a candle-lit vigil on Saturday night at the campus where the 18-year-old freshman lived. Alioto, from Columbia, Missouri, was taking part in a training session at NMU's Physical Education Instructional Facility on Friday evening. University officials have not released any details of what caused the drowning, but it is known more than a dozen other teammates were taking part in the session. According to a report in the Columbia Daily Tribune from 2010 Alioto suffered an epileptic seizure during a match. Her coach said she had forgotten to take her medicine and she was passed fit to play in further games. It is not known if a seizure was the cause of the drowning. Alioto, who went by the nickname Anna, was a standout soccer player for her former high school. Star: The teen (right), known as Anna, was one of the standout players on the NMU soccer team . Much-loved: Anna's coach and university president paid tribute to the popular teen (left) She also played on the Carrera Soccer Club Elite team, a Columbia-based team that participated in tournaments in Michigan, Colorado and other states. The teen was also a member of Missouri's Olympic Development Team. Retired Rock Bridge soccer coach Marc VanDover called Alioto 'a pretty special kid' who 'probably trained harder than any player that I ever had and just a tremendous talent, and she worked very hard to improve every day.' The teen’s death has stunned the university campus. Mystery: It is unclear how Anna (left) drowned, though she is believed to have suffered from epilepsy . 'Arianna was not only a good soccer player, but a wonderful young woman,' NMU soccer coach Matt Granstrand said in a statement. 'We felt honored that she chose to play at Northern Michigan University. 'Our team and our extended team family are in extreme pain. It's hard to grasp that Arianna was with us one moment and gone the next. It just doesn't seem real. Her death is devastating. We will be grieving for her loss for a long time.' N.M.U. President David Haynes extended condolences on behalf of the school to the Alioto family. Haynes said, 'It's difficult to express the emotions that take place when a university family suffers the loss of a student. 'Not only is the soccer team and athletic department in shock, but so too are Arianna's fellow students, professors and the staff she regularly interacted with. Our deepest sympathies go out to the Alioto family at this time.'",18-year-old Arianna Alioto believed to have suffered from epilepsy .

The murder-suicide on Saturday morning left the couple's 3-month-old daughter Zoey an orphan. Happy family: Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins before shooting himself at the Kansas City Chiefs' stadium on Saturday morning . But now relatives have said his mother  Cheryl Shepherd, will take responsibility for the infant, reported the New York Post. It is thought she will raise her grandaughter at the Long Island home where the 25-year-old grew up. Ms Shepherd had been in Kansas City to help Belcher and his girlfriend with their young daughter when the incident happened. Family man: Belcher with his girlfriend at the birth of his son just months before he left the child orphaned . Gone: Belcher's baby will never know its mother . On Saturday he shot Perkins dead in a row when she came home from an R&B concert the night before. His mother discovered the body as she was living in the house and called 911.

The couple had doted on their young . daughter - they posted several photos on the internet showing Perkins . holding the infant when she was born as well as photos of the trio. 'She just lost a son. We're all coming together,' Eric Oakes, a cousin of Belcher, told the New York Post. On Facebook, a profile for Kasandra Perkins includes pictures of her and Belcher with their three month old baby . Cheryl Shepherd said yesterday family was heartbroken over both deaths. 'Right now, we are grieving for Kasandra and Jovan,' she said in a telephone interview to Newsday. 'We are in mourning.' Ms Shepherd was a big influence in her son's life. Belcher told the Bangor Daily News that he credited his mother and three older sisters with giving him support. 'My mother is a hardworking woman,' he said. 'To see her overcome some things and . succeed, it makes me look at things and say, 'This isn't even hard.' I . didn't really have a father figure, so they provided nice guidance for . me.' Dwayne Wilmot, who was Belcher's . position coach at Maine, recalled that the easiest way to make him smile . was to tell him his mother was coming to a game. 'Family was paramount for Jovan. You could see it at every game,' said Wilmot, now a coach at Yale. Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher, 25, shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself on Saturday morning . Happier times: Belcher and Kasandra M. Perkins, had lived apart briefly earlier in the year but had gotten back together by Thanksgiving, according to a friend of Perkins . Belcher and Perkins, had lived apart briefly earlier in the year but had gotten back together by Thanksgiving, according to a friend of Perkins. Brianne York, 21, said Sunday the couple, argued about 'normal couple stuff' but that her friend was 'really happy about being a mom.' When she learned Saturday that Belcher had fatally shot Perkins at the couples' home, York said, she thought someone must have been mistaken. Sunday found Crennel on the . sidelines, bravely holding together a team in turmoil. The Chiefs . rallied to a 27-21 victory over the Carolina Panthers, breaking an . eight-game losing streak. 'It was tough,' said quarterback . Brady Quinn. 'It was an eerie feeling after a win, because you don't . think you can really win in this situation.' York, who met Perkins while taking . classes at the Blue River campus of Metropolitan Community College, said . the women bonded during their pregnancies. York has a baby boy who was . born months before Perkins gave birth to Zoey. 'It doesn't seem that that would be . the end of their story,' York said.

Crime scene: Investigators stand outside an Independence, Mo., house where police say Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend on Saturday morning . York said that sometime after Halloween Perkins had gone to visit her family in Texas. Perkins also briefly stayed with her cousin, who is married to Chiefs player Jamaal Charles. Belcher and Perkins met through Charles, York said. York said the root of the argument was that Belcher, 'sometimes he would just be down in his man cave or whatever,' and Perkins wanted to spend more time together as a family. 'They ended up wanting to try to work it out,' York said, 'and the next time I went over and visited she told me everything was good and things were better, so I thought everything was fine.' Kansas City police spokesman Darin Snapp reiterated Sunday that the couple had argued recently but he could provide no additional details. At the couple's former home, people could be seen coming and going Sunday. 'Can you all respect grieving?' said a man who answered the door at the couple's home. A short time later, at the same time the Chiefs were playing, two men loaded bags into a car, and two women drove away. Attempts to reach various members of Perkins' family in Austin, Texas, were unsuccessful. Respects: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Brady Quinn gestures to heaven after a touchdown pass during the first half the teams game against the Carolina Panthers . Memorial: Kansas City Chiefs fans build a makeshift memorial for Belcher outside Arrowhead Stadium . Neighbors in the newly built Kansas City subdivision where the couple had lived since April were stunned by Saturday's violent events. Kristen VanMeter, 31, lives near the couple and said also she had taken community-college courses with Perkins. VanMeter said the couple threw 'a lot of parties' but said she heard nothing unusual the morning of the killing. 'It's a surprise,' she said. 'There had to of been something that triggered it.' Shawn Martin, vice president of the neighborhood homeowners association, said she wasn't aware of any problems that preceded the shooting. She described the parties at the home Belcher and Perkins shared as 'nothing more than any other young couple' would have. After having the baby, Perkins was taking the fall semester off school. York said Perkins planned to return in January and wanted to become a teacher. Police said Belcher's mother was living with the couple, but York said she just made frequent visits, sometimes lasting a couple weeks at a time. She doesn't know who will care for the baby now. 'They just seemed really happy around each other, and I just don't understand where things went wrong,' York said. York said the only other stress Perkins mentioned was whether Belcher would stay with the Chiefs. 'She was a really good person to be around and a lot of fun,' York said. 'She was somebody you could call when you were down and she would talk you through it. She would lift you back up and make you feel happy again if you were sad or upset.'","Belcher shot his 22-year-old girlfriend and mother of his child Kasandra Perkins on Saturday morning .

Dominique Strauss-Kahn is to get a loan of almost £2million from his estranged wife to help pay off the New York hotel maid he was accused of sexually assualting. An out-of-court deal has reportedly been agreed between the former head of the International Monetary Fund and Nafissatou Diallo, 33. It is expected the agreement will see her dropping a civil lawsuit she pursued against him after a criminal prosecution collapsed last year. Loan: . With no income or savings, Strauss-Kahn will have to ask . multi-millionaire heiress Anne Sinclair, his 64-year-old wife who left . him in the summer, for half of the money . Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo maintained her claims the she was the victim of a 'violent, sadistic attack,' despite criminal charges being dropped . The French newspaper Le Monde reported yesterday that the pair would meet a judge in New York next Friday to sign the deal. 'The discussions have been giong on for weeks, months,' said Michele Saban, a friend of Strauss-Kahn, 63, who saw him recently. 'The agreement should be confirmed at the start of next week. We are moving towards the end of a tragedy.' Le Monde revealed yesterday that the . man once tipped as a future president of France has turned to his . ex-wife, Anne Sinclair, to help him fund the settlement. Stauss-Kahn has travelled to New York . from his home in Paris on a number of occasions in the past month to . broker the deal with Miss Diallo's representatives aimed at making her . 'quietly' drop her case say friends. 'According to his confidants, he must . give $6million (£.7million) to the woman who has accused him of sexual . assault,' Le Monde reported. 'According to friends, he has confided that . he personally does not have this sum. 'He has therefore told his family that he will be getting a bank loan of $3million (£1.8million). 'His wife Anne Sinclair, from whom he has been living apart since the summer, should also lend the remaining $3million.' Miss Sinclair, also 63, a heiress and . former television presenter who now runs a Paris website, originally . put up a £624,000 deposit and £3.1million bond to get Strauss-Kahn out . of the notorious Rikers Island prison in May 2011 after his arrest at . the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan.

The couple who have a daughter Camille, had been married for 20 years. Strauss-Kahn also faces legal trouble . closer to home. He has been charged with aggravated pimping in a . prostitution racket at the Carlton Hotel in Lille. A judge will rule on whether that case proceeds later this month. Miss Diallo alleged that Stauss-Kahn forced her to perform a sex act in his suite at the Manhattan hotel on May 14 last year. The criminal prosecution fell apart . after doubts emerged about her credibility as a witness and the . attempted rape charges against Strauss-Kahn were eventually dropped.

Warning: Motorists are being urged to check the mileage on MOT certificates to avoid being accused of illegally 'clocking' the odometer (file picture) Millions of motorists are urged today to check the car mileage printed on new-style MOT certificates to avoid being accused of illegally ‘clocking’ their own vehicles. The AA says innocent law-abiding drivers who fail to check the mileages printed on the new Government forms which were issued from last week may inadvertently be accused of turning back the mileage on their own cars if garages make mistake when writing it out. As a result millions of motorists are facing an MOT ‘ticking time-bomb’, says the motoring organisation. The AA warns today in a new report: ‘Car owners who put their vehicle in for an MOT test and fail to check the mileage on the new certificate, introduced last week, may inadvertently end up with their own ‘clocked’ car.’ It notes: ’The new certificate carries up to three of the previous recorded mileages. Should the MOT test station make a mistake, the car owner has only seven days to get the tester to correct the error and issue a new certificate. If not, the car’s mileage record is frozen and cannot be changed.’ AA head of public affairs Paul Watters said:  ‘What was designed as a security measure to deter criminal clocking may bite back on the unwary. It is highly unlikely that the tester will make a mistake but the consequences are serious enough for the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to issue a specific warning.’ He said: ’It would be extremely awkward for an innocent owner to be accused of clocking a vehicle when they try to sell it on or get it re-tested, because they hadn’t checked the certificate. ‘With the clocking of vehicles rife in some parts of the country, threatening the safety and finances of used car buyers, the slight possibility of a mileage mistake during the MOT test is seen as a risk worth taking.’ Government statistics show that 28.2million MOT tests are carried out every year, of which 26.6 million are for cars. Check: A car's recorded mileage cannot be changed after seven days of its MOT test according to new rules (file picture) The AA said there had been concern that the MOT certificate printed by the tester could be forged or tampered with: ’However, the new scheme allows a driver to check the mileage history on VOSA’s MOT computerisation database. This underlines the importance of the MOT certificate as a guide to rather than an endorsement of a car’s roadworthiness, ownership or mileage validity.’ An official advice leaflet published by the Department for Transport’s Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) called ‘Your MOT certificate and Odometer history’ warns: ’If your MOT test was conducted on or after 18 November 2012 the MOT certificate will now show the vehicle’s recent mileage history. 'This has been introduced as part of a government initiative to reduce vehicle crime. ‘Where available, the mileage history will compose of the readings associated with the three most recent VT20s (test passes) along with the dates of those readings. This will be in addition to the mileage reading recorded at the time of the current test.’ It notes: ’It is important that you check all details on your MOT certificate at the time of issue so that any errors can be rectified. If you find a mistake in the mileage reading recorded for the current test, the MOT garage that conducted the test will be able to correct the error within seven days of the test and issue a replacement certificate.’ But the official VOSA leaflet adds:’Where an earlier recorded mileage is higher than a later one this could be caused by for example a speedometer replacement or a mistake by the Tester at the time of recording the reading. Alternatively it might suggest evidence of previous ‘clocking’ or tampering of the vehicle’s mileage.’ It stresses ominously: ‘Please note that if there is an error in one or more of the previous mileage readings then this cannot be changed.’","The AA has warned that law abiding drivers who fail to check new Government forms could be accused of turning back mileage .

Abstain: William Hague revealed that Britain will not back a crucial UN vote to give a Palestinian state higher status . Britain will not back a crucial UN vote to give a Palestinian state higher official status unless it unconditionally returns to peace talks with the Israelis. Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed that the government would abstain from today's vote as it had not yet received those guarantees. He warned time was running out to broker a deal between the parties because of the pace of Israeli settlement building. President Mahmoud Abbas wants Palestinians to be given UN ‘non-member observer status’, such as that enjoyed by the Vatican. This will give it a greater presence at the UN. The crunch vote will come at the UN General Assembly, where the majority of countries including France, are sympathetic to the Palestinians. Members of the UN Security Council will not have a veto on the issue, which makes it likely that a resolution will be passed in the teeth of opposition from Israel and the US. Mr Hague told MPs: ‘Up until the time of the vote itself, we will remain open to voting in favour of the resolution, if we see public assurances by the Palestinians on these points. ‘In the absence of these assurances, the UK would abstain on the vote. This would be consistent with our strong support for the principle of Palestinian statehood, but our strong concern that the resolution could set the peace process back,’ he told the House of Commons in a statement.’ He insisted 2013 would be a crucial year for negotiations, adding that there were up to two years left to broker the deal. Mr Hague also urged the Palestinians . to drop plans to try to sue Israel through the International Criminal . Court over the occupied territories. Israel . has threatened to rebuff any negotiations if the Palestinians have . their status upgraded, arguing it would undermine efforts to secure a . Middle East peace settlement. But Mr Hague was warned that abstaining on the vote would be an ‘abdication of Britain’s responsibilities’. Tension: There are fears the vote could stoke further tension with Israel,l following the ceasefire, which was celebrated by Palestinians, pictured . Pushed ahead with vote: President Mahmoud Abbas wants Palestinians to be given UN 'non-member observer status' like the Vatican . Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander accused him of agreeing to the ‘threats’ issued by the Republican-run Congress which would ‘punish the Palestinians’ for taking diplomatic steps. Mr Alexander added: ‘Statehood for the Palestinians is not a gift to be given, but a right to be acknowledged. ‘I warn the Foreign Secretary, if the UK abstains tomorrow it will not be a measure of our growing influence, it will be a confirmation of our growing irrelevance to meaningful engagement in the search for peace.’ He urged the Foreign Secretary ‘not to dither, but to decide to vote for enhanced recognition for the Palestinians at the UN tomorrow’. Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman, said Mr Hague was ‘offering Mr Abbas all support short of actual support’. He added: ‘The right honourable gentleman sits on his hands.’ Mr Hague also faced criticism from Tory colleagues, with Conservative MP Nicholas Soames saying: ‘I profoundly disagree with what he says and whatever this resolution states these conditions are unnecessary and one sided and grossly unfair.’ But Labour MP Louise Ellman questioned why the Palestinians would go back to negotiations they abandoned two years ago if they were first given enhanced status upfront. Conservative MP Robert Halfon warned Hamas would see the vote as a ‘victory’ for its rocket attacks on Israel.

This horrific picture shows the aftermath of a drink-driving smash in which a brilliant college student died - the morning after he had been drinking. Matthew Alston, 18, went out in his car to a friend’s house at 7am not realising he was still drunk from a party at his family home the night before. As he sped down the road, he lost control of his black Vauxhall Corsa on a bend and ploughed head on into a Seat Toledo. Mangled wreckage: Matthew Alston lost control of his black Vauxhall Corsa on a bend . 'He made a positive difference to so many': Matthew Alston, 18, crashed half a mile from his parents' house . Matthew, from Simonstone near Burnley, . Lancashire, died at the scene as a result of multiple injuries and tests . showed he was still double the drink drive limit. The . Seat driver, a 38-year-old off duty traffic policewoman on her way home . from a shift, suffered serious leg injuries and had to quit her job due . to ill health. Her male colleague, 49, escaped with minor injuries. After . the accident it emerged that Matthew had passed four A levels in A, B, C . and C grades which would have enabled him to take up a place on an . international business studies course at Northumbria University. Today . Matthew's devastated parents Andrew, 46, and Janet, 48, gave permission for Lancashire Police to release a picture of the mangled wreckage in the hope that it might prevent more people getting behind the wheel after drinking heavily the night before. They have also released the wreckage of their son's car to Lancashire Police and Lancashire County Council to be shown to students around the area as a warning about the dangers of driving the morning after. Police also hope the crushed car will act as an effective warning to others, and say they plan to breathalyse and drugs test thousands of . drivers around the clock in the run-up to Christmas. Company director Mr Alston and his wife said: 'Matthew died as a result of driving the morning after he had been out drinking alcohol with friends. 'He drove without realising the amount of alcohol still in his body. Later we discovered he had twice the legal drink drive limit still in his system. 'On that day, when we were told Matt had died, we were just in shock; in a daze. We were away and were told over the phone by a police officer. 'It was devastating. Matt was just a normal lad, we are a normal family; surely it wouldn’t happen to us, but it has. 'Matt had a massive amount of friends. He was so cheeky; Always laughing and joking. That’s something we’ll never have again. 'This ""Morning After"" campaign highlights the true effects of drinking and driving. Over 10,000 young people in Lancashire have seen the devastation of Matt’s car and have expressed genuine shock at the reality of how easily something like this can happen. 'We are just a normal family, surely it wouldn't happen to us, but it has.' Matthew's parents Janet and Andrew Alston want to prevent the same thing devastating other families . 'Matt and his friends would always use taxis for nights out, but didn’t always think about the morning after. Please, just stop a second and think. You could still be over the limit. That could have a devastating consequence. 'Too many young drivers are getting behind the wheel when they still have alcohol in their system. 'As Matt’s parents we would urge you to really think about the morning after. Are you really sure you’re fit to drive?  It’s not worth the risk so don’t even chance it.' Promising student: Matthew's parents discovered after the smash that their son had got the A Level grades that would have won him a place on an International Business Studies course at Northumbria University . The tragedy occurred in August 2010 after Matthew hosted a party for ten friends at his family home whilst his parents were away for the weekend. He went to bed in the early hours but got up at 7am because he couldn’t sleep and drove off without telling anyone where he was going. At 7.10am half a mile away from the house, witnesses said the Vauxhall Corsa was speeding when it careered into the centre of the road, spun out of control and smashed into the Seat Toledo travelling in the opposite direction. A coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mr Alston added: 'Tragically Matthew made a grave mistake and if he was here today he would stand up and apologise to everyone for the hurt and trauma he had caused. 'He would have accepted the consequences and learnt from it never to repeat the actions again.  Those who have never met Matthew will form opinions based on the last few hours of his life. 'However those of us who had the privilege of knowing and loving him knew what a fantastic, young person he was who lived his life to the full, had a great work ethic, was caring and thoughtful with a wicked sense of humour. 'He made a positive difference to many, and would have continued to do so if he was with us today. Sadly he has gone too soon.' Supt Richard Morgan from Lancashire Police said this year’s anti drink driving campaign would target drink and or drug drivers under 25 and those who drive the morning after a night drinking. Graphic warning: Lancashire Police are taking the wreckage of Matthew's car around schools and colleges to warn youngsters of the dangers of driving the morning after drinking. Pictured is Supt Richard Morgan with the car . Death trap: Matthew's parents have agreed to let police show his wrecked Vauxhall Corsa as a warning to others . A lesson to others: Lancashire Police and Lancashire County Council hope the car will serve as an effective deterrent . He added: 'People may be surprised to hear that last year between the hours of 6am and 11am nationally more than 400 people failed breath tests which is more than those caught for the hour before or after midnight. 'Drivers need to be aware that regardless of the time of day they are caught, whether they are going to work or taking children to school, they will face the same penalties as someone who has chosen to drink heavily in a pub and driven at night. 'Last year 280 people were killed across the country in accidents where the driver was over the limit. ‘If you don’t drink and drive this Christmas you reduce the risk of killing an innocent person, or yourself. It is really that simple. 'This year we are very grateful for the support of two parents who continue to grieve for their son Matthew who was killed in a collision after drink-driving. They are trying to save someone else from the pain they have endured. 'I would like people to listen to their words and consider the consequences of drinking and driving. 'Like Matthew, there are some drivers who think they are obeying the law but are in fact breaking it by getting into their cars the morning after a night of drinking.'","Matthew Alston, 18, was still double the drink-drive limit at 7am after party .

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rebuked the United Nations General Assembly's vote to recognize a Palestinian state, calling it an ‘unfortunate and counterproductive’ move that further obstructs the path to a peaceful agreement between Palestine and Israel. ‘We have been clear that only through direct negotiations between the parties can the Palestinians and Israelis achieve the peace they both deserve: two states for two people with a sovereign, viable independent Palestine living side by side in peace and security with a Jewish and democratic Israel,’ Clinton said on Thursday in a speech in Washington on foreign policy trends. The U.N. voted overwhelmingly Thursday to recognize the Palestinian state, a long-sought victory for the Palestinians and an embarrassing diplomatic defeat for the United States. Scroll down for video . Opposing vote: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice explains the U.S. position opposing a resolution on Palestinians at a meeting of the General Assembly on November 29, 2012 in New York City . Angered diplomat: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called rebuked the United Nations' vote to recognize a Palestinian state ¿unfortunate and counterproductive¿ . The resolution upgrading the Palestinians' status to a non-member observer state at the U.N. was approved by a vote of 138-9, with 41 abstentions, in the 193-member world body. A Palestinian flag was quickly unfurled on the floor of the General Assembly, behind the Palestinian delegation. In the West Bank city of Ramallah, hundreds crowded into the main square waved Palestinian flags and chanted ‘God is great.’ Others who had watched the vote on outdoor screens and television sets hugged, honked and set off fireworks before dancing in the streets. Real independence, however, remains an elusive dream until the Palestinians negotiate a peace deal with the Israelis, who warned that the General Assembly action will only delay a lasting solution. State Secretary: Clinton speaking at the Brookings Institute in Washington, DC on Thursday . Israel still controls the West Bank, east Jerusalem and access to Gaza, and it accused the Palestinians of bypassing negotiations with the campaign to upgrade their U.N. status. The Palestinians still face enormous limitations. They don't control their borders, airspace or trade, they have separate and competing governments in Gaza and the West Bank and they have no unified army or police. The United States immediately criticized the historic vote. ‘Today's unfortunate and counterproductive resolution places further obstacles in the path peace,""’ U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice said. The United States and Israel voted against recognition, joined by Canada, the Czech Republic, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Panama. Palestine's leader: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas gathers his papers after speaking during a U.N.General Assembly meeting prior to the vote . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the speech by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to the General Assembly shortly before the vote ‘defamatory and venomous,’ saying it was ‘full of mendacious propaganda’ against Israel. Netanyahu called the vote meaningless. Abbas had told the General Assembly that it was ‘being asked today to issue the birth certificate of Palestine.’ Abbas said the vote is the last chance to save the two-state solution. After the vote, Netanyahu said the U.N. move violated past agreements between Israel and the Palestinians and that Israel would act accordingly, without elaborating what steps it might take. Celebration: Palestinians gather next to a section of Israeli separation barrier at the entrance to the west bank city of Bethlehem to watch a large screen showing the U.N. General Assembly vote . Thursday's vote came on the same day that the U.N. General Assembly in 1947 voted to recognize a partitioned state in Palestine, with the jubilant revelers then Jews. The Palestinians rejected that partition plan, and decades of tension and violence followed. Just before Thursday's vote, Israel's U.N. ambassador, Ron Prosor, warned the General Assembly that 'the Palestinians are turning their backs on peace' and that the U.N. can't break the 4,000-year-old bond between the people of Israel and the land of Israel. The vote had been certain to succeed, with most member states sympathetic to the Palestinians.Several key countries, including France, this week announced they would support the move to elevate the Palestinians from the status of U.N. observer to non-member observer state. Independence day: Palestinians celebrate as they watch a screen showing the U.N. General Assembly vote . Unlike the more powerful U.N. Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly, and the resolution to raise the Palestinian status only required a majority vote for approval. The vote grants Abbas an overwhelming international endorsement for his key position: establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, the territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. With Netanyahu opposed to a pullback to the 1967 lines, this should strengthen Abbas' hand if peace talks resume. The overwhelming vote also could help Abbas restore some of his standing, which has been eroded by years of standstill in peace efforts. His rival, Hamas, deeply entrenched in Gaza, has seen its popularity rise after an Israeli offensive on targets linked to the Islamic militant group there earlier this month. Israel has stepped back from initial threats of harsh retaliation for the Palestinians seeking U.N. recognition, but government officials warned that Israel would respond to any Palestinian attempts to use the upgraded status to confront Israel in international bodies. The Palestinians now can gain access to U.N. agencies and international bodies, most significantly the International Criminal Court, which could become a springboard for going after Israel for alleged war crimes or its ongoing settlement building on war-won land. However, in the run-up to the U.N. vote, Abbas signaled that he wants recognition to give him leverage in future talks with Israel, and not as a tool for confronting or delegitimizing Israel, as Israeli leaders have alleged.

Tangled web: Tailblah Assoua is accused of pretending she married her husband's twin brother - a French citizen - so she could claim benefits . An Ivorian woman duped UK authorities and a vicar into thinking she had married her husband’s twin brother to fraudulently claim benefits, a court heard today. Tailblah Assoua, 34, formed a relationship Laurent Atte Aka, a man she had known in the Ivory Coast when she was still of school age, when she illegally came to the UK in 2002. Laurent was also in the country illegally and used his twin brother Barnard's identity because he was married to a French . woman and was able to stay in Europe. Assoua then became pregnant with Laurent's child but used his brother's details to register their daughter's birth. The pair then wed in in Plymouth, Devon, in 2006 by using the details of Laurent's brother. Prosecutor Brian Fitzherbert said Assoua used the French citizenship from the fake marriage to get a European Economic Area residence card and a National Insurance number. He told Plymouth Crown Court: 'She would not have been entitled to benefits without a National Insurance number. 'Her entitlement was based on the fact that her husband was an EU national.' Mr Fitzherbert said Assoua’s offences spanned six years between 2003 and 2009. He said she had lied about fleeing persecution and a polygamous marriage to an 'old man' in a village in her native Ivory Coast when she first approached the Home Office for permission to stay in the UK in April 2003. Assoua, who was pregnant, had claimed the child was the old man’s when, in fact, it was her husband’s. Mr Fitzherbert said: 'She claimed she had begun her journey from her village in March 2003. Trial: Assoua is accused of seeking to remain in the UK by deception, possessing false identity documents and fraud ay Plymouth Crown Court . 'She claimed she had flown to Britain via France but couldn’t say which British airport she had flown into. 'She claimed she used a passport that a friend had bought her. She said that passport was given to a lady who she couldn’t name when she got to the airport. 'She was then put on a bus to Exeter.' Mr Fitzherbert said Assoua had 'perhaps understandably' been desperate to get approval to stay in the UK as she had 'no legal status to remain and was three months pregnant'. He said: 'She made a clumsy attempt to dupe the authorities.' He added that her defence was that she 'genuinely believed Laurent was Auguste'. But Assoua’s husband Laurent told the court that they first met in Exeter in August 2002 - months before she told immigration officers she had arrived. Mr Fitzherbert asked Laurent where he and Assoua had spent Christmas in 2004 and he said they were together at his sister’s in London. Asked how his sister referred to him at this gathering he replied indignantly: 'Laurent'. Assoua, of Plymouth, is charged with seeking to remain in the country by deception, possessing false identity documents with intent, forgery of a registrar’s record, possession of an article for use in fraud, namely a national insurance card, and four counts of fraud against the city council. She denies all charges. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Tailblah Assoua and her partner Ivorian Laurent .

Three rhino horns worth tens of thousands of pounds have been stolen from a British museum. Thieves broke into the secure storage area at Leicester’s New Walk Museum and made off with the valuable pieces. Experts fear the items, which have been in museum’s collection for 50 years, may have been taken by an organised crime gang who plan to sell them on the black market. Rhino horns and elephant tusks can fetch tens of thousands of pounds in some Asian countries, where they are used as ingredients for traditional medicines and, in some cases, aphrodisiacs. Three rhino horns were stolen from a Leicester museum. Some Asian countries believe crushed horn has healing properties and use it to make traditional medicines (file picture) The rhino horns were stolen from a secure storage area at the New Walk Museum in Leicester (pictured) The theft comes as a spate of similar crimes have been reported across Europe. Last year European police agency Europol . have warned that crime gangs were targeting museums, particularly those in . smaller towns and cities, specifically for rhino horns. Museum staff are unsure about when the horns were taken, but the theft is believed to have happened in the past few months. Leicestershire Police was informed of the theft in September, when staff were sure the horns, which were kept in a storage area, had been stolen and not simply mislaid. Officers have now launched an investigation into the incident and recently arrested a 57-year-old man on suspicion of the theft. He has been released on police bail while officers continue their investigation. Leicester City Council, which runs the museum, said it had improved security since the incident came to light. The items have not been on public display . for many years because of the authority’s opposition to the trade in . endangered species’ body parts. A city council spokesman said: 'We can confirm that three rhino horns went missing from the museum stores in September. Rhino horns can fetch tens of thousands of pounds when sold on the black market (file picture) Rhino horn is made of keratin, which people in some Asian countries believe has healing properties. Traditional healers in Vietnam and China use it in a range of remedies, including cancer treatments and hangover cures. But doctors in the UK say rhino horn has no medicinal properties. According to environmentalists say that in the past five years, growing incomes in the Far East have meant more people can get access to crushed horn, despite the £35,000-per-kilo price tag. This has resulted in the number of rhinos being poached for their horns soaring. 'The practice of hunting rhinos for . their horns has decimated the population of several species and the . horns would never have been exhibited. 'But they have been in our possession for more than 50 years and we were very disappointed that they had been stolen. 'Since discovering the theft we have . had a complete review of security and access to our stores, and . implemented new and more stringent procedures.' Dr Dave Unwin, of the School of Museum Studies at the University of Leicester, said: “Rhino horns and, indeed, elephant tusks, are extremely valuable in Asia, where they are ground up and sold as medicine or aphrodisiacs. 'There has been a spate of these thefts across the country in recent years and these items can be sold for tens of thousands of pounds. 'So, the New Walk Museum is certainly not the first victim, but what is unusual here is that these items appear to have been stolen from an area which wasn’t easily accessible to the public.' A report by Europol last year highlighted the theft of rhino horns as a growing problem in the UK. The report said: 'The theft of rhino horn shows how organised criminals are always on the look-out for new and creative crime opportunities. 'The attraction towards rhino horn clearly stems from the high value of this rare commodity. 'Depending on the size and quality of the specimen, a rhino horn can be worth between 25,000 and 200,000 euros. 'Rhino horns are used for decoration, to produce luxury products and also used in traditional medicine, despite it being proven ineffective. The report highlighted one Irish gang’s methods. It said: 'To source and acquire rhino horns, the group has targeted antique dealers, auction houses, art galleries, museums, private collections and zoos, resorting to theft and aggravated burglary where necessary . 'To sell specimens, they have exploited international auction houses in the UK, France, USA and China.'

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:24 EST, 1 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:48 EST, 2 December 2012 . Mitt Romney's shadow looms over a Republican Party in disarray. The face of the GOP for much of the last year, the failed presidential candidate has been a virtual ghost since his defeat November 6. He has quietly weathered the fallout of the campaign from the seclusion of his Southern California home, emerging only momentarily for a private lunch at the White House with President Barack Obama on Thursday. Clash: Romney genuinely believed he had the upper hand in the contest against Barack Obama . Visitor: This image shows Big Bird, a focus of satire during the campaign, apparently dropping in on the meeting . His loss and immediate withdrawal from politics, while welcomed by most, has created a leadership vacuum within his party. Pumping gas at his local station in La Jolla, Romney was happy to talk about his California plans . It's left the GOP rudderless, lacking an overarching agenda and mired in infighting, with competing visions for the way ahead, during what may be the most important policy debate in a generation. In his final meeting with campaign staffers at his Boston headquarters, Romney promised to remain ‘a strong voice for the party,’ according to those in attendance. But so far he has offered little to the Capitol Hill negotiations over potential tax increases and entitlement program changes that could affect virtually every American. He declined to comment on the Treasury Department's recent refusal to declare China a currency manipulator, which was one of his signature issues over the past 18 months. He made no public remarks after his meeting with Obama, quickly fading away, again. ‘If I had to tell you somebody who is the leader of the party right now, I couldn't,’ said Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express, which is among the conservative factions vying for increased influence. ‘There's a void right now.’ There's no shortage of Republicans maneuvering to fill it, from House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio to a number of high-profile politicians looking to boost their national profiles, if not position themselves for a 2016 presidential run. That group could include former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, son and brother of former U.S. presidents, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The heir: Jeb Bush attending an event in Florida to support former candidates Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan . The voice: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie speaking at the Reagan Foundation Center For Public Affairs on September 27, 2011 . Republican officials acknowledge party tensions between the moderate and conservative wings, as well as the tea party and evangelical constituencies. But they dismiss the leadership vacuum as a standard political reality for the losing party in the presidential race. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, never had a strong relationship with the conservative base, given his more moderate past. Party officials are optimistic that a team of younger and more diverse leaders, drawn from the ranks of governors and Congress, will emerge in the coming months to help strengthen and unify what is now a party grappling with its identity. That list includes Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina. The rap fan: Florida Senator Marco Rubio speaking at the Republican National Convention in Tampa in August 2012 . The go-getter: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal speaking to reporters about the conditions in New Orleans, at the national Press Club in Washington DC. in May 2008 . The young governor: South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, 40, speaking to reporters in the spin room after the CMM debate in North Charleston on January 19, 2012 . The GOP was in disarray following its 2006 showing, searching for a new path and leader at a time when President George W. Bush was deeply unpopular. Arizona Senator John McCain, the 2008 presidential nominee, briefly assumed control of a party that he long had criticized, but it never really warmed to him. He lost to Obama, and shortly after that, the party turned to an African-American official, Michael Steele, to serve as its chief spokesman. But the decision was widely seen as a mistake, as Steele, a former Maryland lieutenant governor, presided over major financial problems as head of the Republican National Committee. All that created a leadership vacuum that helped give rise to the tea party movement in 2009 and sparked rounds of internal battles between party pragmatists and more extreme conservatives. Republican strategist Phil Musser is among those suggesting that the current void presents a breakout opportunity for the party chairman, Reince Priebus. The 40-year-old Midwesterner largely played a supporting administrative role in his first two years on the job. The fund-raiser: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus standing on the floor ahead of the Republican National Convention at the Tampa Bay Times Forum on August 26, 2012 . ‘To some degree it's a challenge in as much you don't have a standard bearer to rally behind that unifies central themes of the conservative movement,’ Musser said. ‘The bottom line is that a little bit of messiness and frank family discussion is not a terrible thing after an election like this.’ But Democrats are emboldened, both by their Election Day successes and the subsequent Republican discord. GOP factions are fighting over multiple issues: the ‘fiscal cliff,’ which will dominate the debate on Capitol Hill at least through the end of the year; blame for Romney's defeat; and how to appeal to a shifting and more diverse electorate and unify its message. The party's most passionate voters are reluctant to abandon hard-line immigration policies that have dominated their thinking for years. But Washington-based strategists describe a dire need to win over more Hispanic voters and other minorities who overwhelmingly supported Obama in the swing states that decided the election. At the same time, rank-and-file Republicans on Capitol Hill are struggling to coalesce behind a single message during fiscal cliff negotiations that have exposed a new rift with fiscal conservative guru Grover Norquist and his anti-tax pledge. There's also evidence that the fight isn't over between the conservative and pragmatic wings of the party in Senate primaries. Conservatives wasted littletime signaling that they would work to defeat Shelley Moore Capito, a popular congresswoman from a storied West Virginia political family, as she seeks the nomination for the chance to challenge Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller in 2014. Within an hour of Capito's announcing her candidacy, the deep-pocketed conservative Club for Growth branded her as the ‘establishment candidate’ whose record in Congress of supporting prominent bailouts has led to bigger government. Democratic opponent: West Virginia Representative Shelley Moore Capito listening to testimony during a hearing on the Dodd-Frank Act in Washington, D.C. in May 2012 . Democrats already are working to exploit the GOP divisions to strengthen their own political standing.Obama has taken his party's message directly to voters. He visited a Pennsylvania toy manufacturer on Friday, calling for Republicans to embrace the immediate extension of tax cuts for all but the top 2 per cent of wealthiest Americans. Though Boehner has taken the lead in negotiations with the White House, Republicans generally did not have a standard-bearer to counter that message. Instead, they're relying on familiar Capitol Hill leaders to guide party doctrine during his debate. ‘We don't have one person out there carrying that torch. You'll have (South Carolina Senator) Lindsey Graham, Speaker Boehner, (Wisconsin Representative) Paul Ryan, John McCain – same old, same old,’ said Republican strategist Hogan Gidley, a senior official on former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum's unsuccessful presidential bid. ‘Void of a singular leader, we're going to have to rely on some of the younger more dynamic speakers to go out and make our argument.’ The speaker: House Sopeaker John Boehner pausing during a news conference in Washington, D.C. on November 30, 2012 . No one, it seems, is talking about Romney assuming any sort of leadership role. ‘I don't think that we need to be looking toward Mitt Romney to articulate our principles,’ said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder and national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots. It appears Romney may cooperate, choosing business over politics in defeat. The former businessman is subletting office space at the Boston-area venture capital firm, Solamere Capital, which was founded by his oldest son. Former aides expect Romney to stay out of the spotlight for the foreseeable future – spending colder months at his California home and warmer months at his New Hampshire lake house. ‘It might be better for him, better for the party, to start fresh,’ Gidley said. A happy Thanksgiving: Romney has kept a pretty low public profile since his defeat on Nov. 6. He is pictured here with his wife, Ann, on Thanksgiving .","With Romney out of the picture, conservatives are eying a growing leadership void within the Republican party as new potential leaders emerge .

Blackness: The 68-year-old thought up the idea after moving to Cleveland, which was once home to over 100 iron mines, producing over 444,000 tonnes of iron every year between the 1880s to the 1930s . The 68-year-old thought up the idea after moving to the Cleveland area, a part of the country which was once home to over 100 iron mines, producing over 444,000 tons of iron every year between the 1880s to the 1930s. Thousands of men and boys were employed to work as miners, making it a vital national industry. John, a painter, said: 'The mine is as close to a 100 per cent replica of a Cleveland Ironstone mine as you will find. 'I moved in here 15 years ago - the house is a barn conversion with a conventional garden but plenty of land. 'Having moved from out of the area, I started to become interested in local history and this part of the world is notorious for its mining background. 'I began talking to an unemployed local lad and we both shared an interest in medieval ruins.' Accurate: The mine was mostly built using salvaged authentic materials that John scoured the region for . Tunnel: Many of the fixings in the structure were actually used in mines . He added: 'I visited a mine nearby in North Skelton, and it was an experience I will never forget. 'But it made me want to preserve Cleveland's identity so, as you do, I decided to dig up the garden!' John embedded two shafts into an embankment and installed a headstock tower - where men and ironstone would be lifted in an out of the mine. He also fitted a headstock for the upcast shaft that allows the mine to be ventilated and allows a small amount of light into the ground below. Underground, he dug up the land using a JCB and built subterranean mine workings - a narrow gauge where a railed tramway led to a tippler staith and tubs of ironstone from the mine were tipped into the carts below. The whole operation is ventilated to ensure water does not get in and flood the underground area. His latest addition to the model mine is a lamp house, situated on the ground above, which draws air into the mine and would have been where lamps were cleaned and prepared ready to take down into the pit. Left for John to complete is a mine office, which will be built close to John's house. John said: 'I have spent 13 years completing the mine but I want it to look authentic, like it's from the 1840s. Into the daylight: John extensively researched the iron industry of Cleveland for the mammoth undertaking . Echoes of history: John said: 'I want it to look abandoned, as if miners have just up and left' Structure: John still has to build a mine office, which will be close to his house . 'I want it to look abandoned, as if miners have just up and left. 'I believe it's the only one of its type in the country.' 'I've loved every minute building it and there's never been a point where I've said to myself, I'm sick of this. 'It will be very interesting for anyone interested in history and ironstone mining.' John has used all reclaimed materials to build the mine, collecting them from local builders, scrapyards and local markets to make it as authentic as possible. He said: 'Everything is an exact version of what was in the smaller old mines. 'I've consulted experts, used my own knowledge of ironstone mines and read lots of old books to get everything accurate. 'It's a very green project - I've also planted wild flowers and plants, and hope to attract natural wildlife and birds to the site.' Built next to the roman road, 'Via de Whitby', John is hoping his project will help put Cleveland back on the mining map and act as a tribute to those who worked on them. Track: These rails (left) were used to transport carts laden with ore. The shaft is ventilated for safety (right) Deep: John's recreation has with two minehead shafts, a narrow gauge tramway and 150ft of subterranean mine tunnelling . He said: 'I've had potash miners visit whose fathers were in the ironstone mines and they say it's just like the real thing. 'There's no memorial like this to the ironstone miners of Cleveland. 'And without Cleveland's ironstone, there would be no Teesside steel industry as we know it today.' He hopes that people with an interest will come and see how an iron mine used to run, first-hand. He said: 'It's lots of fun. In my mind I can't spend an afternoon inside when there's exciting things to do outside. John, describes himself as single, but is still hoping for a young lady who would like to share a ruin in a nature reserve. He is prepared to welcome organised groups if they want a free tour of his site.","John Wiggins spent 13 years on the amazing structure .

Manufacturers Vat19 claim that this 27lb monster - known as the 'gummy party python' will kill you if you attempt to eat it in one sitting. And at a staggering 36,000 calories per snake - or nearly 18-and-a-half times an adult's recommended daily calorie intake - it's hardly surprising that you'll get more than a sugar rush if you choose to part with the $150 price tag.

It's recommends that the treat is to be shared, or eaten alone in 306 separate sugary servings. The hand-made treat comes in two flavours, either blue raspberry with green apple or red cherry. Generously described as the Lamborghini of the sweet world, the gummy party python has proved a hit already, with the website currently out of stock. Manufacturers claim that it has lifelike details including including intricate eyes, blended colouring, ridged coils, and thousands of individually carved scales.

The company also produces a giant gummy cola bottle which is 90 times the size of a regular sweet. The snake is not the biggest sweet treat ever produced.

Neighbours could be forced to settle their boundary disputes outside the court-room, saving themselves six-figure fees in the process. A bill to end the ‘daft and unnecessary’ court battles over just inches of land will be considered by ministers today. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke will try to end the costly legal fights which have seen one set of warring neighbours fork out up to £400,000 for a 60cm wide strip of land. Row: Neighbours could be forced to settle their boundary disputes outside the court-room (file picture) Impartial surveyors, rather than judges, would be given the power to sort out the wrangles under the Dover & Deal MP’s Bill. Each party would pay for their own legal costs, although the surveyor would have discretion to award costs. Mr Elphicke said his proposal would provide a ‘fast, cheap and effective’ process. Most of the disputes involve trivial amounts of land and are usually started by one neighbour encroaching on another’s with their fence or a hedge. The row escalates when the vegetation is cut down or the fences are torn down. Families can often end up in court and the costs can soar so quickly that both parties dig in to try to recover their fees - making mediation less likely. Inches: Neighbours have often spent thousands on legal bills trying to settle disputes over tiny bits of land between homes (file picture) One boundary disputed in Hertfordshire was started by planners who used a thick pen to mark out boundaries on a small-scale plan. The area was just 60cm wide yet the legal costs ran to £400,000. In Cheltenham, two neighbours warred over a six metre square patch of land for two years. The court costs ended up soaring to £160,000. One boundary dispute over a driveway turned nasty when a farmer was accused of firing a shot at his neighbour who had chased a runaway horse that had strayed on to his property. It turned out the shot had actually been fired from a booby trap, rather than a gun, but not before police helicopters and armed officers descended on to the property. Mr Elphicke’s Bill - which would apply to England and Wales - is based on the Party Wall Act, where any disputes are settled through surveyors rather than judges. Mr Elphicke urged the government to ‘stop sitting on the fence’ and back his bill, adding: ‘We’ve seen cases where £100,000 or more is spent arguing over a two- foot strip of land. 'This is barmy and reform is urgently needed to stamp out boundary disputes. 'This is why I have tabled a bill that will do just that. I hope the Government will consider the bill and allow it to go forward.’ It is understand that the Department for Justice could allow the Bill to go forward. Although it may not become law, there are hopes that ministers will use it to amend existing rules.","A bill to end 'daft and unnecessary' court battles over inches of land will be debated by ministers today .

A small bronze sculpture that was dismissed as a 'humble' paperweight for decades has been confirmed as an £80,000 Barbara Hepworth. The 1965 work, called Oval Form, sat on the headteacher's desk at St Ives School for years and was originally used as a house prize when students performed well. But was revealed as 'probably the most expensive paperweight in the world' by stunned experts on BBC's Antiques Roadshow on Sunday. The £80,000 sculpture Oval Form, pictured, was originally used as a prize for academic achievement before it became one of the world's most expensive paperweights . David Harris, St Ives School head, said the paperweight would not leave the school in Cornwall, despite its value. He said: 'It's sitting on my desk so it's probably the most expensive paperweight in the world. Dame Barbara Hepworth, pictured, was a governor at St Ives School in Cornwall and gave the sculpture as a gift. She died in 1975 . 'We have links to the art scene because we live and work in St Ives so we knew it was valuable but we'd not had it valued. We didn't know it was that valuable. 'Not that it is of any consequence because it's the school's and it will remain the school's. It's a fabulous piece of work and it's something which we do treasure.' Mr Harris said Oval Form was given to the school by the artist - who used to be a governor there - many years ago as a gift. It was used as a prize for the house that achieved the most academic merits each term. St Ives School librarian Jan Wardman took the 'paperweight' to show experts on the popular BBC show in Falmouth and beamed as she was told the news. Visibly excited Rupert Maas, an expert in ceramics and glass, told the show: 'It's by Barbara Hepworth. 'This is English Modernism, you know, you cannot confuse it with anything else. 'It is very tactile and made of bronze. It's worth £60,000 to £80,000. And it's a very important thing. It's a seriously exciting find. 'There's a lovely sense to it and turning it around is quite fun because it looks completely different from all angles. 'It's easy to forget that here in Cornwall we're actually at the cutting edge of Modernism really. Barbara Hepworth was really at the forefront of British Modernism.' Tourists flock to St Ives to see Barbara Hepworth's large bronze Modernist sculptures in the Hepworth Memorial Garden. Another sculpture sits outside the . Guildhall, home to St Ives Town Council but this smaller example of her . work is not widely known. TV antiques expert Rupert Maas, pictured, described the piece as a 'seriously exciting find' and said it was worth up to £80,000 . The staggering valuation of the bronze was a surprise to the school, who expected it to be worth considerably less. Mr Harris added: 'It's not something we let out of our sight now. 'The guy on Antiques Roadshow said it will be in the upper reaches because it's such a beautiful domestic piece. 'For them it was a significant find. It did look lovely on the television with the light catching it. It is beautiful and a very tactile piece.' The school is now considering creating imitations of the original to hand out as school prizes. Oval Form is in good company at the school, which has two Leonard Fuller paintings and a Hyman Segal sculpture.","Sculpture was originally used as a prize for academic achievement .

Nick Boles, pictured, came under fire from conservationists for making decisions 'on the back of a fag packet' The Planning Minister was accused of allowing developers to ‘let rip’ on the countryside last night, as he warned up to two million acres of green fields may have to be dug up for new housing. Nick Boles came under fire from conservationists for making decisions ‘on the back of a fag packet’ after he declared that the amount of land under development in the UK may have to increase by a third to tackle the housing shortage. They branded the former think tank boss an ‘intellectual gadfly’ and urged him to ‘get serious’, adding new building should focus on so-called brownfield sites that have previously been developed. Mr Boles told BBC2’s Newsnight programme that ministers would protect the Green Belt – but warned that large areas of ‘open land’ may have to be given over for housing. While Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, acknowledged that more housing was needed, he warned against allowing developers free rein. He also pointed out official figures  suggest 12 per cent of England is already built on. Mr Spiers said: ‘Rather than giving up on good planning and allowing housebuilders to let rip, we should be re-using the tens of thousands of hectares of brownfield land available for high quality affordable housing. ‘When he was running a think tank, Nick Boles specialised in interesting if somewhat unrealistic ideas. He is no longer an intellectual gadfly – he is a minister with a serious job.’ Ben Cowell of the National Trust said: ‘I think these figures sound very much like “back of the fag packet” calculations to me. Mr Boles told BBC2's Newsnight programme that ministers would protect the Green Belt - but warned that large areas of 'open land' may have to be given over for housing . ‘Three per cent of the country is an area about the size of Cornwall and we don’t think that you need to build on greenfield land to quite this extent. We need to integrate properly new development into the landscape. ‘Making an announcement like this about opening up a third of extra land for development sort of opens the floodgates to  development that isn’t planned in that way.’ Sue Holden, chief executive of the Woodland Trust, described Mr Boles’s intervention as ‘extremely disconcerting’.  She said house building on the scale he outlined would fuel massive demand for quarrying and result in ‘further fragmentation of irreplaceable habitats’. However Mr Boles’s intervention was welcomed by business. Corin Taylor, of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Nick Boles is absolutely right – we need more housing, and the only way to get it is to build it.’ Speaking to the BBC, Mr Boles also hit out at developers for building ‘pig ugly’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting new development. Mr Boles will step up his campaign today with a speech to planners in which he will vow to take on Nimbys and local authorities who try to block new housing.","Nick Boles branded 'intellectual gadfly' and conservationists urged him to 'get serious', adding new building should focus on sites already developed .

A retired couple say they must knock down and rebuild their £800,000 home, after 500 litres of toxic kerosene was accidentally pumped into it - but their insurers refuse to pay the cost. The delivery of the highly toxic kerosene had been intended for their neighbours but a new tanker driver picked the wrong pipe and sent it gushing into the side of their house. Now, 11 months after the accident, Trevor and Elizabeth Piggott have filed a High Court claim for the cost of rebuilding the five-bedroom property to eliminate the toxic vapours that still contaminate it. Dispute: Trevor and Elizabeth Piggott say their home must be demolished and rebuilt after an oil company accidentally pumped 500 litres of kerosene into the property . Retired businessman Mr Piggott, 66, . said: ‘We can’t move back in because it remains contaminated. You can . still smell the kerosene in every corner of the house. ‘We simply can’t accept that through . no fault of our own we should have our home seriously devalued and left . stinking of dangerous chemicals. ‘Our only recourse has been to pay our . own costs and go to law to argue that to decontaminate it entirely it . would need to be demolished and a new property built.’ The couple were preparing breakfast in their designer kitchen on December 29 last year when disaster struck. 'I wasn't even dressed,' recalled Mrs . Piggott, 65. 'We were recovering from having 21 family and friends for . Boxing Day and it was one of those lazy mornings between Christmas and . New Year. 'We saw the oil tanker pull up outside . to deliver next door and Trevor said he was going to have a word with . the driver because on recent deliveries they had spilt oil into the . hedgerow outside causing it to die back. 'Something distracted us and a couple of minutes later this young man was running up our drive shouting, “Where's your tank?”. ‘The answer was that we don’t have an . oil tank as this property has been on Calor gas for 20 years. When . Trevor went outside to see what was happening, he found himself paddling . in oil. It was the start of a nightmare which is still going on.' Home area: The couple's house is in the hamlet of Little Billington in Bedfordshire, near Leighton Buzzard . The company, GB Oils, have admitted . liability for the error which was caused by a new employee attaching the . tanker full of kerosene to the wrong pipe at the front of the . properties in the hamlet of Little Billington, Bedfordshire. Inexplicably, he had not seen the pipe . on the right which served the Piggott's neighbours and instead blasted . in excess of 500 litres of oil through the redundant pipe which led to . the side of their bungalow. Within seconds the oil dispersed into . the clay-built foundations of the £800,000 detached bungalow which . stands in five acres of land. Worse still, the vapours from the oil . permeated every corner of the home and its contents. 'We just woke up one morning and lost our happy home of 14 years' Elizabeth Piggott . Within hours, GB Oils had sent out a . 'spill team' followed by an environmental rep from their insurers with a . meter to test for dangerous fumes. 'Wherever he went in the house be it the conversion upstairs or downstairs, his meter was glowing red,' said Mrs Piggott. 'He just said, ""This is extremely serious. You can't stay here. You must go to a hotel"". The fumes were just overwhelming. 'All the Christmas decorations were up, the fridge was full of food and drink for New Year but we ended up fleeing to a hotel.’ The next day, the spill team fitted an . extractor fan to a hole punched through the foundations and told the . couple to close the doors and windows to allow it to work effectively. They left at 4pm on Friday, telling them they would be back after the . long New Year weekend. Admission: The company, GB Oils (whose head office in Warrington is pictured), have admitted liability for the error which was caused by a new employee attaching the tanker full of kerosene to the wrong pipe . 'I remember trying to cook us a meal,' said Mrs Piggott, 'but the fumes were too much. I felt nauseous and had . a headache. My husband, who has had a bad heart, was sick and started . getting palpitations. 'Despite making endless calls, no-one . got back to us until the following Tuesday so we were left to cope with . this appalling situation on our own. We ended up retrieving what we . could and going to our daughter’s house.’ When their own insurers, Lloyds, sent a . loss adjustor to assess the damage, the Piggotts were told that it . could be ‘remediated’. 'Our experts have said that kerosene contains some volatile components and if you can smell them there is a risk to health' Trevor Piggott . Large trenches have been dug at other . end of the property in an attempt to flush out the oil and the Piggott’s . have been told that there is no more that the insurance companies are . willing to do. So, 11 months on, the home that had . been the hub of their family life, looks like a crime scene with warning . tape stretched around it, large holes leading into the foundations and . its interior covered in polythene sheeting. The heady smell of chemicals . remains. The Piggott's High Court papers claim . damages ‘in excess of £300,000 from the oil company and their home . insurers, Lloyds TSB including £60,258.05 for the contents of their home . which were ruined in the accident along with  losses for personal . injury, and costs. ‘Our experts have said that kerosene . contains some volatile components and if you can smell them there is a . risk to health,’ said Mr Piggott. Building changes: When their own insurers, Lloyds, sent a loss adjustor to assess the damage, the Piggotts were told that it could be 'remediated' (file picture) ‘To decontaminate the house entirely . it would need to be demolished and a new property built. Their . remediation has not gone far enough. 'At least they should have excavated . the entire downstairs, removed the contaminated soil and installed a . vapour membrane in the damp proof course.’ The trauma has triggered bouts of . insomnia in Mrs Piggott, a mother of four and grandmother of nine. 'We . are confident that Mr and Mrs Piggot’s home can be restored to its . original state with no requirement for demolition, based on the advice . we have received from oil spill remediation experts' Lloyds TSB spokesman . ‘We . just woke up one morning and lost our happy home of 14 years,’ she . added. 'It is our major asset, our retirement fund and was our pride and . joy. ‘You would hope that insurance . companies would be there for you. All we seek is a fair and just . response to this dreadful incident from those responsible.’ A spokesman for Lloyds TSB said: ‘We . are confident that Mr and Mrs Piggot’s home can be restored to its . original state with no requirement for demolition, based on the advice . we have received from oil spill remediation experts. ‘We appreciate this is a stressful . time for our customers and are committed to supporting them through the . period of their claim.’ A spokesman for Warrington based GB .

Now and then: Doctors told Daniel Tamburro (now, left) if they had not caught the growth his heart would have exploded (after the operation, right) Doctors performed an X-ray which revealed a large shadow on his left lung but medics were left in shock when a CT scan revealed a grapefruit-sized cyst pressing against his heart. They said it  was growing at such a rapid rate it was literally forcing his major organs across to the opposite side of his body. He underwent a six hour operation at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, in June to remove the 15cm by 12cm growth. But, remarkably, Mr Tamburro was back at work as a production assistant within three months of the massive operation and has since made a full recovery.

Mr Tamburro had been planning a holiday for the end of June. But doctors told him if he had left the cyst untreated until then, it would have killed him. He added: “Doctors said if I had gone on holiday in a plane like we were planning to in June, the pressure would’ve been too much and my heart would’ve exploded. 'I’m very grateful to the hospital for operating so quickly. 'My parents were really worried about it and my girlfriend Danielle hated it because the operation was on her 18th birthday.

But the Star of Caledonia’s designers hope the 121ft-high sculpture – set to dominate the skyline east of the M74 in Dumfriesshire – will help transform the area’s economy. Motorists crossing the Border near Gretna will be confronted by the enormous structure – almost twice the height of the Angel of the North, the roadside sculpture at Gateshead in Tyne and Wear – from 2014, in time for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Planned: The Star of Caledonia will stand 121ft high over the M74 in Dumfriesshire . However, its size is matched by the near £5million cost – with taxpayers likely to foot most of the bill. Arts quango Creative Scotland has pledged £1million and project organisers are hoping to raise another £3.8million from other sources. The scheme will be submitted for planning permission this week but last night there was concern over the scale of spending on the brainchild of architectural guru Charles Jencks and Cecil Balmond, joint designer of the Orbit tower in London’s Olympic Park. Olympics: Cecil Balmond jointly designed the Orbit tower, pictured in London¿s Olympic Park, with Anish Kapoor . Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers cannot afford to splash out millions on this piece of work. If the sculpture is truly popular it should not need a bail-out from an unelected quango. Creative Scotland appears willing to spend taxpayers’ money like there’s an endless pot of gold.’ The Star of Caledonia is intended to celebrate Scotland’s scientific contribution to the world and pays homage to James Clerk Maxwell, the Edinburgh-born physicist and mathematician noted for his ground-breaking work in electromagnetic theory. Rods will depict an electromagnetic field, with the solar-powered glass tips of each one illuminated at night, while the sun will sparkle from them during the day. They will be painted black at the end to ‘disembody’ the lights and create a floating effect. The project team hopes it will do for the area what Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North – widely credited with prompting the regeneration of Gateshead over the past 15 years – did for Tyneside. Mr Jencks believes his latest project will be equally transformational. He said: ‘Crossing the Border to Scotland across the River Sark is now a passage obscured under a bridge by cars travelling at speed. ‘Instead of marking this with motorway signs we are using a sculpture that pulls together the site, the distant hills and the Solway.’ Dwarfed: The planned 121ft sculpture will tower over the 65ft Angel of the North in Gateshead, left, and the 65ft bronze Damien Hirst statue called Verity in Ilfracombe, Devon .","Arts quango Creative Scotland has .

A mushroom farm based in disused railway tunnels was in fact a front for a sophisticated cannabis operation with a potential annual turnover of more than £2m. Police raided the underground business after a tip-off and found a warren of industrial-sized growing rooms hidden behind fortress-like steel gates. Today four men were jailed for their part in the operation at the disused Faenol Tunnels on the Menai Business Park at Bangor, north Wales. Entrance to the site: The cannabis farm was protected by two sets of steel doors and gates . Sophisticated operation: The court heard how considerable effort had been put into making the underground drug farm . In May, police officers acting on information raided the premises and found the hidden industrial sized cannabis laboratories. Inside was a cabin with a concealed trap door leading down through a tunnel to five large growing rooms - one of which housed cannabis with an estimated street value of £225,000. But the potential annual turnover was between £1.5 million and £2 million. A judge was today given a virtual tour of the operation by video at Mold Crown Court, where the men were sentenced after earlier guilty pleas. Retired builder and great grandfather . Gerald Davies, 63, of Craig y Don Road, Bangor, and Kenneth . John Vincent, 59, a buildings designer from York Terrace, Beaumaris, . admitted producing cannabis and conspiring to supply the class B drug. They were each jailed for three years and four months. Gerald Davies, left, and Kenneth Vincent, right, were each jailed for three years and four months . Phillip Bigley, left, and Christopher McIntyre, right, were each sentenced to 12 months in prison . Two other men who worked as gardeners at the tunnels were also jailed. Philip Joseph Bigley, 22, of Cottage Close in Liverpool and Christopher James McIntyre, 30, of Appleby Drive in Bootle, received 12 months each after admitting production charges. Mr Recorder Timothy Petts, sitting at Mold Crown Court, said it was described by the police as one of the best cannabis factories ever found in North Wales in recent history. But it was clear that others, the brains behind the elaborate venture, should be in the dock as well, he said. Deep underground: The disused railway tunnels housed a warren of tunnels devoted to growing vast quantities of the Class B drug . Elaborate: A trapdoor in the floor of the railway tunnel led to where the cannabis production was taking place . 'There should be others standing alongside you in the dock today,' he said. He . accepted that Davies and Vincent had been involved in a legitimate . operation, Menai Mushrooms, at the tunnels, but they had then been . pressurised into setting up the cannabis farm. This . was a facility on any view capable of producing at least £1.5 million . worth of cannabis a year,' he said.  'This was no small scale set up.' Prosecutor Gareth Preston said that in 2009 or 2010 Gerald Davies, a local builder, met a director of the Faenol Estate when the BBC hosted an event there. A peppercorn rent was agreed for the use of the tunnels, and Davies and Vincent set about establishing the mushroom business. They talked to a local expert with a view to growing specialist shiitake and chestnut mushrooms, and signed him up to provide advise and to visit once a fortnight.  But the court heard the mushroom expert was deterred from attending with various excuses. It was his view that the mushroom farm could easily have been expanded to provide a potential annual yield of £145,000. 'This was no small scale set-up': Cannabis drying inside the secret drug farm in north Wales . The court heard how considerable work took place to transform the old tunnels into a sophisticated farm, with trees cleared, a road reinstated and the tunnel floors lined with 40 tonnes of aggregate. Large steel interior and exterior doors were fitted, and an elaborate trapdoor and tunnel led from the mushroom growing area into the cannabis operation.  Vincent even took photographs of the work at various stages on his iPhone, later found by police working on Operation Gumshoe. Ventilation and electrical work were carried out, and a sub-station installed, all covered by CCTV. The electricity was by-passed at one stage. At 7.30am on May 9 this year police entered the left-hand tunnel and became aware of the smell of cannabis. Secret lair: This picture taken from a police video shows a cabin inside the cannabis farm that was discovered by officers working on Operation Gumshoe . They found the trap door and tunnel leading to the cannabis factory and Davies was arrested. Vincent was stopped by police in a Mercedes car on the junction of the A55 and A487 at Ffordd y Parc. He had keys to the tunnel, and a journal charting the progress of the work was found. He confirmed that there were no booby traps on site to injure officers. The covert part of the tunnels were divided into 11 distinct areas over 70m with a staff area with microwave, television and CD player, five growing rooms, and four irrigation rooms. There were 1,207 plants in various stages of growth with blocks capable of supporting a further 1,600 plants. The potential yields was estimated at £254,000. The illegal set-up was decommissioned by an expert who said the extraction system was silenced and filtered to remove the pungent smell of cannabis production. The lighting and watering systems were all automated, and he discovered 88 lighting units, 11 fans and nine silencers. 'The officer in the case described the set up as one of the best he had encountered in 22 years of service as a drugs officer,' said Mr Preston. 'The simple fact is that this is one of the best-designed and constructed commercial operations that North Wales Police have ever encountered.'Davies told police he had been approached to look after the place, had invested his £40,000 savings into the venture, he was retired and said he felt pressurised into taking part in the venture. Vincent said he was a self-employed commercial building designer, but was bankrupt. He worked with Davies in the Menai Mushrooms operation and agreed he was involved in designing the operation. McIntyre agreed that it was him photographed at the site from the CCTV, said that he worked there to pay off a £3,000 debt, and would sleep on site. It was his job to ensure water butts were full. Bigley, who had a long standing issue with cannabis, declined to comment but his DNA was found on a cigarette butt. The defence stressed that the mushroom operation had been a genuine business but Davies and Vincent had come under pressure by men from Liverpool who saw the tunnels as an ideal cannabis factory.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:29 EST, 3 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:45 EST, 3 December 2012 . Potentially lethal carbon monoxide levels in an Atlanta elementary school sent 42 students and six adults to hospitals Monday amid the evacuation of about 500 students, authorities said. A teacher and a cafeteria worker were among patients treated after firefighters responded to Finch Elementary School shortly after 8 a.m., Atlanta, fire Capt. Marian McDaniel told The Associated Press. Firefighters were initially told that people were unconscious at the school, but none were when fire crews arrived. All of the patients were conscious and alert, as they were being taken to hospitals, McDaniel said. Dangerous: A potentially lethal carbon monoxide leak put 42 elementary students in the hospital and forced hundred to evacuate from a school in Atlanta, Georgia. Devastating: Many of the students suffered from the gas and were given mask to help their breathing. Source: The carbon monoxide leak was attributed to one of the school's furnaces. Video on WSB-TV showed rescue crews carrying young children strapped to gurneys with oxygen masks on their faces. Firefighters detected high and unsafe levels of carbon monoxide near a furnace at the school, which is on the city's southwest side, McDaniel said. She called the reading - 1,700 parts per million - extremely high. 'It was one of the highest we've seen,' she said. The colorless, odorless gas can be deadly at that level, one expert said. 'Seventeen hundred parts per million is potentially lethal if exposed to it for a period of time,' said Stephanie Hon, assistant director of the Georgia Poison Center. Children could be affected faster than adults and are generally affected at lower parts per million, Hon said. She said it's easy for initial symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning to be confused with the flu since both include malaise, headache, nausea and vomiting. A few key differences: Carbon monoxide poisoning generally does not cause a fever and generally a person starts feeling better once he or she is moved to an area with fresh air, Hon said. Hon said it was fortunate the children . do not appear to have suffered severe symptoms and said that was likely . due to a short exposure time and perhaps the location of the leak being . some distance from where the children were. 'The . good news is that they sound like mild to moderate symptoms,' Hon said. 'Luckily those kinds of exposures do not carry significant long-term . health risks, especially with the children involved.' It . was not immediately known if the school had a carbon monoxide detector. If it didn't, Hon said, 'A carbon monoxide detector, if appropriately . used and installed and checked often, could have very well been a . warning for this school system.' Life-threatening: Police say the levels of carbon monoxide were 'extremely' high and that it could have been deadly. Damage: Officials say victims only experienced moderate symptoms, including difficulty breathing, nausea and headaches. Some parents, however, criticized the school for its handling of the situation. Makisha Hamilton told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she had no idea anything happened to her two children until running into a neighbor at the school. It turned out that her oldest son was taken to the hospital, a fact that Hamilton said she would not have known had it not been for her neighbor. 'This wasn’t organized at all,' she said. An Atlanta Public Schools spokesman did not immediately return calls for comment. A total of 42 students and six adults were taken to hospitals, Atlanta Public Schools said on its official Twitter site. Other students from the school were taken to Brown Middle School for the rest of the day, and were being released to their parents, Atlanta Public Schools said in a statement on its official Twitter site. Meanwhile, firefighters were ventilating the school in an attempt to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide, McDaniel said. In Baltimore last year, school officials vowed to put carbon monoxide detectors in all of the school system's approximately 200 schools after two carbon monoxide leaks within a week's time at one of the schools. City officials in Baltimore said the battery-powered detectors cost $15 each wholesale.","A carbon monoxide leak at an Atlanta elementary school sent 42 students and six adults to the hospital Monday .

Authorities wouldn't say how he killed himself, only that he was alone in his cell. An autopsy will be conducted. Keyes flew from Alaska to Chicago with the intent of kidnapping and killing someone, drove to Vermont and picked the Curriers, a couple in their 50s, at random, officials in Vermont said. Informing the public: Essex Junction Police Chief Brad Larose, left, speaks at a news conference on Monday, where he revealed that Keyes had implicated himself in the Curriers' murder .

February 17 to Anchorage, where he sent another text message demanding . ransom and directing it to the account connected to the stolen debit . card, according to prosecutors. Keyes made . withdrawals from automated teller machines in Alaska, Arizona, New . Mexico and Texas before his arrest in Texas, according to prosecutors.

Certificates of presumed death were issued over the summer and a memorial service was held in late summer, she said. Vermont authorities called Chates on Sunday to tell her of Keyes' suicide. 'After some thinking, our family has been saved the long road ahead - trials, possible plea agreements and possible appeals – and perhaps this was the best thing that could have happened,' she said from her home in Florida Sunday evening.

A retired Nato scientist is hoping to make history by sailing a four foot remote-controlled model boat across the Atlantic. Robin Lovelock, 65, hopes to become the first person to sail an unmanned craft - named Snoopy Sloop - 6,000 miles across the ocean as part of the Microtransat Challenge, launched in 2010. The 30lb home made boat, constructed for . less than £450 and put together in Robin's games room at his . Sunninghill, Berkshire, home, will attempt to sail the seas powered by . wind and a solar-powered GPS and steering system. Scroll down for video . Challenge: Retired NATO scientist is trying to make history by engineering the first unmanned vessel to cross the Atlantic and to keep himself from taking the task too seriously, he's made the vessel a toy boat with a Snoopy figure attached . Labour of love: Mr Lovelock has spent four years crafting the four foot boat at a cost of around £450 . Although Robin was more accustomed to developing military computer systems for Nato in his day job, he has constructed a pretty resilient boat - it has already sailed 5,000 miles, albeit in the comparatively still waters of Bray Lake near Windsor, over the last seven months. Robin has already mapped out his route and will depart Barton-On-Sea on Saturday heading along the English Channel before heading south towards the Azores and then off towards the Bahamas, hoping to eventually land in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The painstaking voyage, which will see Robin given hourly updates on the boat's progress along its pre-programmed route via satellite, could take as long as six months. Resilient: Robin's craft has already sailed around 5,000 miles, albeit on the still waters of Bray Lake near Windsor . Slow progress: The journey to the shores of America will not be a quick one - it's expected to take six months . He says that a miniature Snoopy figure placed on board the tiny boat is to poke fun at academics who take the challenge 'far too seriously.' Robin told the Telegraph: 'I got hooked about four years ago. I didn’t even play with model boats when I was a boy. 'I sometimes tinker on the boat in the lounge, but am usually banished to the games room by my wife.' Helped by a team that includes a veteran of BBC's Robot Wars, Mr Lovelock seems to be confident that he will complete the challenge - he has already programmed the return route into the boat's navigation system. The first Microtransat competition took place on a lake near Toulouse, France in June 2006 with three teams taking part. A team from Aberystwyth University attempted the first transatlantic crossing in September 2010 setting sail from Valentia, County Kerry, Ireland. But the team lost its track of the craft off the north west coast of Ireland. The challenge has been attempted three times since 2010, with all three attempts failing. Three more attempts have been registered for this year. Construction: Robin has been helped by a team of friends, including a veteran of BBC's Robot Wars .

A pensioner was dragged to her death when her shopping bag became trapped in a taxi door as it drove off, an inquest heard. Maureen Harrison, 72, was pulled 10 feet along the road outside her home in Bristol by the vehicle after she accidentally shut the holdall in the door. Unsuspecting taxi driver Stephen Edwards pulled Mrs Harrison to the ground and towed her along the road as the widow clung to the bag. She suffered horrific injuries, including a fractured skull, pelvis, collarbone, spine and ribs. Scene of the tragedy: Victoria Terrace, Bristol, near to Mrs Harrison's home . Mrs Harrison died in hospital five days later from a bleed in her brain - the day after her 72nd birthday. Mr Edwards, 63, broke down in tears as he told the inquest at Flax Bourton, North Somerset, he had only stopped his taxi in Victoria Terrace after he heard a horrified passer-by shouting. He said that just moments earlier he had dropped 'frail and wobbly' Mrs Harrison off outside her house and she had waved him off. 'She got out of the car, she had a shopping bag,' he said . 'She slammed the door and said ""Drive on driver, go on, go on, cheerio"". 'I drove off and I was dragging her down the road and I didn’t even know because she was below the window. 'Someone said ""Stop, stop, stop!"" and I did. She was lying in the road.' The driver said Mrs Harrison was an 'independent' lady who would not have accepted help getting out of his silver Skoda. 'I drove off and I was dragging her down the road and I didn’t even know because she was below the window. 'Someone said ""Stop, stop, stop!"" and I did. She was lying in the road.' The inquest heard the incident happened at 12.40pm on September 13 last year. Mrs Harrison was dropped off after she had been shopping in the city's upmarket suburb of Clifton. Mr Edwards told the court he had only realised the elderly lady was being pulled behind him when onlooker Jim Kelliher, 43, raised the alarm. Mr Kelliher said: 'She got out of the car and I saw her close the door. 'She had her handbag, it was stuck in the door. As the taxi drove off I saw her going down sideways. 'I got out my car and stood over Mrs Harrison because she was on the floor. By that time she was unconscious.' Mrs Harrison was taken to the Bristol Royal Infirmary for treatment for fractures, head injuries and bruises. She initially seemed to be stable but her condition rapidly deteriorated and she suffered further bleeding in her brain and died at 6.35am on September 18. Mrs Harrison was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary but died five days later . Dr Sanchit Mehendale , a consultant in trauma and orthopaedics at Bristol Royal Infirmary, told the inquest there was nothing that could have been done to prevent her rapid deterioration. He said: 'She came in with significant injuries to the brain and rib fractures. 'All her injuries were stable. 'I think the cause for sudden deterioration probably was some bleeding into the brain, bringing her death. 'I cannot think of any care or treatment that could have avoided her death.' Dr Christopher Collins, who performed a post mortem examination on her body, said the bleed could not have been anticipated. He added: 'She had fractures to the ribs and the pelvis. In the cranial cavity there was a long skull fracture. 'My feeling was that there was a sudden deterioration associated with a re-bleed.' Police sergeant Leona Naish, of Avon and Somerset police, told the inquest the driver acted correctly. She said: 'When watching her, his focus would have been on her and not the bag that she was holding. 'In hospital, Mrs Harrison told an officer that her bag had become trapped in the car door and she didn’t know why she didn’t let go.' Mrs Harrison's son Daniel described his mother as being 'quite lucid in A&E'. He said: 'She said it was such a silly thing. 'She did have such a ridiculously high level of pain tolerance. 'She said she was two to four out of ten on the pain scale, when it was clear to see that she was in a very bad way.' Coroner Maria Voisin ruled Mrs Harrison’s cause of death to be accidental death, caused by intercranial haematoma as a result of a skull fracture and multiple injuries. She said: 'It is my opinion that based on the evidence, injuries sustained in the road accident were causative to her death.' Speaking after the verdict, Mrs Harrison’s heartbroken sons paid tribute to their mother. Matthew said: 'She was a very independent woman. 'It was just a tragedy she died in that way, without no one to blame for it. 'I feel the initial written statement . from the hospital raised some questions that I wanted to have answered . and I feel satisfied that they have been answered now.' Daniel said: 'We miss her an awful lot.'","Maureen Harrison, 72, was dragged 10 feet along the road .

Not your average student: The University of Tulsa is training students in the fundamentals of cyber-espionage, with many taking jobs in the CIA . A university is offering a two-year course in cyber-espionage, with recruits going on to jobs with the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Secret Service. Students at the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma, are learning how to write computer viruses, hack networks, crack passwords and mine data from a range of digital devices. The little-known Cyber Corps programme already places 85 per cent of its graduates with the NSA - known to students as 'the fraternity - or the CIA - which they call 'the sorority'. Sujeet Shenoi, an Indian immigrant to the U.S., founded the programme at Tulsa's Institute for Information Security in 1998  and continues to lead the teaching, the LA Times reported. Students are taught with a mixture of classroom theory and practical field work, he said, with each assigned to a police crime lab on campus to apply their skills to help recover evidence from digital devices. 'I throw them into the deep end,' Mr Shenoi told the LA Times. 'And they become fearless.' Much of their work involves gathering evidence against paedophiles, with several students having posed as children on the internet to lure predators into stings. But his students in 2003 also helped solve a triple murder case by cracking an email account that linked the killer with his victims and, working alongside the Secret Service, they have developed new techniques for extracting data from damged smartphones, GPS devices and other digital devices. The NSA in May named Tulsa as one of four centres of academic excellence in cyber operations, alongside Northeastern University in Boston, the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, and Dakota State University in Madison, South Dakota. Neal Ziring, a senior NSA official who . visited the school recently, told LA Times: 'Tulsa students show up to . NSA with a lot of highly relevant hands-on experience. 'There . are very few schools that are like Tulsa in terms of having . participation with law enforcement, with industry, with government.' Centre of excellence: Tulsa was in May named by the NSA alongside four other schools as important centres for training cyber-security operatives . New eavesdropping technology could allow government agencies to 'silently record' conversations on internet chat services like Skype in real time. Until now, so called voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services have been difficult for police to tap into, because of the way they send information over the web. The services convert analogue audio signals into digital data packets, which are then sent in a way that is costly and complex for third parties to intercept. But now a California businessman has obtained a patent for a 'legal intercept' technology he says 'would allow governments to ""silently record"" VoIP communications'. Dennis Chang, president of VoIP-PAL, an chat service similar to Skype, claims his system would allow authorities to identify and monitor suspects merely by accessing their username and subscriber data. Applicants to Tulsa's programme, who have ranged in age from 17 to 63, must be U.S. citizens eligible for security clearance of 'top secret' or higher. Many are military veterans or others looking to start second careers, usually people who are working towards degrees in computer science, engineering, law or business. Some two-thirds become what Mr Shenoi calls 'cyber ninjas', with a cyber-operations certificate attached to their diplomas that identifies them, in Mr Shenoi's words, as 'super techie'. The success of the Tulsa course comes as U.S. authorities scramble to beef up their protection against hacker infiltration. Defence Secretary Leon Pannetta admitted last month the Pentagon already spends more than $3billion each year on cyber-security, the LA Times reported. In an October 11 speech, quoted by the LA Times, he warned: 'An aggressor nation or extremist group could gain control of critical switches and derail passenger trains, or trains loaded with lethal chemicals. 'They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.'","University of Tulsa's Cyber Corps programme is training students to write viruses, hack networks, crack passwords and mine data .

She . added: 'A grudge had been harboured against Mr Wood by the defendant for some . considerable time and this defendant, fueled with a mixture of hatred and . jealousy, seized the opportunity to kill him. 'The . reason given for the hatred was that the defendant’s mother had been in violent . relationships in the past and the defendant didn’t want the same to develop . with Mr Wood.

"PUBLISHED: . 07:58 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:39 EST, 5 December 2012 . The private lives of a council leader and his wife found shot dead outside their home in an apparent murder suicide will be investigated in the hunt for a motive, police said. Norfolk Police believe North Norfolk District Council leader Keith Johnson, 58, killed his wife Andrea, 44, with a shotgun before taking his own life. They are investigating possible motives, including aspects of both of their personal lives after it emerged that some people say they saw Mr Johnson looking depressed the day before the shootings. Some neighbours suggested that the couple were in a 'very open relationship' but their family said that this was not the case and they loved one another. Police are looking into the private lives of Keith and Andrea Johnson to see if they can discover a motive into what drove him to kill her and then himself . The family of Mrs Johnson, formerly Chadwick, issued a statement saying: 'We are devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter Andrea, she was a wonderful daughter, aunt and sister. 'She was so bubbly and full of life, she adored her family and has been tragically taken from us. She will be very sorely missed.' It is understood Mr Johnson’s family will not be issuing any tribute. Prominent: Conservative Councillor Mr Johnson was a member of North Norfolk District Council for Cromer ward and former mayor . The force this morning published the results of a post-mortem examination showing that both died of gunshot wounds. The couple were found dead outside their bungalow in Norfolk at 2.50pm on Sunday. Police were called to the property in Compit Hills, Roughton, near Cromer, after reports of gunshots. A police spokesman said: 'Local neighbourhood officers and police community support officers also remain at the scene and will be working with the major investigations team over the coming days to support and reassure their families and the wider community affected by these tragic events.' Neighbours and colleagues of Mr Johnson have spoken of their shock and disbelief. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Guy said it appeared as though Mr Johnson had used one of four shotguns owned and registered to his wife in the attack. The couple did not have children but Mr Johnson had a family from a previous marriage. They had been together for 18 years and married in 2004. Mr Johnson was also a former Cromer mayor, a long-serving member of both the district and town council and a football referee. He was elected as council leader earlier this year and had helped organise the town’s Christmas market, launched at the weekend as part of a series of festive events. He was seen attending civic events on Friday. Mrs Johnson worked in customer services at Homebase in the town. The Johnsons married in 2004 but had been together for 18 years. Both had been married previously and Mr Johnson had three grown-up sons and grandchildren. One friend, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was common knowledge that they had quite an open relationship.’ The couple were found dead outside their bungalow in Norfolk on Sunday afternoon . Another said: ‘A lot of people raised . their eyebrows when Keith became the leader of the council. They were . famous drinkers. She would quite regularly get so drunk that she would . fall into people – and more.’ Mrs Johnson’s grieving parents . dismissed the rumours as ‘complete rubbish’. Her father, John Chadwick, . said: ‘There was nothing wrong with their relationship. This was a . lovers’ tiff that has gone wrong.’ Close neighbour Hilda Reardon, 72, . said she thought Mr and Mrs Johnson had gone on a celebration cruise . this year after she beat cancer. She said: 'Andrea was very ill until . fairly recently, I think she was suffering with cancer, she was . practically housebound for almost two years and people didn't think she . would pull through. Her parents would often visit in that time - she was . incredibly poorly. 'Keith was always very supportive of her, you could see how desperate he was for her to get better. 'In the last year or so, her health took a turn for the better and they both went on a cruise to celebrate. 'They seemed very happy and very much . in love, I never heard them argue. Whatever has happened is truly . tragic. I am completely shocked.' Neighbours also reported unusually . erratic behaviour from Cllr Johnson during his regular Saturday morning . paper round. The former mayor was seen making deliveries in shorts . despite sub-zero temperatures. A forensics officer at Compit Hills, pictured, where the bodies were discovered after a shot was heard . Jean Cheesman, 72, who lived in the house behind the couple, said Mr Johnson had been a 'little out of sorts.' She said: 'He delivered my paper most . days and we would always have a little bit of chit-chat on the doorstep, . pulling each other's legs. 'On Saturday he turned up on my door . with the newspaper and he was wearing shorts and I said to him, ""it's . too cold for shorts this time of year, we don't want you to get poorly"".

David Cameron plans to scupper Labour’s attempts to introduce a ‘Leveson law’ regulating the 300-year-old freedom of the Press, government sources say. A communications green paper, which the Opposition could use to try to force legislation on to the statute book, is expected to be shelved. Editors are meeting the Prime Minister today to discuss the industry’s response to last week’s 2,000-page report by Lord Justice Leveson. Opposing sides: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, plans to scupper Labour's chance to force in a 'Leveson law' though a communications green paper while Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, insists he believes independent regulation of the Press backed by legislation could work . Concerned: Culture Secretary Maria Miller has voiced her concerns that any legislation could later be used to gag the press . The senior journalists were warned by Culture Secretary Maria Miller yesterday that the Government will legislate if they do not agree to set up a genuinely tough and independent self-regulatory body. But, without the communications Bill, Labour will have little chance to force the issue. ‘That Bill is the only thing on which Labour might be able to hang some sort of Leveson clause, and it is going into very long grass,’ said one source. The Prime Minister last week voiced ‘serious concerns and misgivings’ about Lord Justice Leveson’s key recommendation of legislative underpinning for a new regulator. Time for change: Lord Justice Leveson has recommended legislative underpinning for a new regulator . But Downing Street sources said he would tell the industry in Downing Street this morning that there can be ‘no delay’ in setting up a new system themselves. Addressing MPs, Mrs Miller voiced concern that any legislation could be amended by future administrations to gag the Press, and warned it would harm the UK’s reputation as an advocate of free speech. ‘Can we credibly question and challenge others on issues of liberty and freedom if we place our own Press in a legislative framework?’ she said. However, she made clear it had not been ruled out as a last resort if editors fail to agree to set up a new, entirely independent Press watchdog which meets the principles set out in the judge’s report. ‘The Prime Minister is clear – we will see change. That change can either come with the support of the Press or – if we are given no option – without it. Be in no doubt that if the industry doesn’t respond, the Government will,’ she said. She confirmed the action envisaged by ministers ‘would include legislation’ if the industry’s proposals fall short of Leveson’s suggestion that a new regulator must be truly independent and able to impose big fines on errant newspapers. ‘We will not accept a puppet show with the same people pulling the same strings,’ Mrs Miller added. However, asked by Penny Mordaunt, a Tory MP who had indicated she wanted the Government at least to consider an underpinning in law, whether she would concede a free vote on the issue in the Commons, the Culture Secretary made clear: ‘I’m hoping that there will be no votes on this.’ Despite another round of cross-party talks on the issue yesterday, Labour leader Ed Miliband again insisted he believed independent regulation of the Press backed by legislation could work. ‘A large majority of the public also want that change. That’s why we’re going to draft legislation, working with other parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, to show that independent, self-regulation, guaranteed by law, Lord Justice Leveson’s proposal, can work,’ he said. Lord Justice Brian Leveson, center back, delivers a statement following the release of the Leveson Inquiry report at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in London . The final report: A man carries copies of the Leveson Inquiry report as he leaves the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre where Lord Justice Brian Leveson released his report after a year long inquiry . Tory MPs who signed a letter backing laws to police the Press would not vote with Labour to force the issue, a ringleader said last night. The intervention by the MP, who did not wish to be named, came as splits within the group of 42 deepened. Seven of the signatories now say a tougher regulator without a law – as advocated by the Prime Minister – would work. While most of the signatories stuck to their guns and believed some form of legal underpinning was unavoidable, a growing number told the Mail a robust new form of self-regulation would be the best course, and claimed the Labour Party’s refusal to accept it was ‘shameful’. The letter, which circulated last month, was organised by David Cameron’s former press secretary George Eustice. ‘The Government said they want to produce legislation to show it can’t work, we believe it can.’ In the Commons, Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman said self-regulation had repeatedly failed to prevent unwarranted intrusion by the Press. ‘We need statute because the current system of self-regulation has failed year after year for 70 years and despite seven major reports,’ she said. ‘The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome.’ Miss Harman said Labour was drawing up its own ‘tightly drafted and forensic’ Bill to demonstrate that Leveson’s recommendations could be implemented without the difficulties feared by ministers.Labour sources said Mr Miliband was determined that it should be introduced. However, a Private Member’s Bill, which could be brought in by a single Labour MP, would stand no chance of becoming law unless the Government allowed time for its passage through Parliament. The communications green paper has been prepared – but not published – with legislation to deal with issues such as internet piracy and public service broadcasting.","Government's own communications green paper could be used by the opposition to force legislation on to the statute book .

A U.S. psychology professor is looking into the reasons why older people are more susceptible to scams and found that it has to do with more than just to senility. Their susceptibility also has to do with the way older people process visual cues as well as fear and suspicion, says Shelly Taylor, a professor of psychology at the University of California Los Angeles. Taylor began researching the matter after two homeless men duped her 70-somehting-year-old father out of $17,000, NBC News reports. Discerning information: An older man looks at his laptop . American seniors lose an estimated $2.9 billion a year to fraud and most of the victims are between 80 and 89, studies have found . Experts have often assumed that the elderly are more vulnerable to fraud because of diminished brain capacity and because retired people often more time on their hands and more assets to spare. Taylor and her research team did two studies to better understand the full picture. In one study, they asked 119 people between the ages of 55 to 84 to look at photographs of people’s faces and rate them for trustworthiness. Researching brain activity: Shelley Taylor, professor of psychology at the University of California Los Angeles . They then asked 24 young adults in their 20s to do the same. The two age groups generally reacted the same to the ‘trustworthy’ and neutral faces, Taylor told NBC. But those in the older group were far less likely to agree with the young people on who looked ‘untrustworthy,’ she said. ‘They missed facial cues that are pretty easily distinguished,’ she said. ‘Is something going on the brain that would explain this pattern?’ To answer that, Taylor and her team set up a second study using functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI, which is a way to look at brain activity in real time. They studied 23 older adults between the ages of 55 and 80 and 21 younger adults, with an average age of 33. In the younger adults, a part of the brain called the anterior insula became active as they were examining all the faces, but especially active when looking at those with expressions or characteristics that people associate with being untrustworthy, Taylor said. The anterior insula did not activate nearly so much in the older people, she noted. ‘Their brains are not saying “be wary,” as the brains of the younger adults are,’ she said. Therefore, ‘a diminished “gut” response to cues of untrustworthiness may partially underlie older adults’ vulnerability to fraud,’ her report concludes. Ponzi schemer: A police mug shot of Italian-born American swindler Charles Ponzi (1882 - 1949) after his arrest for forgery under the name of Charles Bianchi, Montreal, Canada, 1909 . Taylor and her team are still unsure if this is caused by reduced brain function, or simply by getting older. ‘We know that older adults are good emotion regulators. They make their lives emotionally more positive,’ she said. ‘They don’t stress out over small things. They turn away from negative scenes. They are less likely to go to scary negative movies. They kind of keep their emotional life in balance.’ Taylor and her team’s research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.","Older people are more susceptible to scams due to the way they process visual cues as well as fear and .

Astronomers have discovered a mammoth black hole containing as much mass as 17billion Suns. The monster object is more than 11 times wider than the orbit of Neptune, the eighth planet in our Solar System. It lies at the heart of a small lens-shaped galaxy called NGC1277, 220million light years away in the constellation Perseus. Scroll down for video . Lenticular galaxy NGC 1277 taken with Hubble: The galaxy contains, astronomers have discovered, a mammoth black hole containing as much mass as 17 billion suns . News of the incredible object comes as a separate research team reported the discovery of a quasar with the most energetic outflow ever seen. Observations of the incredible quasar known as SDSS J1106+1939 may answer questions about how the mass of a galaxy is linked to its central black hole mass and why there are so few large galaxies in the universe. The black hole at NGC1277 makes up an enormous 14 per cent of the galaxy's mass. Other black holes found at the centres of galaxies only account for around 0.1 per cent. Black holes are formed from matter collapsing to the point where normal laws of physics break down. Their gravity is so strong that space and time are distorted, and not even light can escape. Describing NGC1277, lead scientist Dr Karl Gebhardt, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: 'This is a really oddball galaxy. It's almost all black hole. 'This could be the first object in a new class of galaxy-black hole systems.' A description of the black hole, found by astronomers using the nine-metre Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas, appears in the journal Nature. The discovery could change theories of how black holes and galaxies form and evolve, say the scientists. Record breaker: An artist's impression showing the material ejected from the region around the supermassive black hole in the quasar SDSS J1106+1939. This object has the most energetic outflows ever seen . NASA has revealed how it has taken inspiration from the past for its spacecraft of the future. Researchers from the space agency have tested a small prototype of a design for a nuclear-reactor engine that they hope could be used one day to power deep-space exploration probes. The proposed design is based on a Stirling engine, which was first invented in the 19th century and uses hot pressurised gas to push a piston. And the space agency's engineers also used used 'heat pipe technology,' which was invented at Los Alamos in 1963, as part of the mechanism to power the engine. A team of NASA and Department of Energy researchers has shown shown that a reliable nuclear reactor based on the old technology could be used in spaceships, according to a news release from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The engine would use a 50lb nuclear uranium battery to generate heat that is then carried to eight Stirling engines to produce about 500 watts of power. The test engine produced 24 watts, while deep-space probes normally require 600 to 700 watts. The experiment known as the Demonstration Using Flattop Fissions, or DUFF, is the first demonstration of a space nuclear reactor system to produce electricity in the United States since 1965. The second black hole announced today . was spotted using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large . Telescope in Paranal, Chile, which found the most energetic quasar . outflow ever discovered. The . rate that energy is carried away by the huge mass of material ejected . is equivalent to two trillion times the power output of the sun. 'This is about 100 times higher than the total power output of the Milky Way galaxy — it's a real monster outflow,' said Nahum Arav, an associate professor of physics in College of Science and leader of the research team. Theorists have predicted energy flows of this magnitude, and simulations have suggested these outflows impact the galaxies around them, but it has all been speculation — until now. 'For the last 15 years many theorists have said that if there were such powerful outflows it would help answer many questions on the formation of galaxies, on the behavior of black holes, and on the enrichment of the intergalactic medium with elements other than hydrogen and helium,' Professor Arav said. 'This discovery means we can better explain the formation of galaxies. There are hundreds of people doing the theoretical side of the work. 'They hypothesise outflows in their simulations, and now we've found an outflow in the magnitude that has only been theorised in the past. 'Now they can refine their already impressive models and base them on empirical data.' Quasars are light phenomenon produced as material falls into a black hole producing a huge amount of energy. The bigger the black hole, the bigger the quasar. The Milky Way, says Professor Arav, is a big galaxy with a 'smallish' black hole. The black hole at the heart of quasar SDSS J1106-1939 is massive, estimated to be a thousand times heavier than the black hole in the Milky Way. And while black holes are noted for pulling material in, quasars accelerate some of the material and eject it at high speed. The larger the quasar, the more material it can take, the higher speed it can accelerate it, and the further it can eject the material. Every year, according to the team's analysis, a mass of more than 400 times that of the sun is streaming away from the quasar at a speed of 8,000 kilometers per second - five times more powerful than the previous record holder. 'I've been looking for something like this for a decade, so it's thrilling to finally find one of the monster outflows that have been predicted,' Professor Arav said.","Monster object lies 220million light years away in the constellation Perseus .

A pony worth £500 was among £270,000 of Ministry of Defence equipment recorded stolen from April to September (file image) A pony worth £500 was among more than £270,000 worth of military property reported stolen in just six months, it emerged today. It is understood the horse was taken by a serving member of the armed forces, but has since been recovered. But as fresh details emerged about the incredible catalogue of military equipment, clothing, silverware, tools, medals and flags which have been stolen, the Ministry of Defence was accused of being too focused on arrivals on military bases and not on what leaves. Details of thefts reported from April to September reveal even secure defence bases are not immune to metal thieves which have also struck across the country as the process of scrap has soared. But it is the theft of a pony which will have raised eyebrows in the MoD, which Defence Secretary Philip Hammond under pressure to prove he takes seriously the issue of government property walking out of the front gates. The pony, worth £500, was stolen at the very end of 2011 but was not recorded as stolen in MoD records until June this year, according to details revealed by defence minister Mark Francois in a parliamentary answer. In the two years from May 2010 £1.25million worth of kit and equipment was stolen, but Mr Hammond has insisted that a 'significant amount has been recovered'. It is understood the pony was taken from the Royal Artillery Equestrian Centre in Hampshire by a serving member of the forces, who was cautioned and has since left the armed forces. The horse was returned at the start of 2012. The biggest single theft recorded in . the six months to the end of September was £26,000 worth of aluminium . taken in July. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has insisted much of the equipment reported stolen is eventually recovered . In May outboard motors worth £25,233 were stolen along . with diving helmets valued at almost £21,000. Land Rover batteries were also taken. The list also included £1,200 of . racing bikes, a set of £2,000 medical knee braces, padlocks worth £3,280 . and paving slabs valued at £138. A Diamond Jubilee medal worth £150 was among the items stolen . The . Ministry of Defence insisted the high value of stolen property was in . part fuelled by a greater awareness of the need to report thefts. Several brass items were taken, including fire fighting fittings, hoses and nozzles. Some £13,000 worth of copper, including pipes, water tanks and roofing sheets, was taken along with more than £14,200 of lead flashing and pipes. A £20 set of galvanised shackles was taken in September. In September hallmarked Silver catering items, including jugs, teapots and baskets, were reported stolen, worth £6,500. A £245 silver rose bowl was also taken. Labour MP Madeleine Moon, who uncovered the figures through parliamentary questions, said: ‘The high level of metal thefts included in the list provided by the MOD and the loss of valuable military equipment such as night vision goggles and bowman radio equipment is very worrying. ‘The continued high level of theft and losses from MOD establishments shows either inadequate tracking systems or that private security firms guarding military bases are too focussed on stopping people entering. ‘Clearly they also need to stop and check the cars and it would appear lorries leaving bases.’ Gadgets included sat navs, DVD players, camcorders, projectors and two TVs worth £1,360. The list also includes sleeping bags, sleeping tablets, bedding, binoculars, gloves, laptops, torches, fire extinguishers, generators, gas meters, and more than £5,200 in fuel. Equipment reported stolen includes body armour, helmets, boots and jackets . A Queen's Diamond Jubilee medal, worth £150, was reported stolen in June - the same month the Queen celebrated 60 years on the throne. Several sets of body armour, plats and helmets worth more than £8,000. Clothing was repeatedly targeted, including jackets, jumpers and trousers. In July a 'women's jumper, Women's slacks, lanyard and scarf' worth £85 was taken. More unusual items to have disappeared include £12,718 of water, 5KG dumbbells worth £55, a £500 solar panel, ceiling spotlights, a ceremonial tunic, £800 in frozen and dried food, a £270 flag, . Almost £22,000 in cash has been stolen, including £18,000 in a single haul. Tools including chainsaws, welding equipment, a wood router,  and a £2,000 winch. Labour MP Madeleine Moon said military chiefs should be as careful at checking what leaves bases as what arrives . A dedicated military police team, working on Operation Embroil, trawls internet auction sites including eBay to catch thieves trying to sell stolen defence equipment online. Last year it uncovered 107 cases where military kit was being sold illegally on websites. The Defence Police Federation, which represents civilian Ministry of Defence Police officers, said too often investigators are called in after the trail has 'gone cold'. Federation chairman Eamon Keating said: 'This list is concerning and shows the potential for vital equipment and resources to either be lost or stolen from MoD sites, which is enormously costly to the Department and can be disruptive to service personnel. 'At present, Ministry of Defence Police officers can only investigate missing assets when called in by the Department, and despite these officers’ expertise and professionalism, they are often faced with the unenviable task of investigating thefts after the trail has gone cold and property disposed of.' He said Ministry of Defence police teams should be used 'proactively as a deterrent and to investigate losses straight away'. A MoD spokesman said: ‘The MOD takes the loss or theft of equipment very seriously and works hard to detect and deter theft. ‘There are robust processes in place to raise awareness of the need for vigilance in all aspects of security and we actively encourage individuals to report loss or theft. This work has resulted in a rise in the number of reports over the last year. ‘Where theft does occur and a suspect is identified, prosecution or internal disciplinary action will follow as appropriate.’","Catalogue of equipment stolen from April to September includes a pony taken by a soldier - who has now left the forces .

SIr Philip Green could be in line for a £250million windfall by selling a stake in his Topshop and Topman business to Americans. The retail tycoon is in talks to sell a 25 per cent stake in the fashion chain which is valued by experts at around £1billion. Sir Philip’s family is already estimated to be worth more than £3billion. It is thought that Sir Philip wants to raise the money by selling a slice of Topshop to expand the chain into China and the US, where he already has flagship stores in three cities. Deal: Sir Philip Green, pictured with daughter Chloe, is in talks to sell a substantial stake in his successful Topshop and Topman business . Topshop and Topman have become one of the biggest successes on the UK high street, partly as a result of a lucrative collaboration with supermodel Kate Moss who designed her own clothing collection for the store. The launch of her line in 2007 saw the biggest single day of trading Topshop.com had ever seen. The chain has also been hailed for  its skill in spotting the latest fashion trends and quickly getting them on to  its shelves. The business has 615 franchised  outlets operating in 39 countries. If  the new deal is successful it could transform Topshop into a truly  global brand. A friend of the tycoon said: ‘You would be wrong to suggest Sir Philip is going to use this deal to take cash out of the business. This is about investing in a big push for Topshop and Topman internationally.’ The American buyer is thought  to be Leonard Green & Partners  which, with Texas Pacific Group, is one of the backers of America’s J. Crew retail chain. Sir Philip is expected to conclude discussions today and make an announcement tomorrow. The landmark deal – Sir Philip’s biggest since his failed approach to Marks & Spencer in 2004 – would provide him with partners who know the US retail market and could help with any expansion plans. Topshop and Topman are the most profitable parts of Sir Philip’s Arcadia empire, which he bought for £800million in 2002 and which includes BHS, Evans and Burton. He is now ranked with his family at number 17 on the Sunday Times rich list with an estimated fortune of £3.3billion. Topshop started as Peter Robinson's Topshop in Sheffield in 1964, becoming a stand-alone shop in the 1970s . Investment: The retail tycoon is thought to want to raise the money to expand his fashion chain into China and the U.S. Last month he signed up American . reality TV stars the Kardashian sisters in an attempt to boost the . fortunes of his Dorothy Perkins chain. The entrepreneur recently criticised . Britain’s battered retailers for feeling sorry for themselves, saying . there was ‘no use moping about’ and they should ‘get on with it’. But he has faced criticism himself over his tax arrangements. Sir Philip, who employs 45,000 people through Arcadia, says he always pays his tax in full.

Worshippers have beaten Santa to it and imported their own gift from Lapland - this flatpack church - just in time for Christmas. For the past 90 years, the congregation of St Michael’s and All Angels Church, in Daws Heath, Essex, have had to make do with a First World War army hut. But with the hut falling into a state of disrepair, the Anglican congregation decided it was time to replace their old church with a brand new £560,000 building. Wood you believe it: The new flatpack St Michael's and All Saints Church, Exxex, made from 150-year-old pine from Lapland, Finland. It took just over three months to assemble . Outdated: The old St Michael's and All Angels Church, Daws Heath, dated back to the First World War, held only 70 parishioners and lacked decent insulation . A 'Buy-a-Log appeal' was set up and donors were invited to buy a metre of wood or more, costing a minimum of £5. And now, thanks to a mammoth three-year fundraising drive and various grants, a brand new church has been built from a flatpack made of 150-year-old pine logs. The Essex church was cut to size in Finland before being shipped to the UK with the inside of the building finished by a team of up to 15builders, including carpenters, plumbers and electricians. The new church boasts a life expectancy of up to 200 years and took just over three months to build. It has twice the capacity of the old church and comfortably seats 150 worshippers on new furniture. Last weekend more than 200 churhgoers packed it out to witness it being sanctified by the Bishop of Bradwell, the Right Reverend John Wraw. Mr Wraw said: 'This is such a lovely building and I think people will rapidly grow to love it and treasure it. 'Those who have been involved in the project already love it.' Inside: The Lapland pine used to build the church is particulalry hardy, having endured freezing weather in Lapland. The structure is expected to last for 200 years . High and mighty: The Anglican church's new capacity is 150 parishioners - double what it was before. And it's better insulated . Light touch: The stained glass window was designed by churchgoer Nikki Saunders. It is triple glazed with lead lighting . St Michael’s and All Angels Church vicar, Rev Marian Sturrock, said: 'I am just absolutely over the moon with this beautiful new building. 'It’s not very often a congregation gets a lovely new church like this, so we are extremely grateful and pleased to worship here. 'It was a lovely service, and I would like to thank everyone for coming along to help us celebrate.' Since pulling the old church down last December and moving into the new one, the congregation celebrated mass in the nearby church hall. Ken Jones, who supervised the project, said worshippers had reported back to say they felt warm thanks to the good insulation, with quite a few remarking on the incredible smell thanks to the pine wood. 'Our church has always been on the edge of the woods, in the shadow of oak trees so we wanted to build something that was compatible. 'We are extremely pleased to move into our beautiful new church'. Handmade: The wooden altar was crafted by Rob Symonds, the church warden, who counts woodcraft as one of his hobbies .","The 150-year-old Lapland wood is expected to last up to 200 years .

Plea: Gerry McCann (pictured today) warns the Leveson Inquiry will have been 'almost useless' unless it is agreed in its totality . Gerry McCann has said the £4million taxpayer-funded Leveson Inquiry will have been 'almost useless' unless David Cameron cements its recommendations in law. The father of missing child Madeleine said the trauma he and other victims re-lived during 16 months of hearings should not be wasted. The Prime Minister must change his mind on statutory regulation of the Press, he added. Mr McCann and his wife Kate, as well as . the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler - Bob and Sally Dowler - . were treated as 'commodities' and left with no rights to privacy, . dignity or basic respect, Lord Leveson said yesterday. But having read his report the families do not believe the judge 'has gone far enough' to protect them from rogue journalists. 'I think the only reason we went to Leveson was to affect change and if . Leveson's report isn't implemented in full then I would say that giving . evidence for all of the victims has been almost useless,' Mr McCann said. 'For almost all the victims, the reason they were there was to stop . other, ordinary people who were caught up in the most unfortunate . circumstances suffering unnecessarily beyond what's happened to them. 'And I feel if Leveson is implemented we will be some way on that route. 'The jury will still be out of course, to it working in practice, but we will certainly be a few steps further forward.' Scotland Yard’s review of her disappearance has so far cost £2million in its first year after 30 murder squad detectives were called in May 2011. They have been sent to Portugal and Spain to gather evidence, including a file of leads from private investigators. The cost includes the salaries of the detectives, translation and interpretation fees, travel expenses and office staff. Appearance: The McCann's spoke to the Leveson Inquiry almost exactly a year ago but said that their evidence will be wasted without change . Rejection: David Cameron, pictured today at a school in his constituency, does not want to rubber-stamp Leveson's report in full . Giving evidence to the inquiry last year, . Kate McCann said she felt like 'climbing into a hole and not coming . out' after the News of the World printed her intensely personal diary, . started after her daughter disappeared. 'Our politicians have now got the ability to do the right thing, and the right thing is to implement in full,' Mr McCann said. 'And I think the MPs have an opportunity to redeem themselves a little bit with the public by accepting this, putting party political issues aside, and doing the right thing for everyone involved.' Mr McCann said he would have liked to see the Leveson report go even further - making the new system compulsory, providing a time-scale, holding individual journalists and photographers accountable, and making the regulator fully independent. 'I don't think it (Lord Leveson's report) goes far enough,' he said. 'The Prime Minister and our other elected politicians have an opportunity now to do the right thing. And if they do the right thing, for the public, then it will help restore a little confidence,' he said. 'I clearly respect his opinion but I personally disagree with the viewpoint and Lord (Justice) Leveson, as a senior law judge of our country, has made clear that what he is proposing is not a state-run press. It is a fine distinction but without the statutory underpinning this system will not work.' Speaking about the stories printed after his daughter went missing in Portugal in 2007, he said: 'The worst thing when Madeleine was abducted was the fact that it was portrayed she was dead and we were responsible for covering it up. I don't think that anybody can go through anything worse. 'There were many ludicrous aspects, that we had managed top hide a body for 28 days before we had a hire car. 'Newspapers knew what they were writing was not correct but the pound signs made them print it. 'I would say that having your child abducted is enough to destroy most families but we managed to get through but there were times where we though we might not survive.'","Father of missing Madeleine says £4m probe must be accepted by MPs .

Reverend Wiseman says he obtained the snap from an internet search . Mr Wiseman says he uploaded the shot as part of the Movember campaign, which aims to raise awareness of serious health conditions men may be too embarrassed to talk about. But this cut no ice his churchgoers. One longstanding parishioner, who did not wish to be named said: 'We understand he’s trying to get an important message across but we don’t need to see a suggestive picture of a man touching himself.

A hungry dolphin bit an 8-year-old girl at Sea World in Orlando, Florida, last week as she was feeding it scraps of fish. Jillian Thomas of Georgia suffered three puncture wounds the size of dimes and a swollen left hand after the unexpected biting occurred, her parents told the Orlando Sentinel. Scroll down for video . Seemingly safe: Jillian Thomas, 8, and her younger brother James were feeding the dolphins at Orlando SeaWorld . Close contact: Jillian's younger brother leans in close to feed one of the marine mammals . Unaware: Jillian turned away from the dolphin she was feeding fish scrap to . Jillian’s father, Jamie Thomas, captured the incident on video displaying images of his daughter being nearly dragged into the water with the dolphin that clamped down on her wrist as she looked away. Thomas posted the video online as a warning to other parents. ‘The first thing I thought was I would have to jump in water and save my daughter's life,’ he told the Sentinel. ‘I literally thought she was going to be pulled into the water.’ His daughter’s cuts are healing, he said, but Thomas and his wife are upset with the way SeaWorld employees handled the incident, saying they trivialized the severity of it. Surprise bite: The dolphin bit Jillian, clamping down on her left wrist . Painful moment: Jillian cringes as the dolphin bites down harder . Strong pull: The dolphin nearly drags Jillian into the water with it . While dolphins are known for their playful behaviour and permanently painted smiles, they are also known for their sheer physical power and sharp teeth which have led to attacks on humans. Human feeding is linked behind many reported attacks though other incidents have been seen during moments of sexual aggression. Federal officials say dolphins are of little threat to people in captive swim programs - with in 1994 less than 1 out of 10,000 people injured - but those animals in the wild are far more spontaneous and unpredictable in their behaviour. Earlier this year in Louisiana a single wild dolphin was reported terrorizing residents in a waterside community in Slidell where it bit three people in June. In one incident a boater's hand was sliced open by the dolphin's teeth while he stuck his hand in the water to clean it. In another case a girl was dragged into the water by her ankle. Other reports described the dolphin as head butting and chasing acquaintances. Like many other incidents, officials in Louisiana said there were related reports of people feeding the dolphin and attempting to lure it out with food potentially leading to its association of all humans having food. ‘Thank God it didn’t pull her in the . water. It’s only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured . at this attraction,’ Thomas wrote in a message at the end of his video. This isn’t the first dolphin bite the park has seen. In 2006, two adults pried open a dolphin's mouth to free a 7-year-old boy from its grip, which left a bruise on the boy’s hand, according to another Sentinel article. SeaWorld spokesperson Becca Bides at the time told the Sentinel that no changes were being planned for the attraction. Jullian’s mother, Amy Thomas, said she would have been more careful if she had known her daughter might get bitten. ‘I felt safe,’ she said. ‘Everyone . just imagines dolphins as smiling, non-biting animals with knobby teeth. You forget these are wild animals.’ The . Thomas family said they do not plan to take legal action against the . Orlando-based theme park, but said they would like Sea World to increase . the age limit for children feeding dolphins and remind parents that . dolphins aren’t always as friendly as they look.

"By . Claire Coleman . PUBLISHED: . 17:02 EST, 25 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:57 EST, 26 November 2012 . Cashmere was once a luxury item - but these days you can buy jumpers in the material in almost every High Street shop, from Primark to Tesco, John Lewis to Mango. The cheap cashmere revolution started in 2005 when import quotas were relaxed and China started exporting huge volumes of it to the EU. The lower end of the market still tends to be dominated by fibres from Chinese goats. Claire Coleman investigates the truth behind cut-price cashmere... In spring, the cashmere fibres - finer and softer, yet more durable, than wool - are collected from the underbelly of the goat, by combing or shearing. After washing, the finest, softest hair is separated from the coarser, outer guard hair. This guard hair is not considered high enough quality for many top-end manufacturers, but, according to industry expert David Mallin, of Cashmere Fibres International, it's this sort you're likely to find on the High Street. 'You get what you pay for,' he says. 'A kilo of fibre, which when spun will make three sweaters, costs around £100. If you're buying a sweater for £50, you can be fairly sure that it hasn't got the highest quality fibre in it.' If you don't care about your jumper lasting, that might not be a problem, but pilling or bobbling tends to be just one of the issues with cheaper, shorter fibres. 'If you're using longer fibres, they tend not to pill in the same way, but short fibres easily roll themselves into balls,' says Mr Mallin. Another way to cut costs is to knit the garment more loosely, giving a lighter garment that won't hold its shape as well. 'A traditional cashmere jumper will weigh around 300g,' says David. 'The sort of cheaper jumpers we see coming from China are closer to 200g.' But while a top-end cashmere sweater can sell for anything from £200 to £300, on the High Street the prices are all under £100, ranging from Tesco's £40 to Gap's £89.95. To find out how they measured up, we asked SGS, a company that specialises in testing fabrics for the textile industry, to blind test jumpers from eight High Street stores. The results were unexpected... THE TESTS . We checked five variables to find out: . 1. Is it really cashmere?High-powered microscopes were used to check that the samples hadn't been supplemented with wool, angora or any other fibre. All of our jumpers came out as 100 per cent cashmere. 2. Will it lose its shape?While washing instructions ranged from 'dry clean only' to 'machine wash at 40c', as most people wash cashmere on a cool machine cycle, we laundered all the jumpers at 30c and let them dry flat. They were measured before and after washing to see how well they kept their shape. 'Most retailers wouldn't put up with change of more than about 5 per cent maximum,' says Michelle Stead from the testing laboratory. 3. Does it hold its colour?A sample of each jumper was washed at 30C with strips of different white fabrics. The strips were checked for any colour, and the sample was checked to see if it had lost colour. The results for each fabric and the original sample are graded and we then averaged them out to give a percentage for colour fastness. 4. Will it go bobbly?A sample is repeatedly rubbed to see to what extent it pills, or bobbles. The result is given a rating from one (the worst) to five (the best). 'You'd hope for a figure of at least four,' says Michelle. 5. WeightWe also weighed all the jumpers to give us a rough idea of how much cashmere had been used. Grey Uniqlo V-neck, £79.90 . Grey V-neck, £79.90 . Washing instructions: Dry clean . Weight: 174g . Colour fastness: 100% . Resistance to pilling: 3/5 . Shrinkage after washing: Width -4.1%, length -3.2%, sleeve length +2.9% . Fit: Quite slim fitting, with a bit of extra length in the arms. I'd probably go for a size up and roll the sleeves back. Verdict: . This was the overall winner of our test, coming out joint best for . pilling and, despite the dry clean only label, best when it came to . keeping its shape and its colour - although as it was one of the . lightest jumpers we tried, that might have swayed the result. Keep an . eye out for cut-price promotions as Uniqlo often mark these jumpers . down, making them even better value. Score: 8/10 . Gap, Blue V-neck, £89.95 . Blue V-neck, £89.95 . Washing instructions: Dry clean . Weight: 220g . Colour  fastness: 88.6% . Resistance to pilling: 2½/5 . Shrinkage after washing:  Width -4.1%, length -3.2%, sleeve length +2.9% . Fit: . Slouchy fit but still nice and snug across the shoulders - liked the . middle seam down the centre of the back as an added design detail. Verdict: . This was the heaviest of all the jumpers we weighed - and although . that's partly because it's a slightly bigger fit than the rest, it does . feel more substantial. Even though the instructions were dry clean only, . it didn't do badly on our wash test. Score: 6/10 . Mango, Camel V-neck, £79.99 . Camel V-neck, £79.99 . Washing instructions:  Handwash at 30C . Weight: 194g . Colour fastness: 98.6% . Resistance to pilling: 2/5 . Shrinkage after washing: Width 4.6%, length +0.4%, sleeve  length +1.5% . Fit: Quite wide in the body but sleeves very narrow; looser, more tunic-like fit around waist. Verdict: . Although this jumper washed well and has a decent weight to it, it was . joint worst with La Redoute when it came to pilling and it lost a point . for the slightly strange fit. Score: 6/10 . Marks & Spencer, Pale Blue V-neck, £79 . Pale blue V-neck, £79 . Washing instructions: Wash at 30C . Weight: 178g . Colour fastness: 91.4% . Resistance to pilling: 2½/5 . Shrinkage after washing: Width -9.6%, length  -1.35%, sleeve length -0.4% . Fit: . Very long in the body but otherwise a fairly traditional fit with nice . shape across the shoulders and sleeves that are the right length. Verdict: . Although this jumper put in an average performance across most of our . tests, it lost almost 10 per cent of its width after just one wash, . despite the fact that the label advises washing at 30c - that's a . disappointing result for a company like M&S that usually prides . itself on the quality of its clothes. Score: 5/10 . Florence & Fred at Tesco, Coral V-neck, £40 . Coral V-neck, £40 . Washing instructions: Wash at 40C . Weight: 146g . Colour fastness: 98.6% . Resistance to pilling: 2½/5 . Shrinkage after washing:  Width -4.5%, length -2.45%,  sleeve length -0% . Fit: . Feels soft and looks fluffy; nice ruched shoulder detail but sleeves . are bracelet length and body comes up shorter than on others and it bags . a bit above the waistband. Verdict: . The lightest of all the jumpers we weighed - and it looks and feels . pretty flimsy, too. While it held its shape and colour well, it doesn't . have a lot of longevity. The style, price and performance have it pegged . as throwaway fashion so don't expect to be wearing it this time next . year. Layer it with a long-sleeved vest if you actually want to stay . warm. Score: 5/10 . La Redoute, Dark Green V-neck, £69 . Dark green V-neck, £69 . Washing instructions: Hand wash . Weight: 158g . Colour fastness: 91.4% . Resistance to pilling: 2/5 . Shrinkage after washing: Width  -3.9%, length -1.05%, sleeve length +1.2% . Fit: Doesn't feel particularly fitted or form flattering. Verdict: . Another very lightweight jumper that might have washed well overall but . did particularly badly in the pilling test and didn't do much for us . when it came to fit. We say spend the extra tenner and get the Uniqlo . one instead. Score: 5/10 . Primark, Black turtleneck, £42 . Black turtle neck, £42 . Washing instructions: Dry clean or handwash cold . Weight: 190g . Colour fastness: 88.6% . Resistance to pilling: 2½/5 . Shrinkage after washing: Width -4.55%, length  -7.2%, sleeve length -6.7% . Fit: Slightly long in the sleeves but otherwise a good classic fitting roll neck and not as lightweight as you might think. Verdict: . Admittedly we didn't follow the washing instructions so maybe we . shouldn't be surprised that it shrank quite dramatically, losing over . 4cm in length on the body and around 3cm on the sleeves - but . realistically, who's going to handwash a Primark jumper? The impressive . price for the weight gives it an extra point. Score: 4/10 . John Lewis, Purple V-neck, £69 . Purple V-neck, £69 . Washing instructions: Wash at 40c . Weight: 176g . Colour fastness: 84.2% . Resistance  to pilling: 3/5 . Shrinkage after washing: Width -8.55%, length -3.3%, sleeve length -4.9% . Fit: Narrow rib at waist and cuffs makes it seem more delicate, as does the rolled seam at the neck - slightly shorter in length than others. Verdict: Despite saying it could be washed at 40c, this jumper shrank more than most when washed at 30c, losing 3.5cm off the width. And, even though the colour change was only marginal, it also came off worst in the colour fastness test. On the plus side it didn't pill as much as others, but a score of three out of five is still lower than the lab would expect from a quality retailer. Score: 3/10 .","We test Gap, Uniqlo, Mango, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, John Lewis, La Redoute and Primark ."

High price: Former estate agent Benjamin Evans has been ordered to do 130 hours community service and pay £530 in fines for displaying a fake parking ticket in an attempt to evade paying an £8 daily charge . A former estate agent who stacked up £1,000 in parking fines attempted to cheat the system by displaying a fake ticket on his car, a court was told. Frustrated with having to pay to park his BMW Benjamin Evans designed a false ticket in an attempt to evade paying the daily £8 charge. But a savvy traffic warden in Southampton, Hampshire, spotted discrepancies between the ticket Evans was displaying and the standard issue ticket. The failed parking tariff dodge has proved expensive for the 27-year-old who has been ordered to pay £530 costs and carry out 130 hours of community service after being found guilty of offences under the Fraud Act. Giving evidence during his trial at Southampton Magistrates Court , Evans further tried to avoid taking the blame by insisting he knew nothing about the spoof ticket. Instead he accused a former work colleague and friend, called Jonathan Bailey, of the fraud. Evans said he drove Bailey to . their joint place of work every day and in return for his lift Bailey . paid for the parking tickets. But it transpired no one had been able to trace Bailey and Evans was accused of making him up. Southampton City Council lawyer . Francisca Da Costa said Evans had 'invented a fictional character' to . take the blame when trying to get 'a freebie'. The court heard how Evans, from Romsey, in Hampshire, was caught out on August 29 last year by warden Christopher Meadows. Mr Meadows became suspicious after spotting that the ticket on Evan's dashboard had part of its serial number hidden by a 10 pence coin. He noticed the shading on the city council logo was different to that on genuine tickets and that the number '3' appeared more curved than usual. The edges of the fake - which declared he had 'paid' for ten hours parking - were also rough, unlike genuine tickets. Deciding something was wrong the warden slapped a fixed penalty notice on the vehicle. Evans, who was working for estate agents Your Move at the time, saw the warden from his office nearby and confronted him. But . when the warden asked Evans to open the car door to show him the ticket . the estate agent refused and walked away, telling Mr Meadows to 'get a . proper job'. Scene of the crime: Evans claimed his friend and colleague Jonathan Bailey took responsibility for paying for parking tickets in return for getting a lift into work. After further investigations, it was revealed that no ticket to the value of £8 had been bought from any of the machines servicing that car park. Enforcement officers repeatedly contacted Evans to provide his ticket but he failed to produce it and just sent an email complaining about the treatment he had received from Mr Meadows. Evans, who has three previous convictions for making off without payment, admitted one count of failing to give information which would identify the owner of the car. He was also found guilty of a second charge of displaying a false parking ticket. Sentencing him, chairman of the bench Susan Williams told Evans she did not believe his evidence.","Fine dodger accused of inventing fictional character to .

"By . Jackie Clune . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 1 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 1 December 2012 . Last year, two of my ageing dental crowns fell out – a front tooth and an incisor that was concealing an impacted canine. An emergency visit to the dentist revealed I needed more than £7,000 of ‘cosmetic’ dental work. My front crown was beyond repair and I would need a dental implant if I were to avoid dentures. Plus, I would need either orthodontic braces to straighten them or extractions and a porcelain bridge to replicate evenly spaced teeth. As an actress, braces were not practical, and with four children and a large mortgage there was no way I could access such a large amount of money. All smiles: Musical star Jackie Clune after her surgery which saw her travel to Budapest to save money . I felt angry at the expense and lack of help available. What are your options if your teeth fail and funds are limited? While trawling the internet for answers, I realised I was far from alone. With budgets ever tighter, dental treatment is increasingly unaffordable. Some suggest going to a dental school and offering yourself up as a guinea pig, but even these are massively over-subscribed. And I won’t even begin to mention what was featured on DIY dentistry websites. But there is another avenue. More and more Britons are travelling to Europe for dental treatment. There are no official numbers, however, a 2007 survey by Which? found that dentistry is one of the most popular types of health tourism. I had immediate reservations. Would a continental dentist work to the same high standard as those in Britain? And what if something went wrong and I found myself in a foreign hospital? Would there be adequate aftercare? There are numerous web forums and even an NHS site giving tips, such as asking the dentist what his qualifications are, where you can check this and what his speciality is. They also advise patients to have a consultation with a British dentist first – which I’d already done. The General Dental Council (GDC) advises people to make their dentist aware of plans to travel for treatment in case of any complications. After: X-ray image showing some of the work done on Jackie in Hungary . The testimonials on various websites seemed to allay my fears. Most were happy with their treatment – despite often feeling a bit baffled by the language barrier. I came across the website of a clinic called Smile Savers Hungary. There are many such Hungarian companies online and Budapest seems to be the dental tourism capital of Europe. Smile Savers stood out because you can have a proper consultation at one of their UK clinics before travelling, so I booked in. At the first consultation they took a panoramic X-ray of my jaw and teeth and discussed what my options were. The procedure would involve at least two trips due to the recovery period needed in between the extractions and bone grafting – the site needs to recover for a few months to allow dental implants. I was told, if I were to go ahead, the clinic would organise the work to take place over the two trips. I was so impressed with their clinic in London’s Charlotte Street and with the quotation I received at the end of my consultation that I didn’t look elsewhere. There are many companies offering a similar service and it’s probably a good idea to shop around. But I left a three- month cooling-off period for myself before taking the plunge. Smile Savers booked me into the . four-star Art Hotel overlooking the parliament building on the Danube . (£65 a night). Travel wasn’t included so I flew with budget airline Wizz . for £100 return from Luton. Having a companion for the trip is also . advised, mainly for moral support, so I took my mum. My . treatment began with a consultation between Dr Juhasz, a kind-looking . lady and Dr Kaman, the head implantologist. They spoke in Hungarian but I . could tell they were appalled by the root canal treatment I’d had back . home, and Dr Kaman could not believe that the problematic impacted . canine had never been extracted, but simply crowned over. Stage smile: Jackie Clune on stage as Donna in hit musical Mamma Mia! I . then spent two hours in the chair, and although the treatment was not . comfortable it was mostly pain-free. Dr Juhasz removed my old crowns and . replaced the leftover amalgam with safer white fillings. The . extractions were next, and Dr Kaman stroked my arm as he wielded the big . needle that was to go into the roof of my mouth. ‘I’m sorry for the pain I’m about to cause you,’ he murmured, before extracting three teeth. He showed me how black the first one was, how infected the  second one was and it took him all of five seconds to extract the impacted tooth  the NHS dentist had been so nervous about touching. The bad news was the implant would have to wait – the bone had receded so much that he would have to use a bone graft to get the tooth to stay in place. ‘It will be a waste of your time and money to do it now – it would fall out,’ he said. Though disappointed – I now needed an extra crown to keep the temporary bridge in place – I was impressed with their honesty. I would need a third visit as implanting a tooth when there is insufficient bone in the jaw is a three-stage process – extraction and healing, followed two months later by the bone graft and abutment (the implanted ‘screw’ to take the tooth) and finally, four or five months later, the porcelain tooth itself. After two days of pain-free sightseeing, Dr Juhasz fitted me with the long-term temporary bridge, and I returned two months later for a one-night stay when Dr Kaman implanted the abutment. A five-month healing period followed before the last stage. On my final visit over five days, the Budapest clinic perfected the colour, shape, bite and fit of my permanent bridge. When she handed me the mirror at the end I was so happy I burst into tears. Throughout my eight-month treatment the quality of service was impeccable. Payment is made in two instalments, the first being due at the end of the first visit, the second on completion. The work is insured for three years, although if there are problems the client has to finance their return trip. The quotation is based on what can be seen on the X-rays, so costs could be more. In the end I paid £2,300 – a saving of about £5,000. So far I have had no problems and am loving my new smile. Perhaps if more were brave enough to try dental tourism, our own dentists would have to stop bleeding us dry.","Musical star Jackie Clune hits out at high fees for dental work in the UK .

As temperatures soared to 70°F (21°C), it was too much for several graduates, standing to attention in heavy uniforms, hats and gloves. One pale-looking policeman fainted and collapsed into colleagues while another crashed to the ground and had to be helped up by the hardier ranks behind. Passing out: One poorly looking police officer is helped by colleagues after becoming faint during a Passing out Parade at the Hendon Police Training College . Feeling faint: One officer struggles to keep on her feet at the Metropolitan Police's largest ever Passing out Parade . Greeting the officers: Mayor Boris Johnson talks to some of the newly graduated police officers who have managed to stay standing . The ceremony, the largest ever Met . Police passing out parade, saw 567  trainees graduate from Hendon Police . College in north London in front of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe . and London Mayor Boris Johnson. Officers graduating included a special . constable who had saved a suicidal  man by holding onto the scruff of . his  neck as he jumped off a bridge and another who had foiled a . kidnap. Others passed out completely and had to be escorted from the parade grounds by medical staff to receive treatment. One unwell officer was determined to finish the ceremony but turned incredibly pale before collapsing into the arms of a colleague. He too then had to be helped inside by other officers. It is unclear whether the officers were struggling to cope with the stifling heat from wearing their uniforms standing in the blazing sun as temperatures reached 20c or whether a group of the officers had fallen ill from something else. Despite the interruptions the ceremony, which is the largest parade the Metropolitan Police service has ever held, was completed to welcome the 567 new officers.

A Santa Monica, California, woman claims that the city's new parking meters are causing her to have ear infections and tightness in her neck - so she wants the city to pay her billions for the inconvenience. Denise Barton has demanded the city pay her $1.7billion for the damage done since the new meters were installed in April and $1.7million every month thereafter. The city has denied the meters emit dangerous levels of radiation, saying the WiFi 's range is only five to eight feet and is on par with other consumer electronics. Conundrum: A Santa Monica, California, woman claims that the city's new parking meters are causing her to have ear infections and tightness in her neck - so she wants the city to pay her billions for the inconvenience . 'I know it seems a little big,' said Barton, a well-known local activist, to the Santa Monica Daily Press. 'But they can’t do things that affect people’s health without their consent. I think that’s wrong.' She says the city began rolling out the new meters in April and her problems started shortly thereafter. The smart meters use wireless signals to process credit cards and monitor when a car arrives or departs. A month after the devices were installed, Barton went to a doctor for an ear infection and needed antibiotics. Barton believes that the radiation emitted by the smart meters is harming her health. Claim: Denise Barton has demanded the city pay her $1.7billion for the damage done since the new meters were installed in April and $1.7million every month thereafter . Barton was in a car accident as a child and suffered neurological damage. 'I'm sensitive to to radiation due to cat scans, some with injections of radioactive dye, as a child,' she wrote in the claim, according to Patch. In the wake of new technologies, new . fears have arisen. Some people believe the radiation emitted from every . day devices can cause illnesses in people with Electromagnetic Field . Sensitivity, or EMF, though no studies have ever been conclusive. Below are some common symptoms and causes identified by the sufferers of EMF. Symptoms: . Headaches, migraines, insomnia, Alzheimers, Parkinson's, irritability, . behavior disorders, autism, nerve and/or muscle pain, Fibromyalgia, . Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), lupus, . leukemia, tumors, cancer, heart attacks . Causes: . Cell phones, microwave or cell phone towers, radar, satellite, . infrared, ultrasonic devices, Wifi, WiMax, GPS, RFID tags, computers, . power lines, and other electrical equipment . The World Health Organization recently conducted a study that defined Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity as follows: . EHS is characterized by a variety of . non-specific symptoms that differ from individual to individual. The . symptoms are certainly real and can vary widely in their severity. Whatever its cause, EHS can be a disabling problem for the affected . individual. EHS has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no . scientific basis to link EHS symptoms to EMF exposure. She cites a study by the World Health Organization that low-level radiation might cause cancer and other illnesses as the origin of her concern. 'This is just blatant negligence,' she said. 'The city didn't do enough research.' Some experts have dismissed her claims as 'frivolous . UCLA’s Chief of Radiology, Christopher Cagnon, said that Barton's argument will be difficult, if not impossible to prove. 'Anything is possible, but the risk has never been proven—ever,' he said. Don Jose, a Pennsylvania-based attorney who specializes in radiation litigation, echoed Mr Cagnon. 'Radio waves are not known to have any effect on people at any level,' he said, calling Barton 'a nut case.' Similarly, City Hall is not interested in her plight. 'We’re not concerned about any health risks,' assistant finance director Don Patterson told ABC. 'It basically uses a very weak WiFi signal that only communicates between the meter and the sensor in each space.' He called the technology 'off-the-shelf' and noted that the city doesn't regulate communication. 'What we’re using is what basically is widely available cell phone technology,' Patterson said. 'If you have WiFi in your house, it’s the same technology. If you have a cell phone, then that portion of the technology is the same.' The city has 45 days to respond to her claim, which is the largest settlement sum sought in Santa Monica's history.","Denise Barton claims WiFi signals from parking meters give her infections .

A famous American culture critic has announced he is quitting the world of art as he claims it has become obsessed with celebrities and money. Dave Hickey attacks the contemporary arts scene saying anyone who has ‘read a Batman comic’ can make a career for themselves in art. The professor and author condemns the . ‘tourist mentality’ of the industry, complaining it has led to well-known artists . being overestimated. The . 71-year-old arts and culture critic said it has become ‘calcified, . self-reverential and a hostage to rich collectors who have no respect . for what they are doing’. ‘Art editors and critics – people like me – have become a courtier class,’ he told The Observer. ‘All we do is wander around the palace and advise very rich people. It's not worth my time.’ ‘If I go to London, everyone wants to talk about Damien Hirst. I'm just not interested in him. Never have been.’ Mr Hickey said the emergence of arts consultants has led to collectors buying what they have . been told is great art, instead of forming their own opinion. 'It used to be that if you stood in . front of a painting you didn't understand, you'd have some obligation to . guess. Now you don't.’ ‘If . you stood in front of a Bridget Riley you have to look at it and it . would start to do interesting things. Now you wouldn't look at it. You . ask a consultant.’ 'Overrated': Dave Hickey said the 'tourism mentality' in modern art led to too much focus on Damien Hirst . Famous names: Critics and curators are obsessed with famous names like Antony Gormley and Tracey Emin, Hickey said . His harsh words comes after several contemporary art . curators called the works of modern ‘celebrity artists’, such as Tracey . Emin, Antony Gormley and Marc Quinn, glorified. One said their acclaim is a result of ‘too much fame, too much success and too little critical sifting,’ the Observer reported. One anonymous curator called Emin’s work ‘empty’, telling BBC arts editor Will Gompertz the high price tag led to curators defending Ms Emin's work. This comes just over a week after Damien Hirst's Verity - a 67ft bronze statue of a half-flayed pregnant woman - was erected in Ilfracombe, Devon despite hundreds of letters of complaint. ‘Money and celebrity has cast a shadow over the art world which is prohibiting ideas and debate from coming to the fore,’ Mr Gompertz said. Hyped: Damien Hirst's bronze sculpture Verity is now in place in Ilfracombe, Devon where she will stand for 20 years . Mr Hickey’s ‘resignation’ was the result of the world of art becoming too bureaucratic, he told GalleristNY. ‘What can I tell you? It's nasty and it's stupid. I'm an intellectual and I don't care if I'm not invited to the party. I quit.’ Will Gompertz added that the focus on big names had led to difficulties in debating and critiquing art. ‘At the moment it feels like the Paris salon of the 19th century, where bureaucrats and conservatives combined to stifle the field of work.'",American art critic Dave Hickey accuses modern art of being obsessed with celebrity artists .

The 'remorseless' ex-wife of one of Europe's most reviled child killers is to be released from prison to spend the next ten years 'at prayer' in a convent. Michelle Martin, 52, has served 16 years of 30-year jail term for complicity in the imprisonment and murder of the young victims of Belgian serial killer husband Marc Dutroux. Families of Dutroux's victims have branded the ruling by the Belgian court in Mons as 'an outrage'. Dutroux was arrested in 1996 and jailed for life in June 2004 for the kidnap, rape and torture of six young girls in the mid-1990s, four of whom died. Martin was also arrested in 1996 and later found guilty of helping Dutroux hold his victims prisoner. She was also convicted of complicity in the death of two of the small girls, found starved to death in a cellar in the southern city of Charleroi. The traumatic case is still fresh in the minds of many in Belgium, which is also reeling from a Catholic church child abuse scandal involving more than 500 victims. Under Belgian law, convicts can appeal for early release after serving a third of their sentence. Martin has repeatedly requested to be freed to live in a convent but until now nuns in France and Belgium had all refused to house her. Move: Martin has repeatedly requested to be freed to live in a convent but they refused to house her.

Child killer: Dutroux was first detained for the child abductions in 1996 but not convicted until 2004 . Now she has been accepted at the Clarisses monastery in the city of Malonne - just 45 miles from the scene of her crimes. Horrified Jean-Denis Lejeune, father of Julie Lejeune, one of the two eight-year-olds found in Dutroux's cellar, said: 'No one has consulted us, and now she will be living as a virtually free woman just 60 kilometres away. 'Legally we are powerless to do anything about this. The rights of the victims' families are being trampled all over by the law.' The family of victim Eefje Lambrecks . said they were strongly opposed to Martin's release because 'she had . never voiced any sincere regrets'. Psychiatrists have also warned officials that Martin could still present a danger to society, the Belgian media reported. The Dutroux affair emerged in 1996, when police arrested him following the abduction of 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez, right. She was found alive two days later along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne, left 12, in the basement of his house in the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle (both pictured in 2004) House of horrors: A policeman guards the scene where Marc Dutroux tied up and raped children in a picture taken in 2004 .

Established under the reign of Queen Victoria, Wimbledon Park Golf Club has hosted some of the finest players the sport has ever created. The late Seve Ballesteros and Colin Montgomerie are among many world-class champions invited to play on the meandering fairways in south-west London. Former cabinet secretary Lord O’Donnell and popular TV hosts Ant and Dec – Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – are reportedly on the waiting list to join the prestigious club. Clash on course: Members of Queen Victoria Wimbledon Park Golf Club want to oust a club champion whom they accuse of swearing and cheating . But now a bitter dispute over unsporting behaviour on the fairways and inappropriate language within earshot of the wood-panelled bar has begun to overshadow the usually tranquil atmosphere. Some of the club’s 800 members, which include rich businessmen, senior policemen and television presenters, have threatened to leave unless a club champion is ‘thrown out on his ear’ for alleged cheating. And the star player’s alleged use of bad language has been cited as evidence that the middle-aged player has no place at the exclusive club. Disgruntled members have launched a campaign to oust the champion accusing him of being a foul-mouthed cheat. Allegations against the star, who plays off a low handicap, stretch back several years, it is claimed in an anonymous email circulated around the club members. Foul play: The champion golfer has been accused in an anonymous email sent to members(file photo) His accuser says was ‘caught red handed’ cheating in an annual competition. When he was suspended from the club the man is said to have involved the European Court of Human Rights to get his title restored. However his detractors claim they have been forced to act following an alleged incident at the annual club knock-out competition this autumn, he is he alleged to have pocketed an opponent’s lost ball while pretending to look for it. The email claims the player, who has won a number of club championships, has cheated before – kicking his own ball out of the rough, and ‘flipping his marker two feet nearer the hole’. His dog has also been accused of sharp practice – allegedly stealing a lady member’s ball from a green. The star player allegedly told the woman to ‘get a f****** life’ when she complained. The email continued; ‘His loud swearing, particularly in the men’s changing room is also a problem’. The star player is said to have ‘refused to go’ when he was challenged about the allegations. Famous player: Scottish pro Colin Montgomerie is a fan of the prestigious Queen Victoria Wimbledon Park Golf Club . But to the growing annoyance of the email writer, it is he who has been asked to leave the club and not his nemesis – the alleged foul-mouth cheat. The club captain Sandy Adamson has now written to members appealing for calm and criticising their ‘presumption of guilt’. Mr Adamson wrote: ‘Various notices on the board of the clubhouse have also been defaced with the word “cheat”. ‘Such behaviour is shocking and I would ask members to remind themselves of the proper ethical and legal traditions that underlie the culture of our club and the legal system of our country.’ However critics of the star player have refused to be cowed. One reportedly said: ‘This isn’t about . one member disagreeing with another. There’s a lot of us who have . complained about cheating. ‘One member has already threatened to resign and I think many will go if he is allowed to stay on this time. ‘His . behaviour is not just damaging the club’s reputation but golf as a . whole.’ The star player declined to offer comment when approached by the .

Angus Skinner, 78, a retired lecturer at Imperial College and former golf club board member, told the Daily Mail: ‘I have played him a number of times and I have always found him to be a total gentleman, a really decent bloke. ‘He is a very good sportsman, one of the club’s best players.’ Mr Skinner added: ‘This whole business really should have been sorted out before it got this far.’ His son John Skinner, who is also a member of Wimbledon Park Golf Club, said: ‘He has always been very pleasant.’ Last night no one from the board of Wimbledon Park Golf Club replied to messages left by the Daily Mail. But the club is reported to have said: ‘The matter is subject of an inquiry and we have no comment to make at present.’ Set in grounds next to the All England Lawn Tennis Club and Created in 1898 Wimbledon Park Golf Course claims its course is one of the best in the UK.",Top player at Wimbledon Park Golf Club accused of using foul language and cheating .

A toddler's death during a visit with his father on October 21 in Virginia is prompting police to also more closely investigate the suicide of the man's mother and the shooting death of a onetime girlfriend in the past decade. Fifteen-month-old Prince McLeod Rams died during a three-hour, unsupervised visit with his father, Joaquin S. Rams of Manassas, police said. Manassas Police spokesman Lowell Nevill said that led police to further probe the 2008 suicide of Joaquin Rams' mother and the 2003 shooting death of his ex-girlfriend Shawn K. Mason. Prince McLeod Rams died during unsupervised time with his father Joaquin Rams on October 21. Police are now looking into the suicide of Rams' mother and shooting of his ex-girlfriend. The boy's mother, Hera McLeod, said the system failed to protect the boy after she fought vehemently to prevent the unsupervised visits, which were ordered by a judge in Maryland. Authorities have not yet determined how the boy died, and Rams has not been charged with a crime. But McLeod said the unusual confluence of deaths is not easily explained. 'Either he's the most unlucky bastard on this planet, or he's a killer,' said McLeod, who fled the relationship with her one-time fiance about two weeks after Prince was born. Joaquin Rams did not answer calls to his cellphone. His attorney also did not return calls seeking comment. Hera McLeod, the mother of Prince McLeod Rams, said Joaquin Rams was 'either the most unlucky b*****d on this planet, or he's a killer.' Hera McLeod said she has been given only a little information about her son's injuries. But she said the hospital called child protective services because of suspicious injuries, including dried blood in his nose and a bruise on his forehead. During a custody hearing for Prince Rams in March, investigators testified Joaquin Rams is a suspect in the killing of Mason, 22, who was shot in the head in her Manassas condo in 2003. In 2008, Rams' mother, Alma Collins, was found dead. Prince William County Police at the time ruled the death a suicide. While Manassas police say all the investigations remain a high priority, Prince William County police spokesman Jonathan Perok said investigators have so far not found anything to indicate Collins' death was not a suicide. But her son Joseph Velez - Joaquin Rams' half brother - said it makes no sense that his mother would have killed herself and said he has been interviewed by police investigating whether his mother's death was a homicide. 'My mother in her life never had a history of depression,' Velez said. He described his half brother as 'a monster,' describing how even at age 3, his younger brother attacked him on the head with a hammer he had hidden behind his back as he feigned a request for a kiss. Like Hera McLeod, Velez expressed frustration at police who failed to make a case in the slaying of Shawn Mason. Hera McLeod was a contestant on CBS show The Amazing Race in 2004 . And Alma Collins' sister, Elva Caraballo of Tarpon Springs, Fla., said she tried to tell Prince William County police of her suspicions about Collins' death, but detectives wouldn't return her phone calls. The most recent death occurred Oct. 21, when Hera McLeod turned over her young son to Joaquin Rams. Hera McLeod won custody of the boy in Montgomery County, Md., court. But the judge granted Rams visitation - first supervised, and then unsupervised. McLeod, an intelligence analyst who once was a contestant on the CBS reality competition 'The Amazing Race,' said she does not understand why the judge ignored her concerns for her son's safety. This was accompanied by evidence of Joaquin Rams' lack of fitness as a father: his involvement in running an online pornography business; the testimony from the Manassas detective that Rams is a suspect in his ex-girlfriend's killing; and a sexual encounter between Rams, 40, and a woman who said Rams raped her when she was 19. Rams said it was consensual. The Associated Press does not identify people who claim to be victims of sexual assault. In making his custody and visitation rulings, the judge said the suspicions about the deaths of Collins and Mason were no concern to him, describing it as 'smoke that's been blown that I can see through.' Hera McLeod said she wants to expose what went wrong and led to her son's death. 'I knew how bad this could get. ... If the laws are not designed to protect children, then they need to be changed,' she wrote about the custody ruling on a blog she maintains. 'In my son's case, it appears as though death was the only threshold for denial of visitation.'

Concern: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said that there may still be 'pockets of poor care' in hospitals . Scroll down for video . Nearly 3,000 patients are dying a year because of needless hospital blunders, figures reveal. Another 7,500 are severely harmed after being wrongly diagnosed, given incorrect drugs or poorly cared for. Experts warn that such mistakes will increase because already overstretched staff will be unable to cope with the higher numbers of patients coming into hospitals. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has admitted that there may still be ‘pockets’ of poor care like that revealed in Mid Staffordshire in 2008, where hundreds of patients died needlessly. Figures obtained by Panorama in a BBC documentary to be aired tonight show that in 2011/12, a total of 2,864 patients died following mistakes by hospital staff. This is up almost 5 per cent compared to the previous year when there were 2,726 deaths. Errors include elderly patients being misdiagnosed with cancer when they had heart failure, and being given pointless treatment while they deteriorated. In other cases nurses or midwives failed to notice chest infections in newborn babies which could have been cured with antibiotics. Dr Mike Williams, of the University of Exeter, who has carried out studies on hospital safety said: ‘Doctors, nurses, and managers do not realise the level of harm that’s going on hospitals.‘Most hospitals are now having more and more patients coming through the front door. The money is at standstill, if not reducing. ‘The number of staff are therefore at the same level, they’re having to do more work – and work harder and faster. ‘The research is very clear that where staff have to work extremely hard they are much more likely to make mistakes.’ Death rates at 12 NHS hospital trusts are alarmingly high, says an annual guide from health information firm Dr Foster. Those with above average death rates include Blackpool Teaching Hospitals, George Eliot Trust in Warwickshire, Medway Foundation Trust in Kent, University Hospitals Birmingham, Walsall, Hull and East Yorkshire, Western Sussex, North Cumbria and Northern Lincolnshire and Goole. The figures also show that another 7,559 patients were severely harmed by a mistake. This is slightly higher than the preceding 12 months when there were 7,497 such cases. Peter Walsh, of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, warned that the current system for monitoring patient safety ‘isn’t fully fit for purpose’. He said on the Panorama programme that poor care – similar to that which led to the scandal at Mid Staffordshire hospital in 2008 – existed across the Health Service. Up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died at the hospital from mistakes and neglect between 2005 and 2008. Mr Walsh, whose organisation receives 3,500 calls a year, said: ‘We see elements of what happened at Mid Staffordshire in hospitals all around the country. ‘Again we see regulators and commissioners, all thinking or wanting to believe that patient safety was somebody else’s responsibility. And it’s a terrible indictment of how the current system still isn’t fully fit for purpose.’ Overstretched: Poor care was revealed in Mid Staffordshire in 2008 where hundreds of patients died needlessly . Shocking: In 2011/12 a total of 2,864 patients died following mistakes by hospital staff (file picture) In a statement issued to the programme, the Health  Secretary said: ‘Whilst failings in care at Mid-Staffordshire  NHS Foundation Trust have shocked many, we cannot say with confidence that some of those failings do not exist in pockets elsewhere in the NHS.’ He added: ‘Whilst the majority of patients receive excellent care from the NHS, we still have much to do to ensure quality of care is considered as important as quality of treatment throughout the system.’ ■ Panorama – How Safe Is Your Hospital? will be screened tonight on BBC1 at 8.30pm.

'Husk of a man': Shrien Dewani has 'adapted poorly' to treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder as he faces extradition to South Africa to face charges of his wife's murder . The family of tragic honeymoon bride Anni Dewani have reacted with fury after the husband accused of her murder was given six more months to recover from the shock of her death. Murder suspect Shrien Dewani is said to be terrified of travelling . in a car and spends his days playing computer games while facing . extradition to South Africa. He denies hiring a hitman to murder his new wife and told police he escaped from the window of a cab in South Africa minutes before his 28-year-old wife was shot. A judge in London was told he was not fit to face extradition to South Africa because of depression and post traumatic stress. But Anni's 62-year-old father Vinod Hindocha said: 'What about my mental health and that of my family? I am not sure who is going to crack first. Anni's mother and I have never had a proper night's sleep since Anni was taken from us. 'The wheels of British justice turn very slowly but we will continue to have faith in the system.' Dewani, 33, is currently being treated in a secure mental health hospital for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) so he can be extradited to face charges of his new wife’s murder. Anni, 28, was shot when a taxi the couple were travelling in was hijacked in Gugulethu township on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010. Dewani’s condition has worsened, making him a ‘husk of a man’, his lawyer Clare Montgomery told Westminster Magistrates’ Court. She said: ‘He cannot travel by car as he has a severe reaction, he doesn’t want to get into a travelling car or go outside. ‘He doesn’t even want to go to the shops on his own,’ she added as the conditions of his bail were discussed. ‘In his current state it is unthinkable he would be able to plan any escape, let alone effect one.’ The court also heard that Dewani has flashbacks and remembers the smell of the breath of the man who held a gun to his head before hijacking his car and murdering his bride so vividly that it was ‘burned into his brain’. Honeymoon murder: Dewani (pictured with Anni on their wedding day in 2010) is accused of ordering a cab driver to arrange the shooting death of Anni while on honeymoon in Capetown . His extradition to face trial in South Africa has been halted on the grounds he is suffering severe mental disorders. The . court heard that he now spends his days sitting in a disused camper van . on the grounds of Fromeside Hospital, Bristol where he prays and plays . computer games. Giving evidence, his psychiatrist, Dr Paul Cantrell, admitted that Dewani had ‘adapted poorly’ to treatment and is suffering from severe PTSD and moderate depression. He said: ‘His depression has moved into the moderate range, albeit in the lower range of that range in the borderlands between severe and moderate. ‘I am clear that his PTSD remains in the severe range. That PTSD has mutated over time and there are different aspects of it that now incapacitate him but the most difficult aspect is his hyper-arousal which make him highly sensitive to noise and now very clearly smell. ‘Something akin to the smell of the breath of the man that is burned into his brain who was holding a gun, by his account, to his head.’ His hyper-sensitivity to both smells and sounds ‘trigger the re-experiencing of those events in South Africa,’ Dr Cantrell said . The psychiatrist, who is not instructed by either the authorities or the defence, said: ‘When I say re-experiencing it is not just memory, it is as if he was there, that is how disabling it is.’ Dewani maintains that he is innocent of the allegations and was a victim of the hijacking before he was ordered out of the vehicle which drove off with his bride. Her body was found in the abandoned vehicle the next day. Stressed: The court heard today that Dewani is terrified of car travel and vividly remembers the smell of the breath of the man who hijacked the car. He is currently being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression . Today the judge granted an application by his legal teams to vary his bail conditions so that he could move from Fromeside to Blaise View Hospital, also in Bristol, which has lower levels of security and was described as a more ‘open, relaxed and calm environment’. Hugo Keith QC, representing the South African authorities, said the 32-year-old does not see himself as a patient at times, that he has fought against treatment and has been aggressive towards staff. He also suggested that Dewani spends his time ‘in his camper van playing computer games’. Dr Cantrell agreed. Dewani’s bail conditions include a £250,000 security, which has already been paid, not to leave the mental health hospital where he is required to spend nights without permission and to continue with his treatment. Dewani’s extradition was ordered in August last year but proceedings were temporarily halted by the High Court in March on the grounds it would ‘unjust and oppressive’ to extradite him immediately because of his health. Ms Montgomery said: ‘We are hoping and believe on the evidence he will recover, in which case he there is no battle at all apart from ensuring appropriate conditions in South Africa.’ The legal arguments against his . extradition will therefore be whether the conditions in South Africa are . sufficient to ensure he does not relapse into his ‘severe and disabling . mental state’. She added: . ‘At some point he will became fit to plead, he will no longer require . medical treatment and all that will be required is some reassurances on . the conditions in which he will be held.’ Dewani . was arrested in December 2010 and has been held in secure units at . Fromeside Hospital as part of his bail conditions since in February last . year when he took an overdose in an apparent suicide attempt. Family watches on: Both families packed the galleries to hear the proceedings including Dewani's father Prakesh Dewani (left with unidentified woman) and Anni's parents Vinod Hindocha and Nilam Hindocha (right) who revealed that the wait has been torture . The ‘constant noises’ and conditions at the hospital which houses ‘seriously disturbed patients’ are a ‘maintaining feature’ in his illness, Ms Montgomery said. The South African authorities are requesting him on charges of murder, kidnap, robbery with aggravated circumstances, conspiracy to commit those offences and a charge of obstructing the administration of justice. Ms Montgomery said: ‘He continues to express a desire to return to South Africa and face his trial.’ Both families packed the public the gallery to listen to the legal discussions. A review hearing will be heard in April while the full hearing reviewing the decision will take place in June. Outside the court Mrs Dewani’s uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said: ‘We accept the court’s decision today, we know these things take and British justice system is taking too much long time.’ Single shot: Anni was shot in the neck after the car she and Dewani were travelling in was hijacked, before he was ordered out of the car while on their honeymoon in Cape Town . Anni’s father, Vinod Hindocha, stood next to his brother as he revealed that he is travelling to South Africa tomorrow. Ashok said: ‘He is leaving for South Africa tomorrow to make sure that justice is being done, we hope that justice will be done for us.’ Speaking about the final hearing date he said: ‘It is eight months of torture for our family, we have no other choice but to accept what the court says, but to wait.’ It is alleged that Dewani paid cab driver Zola Tongo to arrange the hit whilst on honeymoon in Cape Town in November 2010. Their car was hijacked as it passed through the township of Gugulethu. Tongo then ordered out Dewani but Anni was driven off by Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe who robbed her mobile phone, white gold diamond bracelet, Armani wristwatch and handbag before she was killed with a single shot wound to her neck. Tongo’s middleman Monde Mbolombo and hijacker Qwabe admitted their roles in plea bargains in which they agreed to testify against the care home boss and received lighter sentences. Terminally ill hitman Mngeni was found guilty last month of firing the shot which killed the Swedish engineer.

In court: Dane Bowers arrives at Norwich Crown Court today where he admitted common assault . Singer and former Big Brother star Dane Bowers must perform community service after admitting common assault during a drunken night out. Norwich Crown Court heard how Bowers led a group of men in a violent confrontation against another group, including two black men, outside a nightclub in the city. During the attack, the 33-year-old former partner of glamour model Katie Price, grabbed a man by the neck and 'shook him around', the court heard. Witnesses said they heard Bowers shouting racist language but when challenged he told them: 'Don't accuse me of being racist, my father's black'. Other witnesses said somebody else may have shouted the abuse. When arrested Bowers told police that he was '8 out of 10 drunk' with 10 being a state of total drunkenness. He had been due to stand trial today accused of two counts of assault on separate victims and one of harassment - all allegedly racially aggravated. But today Bowers, who wore a grey shirt, waistcoat and tie in court, admitted one count of common assault and one of threatening behaviour, both without any racial element. Judge Stephen Holt ordered that he compete 120 hours of unpaid work for the community. He must also pay £1,000 in legal costs. Prosecutor John Farmer said the other charges would not be proceeded with. Mr Farmer said the incident happened after 5am on June 2 in Prince of Wales Road, Norwich's nightclub district. 'The defendant was with a group of friends and much drink had been consumed,' he added. 'There was a confrontation and Mr Bowers was then the front runner in a group of young men driving up Prince of Wales Road as another man backed off.' Kevin Molloy, mitigating, said that Bowers was 'many degrees away from somebody who could be deemed racist'. He added that his grandfather is Jamaican. Bowers is involved in charitable work including with the Sodje Sports Foundation which develops grass roots sport in Nigeria and with tackling racism in football, Mr Molloy added. Former partners: Dane Bowers pictured with his ex-girlfriend Katie Price in 2000 . Music career: Dane Bowers, pictured far right, was part of the boy-band Another Level shown above at HMV in London's Oxford Street to promote their album in the 1990s . 'Whatever was said was said by somebody not in his group,' he added. Mr Molloy pleaded that a curfew, which would mean Bowers must stay home during certain hours, not be imposed so as not to interfere with his musical career. Bowers, from Coulsdon, Surrey, had two previous convictions for drink driving and was cautioned for common assault on New Year's Eve, 2005. Judge Holt told him: 'You got thoroughly drunk, putting it politely, and got in all sorts of trouble. 'It seems highly unlikely that you, given your background, would have made racist remarks. 'Putting that to one side, problems on Prince of Wales Road are a constant thorn in the side of this city - young men go out and get drunk and cause a great deal of problems.' It is understood Bowers had been enjoying a stag night with friends at the time. The singer, now a DJ, rose to fame with boy band Another Level in the 1990s. He appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2010.

The sight of safety barriers and security guards protecting the 8ft tree - the crown jewel in the Durham town's Christmas festival - served only to heighten the excitement. But within an hour of lighting up the . town and the faces of the 1,500 who turned out, the fake-frosted tree . was hurriedly taken down for fear of electrocuting somebody. Fir your eyes (and one hour) only: The Stanley Christmas tree in all its glory before council bosses pulled the plug after one hour for fear of electrocuting somebody . Fake fir: The £10,000 metal Christmas tree took all day to put up and was the crown jewel in Stanley Town Council's £15,000 Christmas budget. More than 1,500 people turned out to see the big switch on . Shocking: One Durham councillor said that there was a good risk that anyone messing around with it would 'not just get a little shock. It would be a fatality' The plug was pulled when Stanley Town Council chiefs realised the 240 volt metal tree twinkling with thousands . of blue lights was ten times the health and safety electrics limit. Durham County Councillor Carl Marshall, who helped organise the festival, said: 'The tree was metal and covered in LEDs. 'If anyone was to open up a junction box or was messing about with it then there was good risk that they would not just get a little shock. 'It would be a fatality. 'I am disappointed because it was a great spectacle for Stanley’s Front Street. It is a total joke.' The tree was bought six weeks before Saturday's 'switch-on' and its instructions were in French, although this is not believed to have caused the oversight. It was erected by Durham County Council, who checked the tree and realised it did not meet safety specifications so fenced it off for the duration of the event and then had it dismantled. Council clerk Russell Morgan said: 'Modification work has been scheduled for January/February 2013 to ensure that the tree is fully operational in less controlled circumstances for many more Christmases to come and a range of suitable locations is being considered within the council’s wider regeneration strategy for the town centre.' Local shop owners, who hoped the town’s new decoration would bring much-needed trade to the town, told of their shock over the tree’s premature removal. Gillian Andrews, manager of Store 21, a clothes and home ware store on Front Street said: 'It was meant to be a big event. Christmas always goes so quickly: The assembling and dismantling of the 8ft metal tree cost £2,000. The voltage needed to light it ran at 240v - ten times the safety limit . On the button: Ross Adams (centre) alongside Santa Claus and an unknown volunteer lighting up the £10,000 metal Christmas tree . 'The town council and Stanley Traders Association wrote to us asking us to extend our opening hours which we did. 'There was a lot spent on it and we all hoped it would attract more people here. 'It’s disappointing that the tree has been taken down, they went to a lot of effort on the night getting a soap star and they were collecting money from each store for a Secret Santa for the kids.” Elizabeth Cajioa, owner of Jake’s Hairdressing on Front Street, Stanley, said: 'I saw them putting it up on Saturday, after four hours they’d half finished it, but I left before they finished or took it down. 'It was a fake frosted metal tree. Ready for action: Emmerdale's Ross Adams, known as Alex Owen to soap fans, turned on Stanley's Christmas lights . 'I’m not really surprised. I didn’t think it would last, some people in Stanley might have vandalised it first. 'I think that £10,000 could have been better spent, there’s a few shops fronts that need doing up.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:29 EST, 10 September 2011 . As power was finally restored to six . million, officials from Arizona's largest electric utility said on . Friday they are still baffled by the chain of events that caused massive . blackouts across Arizona, California and parts of Mexico. APS has said they believe a single . employee at the North Gila substation tripped a 500-kV transmission line . that runs from Arizona to Southern California. They are investigating how that happened and the subsequent failure of safeguards that should have prevented major outages. Scroll down for video . Darker than usual: Despite lights showing in San Diego buildings, the city was without power after a blackout on caused havoc on Thursday . Daniel Froetscher, Vice President of . Energy Delivery for APS, said: 'We’re struggling. We have to take a hard . look at the system design and figure out exactly what happened. We . don’t know the underlying causes.' Early Thursday, APS officials noticed . an issue with a series capacitor at the North Gila substation outside . the city of Yuma, Mr Froetscher said. The capacitor — a piece of equipment . about the size of a small car that helps the utility manage voltage — . wasn’t functioning properly. APS personnel were dispatched to take it offline, the LA Times. Going nowhere: Passenger Michael Moretti waits at the baggage pick-up at San Diego International Airport after a massive blackout hit Southern California . Typically, the utility can shut down an individual capacitor and reroute power without any disruption of service, Mr Froetscher said. But this time, something went wrong. After the North Gila capacitor was taken offline, the 500-kV line that runs through the substation went down. At that point, 3.27pm, the grid should have compensated for the loss of the 500-kV line, which runs from Yuma to the Imperial Valley and San Diego. 'The intent is for the system to automatically open and close different breakers and relays and switches to reroute power from the line that was lost to other lines to continue to provide service,' he said. 'Transmission lines do go out of service on an unplanned basis; it’s not an unusual event. Most times when a line goes out unexpectedly, the system performs exactly as it’s expected to and customers never know the difference.' Rebecca Wilder, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates electric utilities in the state, said the agency was monitoring the APS investigation. Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which operates most of the state’s electric grid, insisted that it’s too early to even theorize about the cause of the San Diego power outage or its size. 'Someone who comes to conclusions quickly doesn’t know what he is talking about,' she said, noting that a similar massive outage struck parts of California on August 10, 1996, with the loss of a 500-kV high-voltage transmission line from the Pacific Northwest that is similar to the Southwestern Power Link that went down Thursday in Arizona. The blackout was a reminder that U.S. transmission lines remain vulnerable to cascading power failures. There have been several similar failures in recent years. In 2003, a blackout knocked out power to 50 million people in the Midwest and the Northeast. And in 2005, a major outage struck the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the Associated Press reports. That same year, Congress required utilities to comply with federal reliability standards for the electricity grid, instead of self-regulation. Layers of safeguards and backups were intended to isolate problems and make sure the power keeps flowing. But that didn't happen on Thursday. By candlelight: The power outage didn't end the night for visitors to Voyeur in San Diego's Gaslamp District . The San Diego County Sheriff's Department and other police departments told 10News.com  they received reports of break-ins and vandalism at homes and businesses. The Sheriff's department received reports of a glass door broken at a taco store in Lemon Grove and a report of a home break-in in Vista during the outage. A suspect in San Diego was arrested after he was found to have items from a Kensington area home where neighbours had reported a possible robbery. APS, Arizona's largest electricity provider, said a utility worker doing maintenance near Yuma triggered the blackout. The error, on a high-voltage power line linking Arizona and San Diego, causing a cascading series of electrical grid failures stretching into Southern California. Authorities say the outage was accidentally triggered sometime Thursday afternoon when the APS electrical worker removed a piece of monitoring equipment at a power substation in southwest Arizona. An APS statement said: 'The outage appears to be related to a procedure an APS employee was carrying out in the North Gila substation. Lights out: Buildings in downtown San Diego look eerily abandoned as the blackout drags on. A single worker was responsible for the power cut . Inconvenience store: A shopper is forced to make her grocery choices in the dark at her local store. More than six million people and businesses were affected . 'Operating and protection protocols . typically would have isolated the resulting outage to the Yuma area. The . reason that did not occur in this case will be the focal point of the . investigation into the event, which already is underway.' Daniel Froetscher, an APS vice president, said authorities . quickly ruled out any sabotage or, in the anxious days leading up to . the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 attacks, any suggestion of terrorism. Power tripped: Map shows the affected areas of the power outage . 'This was not a deliberate act. The employee was just switching out a piece of equipment that was problematic.' For obvious reasons, APS did not name the employee. It's possible that extreme heat in the region also may have caused some problems with the transmission lines, one expert said. Many minor traffic accidents occurred as the outage caused mayhem on streets without stoplights during rush hour. Leah Walden, 59, of California, said she saw about five fender-bender crashes on one trip out. Ms Walden said: 'People are irritated. They don't want to wait.' In the beach town of Encinitas north of San Diego, Tim Grenda, 41, put a positive spin on the situation, pointing out that his hot yoga class was cooler as a result of the outage. Rosa Maria Gonzales, a spokeswoman with the Imperial Irrigation District in California's sizzling eastern desert, was less enthusiastic - temperatures were well into triple-digit territory when the power went out. Ms Gonzales said: 'It feels like you're in an oven and you can't escape.' Many offices closed during the outage but workers were caught in gridlock conditions because traffic lights were out.

FBI officials ruled out terrorism . while power plant authorities struggled to find the cause of the outage . that started shortly before 4pm local time. A . transmitter line between Arizona and California was severed, said Mike . Niggli, chief operating officer of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., . causing the outage. The extreme heat in some areas also may have caused . some problems with the lines. People were trapped in elevators and on rides at Sea World in San Diego and Legoland in Carlsbad. The San Onofre nuclear power plant . went offline at 3.30pm as they are programmed to do when there is a . disturbance in the power grid, said Charles Coleman, a spokesman from Southern California Edison. He said there was no danger to the public or to workers there. The . outage came more than eight years after a more severe black out in 2003 . darkened a large swath of the Northeast and Midwest. More than 50 million people were affected in that outage. Five . hundred to 2,000 SoCal Edison customers in southern Orange County and . Riverside County are currently without power and there is no estimate . for when power will be restored, Coleman said. A pain at the pump: People park their cars at an Encinitas, California, gas station, waiting for the power to come back on last night . She show must go on: Undaunted by the power cut, workers at Filippi's pizza still manage to serve customers by candlelight outside the store . Slow progress in all directions: Freeway traffic was gridlocked in both directions as traffic signals went down and police struggled to keep vehicles moving . Capt. Mike Stone of the Orange County Fire Authority said several people were trapped and rescued at the tony Ritz Carlton hotel in south Orange County, Stone said.

A judge who told a burglar that stealing from homes took 'a huge amount of courage' before setting him free has been formally reprimanded. Judge Peter Bowers admitted he could be pilloried for sparing Richard Rochford from prison at Teesside Crown Court when he made the comment in September. David Cameron got involved in the outcry that followed saying that burglars were cowards, not brave, and their crimes were 'hateful'. Judge Peter Bowers, left, was reprimanded for saying Richard Rochford, right, was 'brave' for carrying out burglaries in other people's homes . Following an investigation, the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice have upheld complaints about the judge’s comments and issued him with a reprimand after his remarks 'damaged public confidence in the judicial process', the Office for Judicial Complaints said. They believed the use of the word courage was a 'serious error of judgement' and 'offensive' to those who have been victims of a burglary, according to a letter from the OJC to one of the complainants, radio presenter Nick Ferrari. Judge Bowers told an offender who raided three homes in five days: 'It takes a huge amount of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to burgle somebody’s house. I wouldn’t have the nerve.' Handing 26-year-old Richard Rochford, from Redcar, a suspended 12-month term, the judge said: 'I’m going to take a chance on you', the Evening Gazette newspaper reported. After acknowledging the trauma . burglary victims face, the judge explained he would not jail Rochford, . who had quit drugs since the February break-ins. He was given a two-year supervision order with drug rehabilitation and 200 hours’ unpaid work, with a one-year driving ban. Following the case, Mr Ferrari, who presents the LBC 97.3 breakfast show, sent a written complaint to the OJC after he was contacted by thousands of listeners venting their anger at the judge’s remarks. Judge Bowers' comments at Teesside Crown Court caused an outcry and even attracted criticism from David Cameron . He said: 'These comments appear to praise this individual even though he was found guilty of his crime. In addition to this the sentence seems to reward this man for his behaviour rather than punish. 'He could have been jailed for two-and-a-half years but instead he was given a suspended 12-month jail sentence. 'The comment and the sentence has upset and angered my listeners, many of whom have been victims of burglaries.' Following the decision to reprimand the judge, the OJC replied: 'Whilst His Honour Judge (HHJ) Bowers regrets his use of the word ‘courage’ the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice believe that this was a serious error of judgment and offensive to those who have been victims of a burglary. 'They also believe that HHJ Bowers’ conduct has been damaging to the respect of the judicial process. For this reason, HHJ Bowers has been issued with a formal reprimand.' Announcing the decision, an OJC spokesman said: 'His Honour Judge Peter Bowers has been issued with a reprimand following complaints about remarks he made during his sentencing of a burglar at Teesside Crown Court.

West Ham players have leapt to the defence of Andy Carroll after the striker was accused of assaulting a photographer during the squad's Christmas party. The £35million England star, on loan at Upton Park from Liverpool, has found himself in hot-water after the incident outside a nightclub in Dublin in the early hours of Sunday morning. Happy Hammers: Andy Carroll and Kevin Nolan were part of a group to visit Whipps Cross Hospital in Essex . Carroll is said to have lashed out at . 33-year-old snapper Paddy Cummins, who was trying to take a shot of him . without his leg-brace. The centre-forward is expected to miss the next two months with a knee injury and is required to wear the brace. But in a show of team solidarity, . Carroll's team-mates will vouch for the 23-year-old when questioned by . club officials about the incident. The players will insist the striker . was provoked and showed no aggression towards the photographer. Team-mate Kevin Nolan, who joined . Carroll on a trip to Whipps Cross Hospital in Essex on Tuesday to hand . out presents to sick children, said: 'Someone is trying to fabricate a . story and that is the disappointing thing. It is part and parcel of what . we do and we understand that. 'We have had a fantastic weekend away . and you think you have come back with no problems but someone has made . something which was nothing as far as I was aware.' Photographer Cummins alleges he was eye-gouged, pushed to the floor and that Carroll attempted to bite him during fracas. Garda - Ireland's police force - have launched an investigation into the incident, which is said to have taken place at 2.30am. Carroll and a number of his team-mates have been interviewed by police but no arrests have been made. Meal deal: Carroll - seemingly without his protective leg brace on - is pictured ordering food from Burger King at the end of his night out . Injured: Carroll was wearing a protective knee brace on Saturday at Upton Park . On Tuesday West Ham released a statement backing Carroll. It read: 'Andy Carroll was in Dublin as part of a social trip with full permission of the management team. 'Andy agreed to have a number of pictures taken at the request of a photographer who was waiting on the street. 'Despite this, the photographer then . carried on taking photos in the close proximity of Andy and was politely . asked to stop by the private security team working on the trip. 'When he then continued taking more . photos he was restrained by the security team for Andy's . safety. Eyewitnesses state at no point was there any physical contact . between Andy and the photographer. 'The Garda took statements from the group back at the hotel and no further action was taken.' Speaking about the disappearance of . the leg brace, Carroll's agent Mark Curtis added: 'The leg brace was . outside his trousers inside the club because he wanted people to see it . so they wouldn't knock into him. When he left he put it under the . trousers.' 'He can't walk without it. He isn't a daft lad and he wouldn't be able to put weight on his leg without it.' Carroll now looks likely to escape recrimination from police and West Ham over the incident. Since January 2011, Carroll has scored seven league goals. Barcelona striker Lionel Messi scored nine in November. In 95 league games for Newcastle, Liverpool and West Ham, Carroll has scored 21 goals. Messi has scored 22 in his last 16 matches. In his Premier League career, Carroll has six assists. Messi has seven in 19 matches this season.

Free: Ezekiel McCarthy, at the Old Bailey, pictured outside the Old Bailey was giving a nine month suspended sentence after stabbing his nephew . A pensioner who fatally stabbed his nephew after mistaking him for a burglar walked free from court after a judge took pity on him. Confused Ezekiel McCarthy, 85, stabbed Desbert Welsh, 50, while 'defending himself' against what he thought was an intruder the morning after the pair had been out celebrating the former's birthday in Cricklewood, north London, last November. McCarthy, one of the oldest people to appear at the Old Bailey, was handed a nine month jail term suspended for two years on condition that he is supervised during that time. Judge Peter Beaumont, the Recorder of London, said it was extremely unlikely he would offend again. He told him: 'You took the life of a wholly innocent man who had shown you nothing but friendship and support.' But the judge said he had received reports, including those from members of the family, which showed what sort of person he really was. The Old Bailey heard McCarthy was confused when he plunged a knife into Desbert Welsh, 50. Last month, he denied murder and his plea to manslaughter was accepted by the prosecution. Mr Welsh died on November 13 last year at McCarthy’s ground-floor flat in sheltered accommodation. The pair had been drinking and celebrating McCarthy’s birthday a few days earlier. They arrived at McCarthy’s home in the early hours and in the morning, he stabbed Mr Welsh. McCarthy is said to have stamped on his head and shouted after stabbing him: 'This bloody man. I don’t know how he got in my room.' He later told police: 'I was defending myself.' The Scales of Justice on top of the Old Bailey in central London, where Ezekiel McCarthy was given a nine month suspended jail term . McCarthy had become paranoid he was going be targeted and had hidden a knife under his bed to protect himself. He was originally charged with Mr Welsh’s murder but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter on the day his trial was due to begin. Jonathan Rees, QC, prosecuting, said: 'This is a dreadfully sad case involving the killing of a nephew by his uncle, thinking he was an unknown intruder.' Mr Welsh died three days later from a stab wound which pierced his liver and caused complications. Medical reports indicated that McCarthy had suffered an acute episode of delirium or confusion brought about by medical conditions linked to his age. Alex Milne QC, defending, said the death had had an impact on the whole family. McCarthy could not believe what he had done and could not associate the victim with his nephew. Mr Milne said: 'He is destroyed. He is mortified. He could not in his wildest dreams harm his nephew.'","Confused Ezekiel McCarthy thought that Desbert Welsh, 50, was an intruder in his Cricklewood, north London, home .

One of America’s most famous historical figures who wrote the Declaration of Independence might not have fathered his slave’s children after all. It had been believed for more than a decade that former U.S. President Thomas Jefferson fathered his slave Sally Hemings’s youngest son, Eston. But DNA evidence that showed a Jefferson male fathered the boy actually suggests Mr Jefferson’s brother Randolph was the dad, a new book says. Changing history: It had been believed for more than a decade that U.S. President Thomas Jefferson fathered his slave Sally Hemings's youngest son, Eston . It’s an important debate because of America’s history of slavery and race - and Mr Jefferson’s controversial ownership of slaves. The book's release comes as the Smithsonian's . National Museum of African American History and Culture plans an exhibit . to explore Mr Jefferson's history with slavery. Museum . officials say the exhibit, to be opened in January, will tackle the sensitive subject of slavery during . the American Revolution. Mr Jefferson called slavery an 'abominable crime' but was a lifelong slaveholder. The scholars’ book also disputes beliefs that Ms Hemings's children received special treatment from the president, which suggested a special bond with the president. ‘It is true that Sally’s sons Madison and Eston were freed in Jefferson’s will,’ commission chairman Robert F. Turner told the Washington Times. ‘But so were all but two of the sons and grandsons of Sally’s mother Betty Hemings, who still belonged to Thomas Jefferson at the time of his death. ‘Sally’s sons received by far the least favourable treatment of those freed in Thomas Jefferson’s will,’ the former University of Virginia professor said.

The book, entitled ‘The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy: Report of the Scholars Commission’, will be released on Thursday.

The commission was formed by request of the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society - a group that tries to defend his image. Richard Dixon, of the Jefferson Heritage Society, told the Washington Times the book is important as shows ‘the issue is not proven’. ‘It does address (these) reasons why Jefferson could have been the father in a detailed manner - and shows the fallacies in these reasons,’ he said. Publication: The book, entitled 'The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy: Report of the Scholars Commission', will be released on Thursday . The Thomas Jefferson Foundation in Virginia says the evidence they have seen suggests he was the father, but it cannot be proven either way. 'It does address (these) reasons why Jefferson could have been the father, in a detailed manner, and shows the fallacies in these reasons, and should bring the reader back to a point where the issue is not proven' Richard Dixon, Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society . It all dates back to the early 1800s . when a newspaper claimed Mr Jefferson had fathered ‘several children’ with a slave called Sally. Evidence released almost 200 years later in 1998 showed a genetic link between family descendants of Mr Jefferson and Eston Hemings, reported the Washington Times. It's also believed Mr Hemings’s family said his father was an ‘uncle’, which scholars say is referring to Mr Jefferson’s brother Randolph.

For many the sight of his grinning face tucking into a 'cow pie'  brings back memories of a happier and simpler time -  the golden age of comics when children would excitedly part with pocket money for the next installment of their hero's escapades. In the wake of World War Two, the Dandy Comic was the nation's children's best loved buy, and despite households still relying on ration books, the magazine had a circulation which topped two million. But now, as Desperate Dan - the comics best known character - approaches his 75th birthday and following a steep drop in circulation in recent years, the world's third-longest-running comic magazine will switch to online only publication. Seventy-five years after Desperate Dan ate his first cow pie, he is set to settle into his new home on the internet . From Tuesday, gone will be the inky weekly paper comic, and Dan will settle into his new home in a  digital edition, which is expected to cost a little over a pound if bought singly, according to DC Thomson & Co, the comic's Dundee-based publisher. The team have been busily putting the secret finishing touches to its new website, drawing on the help of some of the comics biggest fans and former workers. Morris Heggie, 62-year-old archivist and former editor, told the Observer he believed the best was yet to come. 'It is a long time since I have had sleepless nights over the Dandy, but this new site is classic Dandy and just fabulous.' The Dandy, which launched in 1937, has featured characters such as Bananaman, Korky the Cat, Cuddles and Dimples, and Beryl the Peril . While enthusiastic, Mr Heggie said he admits his heart remains with the print edition, from loving the bad quality paper that the comic was printed on after the war, to championing the look of the original pen-and-ink illustrations, which he says have never been bettered. He said he still remembers the smell of a new DC Thomson Christmas annual, a passion his grown up children still tease him over, adding: 'There was this inky smell the first couple of times you opened it. It was a unique British style, too.' The Dandy, best known for cartoon character Desperate Dan, is being pulled from shelves  and replaced with an online version. The comic has had several overhauls (left) since it was first released (right) Over the years the magazine has won a legion of celebrity fans, including Sir Paul McCartney, who were raised on the comics and eagerly bought them at the height of their popularity . The Dandy, which launched in 1937, has featured characters such as Bananaman, Korky the Cat, Cuddles and Dimples, and Beryl the Peril. The first edition of the Dandy Comic cost just tuppence - and there was a free whistle on the cover . The print title came out every week from its launch in 1937 until 1941, when paper shortages forced it to alternate weeks with sister title the Beano. By 1949 it had gone back to weekly editions and a year later it changed its name to simply the Dandy - the first in a series of infrequent efforts to modernise. With a circulation of 2m in 1950, the Dandy became the world's biggestselling comic . On Tuesday the world's third-longest-running comic magazine will switch to online publication . A bronze statue of Desperate Dan . stands in Dundee city centre, alongside Minnie the Minx, from The . Dandy’s sister title The Beano . Throughout 75 years of change the comic has reflected world events, all with its own inimitable, and very British, humour. In 1941 Desperate Dan even helped the war efforts, by sinking U-boats and bringing down enemy planes with a peashooter. Hitler and Göring were also taken apart in a strip called Addie and Hermy, The Nasty Nazis. It saw Desperate Dan, who is rumoured to have been modeled on Former editor Albert Barnes, punch Hitler all the way back to Germany. In 1997, Dan fans rallied for a return of their hero when he was 'temporarily retired' following an edition in which he was shown disappearing off into the sunset with the Spice Girls. DC Thomson later admitted this was a publicity stunt to garner attention for their 60th anniversary title. And Dan also caused a stir during the BSE outbreak when he famously gave up his cow pies. A Dandy revamp in 2010 saw some of the magazine's old favourites pushed aside to make room for new celebrity-based comic strips, featuring Harry Hill, Cheryl Cole, Simon Cowell, Jamie Oliver and Jeremy Clarkson. DC Thomson has said while there will be no more weekly comics, there are still plans for a printed Dandy annual for those not quite ready to go completely digital. Over the years the magazine has won a legion of celebrity fans who were raised on the comics and eagerly bought them at the height of their popularity. Sir Paul McCartney is reportedly a fan and in a recent letter to the publication, said: ‘The Dandy was a favourite comic of mine when growing up in Liverpool and each week I would look forward to the exploits of Desperate Dan and his other comic book colleagues. 'I feel a little sadness that I see its final issue is appearing in December. 'In 1963, in the NME, when asked what my personal ambition was, I replied – to have my picture in The Dandy! I hope it’s not too late!’ In the final issue, Sir Paul’s cartoon persona leads a sing-along with the comic’s most famous characters at a farewell party. The Dandy’s print editor, Craig Graham, said: ‘When the decision was taken to stop printing The Dandy and take it online earlier this year, it really was a case of now or never. 'Sir Paul wrote a lovely letter to us, wishing The Dandy well and hoping it wasn’t too late to make an appearance. How could we refuse?’ The last print issue of The Dandy will go on sale on Tuesday. The first digital issue will go live on www.dandy.com on the same day.","The Dandy,  the world's third-longest-running comic magazine will switch to online publication on Tuesday .

A town mayor became so fed up with residents' bad manners he has introduced new rules forcing them to be polite. Mayor Gerard Plée brought in regulations requiring all visitors to speak politely to staff at the town hall in Lhéraule, situated a little north of Paris. And if anyone forgets their Ps and Qs or fails to say 'thank you' they will promptly be told to leave. Mind your Ps and Qs: Visitors to the Lheraule town hall can now be forced to leave if they are rude after the mayor brought in new rules demanding politeness . Mayor Plee said: 'Being polite is the basic gesture of respect towards others which is needed for people to live together in harmony. 'I believe that when people enter the town hall they should comply with certain common courtesies, such as wishing people good morning, saying goodbye when they leave, and please and thank you when they are being served. 'If I don’t introduce this rule I have no power to take action against these people because there is no law in France that forces people to say hello, and there’s no judge who will condemn someone for not saying it.' He added he felt compelled to introduce the rule after an incident at the town hall where a visitor was rude. A smile costs nothing: Mayor Gerard Plee said the rule is aimed at the 'eternally dissatisfied, the rancorous and grumpy people' The decree, which comes after a poll found 'lack of manners' was the number one cause of stress for 60 per cent of French population, is aimed at 'the eternally dissatisfied, the rancorous and any other grumpy people'. The mayor of the northern Oise town, which has just 185 residents, hopes the measure will improve the 'social standards in the municipality'. A notice has now been pinned up outside the door of the town hall warning visitors of the consequences of any rudeness. The only exceptions to the rule are on election day and during weddings. It read: 'Visitors to the Lhéraule municipal offices are required to comply with and observe the social norms of politeness and courtesy...especially by greeting municipal staff upon entering the premises. 'In the case of manifest failure to comply voluntarily with these norms the person concerned will be requested to leave the premises.'","Mayor Gerard Plée introduced the regulation requiring all visitors to the town hall in .

He is determined to return to the Special Forces regiment after winning a legal battle last week. Sergeant Nightingale, 37, was freed by Appeal Court judges on Thursday after widespread outrage over an 18-month sentence for illegally possessing a pistol and ammunition. Back together: Sergeant Danny Nightingale has returned home to his family in time for Christmas . To the frontline: But SAS soldier Danny Nightingale, pictured kissing his wife Sally after he was freed from prison, may be serving in Afghanistan within months . Campaign: Sally Nightingale, wife of soldier Danny Nightingale, outside the Royal Courts of Justice before handing in a petition for his release . The punishment was cut to 12 months and suspended, allowing him to return home. He is now fighting to clear his name by overturning the conviction, while weighing up his military career options. Sitting with his wife Sally, 38, and their two daughters Mara, five, and Alys, two, Sergeant Nightingale said: ‘I want to get my good name back and I want to return to my regiment. ‘I’m still proud to have been a member of the SAS. It has always been the pinnacle of my career.’ SAS soldier Sgt Danny Nightingale was jailed for illegal possession of a pistol he was gifted by Iraqi soldiers . He is expected to have talks with his commanders over the publicity surrounding his case. The SAS is a notoriously secretive unit with members fiercely protecting their identities so they are not compromised on top secret operations. Sergeant Nightingale’s name and face have been splashed across television screens, newspapers and websites. Once a soldier is ‘outed’, their career with the elite regiment is almost certainly at an end. But Sergeant Nightingale could return to his old unit – the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment – for a two-month ‘cooling off’ period and he is trained as a combat medic. If that happens he could be deployed to Helmand next March. However, if he fails to quash his conviction he could be discharged from the Army under the Queen’s Regulations. Sergeant Nightingale, who has served with valour in Iraq and Afghanistan, was sent to a military prison in Colchester three weeks ago after pleading guilty to possessing a working 9mm Glock pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition at his quarters in Hereford. The weapon was a souvenir from Iraqi soldiers but the SAS sniper forgot he had it when he suffered ‘significant’ brain damage after collapsing on a charity trek in the Brazilian jungle. He admitted two charges at the court martial in November. But his legal team argued at the Royal Courts of Justice in London that the ‘exemplary’ soldier was pressured into pleading guilty after the trial judge hinted he would receive five years in a civilian jail if he fought the case. More than 107,000 signed a petition demanding his release and Prime Minister David Cameron expressed sympathy.

Child stars of the West End hit Matilda are earning just £250 a week - nearly £1,000 less than their American counterparts will be paid when the musical opens in Broadway next year. The girls who play the starring role in The Royal Shakespeare Company stage adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic are paid £60 a performance or £30 for being on standby. They usually appear on stage twice a week and their weekly income rises to around £250 with rehearsal fees. Royal greeting: The Queen meets stars of Matilda at last month's Royal Variety Performance . But the youngsters chosen to tread the boards at New York's Shubert Theatre in the Spring can expect to earn £1,095. The London show plays to sell out crowds at the Cambridge Theatre - telling the tale of a little girl's rebellion against a money obsessed world. But with the show able to generate an estimated £7,000 a performance, the producers have been accused of taking advantage of an ambitious young cast. Book worms: The hit West End musical is based on the classic children's novel by Roald Dahl .

She told The Sunday Times: 'The work they do within the show is enormous, as much or more than the adults. Kids are not paid as well as they should be there is no question about that. 'By the times the parents have paid the expense to and from the theatre, that's the fee eaten up. It would be nice if they found a little more for the children on big hit shows.' A spokesperson for the show said 'contractually' they cannot discuss any fees or salaries paid to cast members. Bestselling: Children's writer Roald Dahl wrote countless classics . But they added: 'We are content that the young actresses who play Matilda are paid fees that are appropriately above the Equity recommendations. 'Each actress typically performs in two shows a week and is on standby for another two.' The producers also pay for chaperones for the children and meet some meal and travel costs. Equity's minimum fee per performance is just under £38 but the union's head of live performance, Hilary Hadley, said: 'A figure of about £60 is disappointingly low for a child that is basically a lead role in a show.' ht lights: The Cambridge Theatre in London's West End is home to the the his Matilda musical .","Producers of the West End show are accused of taking advantage of ambitious young stars .

Two days after the incident Houchin posted on Facebook: 'I was not aware he was going to do this. This was not a stunt or part of an act - this was a criminal attack.

The wife of a wealthy Muslim has won a legal battle to divorce him after he claimed that Sharia law allowed him to take up to four wives and a temporary partner 28 years his junior. Millionaire property developer Houshang Jafari, 62, refused to divorce wife Aghdas Bidaki, 53, despite taking up a ‘temporary wife’ 20 years her junior. After standing by years of infidelity by Jafari, Ms Bidaki demanded a divorce when she discovered that her husband had fathered two children with his mistress. Legal battle over divorce: Aghdas Bidaki (right) has won a legal battle with husband Houshang Jafari (left) after he refused to divorce her despite taking up a 'temporary wife' 20 years her junior . The couple had moved to the UK 22 years ago with their three children but in 2010, Jafari moved out with his mistress Katrina into his luxurious £1.2million flat in Bristol's historic Dower House, while Ms Bidaki remained in the family home in Downleaze, Bristol. Ms Bidaki launched an 18-month legal battle to end their marriage when Jafari refused to divorce her, claiming his actions were acceptable under Sharia law. Jafari told the court that he was allowed to have four permanent marriages and as many ‘temporary’ marriages as he could afford - with the consent of his first wife - under the Iranian Civil Code. Sharia Law is part of the Iranian Civil Code which states that a husband must get permission from his first wife before taking any more. Demanded divorce: After years standing by Jafari's infidelity, Ms Bidaki demanded a divorce after learning that he had fathered two children with mistress Katrina (pictured together) who he had moved out of the family home with in 2010 . He claimed Ms Bidaki had agreed that he could take multiple wives before their marriage, a claim she strenuously denies. But a British judge granted the divorce on Friday at Bristol County Court, stating that his behaviour was ‘unreasonable’. Recorder Jacklin, who will produce a full written judgement about the case next week, told the court: ‘I am quite sure that this is unreasonable behaviour and the marriage has irretrievably broken down. ‘I am quite satisfied of this. ‘I will pronounce a decree nisi now. The six weeks starts today.’ Moved out: Jafari moved into his £1.2 million flat with his mistress Katrina, who uses the title 'Lady Jafari', in historic Dower House (pictured) Jafari, represented in court by his mistress . Katrina, said Ms Bidaki had not complained until July 2011, despite . knowing that he was in a relationship more than four years ago. 'Not love': Katrina, who represented Jafari in court, said that an Iranian marriage is based on the principle of polygamy and that it is 'not based on love' Katrina, . the mother to Jafari’s two young sons, told the court: ‘Ms Bidaki . married a man who was polygamous, that’s the end of it. ‘The whole of Islam is based on the principle of polygamy, whereas the Bible is based on the principle of monogamy. ‘The Iranian marriage is different in its constitution from the British marriage. It is not based on love.’ Jafari and Katrina, who uses the title ‘Lady Jafari,’ now plan to marry. Jafari and Ms Bidaki will still remain married under the Sharia laws of Iran, as British court orders are not recognised. Ms Bidaki has instructed lawyers there to apply to the courts to end the marriage. Jafari and Ms Bidaki married in Iran in 1978 and the couple moved to the UK 22 years ago with their children Yaser, 33, Sajad, 26 and Yasaman, 28. Speaking after the judgement was handed down on Friday, Ms Bidaki disputed his claims and said she would fight her former husband for anything she was entitled to in his property empire. She said: ‘It is the beginning of the end. He claimed he didn’t love me from the start, which is rubbish. ‘Many women see their husband having an affair and they didn’t but I stayed until I realised he had two children. Then he disgusted me. ‘I stood by him while his money was piling up. I wasn’t expecting him to do it to me.’ Son Yaser added: ‘It has always been the case that my mum wanted to have a divorce after 32 years of marriage. ‘She wants to get on with her life. She sees herself as a UK resident and is instructing a lawyer in Iran to divorce him there.’","Aghdas Bidaki demanded a divorce from Houshang Jafari after she found out he had fathered two children with his mistress .

Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer: '[It's a] consequence of the choice by the UK to remain outside the euro area' France's most senior state banker was today accused of a ‘naked attempt to steal London’s financial crown’. Christian Noyer, 62-year-old governor of the Bank of France, said the City of London should be stripped of its status, and the bulk of its business be transferred to mainland Europe. But a furious Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, said: ‘This is a desperate French attack in an effort to make something out of the Eurozone crisis.’ Mr Johnson added that the move ‘shows utter contempt for the principles of the single market and it will not succeed.’ Mr Noyer, a Paris-born career financier who has worked in Brussels, insisted there was ‘no rationale’ for allowing the Eurozone’s main financial centre to be ‘offshore’. Britain has never signed up to the single European currency, Mr Noyer argued, and ‘most of the euro business should be done inside the euro area. ‘It's linked to the capacity of the central bank to provide liquidity and ensure oversight of its own currency,’ Mr Noyer told the Financial Times. ‘We're not against some business being done in London, but the bulk of the business should be under our control. That's the consequence of the choice by the UK to remain outside the euro area.’ Vince Cable, Britain’s business secretary, also attacked Mr Noyer, saying: ‘I don’t think his analysis is correct.’ During a visit to Paris, Mr Cable said other ‘serious French bankers’ believed that ‘having a strong UK financial sector is important for Europe. It is not a zero sum game. We want to be part of a single market in financial services.’ The City of London has served as Europe’s main financial centre since the setting up of the single European currency. Lord Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Business secretary Vince Cable both criticised My Noeyr's words today . More than 40 per cent of euro foreign-exchange transactions are conducted in London, a bigger share than the rest of the Eurozone combined. Mr Noyer’s attack is the latest in a long list which have been launched by French financiers on Britain. Shortly before Standard and Poor’s stripped France of its AAA credit rating in January, Mr Noyer said that Britain’s rating should be cut before that of France as the UK had ‘as much debt, more inflation, less growth than us’. Jean–Pierre Jouyet, the head of the French financial regulator, has also described the right–wing of British politics as ‘the world's stupidest’. EU leaders meet on Tuesday to try to broker a deal on giving the European Central Bank (ECB) sweeping powers to supervise lenders. The move, which will not include Britain, will be the first step towards creating a Eurozone banking union. George Osborne, Britain's Chancellor, backs a union in principle, but has pressed for safeguards to stop the new bloc from forcing its rules on non-members. Christian Noyer has come into criticism in the past for not revealing his salary, which is said to be well into six figures – making him one of the highest paid civil servants in France. After studying in Rennes and Paris he did his military service in the Navy, and then became a Treasury secretary before spending two years as a French respresentative to the EU in Brussels in the early 80s. He was vice-president of the European Central Bank for four years up until 2002, and was appointed governor of the Bank of France in 2003. Fiscal tactics: An ECB scheme that allows it to purchase a eurozone country's sovereign debt, is vital to restoring the functioning of monetary policy and dispelling fears that the euro currency block could break up . Noyer, a European Central Bank governing council member, also defended the tactic of pumping money into ailing economies. Warning that global economic growth . remained sluggish and fragile, he said: 'Expansion in central bank money . has not affected inflation expectations, which have remained . well-anchored.' Noyer poured cold water on . perceptions that central banks may have lost some independence after the . global financial crisis in 2008, arguing that the non-conventional . measures taken by major central banks were never imposed by governments. 'In all countries, non-conventional . measures and the consecutive expansion of balance sheets were a . deliberate and voluntary response to financial market developments that . threatened their integrity, their functioning and overall economic . stability.' Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki . Shirakawa, who spoke alongside Noyer in Tokyo, also appealed for . understanding that the BOJ doesn't adjust monetary policy to match . investors' expectations. 'While central banks should have deep . respect for financial markets...they should be willing to stand up to . the market from time to time,' he said. The BOJ has been under intense . political pressure to take bolder action to beat deflation that has . plagued Japan for more than a decade. Shinzo Abe, the head of a main . opposition party set to win next month's general election, has called . for 'unlimited' easing to achieve 2 per cent inflation and a possible . revision to a law guaranteeing the BOJ's independence. In any case, central banks have 'many tools' available to mop up liquidity when needed, he added. An ECB scheme that allows it to . purchase a eurozone country's sovereign debt, known as outright monetary . transactions (OMT), is vital to restoring the functioning of monetary . policy and dispelling fears that the euro currency block could break up, . he said. Noyer said it was also up to eurozone . governments to improve public finances and use structural reforms to . make the region's economies more competitive as a sovereign debt crisis . that started in Greece is poised to enter its fourth year. 'It has always been perfectly clear . that the responses to the real roots of the crisis can only be provided . by the governments themselves and that monetary policy can never durably . mitigate political shortcomings.' Noyer also rebuffed criticism that . the ECB's government bond purchases could be equivalent of monetising . public debt, saying that the central bank is allowed under law to . conduct such purchases from the secondary market. The OMT can only be enacted if a . country applies for a bailout and agrees to improve public finances and . implement sometimes painful structural reforms, he said, so the strict . conditions will help bolster confidence in the region. ECB policymakers hold their regular . monthly policy meeting on December 6 and are widely expected to leave . interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.75 per cent. Economists are . divided on whether the central bank will cut next year.","Christian Noyer said City of London should be stripped of its status - with businesses moving into Euro Zone .

For many, one of the most enjoyable parts of Christmas is gathering around a fir tree with family to spend a few hours decorating it with baubles, beads and treats. But in one small town in Germany, this tradition means a little bit more, as it is where the first ever Christmas baubles were made. While the glass balls bought today may have been manufactured in China, Mexico, or the USA, the originals were invented in Germany and a small . mountain village of Lauscha is considered to be the birthplace of the . handmade, glass-blown Christmas bauble. The spirit of Christmas: A shop in Lauscha, in the German state of Thuringen, displays the locally produced Christmas baubles . Birthplace of the bauble: The family of Weschenfelder work on Christmas balls in their combined living room and work space in the small village of Lauscha . Still going strong: There are now 20 small glass-blowing companies in the mountain village of Lauscha in German Thuringia . In the late 16th century, Lauscha, in the German state of Thuringen, became known for its excellence in glass-blowing. Lauscha, located in a river valley, had several elements needed for glass-making: timber, for firing the glass ovens, and sand. In 1597, Christoph Muller and Hans Greiner set up Lauscha's first glassworks and very soon, Glashutten (glassworks) were established in the town. Lauscha's Glashutten eventually produced drinking glasses, flasks, glass bowls, glass beads (Glasperlen), and in 1835, local glass blower Ludwig Muller- Uri invented the artificial human eye from glass. The original decorations: The earliest hand blown Christmas tree ornaments from glass were attached to each other to form a chain . The factories in the town became state-owned while under the East German communist government . Christmas antiques: Glass-blown balls for the Christmas tree dating back from the 1860s . In 1847 Hans Greiner began producing glass ornaments in the shape of fruits and nuts. The inside of the ornament was made to look silvery, at first with mercury or lead, then later using a special compound of silver nitrate and sugar water. Soon these unique glass Christmas ornaments were being exported to other parts of Europe. By the 1870s, Lauscha was exporting its unique glass ornaments to Britain. Glass ornaments had become popular in 1846 when an illustration of Queen Victoria's Christmas tree was printed in a London paper. The royal tree was decorated with glass ornaments from Prince Albert's native land of Germany.

The parents of missing college student Lauren Spierer voiced their anger, saying that they have been stonewalled by her friends, who may have been the last people to see the 20-year-old alive. Speaking with Katie Couric today, Robert Spierer said: ‘I’m angry. We’ve been stonewalled, to some extent, by the last people to see Lauren.’ Lauren Spierer mysteriously vanished on June 3, 2011 after a night out with friends. She was a student at Indiana University. Scroll down for video . Stonewalled: Lauren Spierer's parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer spoke with Katie Couric about their daughter's disappearance a year and a half ago . Demanding answers: Mrs Spierer, left, said that she must know the fate of her daughter, and if it was a random abduction or if Lauren's friends had anything to do with it . Speaking on Couric’s daytime talk show, Lauren’s parents said that their daughter’s friends are impeding the search for her. They hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence. ‘Despite their claims of doing whatever they could do, the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us…they refuse to take a police polygraph, which we feel is important for a number of reasons,’ Mr Spierer said. The television host also asked Lauren’s still-devastated mother if, more than a year after her daughter’s disappearance, she had any theories as to who might have taken her. ‘Our biggest dilemma is not knowing if it was a random abduction or if it was someone that Lauren knew,’ Charlene Spierer told Couric. She added that she now believes it to be someone who knew her daughter, based in part because of the lack of cooperation she and her husband have received from Lauren’s university friends. Mr Spierer added that while he and his wife now think their daughter is dead, they still cling to hope. ‘I understand that Lauren may no longer be with us,’ he said. ‘We ache for her. We want to bring her home.’ In August, Mrs Spierer posted a heartbreaking open letter to her daughter's killer describing the intense agony of not knowing what happened to the missing Indiana University student. 'I hope you have as many sleepless nights as I have,' Charlene Spierer wrote on a family blog. Missing: Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, 19, disappeared from Bloomington, Indiana, in June 2011. Police have few clues about her whereabouts . Missing: Charlene Spierer posted an open letter to her daughter's killer an in effort to prod him or anyone who knows about her disappearance to come forward . 'I hope that some day, your parents, your siblings, your friends will all be in a courtroom when your true self is revealed, the self which was born on June 3, 2011 when you took Lauren from us.' The search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another. When the investigation kicked off, five of her male friends, who police believed could have offered insight into the final moments before her disappearance, have hired criminal defense lawyers and quickly stopped fully cooperating with police. 'We were shocked when several people hired attorneys within days of Lauren’s disappearance. Five young men, five attorneys.  I’m still not sure why they felt it was necessary,' she wrote. Then, there have been multiple false leads -- possible suspects who weren't involved, remains found that didn't belong to Lauren. The most recent lead -- the skull discovered by a fisherman in mid July in the White River -- 50 miles from where she disappeared -- could take up to eight weeks for the lab to process. Waiting: The Spierers are still awaiting the results of DNA tests on a skill that was found 50 miles from Bloomington in the White River in Indianapolis . 'That’s 80,640 minutes of agony.  We are waiting to find out if a skull found in the White River might be Lauren’s.  It’s chilling to say the words.  I find it incomprehensible that if by chance you are reading this, you know the answer already,' Mrs Spierer wrote to her daughter's as-yet-unidentified killer. She also described the intense pain of knowing her daughter was dead, but having no idea what happened to her. 'For me, living without Lauren, it’s the little things in my day-to-day life which are the most difficult. The things that aren’t mentioned.  Getting mail addressed to Lauren, walking past her room just as she left it the last time she was home, still waiting for her return. 'The unpacked boxes I cannot bear to move. The notice Rob (Lauren's father) has hidden away among so many other pieces of mail, from the Department of Motor Vehicles. 'It’s Lauren’s. It arrived shortly before her 21st birthday. We try to shield each other from more pain. It is impossible to do,' she said. Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the last known image of Lauren. Several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating . In Bloomington, a quiet college town that is known as one of the safest cities in America, the scars of Lauren's disappearance are visible even a year and a half later. Her smiling face is visible on posters plastered on street corners, hung around the campus and posted in nearly every bar, restaurant and shop downtown. Mrs Spierer says she is writing so that her daughter's killer, and presumably the other people who might know what happened to her, don't forget about Lauren. 'I hope I am making you uncomfortable,' she wrote.

Custom-designed personal electronics could soon be available thanks to a new material that can be used to 3D print objects including working sensors. The material, nicknamed ‘carbomorph’, enables users to lay down electronic tracks and sensors as part of a 3D printed structure. This could, for example, allow the printer to create touch-sensitive areas which can then be connected to a simple electronic circuit board. Breakthrough: Warwick University's Dr Simon Leigh holds a video games controller he and his team 3D printed using a new material that is both conductive and piezo-resistive . The revolutionary new material was created by a team from the University of Warwick, who have so far used it to to print gloves with embedded flex sensors and computer game controllers with touch-sensitive buttons. The next step is to work on printing much more complex structures and electronic components including the wires and cables required to connect the devices to computers. Dr Simon Leigh of Warwick's School of Engineering led the research, which is detailed in a study published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE. While 3D printers have until now been . useful for basic prototyping, the products they create are . disappointingly inert and functional elements like electronic sensors . have had to be to be manually attached. Fully working: The material, nicknamed carbomorph, enables users to lay down electronic tracks and sensors as . part of a 3D printed structure . 'It’s always great seeing the complex and intricate models of devices such as mobile phones or television remote controls that can be produced with 3D printing,' Dr Leigh said. 'But that’s it, they are invariably models that don’t really function.' 'We set about trying to find a way in which we could actually print out a functioning electronic device from a 3D printer.' In order to achieve their goal, Dr Leigh's team created carbomorph, a conductive medium which could be made into shapes with 3D printers. It is based on Carbon Black filler, a readily available, inexpensive byproduct of the petrochemical industry, which conducts electricity. The team mixed the Carbon Black with a readily available modelling plastic called polymorph until they had a substance that was usable in 3D printers but still conducted electricity. Even more useful, the new material was also found to be piezo-resistive, meaning that its electrical resistance changes when it is squeezed. The paper describes how the Warwick team were able to use multiple strips of carbomorph to build an 'exo-glove' which is capable of detecting fingers flexing, and in a release they showed a computer game controller made entirely of the stuff, right down to working buttons. Multiple applications: The Warwick team were able to use multiple strips of carbomorph to build an 'exo-glove' which is capable of detecting fingers flexing . Dr Leigh and his team hope their new . material could 'meet the demands of entrepreneurs, designers and artists . wishing to create ever more complex and high-tech products' using 3D . printing. Anyone in the world could soon have access to a 3D printable gun through the internet. A U.S. start-up plans to distribute schematics for the weapons free of charge. Defense Distributed, a company which wants to extend the U.S. Second Amendment rights to the entire world, hopes to test prototypes of the printable weapons by the end of the year. 'This project could very well change the way we think about gun control and consumption,' the organisation says on their website. 'How do governments behave if they must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has near instant access to a firearm through the Internet? Let’s find out.' 'In the long term, . this technology could revolutionise the way we produce the world . around us, making products such as personal electronics a lot more . individualised and unique and in the process reducing electronic waste,' Dr Leigh said. 'Designers could also use it to understand better how people tactilely interact with products by monitoring sensors embedded into objects. 'However, in the short term I can see this technology having a major impact in the educational sector. 'For example, allowing the next generation of young engineers to get hands-on experience of using advanced manufacturing technology to design fairly high-tech devices and products right there in the classroom.' The printed sensors can be monitored using existing open-source electronics and freely available programming libraries. A major advantage of using 3D printing is that sockets for connection to equipment such as interface electronics can be printed out instead of connected using conductive glues or paints.","Researchers from University of Warwick say electronic tracks and sensors can now be integral to a 3D printed structure .

Outcry: Starbucks is set to pay more tax in the UK after it was accused of acting 'immorally' after it emerged that it has paid no corporation tax in 14 of the past 15 years . Starbucks is set to pay more tax in the UK following public outcry at its convoluted financial dealings. The US-owned coffee chain was accused by MPs of acting ‘immorally’ after it emerged that it has paid no corporation tax in this country for 14 of the past 15 years. The company, which enjoys a market share of 31 per cent, had a turnover of almost £400million in Britain last year – but recorded no taxable profits. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said it found the figures ‘difficult to believe’. The chain is facing a boycott, which was backed yesterday by the Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander. He and the Chancellor have now announced plans for a £10billion crackdown on tax-dodging by corporations and wealthy individuals. On Sunday Starbucks confirmed it had opened talks with HM Revenue and Customs on its tax affairs, saying it ‘needed to do more’ on tax in the UK. Yesterday it emerged that the company is preparing to change a controversial arrangement under which it sends 4.7 per cent of its turnover to the Netherlands, where it enjoys a special low tax rate. The move is expected to result in the firm recording taxable profits in this country. Starbucks declined to comment last night, but it is expected to make a detailed statement on the changes later this week. The news emerged as the Public Accounts . Committee released a devastating report on HMRC’s handling of the tax . affairs of major corporations. 'Name and shame': The Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge called on ministers to reveal firms that were not paying their fair share and suggested that the Government should back boycotts .

"PUBLISHED: . 02:15 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:10 EST, 4 December 2012 . An extensive study of the brains of dead NFL and CFL players showed that the majority of them had signs of brain damage after suffering repeated head injuries. The study, carried out by the Boston University School of Medicine, posthumously tested the brains of 50 footballers, 33 of whom played in the NFL. It found a link between head injuries suffered in the heavy-impact sport and degenerative brain disease. Brain study: Dr Ann McKee, professor of Neurology and Pathology of Boston University School of Medicine, inspects a brain in the Bedford Veteran Medical Center . Degeneration: There is normally very little deposition of p-tau in the brain (top row). In stage four CTE there is severe p-tau deposition throughout the brain, highlighted by the darker areas. T-pau depositions characterise the onset of CTE . The study, which included stars such as Dave Duerson, Cookie Gilchrist and John Mackey, found widespread evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The disease can lead to sufferers experiencing memory loss, dementia and depression. Only one of the 35 football players showed no signs of brain disease, while 31 of the 34 NFL players (only one CFL player was included in the study) had stage three to four CTE. In total, the study analysed 85 brain donors, including 21 army veterans. Most of those taking part in the study played sports. The autopsies revealed extensive evidence of protein tangles clogging brain tissue and causing the destruction of brain cells in football players, wrestlers, hockey players, boxers, and the military combat veterans. The New York Times reported that out of the 85 subjects, 68 men had a background in sports, and 50 people showed evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The paper added that there were 34 brain samples that came from NFL players - and among them, only one was found not to show signs of CTE. The researchers reported in the journal Brain that 68 of the 85 individuals they examined, all of whom had experienced repeated head trauma, had evidence of CTE. Surprising death: There is a renewed concern of the effects of football injuries following the suicide of Javon Belcher at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium . Football greats: Dave Duerson, left, and Ollie Matson's brains were looked at in the study . Ollie Matson died at the age of 80 suffering from dementia. He was suffering from stage four CTE, shown by the darkened areas . The brain of Cookie Gilchrist, former NFL and Canadian league running back, shows widespread damage indicative of stage four CTE . Legend: Cookie Gilchrist died in 2011, aged 75. He set a record in 1963 when he amassed 243 yards and scored five touchdowns in a single game . There is a renewed concern of the . lasting effects of football injuries following the death of Javon . Belcher at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium. Belcher killed himself in front of . his coaches - moments after shooting his girlfriend, who had given birth . to the couple's first child three months prior. Brain tissue from Dave Duerson, one of . the most recent NFL figures to fatally shoot himself, was among the . brain samples tested in the Boston University study. Other former NFL players involved in the study were Ollie Matson, John Grimsley and Cookie Gilchrist. Gone too soon: New York Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard killed himself last year. He was just 28 years old . The study is not just about . football, as one sample came from hockey player Derek Boogaard, a New . York Rangers enforcer who killed himself in May 2011. Co-author Dr. Robert Cantu told The Boston Globe the study should convince doubters that CTE is a real condition caused by repeat head injuries. Symptoms of CTE were first described in retired boxers in the 1920s and have been documented in football players, hockey players, boxers, military veterans, and those with a predilection for head banging. While the condition has not been found in the brains of those without head trauma, Warinner said that could simply be due to the fact that it’s rare and that more brains in the general population need to be autopsied. The new study described four stages of the disease, noting that symptoms can progress for years after head trauma. It starts with headaches and problems with concentration in the early stages, followed by depression, aggression, explosive anger and short-term memory loss. Then comes more serious cognitive impairment, and eventually full-blown dementia where a person doesn’t recognize loved ones. Athletes and military veterans who experienced such symptoms before they died donated their brains for further research. Eric Pelly died ten days after suffering a concussion playing rugby. His brain scans show rare isolated areas of damage diagnostic of CTE stage 1 . Sportsman: Eric Pelly, centre, died aged 18 in 2006 after suffering concussion while playing rugby.

But . the revelation that Britain is losing so much revenue through tax . loopholes will intensify demands at Westminster and beyond for tougher . action on multinationals, such as Google and Starbucks, paying small . amounts of tax. The anti-tax . avoidance pressure group Uncut said that it was planning protests in . Starbucks cafes this Saturday, involving 'creative civil disobedience'. It follows stinging criticism of tax avoidance MPs on the public . accounts committee who accused the coffee chain, Google and Amazon of . 'immoral' use of secretive jurisdictions, royalties and complex company . structures to avoid paying tax on British profits. Margaret Hodge, the committee's chair, said she had already stopped buying coffee at Starbucks and ceased using Amazon. 'Name and shame': The Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge called on ministers to reveal firms that were not paying their fair share and suggested that the Government should back boycotts . 'I . think actually the government can do things like … we buy a lot of . stuff, we can say we won't buy from companies. I think it's good . citizenship,' she told The Guardian. The Prime Minister's official . spokesman said: 'The issue for government is how we tackle that tax . avoidance. 'What we have to do in government is make sure we are . tackling that kind of aggressive tax avoidance. We are doing that in a . number of ways. We are bringing in a general anti-avoidance rule, we are . working with other countries.' The question of a boycott was 'an issue for individuals', said the spokesman. Under . the EU's VAT rules, digital supplies to non-business customers – such . as ebooks, music downloads and online apps – are classified as services . rather than products. 'This is yet another example of . industrial scale tax avoidance by foreign owned multinational . corporations. Their behaviour is irresponsible, unethical and . unacceptable.' Charlie Elphicke MP . VAT . on electronic services is imposed at the rate applying to the country in . which a company is headquartered rather than the rate applied by the . country in which it is bought. Amazon, for example, is based in Luxembourg and therefore charges its customers 3 per cent VAT for ebooks, compared with the 20 per cent levied in the UK. Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP and a former tax lawyer, believes that the EU should accelerate plans to change the way VAT is charged on digital services, which is due to be phased in between 2015 and 2019. 'This is yet another example of industrial scale tax avoidance by foreign owned multinational corporations. Their behaviour is irresponsible, unethical and unacceptable,' he said. The Greenwich report was commissioned by Philippe Marini, chairman of the French senate's finance committee and was prepared for a private meeting of pan-European politicians, civil servants and tax specialists in Brussels. Mr Marini supports an earlier date for bringing into line with other goods the rules for charging EU VAT on digital services. 'At the European level we need to renegotiate the schedule for implementing the VAT directive on electronic services in order to bring its application deadline nearer than 2015 or 2019, the term of the transition phase,' he said. An HMRC spokesman told The Guardian: 'It is a natural consequence of the VAT rules rather than any lack of compliance that a business in say, Germany, supplying such services to UK customers will account for VAT in Germany and not in the UK. 'Businesses have the freedom to establish themselves in whichever member state they wish. 'However, some UK businesses claimed to have moved their operations to other member states in order to benefit from lower VAT rates where in reality the supplies were still made from the UK. HMRC has successfully challenged such arrangements.'","Study reveals HMRC loses over £1.6bn a year in .

Instead of waiting for a service at a local church or temple, worshippers can now pop into a 'Pray-o-mat' and pick up a blessing. Believers can follow their faiths in a whole new frame of mind by saying their prayers in this 'church' made from an old photo booth. Instead of paying £5 for a set of four passport snaps, people can now use the touch screen inside the converted booth to listen to up 300 pre-recorded prayers and incantations in 65 different languages. Scroll down to hear some of the prayers . Prayers on the go: Created by German artist Oliver Sturm, the specially converted photo booth gives Manchester's citizens somewhere to pray . Pick up a prayer: A 'church' has been installed on the grounds of The University of Manchester, home of a large, three-year research project on multi-faith spaces . As well as the Lords Prayer, there are Buddhist and Islamic benedictions; Aborigine devotional songs,Voodoo blessings and solemn chanting of an orthodox Jewish congregation. Even Tom Cruise is catered for, with five minutes of Scientology prayers included too in the booth. Users will step into the booth named the 'Pray-o-mat', scroll through a menu and make the selection on the touch-screen - before donating money in a nearby slot. It has opened at the University in Manchester as part of a £500,000 three year research project into prayer rooms and 'multi faith spaces' across the world. Dr Ralf Brand, Senior Lecturer in Architectural Studies at the University's Manchester Architecture Research Centre who is leading the project said: 'Though the Pray-o-mat is a bit tongue-in-cheek, there is a serious message to what we're doing. 'Successful multi-faith spaces do not need to be flashy or expensive. Pray-o-mat: The project is described as being 'tongue in cheek' but has a serious message and will allow people of different faiths to worship in the same place . 'In many places a small, clean and largely unadorned space can serve adequately.' The conversion of the German 'Gebetomat' into an English 'Pray-o-mat' was partly supported by the Goethe-Institut, London and was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Created by German artist Oliver Sturm, the booth is free to use and offers prayers via a touch screen - after Sturm collected them mainly from radio archives including a recording of missionaries singing church songs in 1903 . The university research team have visited almost 250 multi-faith spaces in the UK and abroad including those at airports, universities, hospitals and shopping malls. Rearchers say multi faith spaces are presently viewed in Britain as 'tangible manifestations of tolerance and pluralism, within a socio-religious landscape characterised by a certain degree of fragmentation.' After choosing a blessing, people can then pick up a snack at the vending machine next to the Pray-o-mat in the University of Manchester . They saw charting the emergence and scope of the spaces has been difficult because many are concealed from public view, the team estimate over 1,500 exist in the UK. They are hoping to investigate the multi faith spaces in terms of architecture, how they might be built and whether they can be places of historical interest. Researcher Dr Chris Hewson said: 'It is clear that a universal, off-the-shelf space can never adequately serve locally specific purposes. 'While multi faith spaces - and multi-faith issues in general - have received attention from a theological perspective, less is known around practical themes, such as design, architecture and ornamentation.

'Furious': Carol Vorderman is said to be angry at National Grid plans to build a new stretch of 150ft pylons near her home in the Bristol countryside . TV star Carol Vorderman has backed a campaign to prevent a row of huge pylons being built across an exclusive ‘millionaires’ row’ where she owns a property. Loose Women presenter Vorderman, 51, is furious that National Grid has opted to route high-voltage power lines across the street, near Bristol. The private road is home to several multi-million properties and the wealthy residents have now launched a ‘fighting fund’ to campaign against the pylons. Vorderman’s agent John Miles, who . also lives in the road near Clapton-in-Gordano, is head of the . residents’ association and is spearheading the campaign. He says the 150ft high pylons will be an eyesore and carry significant health risks. Mr . Miles - who also represents Noel Edmonds and Des O’Connor - wants the . 400,000 volt cables underground, which National Grid says is too . expensive. He said: 'They want to put these 150ft high pylons everywhere, which will spoil the countryside. 'They should just dig it underground or link it with another cable they are burying not too far away. 'I think that it is selfish of the energy company for using pylons - they were invented in 1926. 'We . have made huge advances in how to transport electricity since then but . it is poor for National Grid to say it is limited by the cost. 'How can you put a value on people’s health?' The . energy giant needs to erect 37 miles of new power lines from the . Hinkley C nuclear power station which is currently being constructed at . Hinkley Point near Bridgwater, Somerset, to Avonmouth near Bristol. At risk: Carol Vorderman has joined residents who say the 150ft power . lines will ruin the countryside around their properties near Bristol . The road already has a 132,000 volt power line running across it which is suspended from 88ft pylons. But . residents had hoped the new bigger pylons would be routed elsewhere or . underground as National Grid was considering two different routes for . the new cables. However, last month it announced its chosen route would run directly over the lane. Vorderman owns one of the 44 homes on the secluded road and spoke out against the plans when they were first announced in 2008. She . said: 'Clearly there are engineering challenges to placing cables under . the sea bed but it is striking that, in the 21st century, National Grid . has not put forward a proposal for bringing the cables from Hinkley C . to Avonmouth using the Bristol Channel.' John estimates the cost of burying the cables underground would work out as an extra £8 on customers’ annual bills nationwide. He . said: 'I am sure that everyone in this area would agree to have a . little more on their energy bills to get this line underground. 'This is not just about fighting for the residents but everyone affected by this new power line. 'But if National Grid thinks we are just a small group of people it can ride roughshod over, it is very much mistaken.' Contested: The existing power line (yellow) will be removed but the . proposed new line of pylons (purple) will run directly over a road where Carol Vorderman owns a property . He added: 'It may cost millions to put the 400kv line underground but that will be very cheap compared to the hassle you will get from us, legally or illegally. 'We will give you absolute hell and you will be better off looking at some alternatives.' Campaigning: Carol Vorderman's agent John Miles, who also lives on the same road, is leading residents in opposing National Grid plans . to build the new power lines . However, National Grid says the cost of burying the entire route underground would be £1.5billion - twice the £75million of its current proposed mechanism. Overhead cable cost around £1.24 million per mile, whereas an underground cable costs between £9.4 and £11.2 million per mile. National Grid’s draft route includes burying five miles of cables underground across the Mendip Hills. Spokeswoman Jane Taylor said: 'All the emissions from the electro-magnetic forces from the lines are monitored. 'There are statutory limits on that which are set by the Government and all our equipment does operate within those limits. 'The connection we have to build is a transmission line to move very big amount of electricity across a very long distance. 'We are proposing to take down the 132,000v line from Hinkley to Seabank in Avonmouth and build a 400,000v connection. 'The connection will include five miles of underground cable through the Mendips and will result in 95 fewer pylons along the route.' Residents have until December 18 to make comments on the draft route before formal plans are lodged with the planners.","TV star opposes bid to build power lines near her home in Bristol countryside .

But now some of the most famous paintings the world has ever seen have been brought to life by an artist who recreate them in photographic form. Maisie Broadhead has used theatre-like sets, family members and Photoshop to give works by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer and English pioneer William Hogarth a thoroughly modern makeover. The British artist's Take the Chair project sees her relatives standing in for the Young Woman Seated at a Virginal in Broadhead's version of Vermeer's 17th century painting, and the Man with a Newspaper in her recreation of surrealist painter Rene Magritte's more modern 1928 piece. Original: Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's 17th century painting shows a woman sitting at a table and drinking a glass of wine while a man looks on . Life imitating art: Maisie Broadhead's photograph cleverly recreates Vermeer's artwork, this time with a woman replacing the man in the hat . Royal College of Art graduate Ms Broadhead, 32, collaborated with her mother Caroline Broadhead, a furniture and textiles designer who works in fine and applied arts, on the project. Together the pair chose seven examples of fine artworks, all featuring a chair, and set about reconstructing the scenes in real life in order to capture a digital version of the classic painting. Ms Broadhead set up her recreations in theatre-like sets built in her mother's studio, before using Photoshop to give each of her digital images a 'painterly' quality. All of Maisie Broadhead's reworkings feature a chair created by Caroline, while some of the details featured in the original paintings have been replaced by items of personal significance to both the artist and her mother. In one of the photographs, Caroline's wedding dress has been used as a dressing up outfit for Maisie's son, who performs the role of Spain's Prince Felipe Prospero in his mother's re-interpretation of Velazquez's masterpiece. Work by Broadhead is currently on display in The National Gallery in London as part of its exhibition Seduced by Art: Photography Past and Present. Infante Philip Prosper: Diego Velazquez painted this portrait of Spain's Prince Felipe Prospero (left) in 1660, Maisie Broadhead's take on the painting also features a child - the artist's son - with his hand resting on a chair, but in her version the infant is wearing a feathered headband .

Contestants on I’m A Celebrity at least have plenty of warning of the emotional turmoil the challenges of the jungle are likely to present. But the ITV show reached disturbing new lows when a seven-year-old girl was the one left in distress. Producers were accused of cruelty after the child was put up as a prize – and had to be consoled when her mother failed to ‘win’ her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Distraught: Charlie Brooks was devastated to learn that she was inches away from her daughter . So close: Charlie's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother . Hundreds of viewers took to social . networking sites and internet discussion forums yesterday to complain . about the treatment of Kiki, the daughter of jungle competitor and . former EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks. Miss Brooks had been paired with a . fellow contestant, darts champion Eric Bristow, and given the . opportunity to win luxuries by choosing one of five doors to open. They did not know that behind the . doors the prizes included food, clean clothes – and various members of . their friends and family. Kiki, who had been away from her mother for 18 . days, was standing behind a yellow door. The youngster could hear her mother’s . voice and was heartbroken when Miss Brooks and Mr Bristow picked the . wrong colour to reveal a sign which said ‘game over’. Millions of . viewers saw Kiki’s distress as she realised she would not see her mother . and had to be consoled by one of Mr Bristow’s sons, who was next to . her. Tough blow: Charlie described learning that her daughter could have been so close was like being 'kicked in the gut' Pulling at the heartstrings: Charlie was left in tears at the thought of her daughter being so close . It was only after learning that two . fellow contestants had got to see their loved ones that Miss Brooks, 31, . realised she had missed the opportunity to see her daughter. She was left distraught and  made a . tearful apology to the cameras, saying: ‘It felt like someone had taken a . boot and kicked me in the guts. 'I didn’t even think having a member of . family behind the  door would have been an option. This is . heartbreaking.’ Yesterday experts and campaigners . called on TV watchdog Ofcom to investigate the decision to involve Kiki . in the contest, which is filmed in Australia, while others accused Miss . Brooks of bad parenting for not leaving the jungle to comfort her . daughter as soon as she learned what had happened. What's behind each door: Charlie and Eric were first to have a go at the Door to Door game, she didn't know her daughter Kiki was behind the yellow door . End of the line: The pair chose the blue door and were greeted with a 'game over' sign . Margaret Morrissey, of campaign group . Parents Outloud, said: ‘If [Charlie Brooks] was genuine about this, she . would have got up and walked straight to her daughter and not put her . daughter in this position again. ‘I find it staggering that [producers] have used a child in this way. To involve a seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.’ The stunt comes just days after . producers were accused of failing to look after comedian Brian Conley, . 51, who has battled depression and alcoholism. He left the jungle after . becoming distressed and was admitted to hospital. Over the moon: The pair looked delighted to be greeted by their loved ones . Group hug: Rosemary was seen hugging her daughter while David was delighted his mother was there to meet him . Viewers took to the internet to . express their outrage at Kiki’s treatment.

This is the dramatic moment when a whole chunk of Jurassic coastline came crashing down on to a beach. The rain-soaked clifftop plunged 100 feet to the pebbled beach below at Sidmouth, east Devon. The moment was captured by John Austin, 70, who spotted a crack in the red sandstone cliffs while out for a walk last week. A crack on the surface: A large crack is visible along a red sandstone cliff in Sidmouth, east Devon . Going, going... The cliff situated in the Dorset and East Devon world heritage site begins to break away . Plunging to earth: Residents claim this is the fifth time part of the cliff has collapsed in a week . Changing the face of the landscape: Tonnes of rock and mud plunge down on to the empty beach . Armed with his camera, Mr Austin, from Sidmouth, snapped away as tonnes of rock and mud hurtled down to the empty beach. Local people claim it is the fifth fall in a week after the ground became saturated with torrential rain with residents in Cliff Road seeing large parts of their elongated rear gardens disappear from sight. In one garden a wooden shed sits on the edge of the fall - with its owners no longer going anywhere near the hut. Security barriers erected at the end of another garden lay crumpled on the beach below along with grass and trees. The latest massive fall has led to calls for emergency action to be taken as more heavy rainfall is due to hit the region. The Dorset and East Devon world heritage site stretches 95 miles with rocks recording 185 million years of the Earth's history. Another section of the Jurassic coast at Charmouth on the Devon-Dorset border was also cordoned off after a crack was spotted in the cliff. In August five people were unhurt after a landslip between Charmouth and Golden Cap. And ten miles further along the Dorset coast at Burton Bradstock, holidaymaker Charlotte Blackman died in a massive landslide in July. Mr Austin said: 'It's the first time I've seen anything like that.' Another local resident Philip Field has been studying the cliff for the last 25 years. Making waves: The collapsed segment of cliff is gradually washed out to sea . He was one of dozens of people who were at the scene at the weekend looking at the crumbling cliffs which have become a local attraction. He said: 'We had exceedingly heavy rain and it was saturated on the top part of the cliff. 'Water tends to dribble out at various sections but the water cannot permeate the top section and it makes it unstable. It normally dries out before it comes down but there is too much pressure on it now. 'It is to do with the weather pattern. The sea is not doing the damage at the base of the cliffs. There isn't much anyone can do about this. Surveyors have been out looking at it. 'We used to have two minor falls a year for the last 20 years. But there are a lot more now. Around ten years ago there was another massive one with brought down a half kilometre of the cliff path.' Cllr Stuart Hughes, Devon county council's lead councillor for flooding, says it is 'only a matter of time' before the last protective piece of Pennington Point of lost. The Sidmouth based councillor said: 'I am of the opinion that unless some form of emergency rock revetment work is carried out and put in place it will only be a matter of a short period of time before we lost the last section of cliff that is protecting both eastern town and Alma Bridge from south easterlies and, with it, the threat of tidal flooding.'","Red sandstone cliff in Sidmouth is part of the Dorset and East Devon world heritage site .

A cruel pet owner who kept two marmosets in appalling conditions at his squalid home has been banned from keeping monkeys for life. Disabled Peter Powell, 53, from Plymouth, Devon, forced six-month-old Tya and two-year-old Rattler to perch on a curtain pole or crawl into a dirty tube slung underneath. The animals were kept in 'heartbreaking' conditions in a room littered with, cigarette butts, faeces, and a razor blade, and forced to travel in Powell's pocket when he drove around town. 'Heartbreaking': Rattler the marmoset clings to a curtain rail at Powell's Plymouth home. The two-year-old primate was kept a litter strewn room with six-month-old Tya without specialist food or suitable perching room . Scruffy: Underweight and in a bad state of health Rattler hangs on to the wooden curtain pole in the living room . On Friday Plymouth Magistrates' Court slapped Powell with a lifelong ban on keeping monkeys after he pleaded guilty to neglect at an earlier hearing. He was given a two year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,000 in costs. RSPCA inspector Becky Wadey visited Powell’s home last year with . primate experts from Monkey World-Ape Rescue Centre, in Dorset, and found . the monkeys living in appalling conditions. A razor blade, . cigarette butts and faeces were scattered across the floor and there was . no specialised food or suitable perching room needed for their care. She . said: 'It was heartbreaking to see these poor little marmosets like this – their fur was sticky with faeces and urine and they were clearly underweight and in a bad state of health. 'Tya, the little one, was just crouched inside a dirty tube set up beneath the curtain rail while Rattler was balanced precariously on top of it. 'There was so little room for both of them that at one point Rattler knocked Tya off the perch – she had quite a fall to the hard floor. 'It is hard to understand how anyone could think this was an acceptable way to keep an animal.' Tya: After Tya was rescued by the RSPCA she was found to be suffering from the early stages of rickets . This was the RSPCA’s third major case involving cruelty . or neglect to a marmoset since January in what is a growing trade in . keeping them as pets. Dr Lisa Riley, primatologist for the RSPCA, . said: 'These cases show exactly why we are calling for a ban on primates . such as pets. Marmosets are seen as small and easy to keep but this is . far from the truth - they are very hard to look after and totally . unsuitable as pets. 'We must stop this growing trade. Breeders and . dealers charge large sums of money and it has become far too easy to . pick up a marmoset over the internet, especially since you don’t need a . licence to have one.' Tya and Rattler were removed and taken to Monkey World where it was found they were suffering from the early stages of rickets, or metabolic bone disease. After being given specialist care and lessons in how to feed, talk and socialise from fellow marmoset Gabi, they are now growing and doing well. 'Monkey man' Powell, 53, pleaded guilty to neglect . Speaking after the hearing Powell said he was 'upset' about what had happened and that the RSPCA had been too quick to judge the conditions in his flat. The unemployed father-of-three, who still keeps a pair of zebra finches, said: 'They came on a particular morning when I wasn’t expecting them. 'I was dealing with some issues that morning and hadn’t got round to doing the housework. 'Normally it wouldn’t have been that dirty.' Powell, who was disabled by a stroke, said the two marmosets had been able to play on ropes he had attached to the ceiling of his lounge. He had covered these with plastic ivy leaves to make the room look like a jungle. It was one of these that the court heard one of the monkeys had eaten. He said: 'I was well known in Plymouth where they used to call me the monkey man as I rode around in my mobility scooter with a marmoset in my pocket.' He said the RSPCA had previously been involved with him in June 2010 when he lost a 10-year-old marmoset called Bonnie in Plymouth city centre. He had tripped allowing Bonnie, who lived in a dolls house, to run away. Marmosets originate from Brazil and usually live in the upper canopy of trees in forests. Monkey World are campaigning to change laws that govern the keeping of primates as pets in Britain. Dr Alison Cronin MBE, director of Monkey World, said: 'We are an international primate rescue and rehabilitation centre, but more and more we find ourselves being called to rescue and rehabilitate monkeys being kept as pets legally in Britain today.'

She may have been left distraught on Wednesday when she narrowly missed out on seeing her daughter Kiki in the jungle, but it was a better day for Charlie Brooks on Thursday night's show. The EastEnders actress won a phone call to her daughter as a result of a darts game they played. And she was so overwhelmed she gushed at her campmates afterwards, thanking them for letting her take the one call granted to the four of them. Scroll down for video . Delighted: Just a day after Charlie Brooks was left disappointed at not . getting to see her daughter Kiki in the jungle, she won a phone call . from her in camp . The celebrities took part in a game in which their dart throwing skills could win 21 treats - two of which were phone calls to friends or family. The aim of the game was to fire a dart to the corresponding number picked out of a bag and the celebrity would get whatever treat was beside that number written on a board, all played in a relay style. Charlie said as she learned about the new challenge: 'It was really handy that we had a darts challenge and we had Eric Bristow, although his track record through the show hasn’t been very good.' That smile says it all: The EastEnders actress was selected by her camp mates to use up the one phone call to make up for her disappointment the day before . Eric was first up and pulled number 10, he hit double ten with the first arrow which won them one beer. Next up was David who managed to hit number 14 on his fourth dart winning some Cheddar cheese. Ashley hit number one and won a phone call from home, Charlie missed the board completely but then it was Eric’s turn again and he hit number nine with his first dart and won coffee. Meanwhile, David pulled number eight and hit it with his first dart and won coffee and sugar. Agreeing that the two phone calls should be combined to make a four minute call, Eric said: 'Do you think Charlie should have it as David spoke to his mum and I don’t give a s**t?' The others agreed 100 per cent with him and a thrilled Charlie beamed: 'That will be amazing, thank you guys.' Overcome: The camp mates had won the chance for two different two minute calls but let Charlie speak to her daughter for the full four minutes . Thank you! She gushed to Ashley, David and Eric after squealing down the phone for the duration . The celebrities had their winnings from the darts challenge delivered, it was cheese, a beer, coffee and sugar. They were tucking into the cheese when the phone in camp rang and Charlie spoke to her daughter Kiki. Squealing with delight Charlie was so excited to hear from Kiki as the youngster screamed down the phone: 'I miss you mummy, you are doing really well, you have lost a lot of weight, I’ve been watching and I can’t tell you how proud I am of you.' Charlie told her how much she loved her and that her handwriting in the letter she sent to camp was really good. Can he do it? The camp mates joined in together on a group challenge which saw them try to hit different treats on a board to win them . Showing them how it's done: Darts legend Eric Bristow showed off the talents which made him famous as he won treat after treat . 'I know you so well and you are a strong woman why didn’t you say we are a strong, independent, motivational, inspirational women?' Charlie answered: 'Because we are strong, independent, motivational, inspirational women and I did say it and I think of you every time. I love you, you are the best, I can’t wait for snuggles and I’m going to snuggle you so much.' Kiki replied: 'You are the best mummy, you will win it now, I want to be the princess of the jungle! I love you!' Having a go: Charlie also took part to win the remaining four some treats to take back to camp on one of their final evenings . Charlie said: 'You will be princess of the jungle no matter what. Do you know what the Chelsea score is, don’t worry I know you can’t tell me. I love you, love you, love to everyone.' After the call Charlie thanked everyone for letting her take the call and jumped up and down and clapped with glee. It was just a day after show producers infuriated viewers by getting Kiki's hopes up by telling her she could get to see her mum for a cuddle. Contestants on I’m A Celebrity at least have plenty of warning of the emotional turmoil the challenges of the jungle are likely to present. But the ITV show reached disturbing new lows when a seven-year-old girl was the one left in distress. Producers were accused of cruelty after the child was put up as a prize – and had to be consoled when her mother failed to ‘win’ her. Distraught: Charlie Brooks was devastated to learn that she was inches away from her daughter 24 hours earlier . So close: Charlie's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother . Hundreds of viewers took to social . networking sites and internet discussion forums yesterday to complain . about the treatment of Kiki, the daughter of jungle competitor and . former EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks. Miss Brooks had been paired with a . fellow contestant, darts champion Eric Bristow, and given the . opportunity to win luxuries by choosing one of five doors to open. They did not know that behind the . doors the prizes included food, clean clothes – and various members of . their friends and family. Kiki, who had been away from her mother for 18 . days, was standing behind a yellow door. The youngster could hear her mother’s . voice and was heartbroken when Miss Brooks and Mr Bristow picked the . wrong colour to reveal a sign which said ‘game over’. Millions of . viewers saw Kiki’s distress as she realised she would not see her mother . and had to be consoled by one of Mr Bristow’s sons, who was next to . her. Tough blow: Charlie described learning that her daughter could have been so close was like being 'kicked in the gut' Pulling at the heartstrings: Charlie was left in tears at the thought of her daughter being so close . It was only after learning that two . fellow contestants had got to see their loved ones that Miss Brooks, 31, . realised she had missed the opportunity to see her daughter. She was left distraught and  made a . tearful apology to the cameras, saying: ‘It felt like someone had taken a . boot and kicked me in the guts. 'I didn’t even think having a member of . family behind the  door would have been an option. This is . heartbreaking.’ Yesterday experts and campaigners . called on TV watchdog Ofcom to investigate the decision to involve Kiki . in the contest, which is filmed in Australia, while others accused Miss . Brooks of bad parenting for not leaving the jungle to comfort her . daughter as soon as she learned what had happened. What's behind each door: Charlie and Eric were first to have a go at the Door to Door game, she didn't know her daughter Kiki was behind the yellow door . End of the line: The pair chose the blue door and were greeted with a 'game over' sign . Margaret Morrissey, of campaign group . Parents Outloud, said: ‘If [Charlie Brooks] was genuine about this, she . would have got up and walked straight to her daughter and not put her . daughter in this position again. ‘I find it staggering that [producers] have used a child in this way. To involve a seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.’ The stunt comes just days after . producers were accused of failing to look after comedian Brian Conley, . 51, who has battled depression and alcoholism. He left the jungle after . becoming distressed and was admitted to hospital. Over the moon: The pair looked delighted to be greeted by their loved ones . Group hug: Rosemary was seen hugging her daughter while David was delighted his mother was there to meet him . Viewers took to the internet to . express their outrage at Kiki’s treatment. One wrote: ‘For such a small . child to hear her mother’s voice and look so desolate when she didn’t . get to see her isn’t sitting comfortably with me.’ Another agreed, adding: ‘ITV should . hang their heads in shame!’ Roy Shuttleworth, a consultant in clinical . psychology, said the game amounted to a ‘high-risk strategy’, adding: . ‘Some children would be tormented by it.’ A spokesman for the ITV show said . permission for the girl to take part in the game had come from her . grandmother, adding: ‘A senior producer saw Kiki afterwards and she was . fine.  Kiki and her grandma come to the jungle every day with the other . friends and family, so the experience wasn’t as out of the ordinary as . it might look.’ An agent for Miss Brooks refused to comment on why Kiki was not at school.","Former EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks failed to 'win' her daughter in task a day earlier .

A motorist died of his injuries after he was punched and kicked by a gang of men in front of his teenage son. Johnny Assani, 43, died of his injuries in hospital after he was left lying bleeding and unconscious in a road in Derby. His 16-year-old son Mukhaila Assani, was also allegedly punched by some of the men when he tried to drag the attackers off his father. Victim: Johnny Assani was kicked and punched by a group of men and died of his injuries in hospital the next day . Giving evidence at Nottingham Crown Court, Mukhaila said: ‘I was shocked when I saw my dad fall. He didn’t see the man who hit him coming and I think it was a shock to my dad that he’d been hit. He added: ‘He didn’t get up after that, he never got up again. He tried and tried but he couldn’t because of being kicked and punched while he was laid on the ground. ‘I tried to pull the men off him but they started to attack me then and punched me in the face. ‘I was left with a cut lip and bruising to my head as I tried to pull them away from my dad. ‘When they were hitting me I tried to protect myself and was protecting my face by shielding it with my arms. I had my eyes closed and I couldn’t see what was happening to my dad.’ Seconds later the men dispersed and Mukhaila saw his father lying on the ground, his head on the pavement and his feet on the road, breathing but unconscious and unresponsive. Two brothers, Mohammed Shahid and Mohammed Rafiq have already been convicted of killing Mr Assani. Incident: Police officers and teams of forensics raid a house on Walbrook Road where Mr Assani was attacked . A third brother, Mohammed Tariq, is now standing trial, accused of being one of a nine-strong gang that attacked Mr Assani. Tariq was not tried with his brothers because ‘he went to ground’ after the attack, hiding in Birmingham and then Bradford, Nottingham Crown Court heard. The 26-year-old, from Derby, who denies manslaughter, was arrested almost six months after the attack, in February. Mr Assani was attacked at around 3pm on Sunday, August 14 last year, after an incident involving his and Shahid’s car as they were driving. Mr Assani’s silver VW Golf was in front of Shahid’s white BMW but when Shahid turned left, Mr Assani went around the traffic island and followed him. Shahid, 33, pulled up outside his home in Walbrook Road and Mr Assani stopped his car a couple of car-lengths in front. Two brothers, Mohammed Shahid and Mohammed Rafiq have already been convicted of killing Mr Assani and a third is on trial at the moment . Prosecutor Peter Joyce QC told the court that Mr Assani got out of his car to speak to the driver of the BMW, Shahid, while his son Mukhaila remained in the vehicle. The two men started arguing and Shahid shouted towards his house, calling for back-up. A man came out of the house, jogged over to Mr Assani and punched him, knocking him to the ground. Mr Joyce said: ‘Both men set about repeatedly hitting Mr Assani, using fists and feet, to punch and kick him to the head and body. ‘And the only thing that Johnny Assani could do at that stage was to shield himself from the blows as he tried to get back up. He failed.’ The court heard that at that point between seven and nine more men came out of the house and joined in kicking and punching Mr Assani as he lay on the ground. One man hung back and delivered a final kick to Mr Assani’s head and walked off smiling, said Mr Joyce. M Joyce told a jury that as Mr Assani’s attackers left him lying unconscious on the road, one shouted out: ‘You don’t mess with the Khans.’ Mr Joyce told the court that Mr Assani was killed by members of the Khan family, including Shahid, Rafiq and Tarip together with other men. After the attack, Ellen Shreeve, who lived nearby and had seen the commotion from her house, rushed out to give Mr Assani first aid until paramedics arrived. She said: ‘I heard all the shouting in the street and had a look what all the fuss was. I saw a big group of people - around 15 to 20 - outside a house further down the street, around number 118. ‘When the crowds had dispersed I saw the person lying on the street and rushed out. I’m first aid trained and took my first aid kit with me. ‘I recognised Mukhaila when I got out and then saw the man on the ground was his father. ‘I helped stem the bleeding and tried to calm both of them down while the paramedics arrived.’ The victim was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital and a CT scan showed he had suffered ‘a large bleed in his brain’. He was transferred to the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham, where he died in the intensive care unit after suffering a cardiac arrest a day after the attack. A post-mortem examination revealed he had suffered significant bruising to his back, chest, upper abdomen and to his right jaw. He had also lost a tooth which had lodged in his throat. Tariq’s DNA was found in a blood sample taken from the nails of Mr Assani’s right hand, the jury was told. The case continues.

Robin May, outside South Lakeland Magistrates' Court in Cumbria were he was banned for two years for drink driving . A drink driver crashed into a pub, ruptured a gas main and triggered the evacuation of 60 neighbours in the early hours amid fears of an explosion. Robin May, 47, who admitted drink driving, was banned for two years and fined £100 at South Lakeland Magistrates’ Court, Cumbria. Around 60 people had to be evacuated from their homes in the early hours of November 11 after May, of Arnside, drove his Honda into the The Ship Inn, Sandside, rupturing a gas main. The court heard that he had 76 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35. Landlady Lyn Million, who runs the pub with husband Ray, said she thought Mr May had ‘got off lightly’, but that he had been into the pub later on to apologise. 'I think he was quite shook up but it took a lot of courage for him to come in,' she said. 'He obviously didn’t know how we would react but we are quite forgiving people. 'It’s one of those things - a bad call on his part and he is paying the price. He did say he thought he would also get community service. 'It was quite a horrific accident and if there was a spark the pub would have gone up and our whole family would have been wiped out.' Speaking shortly after the incident, Kendal fire station watch manager Phil Stannet said: 'There was a lot of gas in the air and I think, had it ignited, we would have had a few issues on our hands. There was a major gas leak.' As a 400-metre exclusion was put in . place by police and the road between Milnthorpe and Arnside was closed, . locals were ordered to leave their homes amid fears gas could explode. In mitigation Jackie Partington told the court that May had not planned to drive home that night. 'He had travelled into Arnside to . meet friends and the plan was to stay with a friend, but he became . separated from them,' she said. 'He slept in his car for an hour but woke up cold and felt OK to drive. He realises that was a stupid decision.' May was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Mr May crashed his Honda into the Ship Inn, Sandside, but the landlady Lyn Million confirmed he had been in to apologise afterwards for the incident .

"By . Arthur Martin . PUBLISHED: . 03:44 EST, 3 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:34 EST, 4 December 2012 . A brawl broke out on a motorway after a ‘140mph race’ that left two dead and six injured. A witness reported seeing two black BMWs speeding along the M1 moments before one clipped the central reservation and bounced off a bridge into the path of the other. The driver and a back-seat passenger in one car were killed, and both vehicles were damaged beyond recognition. Two black BMW cars crashed in the early hours of yesterday morning on the southbound carriageway of the M1 . Police closed the road for several hours yesterday morning following the collision . The collision killed two people and injured another four between junctions 4 and 5 of the motorway . But as the wreckage lay across the road, a third car pulled up on the hard shoulder and four passengers got out to begin fighting with survivors of the crash – accusing them of killing their friends. Witness Basit Nasir said: ‘They all jumped out and everybody started punching each other. They said, “What have you done? You have killed them.” I tried to break up the fight and called the police from my mobile.’ Two men aged 22 and 24 died in the accident, which happened at 2.30am yesterday. A lorry driver died on the M4 today causing long delays. The motorist crashed with another HGV close to the Almondsbury Interchange and police have said the eastbound carriageway would be closed for several hours. A police spokesman said: 'Police are advising motorists to avoid the area if at all possible as serious congestion is anticipated during the peak period. 'All three lanes have been closed to allow emergency services access to the collision. 'Vehicles travelling from the west along the M4 are being urged to use the M49. 'Traffic is advised to avoid the area if at all possible and find alternative routes as the section of the motorway is likely to be closed for a significant part of the day.' A car fire on the M4 close to the junction for the M32 also caused delays for westbound motorists but later opened to traffic. Other accidents on diversion routes such as the M49 - where a lorry hit the central reservation - have also caused problems. The M5 northbound was also badly affected by the M4 closure, with queues around Cribbs Causeway and Avonmouth. Two other men travelling in the same BMW suffered serious injuries and were taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, west London, for treatment. The four men in the other BMW – some of whom fought with men from the third car – needed hospital treatment for injuries they suffered during the crash. Mr Nasir said a black BMW 5 Series went past him at ‘about 140mph’, closely followed by a black BMW 7 Series. ‘They appeared to be having a high-speed race,’ he said. ‘It was total mayhem. 'There was mangled metal everywhere. It was foolish of them to drive at this sort of speed. 'It was raining as well.’ He said that soon after the crash, four men in a silver Mercedes C220 pulled up at the scene and began fighting with the occupants of one of the BMWs. Four fire engines and six ambulances were sent to deal with the accident, which happened close to junction five of the M1, near Watford. It took firefighters about an hour to free all of the casualties from the wreckage. Five junctions of the motorway were shut for hours in both directions following the incident, causing major delays during yesterday morning’s rush hour. The men involved are understood to be from the Bangladeshi or Pakistani community in east London. They are thought to have spent some of their evening in Luton and the rest in Milton Keynes before heading back to London. Both cars were unrecognisable after the collision which resulted in the closure of five motorway junctions . Mr Nasir said he managed to help the front-seat passenger out of the  BMW 5 Series but that he appeared badly dazed. The driver of that car had been thrown across to the passenger side and was ‘totally limp’. He also said one of the passengers in the Mercedes told him that the reason their car was further back was because it had stopped at a service station. ‘The conversation I had with the 7 Series driver was that they just went to Luton to see somebody, then they went to Milton Keynes. I think they were just on a night out,’ he added. Thames Water said the crash delayed contractors heading to fix a burst water main which created gridlock across west London. A 25-year-old man, from east London, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. The man has been released on police bail pending further enquiries, a Hertfordshire Police spokeswoman said. The force has appealed for witnesses to the collision or the events leading up to it to contact them on 101. There were long delays across north London and Hertfordshire yesterday morning as a result of the crash . The roofs of both vehicles were cut off to help free injured people inside the two cars .","Police bail a man after arresting him in connection with the crash .

With her sparkling blue eyes, long red locks and pretty bow she looks just like a normal little girl. It's hard to believe that she won't start running around causing mischief or playing with the toy that she clutches. But the little red-head is actually a scarily realistic doll created by French artist Laurence Ruet. The doll is one of a collection of intricately crafted unique creations which normally fetch between 450 and 1,350 Euros each. Hardly a crying, walking living doll and a far cry from the Cabbage Patch Kid dolls of old, the creations are not advertised as toys but as collectors items. Each child takes Laurence around two weeks to craft and cannot be replicated - they are not made using a mould. Made from a malleable polymer resin, the dolls are cooked rather like ceramics with limbs and faces fashioned from acrylic. Laurence painstakingly shapes each child's facial expression - the hardest part to make she says - and seems to have a penchant for freckles. The eyes are made of glass and the hair either from mohair or real hair. As well as the dolls themselves, she also pays great attention to crafting unique cloths and shoes - with each child dressed in classical clothing. Living doll: Artist Laurence Ruet seems to have a predilection for creating dolls with red hair and freckles . Collectable: The dolls more often than not carry their own toy, but the creation on the left is a rare example of one without a doll of its own . She said: 'My aim is to give emotion. I am very sensitive to expressions like delicacy, timidity, surprise and tenderness.' The dolls range from newborn to nursery school age with 'mini-bebes' starting at eight inches long and the biggest creations standing at an almost lifelike 22 inches tall. Laurence of Dijon in France, who only makes a handful of the dolls each year, was a portrait painter until she discovered her love for creating the lifelike children 12 years ago. She now says that it is her favourite art medium. Range: The dolls come in a selection of different sizes and ages - with newborn baby dolls, children of nursery school age and boys and girls .

The bodies of Robert and Amber Seymore, both 38, were found at their home in Holly Springs, North Carolina at 9am on Monday by Amber's mother. She had been living at the home to help the couple, who were getting a divorce, and returned from taking two of their children, aged six and eight, to school to find their bodies in the bedroom. Their two-year-old child was also at . home at the time of the shootings but was not harmed. Amber's mother . took the child to a neighbour's home and called 911. 'I just went upstairs to tell my daughter that I would take the baby to . nursery,' she  said in a recording of the call, obtained by NBC 17. 'I opened the door and they were both dead on the floor. 'My son in law killed both of them. He's a cop. He killed her... Oh my god, oh my god. They were getting a divorce.' Authorities . have not revealed who killed whom, but on the day after Thanksgiving, . Mrs Seymore called police to file a domestic violence complaint, town spokesman Mark Andrews said.

She explained that her brother, also a police officer, had urged her to alert authorities and that he, her husband and two of her children would soon be returning home. 'I will be kicking him out of the . house when he gets here,' she said of her husband. She asked for a police officer to park in the street outside the house for his return, as he did not know she had found out about the affair and, 'We have a lot of guns in the house'. 'I caught him doing some other stuff a . few months ago and when I confronted him he shoved me and got in my face . and was yelling at me when I was holding the kids,' she told the . dispatcher.

A mother who decapitated her two-year-old son before stabbing herself to death in a crazed murder suicide had smoked marijuana laced with PCP just before the attack it’s been revealed. A toxicology test confirmed Chevronne . Thomas, 34, had smoked the dangerous hallucinogenic last August making the third time authorities say the mother used the drug around her son in Camden, New Jersey. Thomas lost custody of the boy in 2010 and 2011 because of the drug use - once telling police she misplaced her baby while high - before he was returned to her care just four months before his murder. Murder suicide: A toxicology test confirmed that Chevonne Thomas, 34, had smoked marijuana and PCP just before decapitating her two-year-old son Zahree, right, and then killing herself last August . Police say that just five months after Thomas was reunited with her son in April, found to be fit to care for him by state workers, she carried out the gruesome attack before panicking and calling 911. Two-year-old Zahree's headless body was found on the ground floor of Thomas' apartment with the mother in an upstairs bedroom. Police tried to talk her into surrendering but she slashed her own throat and died before police could reach her. Inside the home's freezer police said they discovered the toddler's head. State workers with the Department of Children and Families say Thomas had received counselling, had passed drug screenings and was visited by state workers. But there are new questions on the regularity of those visits and if she truly was found fit to care for her son. Grisly scene: When police arrived at Thomas' home in New Jersey, they found the little boy's headless body on the ground floor of her apartment with Thomas moments later slashing her own throat upstairs . Tragic attack: The boy's head was found in the home's freezer after the third known drug use by the mother while around her child who had only been returned to her in April . Eerie silence: An air conditioner is seen on the roof of Thomas' home, along with a torn out screen and broken blinds after that tragic August night . State officials say they are now investigating the case. 'It's not just getting the facts on this case. It's about getting information on how very young children are being protected in New Jersey,' Cecilia Zalkind, executive director for Advocates for Children of New Jersey, told Philly.com. 'There are still many unanswered questions, especially about visitation. How often did the mother and child visit prior to reunification?’ she added, stressing the importance of visitation to determine a safe transition back to the home. Since the attack authorities have released the 911 call of the mother admitting her crime to a dispatcher while rambling and repeatedly contradicting herself. She first blames her boyfriend for killing her son before admitting to it, saying multiple times: 'I'm lying, I'm lying, I'm lying, I did it.' She also revealed she was taking Prozac but had not taken it that day. A neighbour said she saw Thomas sitting on the steps of her home earlier in the night topless and crying with her boyfriend. Police received the call around 12.30am from a woman about a domestic dispute. No one else was in the home when this happened. Thomas has another child who was not at home at the time. Prosecutors say Thomas had lost . custody of Zahree in 2010 when she left the boy . unattended in a car. She admitted she had smoked marijuana laced with PCP before blacking out in a park. Camden, which lies across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, has been plagued by poverty and high crime rates. Records show Thomas was arrested last year on charges of endangering the welfare of a child. Chevonne Thomas: Hell no, hell no, hell no. Keep thinking that. Keep thinking that.

A magnificent model of HMS Victory that is said to be the most accurate ever made is tipped to sell for £30,000. Dedicated modeller Tim Davies spent more than 10 years on the painstaking project which he meticulously researched. The result is a 2ft long, 1:96 scale model of Lord Nelson’s flagship that has the tiny figures of the naval hero and Captain Thomas Hardy stood on the poop deck. A magnificent model of Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory that is said to be the most accurate ever made is tipped to sell for £30,000 . The astonishing detail includes Nelson and Hardy on the poop deck and shows the famous ship off Sardinia at exactly 3.45pm on January 19 1805 . Mr Davies, 74, has kept the model in his study for the last 15 years but has now decided to auction it to raise money to fund his grandchildren's university education . Mr Davies, 74, has kept the model in his study for 15 years but has now decided to sell it to raise money to fund his grandchildren’s university education. The model ship, made from 12 varieties of fruit wood, is so accurate it is believed to show Victory as she was on January 19, 1805 at 3.45pm precisely. Mr Davies’ research revealed Victory was moored off Sardinia at that moment as Nelson prepared to chase the French fleet through the Mediterranean. The hunt came to a head at Trafalgar. He sourced weather reports and tidal information from the time so he could tell exactly which way the ship was pointed and got her position to within 10 yards. He used historic photos to discover what the topography of Sardinia looked like in 1805 and commissioned a marine artist to paint the background. The ship is housed in a . specially-designed glass case that is airtight and temperature . controlled with carefully arranged lighting that shows off the green . glass sea. Behind the . Victory is the rest of the fleet that includes the frigates Active and . Seahorse that arrived to tell Nelson of the French fleet’s movement. Dedicated modeller Tim Davies spent more than 10 years on the painstaking project that was meticulously researched by him . The ship is made out of 12 varieties of fruit woods and the hull even includes copper below the waterline . On the ship herself the signal flying from the mizzen mast reads 'unmoor', meaning one anchor is being raised, suggesting they were preparing to sail. The sails are made from draughtsman’s linen and contain 20,000 stitches which Mr Davies could only make after adapting his wife’s sewing machine. The colours of the hull are alternately black and yellow and on the upper two decks the gun ports are open and the cannons showing. The decks are correctly planked and pinned and the rigging is even of the right weight for the size of model. It is even possible to see inside the ship and view the internal fittings in the quarter galleries. On . the decks the figures of crew members and officers can be seen furling . sails, stowing anchor ropes and preparing to raise a small rowing boat. There is also a small boat being rowed towards Victory. Mr . Davies, from Cranleigh, Surrey, who is semi-retired from the family’s . wine and spirit business, said: 'My grandfather was a marine artist and . built two ivory models so it was in my genes. Heave ho! Mr Davies, from Cranleigh, Surrey, wanted to pick a specific time in Victory's life . The grandfather said he managed to pin-point the location of Victory to within 10 feet . Mr Davies flew out to Sardinia for a week and took photos for his project . 'It took 10 years to complete and I wanted to pick a specific time in Victory’s life. It couldn’t be when she had no sails up or when she was at sea with all her sails up. 'I chose the time in January 1805 and this was when the fleet was blockading Toulon and Victory had left for Sardinia for supplies. 'While there Nelson learned that the French had left the port and at this time he was preparing to sail. 'I managed to pin-point the location of Victory to within 10 feet, but had to find out how the magnetism had changed over the years so I could find the bearings taken at the time. 'I also found out what the tide was like at the time, and the weather. I flew out there for a week and took photos and also found some very old photographs of Sardinia. 'I built the model in the same way Victory had been built. This illustration shows Nelson mortally wounded at the Battle of Trafalgar, with his death in the cockpit of HMS Victory . A general view of HMS Victory in Portsmouth, Hampshire . 'I used about 12 different types of wood and made planks and the hull. 'She is fully rigged and the rigging took over a third of the total time to make the model. 'Another big job was the sea and in the end I used coloured glass, but it has to have the correct lighting or it changes colour. 'The glass is about six inches deep and makes the whole thing very heavy - about 140 kilos. 'There are 152 men on the model, which my wife Catherine painted.' He added: 'I am selling it to help raise money for my grandchildren’s education. It has been sitting in my study for the last 15 years since I finished it.' The model, which measures 4.5ft long including the case, is going under the hammer at Charles Miller auctions in London on October 31. Mr Miller said: 'I have never seen a better or more detailed model of Victory than this. 'The research and effort that has gone into it is incredible and it is all handmade.'","2ft long, 1:96 model took pensioner more than 10 years to build .

It has now been confirmed that Alyce's heart attacks were a result of the contraceptive pill . A teenager suffered seven heart attacks after a contraceptive Pill caused her to develop hundreds of blood clots. Promising show jumper Alyce Clark had been taking a daily dose of Microgynon for just one month when she suddenly collapsed at home with a cardiac arrest. By the time the 19-year-old was admitted to hospital she had been resuscitated by paramedics seven times in the ambulance. Her condition was so severe that her parents Roger, 61, and Freda, 60, were invited to 'say goodbye' to their daughter in hospital. A CT scan revealed 'hundreds' of blood clots had travelled from her leg to her heart and then to both her lungs. But after emergency injections of an anti-blood clotting drug and two days in intensive care, Alyce eventually started to recover. She said: 'Doctors told me if I'd been over 25 I would have been brain damaged for life, but I was young and able to recover.' Studies have shown that around 15 to 30 women in every 100,000 using the Pill will develop a potentially dangerous blood clot each year. Last week the Mail told how Shannon Deakin, 16, died from a blood clot after being prescribed oral contraceptive Dianette to clear up her acne. Now more than three years of testing by a specialist at University College London has confirmed Miss Clark's condition was caused by her contraceptive Pill. Alyce, now 22, said: 'They wanted to . make sure that the blood clots hadn't been caused by anything else . before they blamed the Pill. 'But I knew it must have been that. I was a fighting-fit teenager who loved sport, didn't smoke, drink or do drugs. It's nice to finally have an explanation after all these years.' Alyce had been resting at home in . Cliffe, Kent after injuring her back in a riding accident when the first . sign of her condition appeared. She had gone upstairs to speak to her mother and suddenly felt dizzy. She said: 'I had the overwhelming urge to sit down. Alyce took the contraceptive pill for just one month when she was 19 and suffered seven cardiac arrests, which ended her dream of being a show jumper forever . She had gone upstairs to speak to her mother and suddenly felt dizzy. She said: 'I had the overwhelming urge to sit down. But instead I collapsed and fell head first down the stairs and into a wall. 'My face was covered in blood and I had bitten down hard on my bottom lip. I knew something was seriously wrong and I told my parents to call an ambulance.' By the time paramedics arrived Alyce was suffering from excruciating chest pains. She said: 'I was terrified. I had no idea what was going on and could tell my parents were just as scared as I was. 'The paramedics got me into the ambulance but on the way to the hospital I stopped breathing because my heart had stopped. 'I was brought back but I had another cardiac arrest shortly afterwards, and then another, and then another. 'I was admitted to the resuscitation ward at the hospital by which time I had suffered seven near-fatal cardiac arrests. 'I was bleeding through my nose and mouth, and blood was escaping through my IV drips. My parents were invited in to say goodbye and no one so much as mentioned a chance of survival.' Alyce responded to treatment  at Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham and has recovered but she has been told she will never be able to return to showjumping. She said: They warned that my lungs would be damaged for the rest of my life and I knew it would be foolish to pursue an athletic career.' A spokesman from Bayer, which produces Microgynon, said: 'Every report about side effects on any of our products is reported to our drug safety department and thoroughly investigated by our medical experts. 'The use of any combined oral contraceptive carries a small increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots. 'At Bayer, patient safety comes first and Bayer regularly reviews safety related information of its products, including Microgynon. 'Based on the currently available information, the benefit-risk profile of Microgynon is favourable.'","Alyce Clark suffered cardiac arrest after taking Microgynon for a month .

A grandmother has found a way to avoid shelling out for expensive skin creams - by letting live snails slide all over her face. Edith Pangle, 62, said she has maintained her youthful looks by allowing the slimy molluscs to slither across her skin for at least 15 minutes every week. The grandmother came up with the idea after seeing adverts for luxury facial creams featuring the garden creature's ooze. Scroll down for video . Enough to make your skin crawl: South African Edith Pangle keeps the snails in a bag in her bedroom . But rather than splashing out on products, thrifty Ms Pangle simply collects snails from her back garden and lets them work their way across her skin. These amazing pictures show her enjoying the unique beauty therapy treatment at her home in Cape Town, South Africa. Ms Pangle told South Africa’s Daily Voice newspaper she believed the bizarre ritual had helped her keep her looks. She said: 'I just let the snails crawl over my face, my neck and my hands. 'Once a woman reaches a certain age you need to look after your skin, and this costs me nothing.' Ms . Pangle told the Daily Voice she started using snails as part of her . beauty therapy two years ago after spotting a television advert for an . anti-acne cream imported from France. Ms Pangle says her garden snails can last up to weeks once caught and kept in bags . She now regularly goes hunting in her . own garden and those of friends and neighbours for the slimey . creatures, which she keeps in a bag in her bedroom. Ms Pangle lets the snails out at least once a week to slide across her face, neck and hands. She sits back and stays still as the creatures leave a trail of mucus on her skin. She then just needs a quick wash with cold water before her beauty routine is complete. The grandmother said the home-made therapy was just as good as expensive creams. She . said: 'I can’t afford the expensive cream made from snails in France. That’s when I started collecting the snails and using them.' She added: 'I have my snails right here, I keep them for weeks in this packet and I don’t even need to feed them.' MS . Pangle said many of her friends had been stunned when they found out . about her bizarre beauty routine. But she said some had started using . snail therapy themselves after seeing the results. She added: 'I told a friend in England to try it out and she called me a few weeks later to say it does work.' However . Ms Pangle’s idea has not gone down well with all members of her family. Her brother Ken told the Daily Voice he hated seeing snails sliding . over his sister. He said: 'I can’t watch when she does this - it’s too creepy.' Snail extract has become a key ingredient in expensive skin creams . Snail slime has recently been heralded by cosmetic firms as a useful beauty ingredient. Several upmarket facial creams now include the shelled slug’s mucus. Those who apply the cream are told the slime can help reduce wrinkles, clear up acne and reduce pigmentation and scarring. But commercial creams can prove costly for those wanting to try the healing power of the snail. A 130 ml tube of cream containing snail slime was being sold by Missha for $33.99. Meanwhile a 30ml jar of cream made from 85 percent snail slime was on offer from the beauty firm Labcconte for $64.99.","Edith Pangle, 62, lets garden snails crawl over face, neck and hands .

The fight was triggered when Gary Shackleton, 26, and Andrew Dixon, 44, clashed outside their homes in Newcastle and then went indoors to gather makeshift weapons and family members. Shackleton came out with a heavy tin of paint, which he smashed into Dixon's head, before his  brother Paul followed him out carrying a stick, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Vicious: The families brawl outside their homes using chairs, sticks and even a machete as makeshift weapons . Armed: Gary Shackleton, left, started the fight by punching his neighbour before enlisting the help of his brother Paul, right, in the battle . CCTV footage shows Dixon carrying what appears to be a machete and then attacking Gary with a stick, kicking him in the head and hitting him with a broken chair. Both Shackleton brothers were injured and Gary was left needing 25 stitches to his head. Gary was jailed for four years, his brother was given a nine-month suspended sentence and Dixon was jailed for six months. The row began when Shackleton fell from his bike and accused Dixon of going through his pockets. Dixon is seen pushing a bike away from Shackleton, who then punches him, at which point they both enter their houses. Jailing Shackleton for affray and an unrelated burglary, Judge John Evans said: 'It was a disgraceful incident and you behaved in a way which resulted in a serious outburst of violence. 'You dealt the first blow to Dixon and thereafter the violence escalated, and you ended up with serious injuries to your head. 'You can’t expect sympathy for that given your behaviour.' First blow: Relatives of each man gather for the brawl after Gary Shackleton accused Andrew Dixon of going through his pockets and punched him . Brutal: Dixon, carrying what appears to be a machete, attacked Gary with a stick, kicking him in the head and hitting him with a broken chair . The fight took place on their street on February 2 this year. Barry Robson, defending Gary, said: 'He fell off his bike as he had been taking valium, and he doesn’t know if he passed out, but he accused the victims of trying to take money from his pockets. 'If anyone came out of this with a good hiding it was him. He had to be stitched up.' Paul Shackleton, from Denton Burn, Newcastle, has 53 previous convictions. He admitted affray on the basis he was less involved. Glenn Gatland, defending Paul, said: 'He didn’t actually hit anyone, he just chased someone with a stick. He suffered injuries.' He was given nine months in prison, suspended for 12 months, with a three-month curfew. Dixon, from Gateshead, pleaded guilty to affray and was jailed for six months. Mark Saunders, defending Dixon, said: 'This was not an incident brought by the Dixons to the door of the Shackletons, it may have been the other way round. 'There had been earlier difficulties but this was the crescendo.' Nasty: Gary, who has convictions for 59 previous offences, needed 25 stitches in his head . Gary, from Benwell, has convictions for 59 previous offences and pleaded guilty to affray and burglary. In May, he terrified a couple when they caught him burgling their home, the court heard. The 53-year-old woman got up to go to the toilet during the night and heard a noise downstairs. When she went to look, the kitchen door into the garage was open, as was the door from the garage into the garden, and she saw Shackleton running into the garden carrying an electric saw. The woman’s 54-year-old husband came down and was confronted by Shackleton at his front door. The thug pushed the man back into his house and his wife slammed the door and rang the police. In 2007, the Shackletons became the first family to be evicted from a private property after drunkenness, vandalism sprees and thefts. Dawn Shackleton, together with sons Gary, Paul and Mark and partner Colin Alderson, made life miserable for people living in Newcastle’s West End. Stopped: In 2007, the Shackletons became the first family to be evicted from a private property after drunkenness, vandalism sprees and thefts . When they were finally kicked out of their home, Mrs Shackleton claimed her family were the real victims. She complained about not being able to run her house on state handouts, but boasted of her 52inch widescreen plasma TV and family jaunts to Corfu and Benidorm - apparently paid for with ‘savings’. The 47-year-old mother was later exposed as a benefits cheat. The Department for Work and Pensions launched an investigation into her finances after the family’s eviction was highlighted. Investigations revealed she had been pretending to be her sister Julie Menzah, who lives thousands of miles away in Africa, for 12 years. She used the false identity to claim income support, jobseeker’s allowance, child benefit, housing benefit and council tax benefit, on top of the benefits she was entitled to already. In the run-up to their eviction, family members were arrested 40 times in six months.","Gary Shackleton punched neighbour he said was trying to steal from him .

However, 2010's final of the show received more than 2,000 complaints to Ofcom after raunchy performances by Rihanna and Christina Aguilera. Christina wore a super-short black dress, while her female dancers, who were bent over chairs, wore suspenders, bra tops, fishnet stockings and basques in the raunchy routine. Rihanna's performance in a bra-top, pants and fishnets was judged by Ofcom as having 'some mildly sexual overtones and included images of her gyrating and rocking her buttocks'.

Alone: More than 500,000 pensioners 'will be lonely at Christmas' (file picture) More than half a million older people will be spending Christmas alone this year – with only the TV for company, say campaigners. One in six is in touch with family, friends and neighbours barely once a week, while one in ten is in contact less than once a month. Surveys reveal the depth of isolation affecting many over-65s, whose wellbeing is at greater risk during the winter. Even in relatively mild winters, there are around 8,000 extra deaths for every one degree drop in average temperature. Spiralling energy bills, the severe cold snap affecting much of the country and poor eating habits pose threats to their health, but charities also want people to make time to care for their emotional needs. Richard Furze, chief executive of the Friends of the Elderly charity, said: ‘The effects of isolation on older people – including loneliness, depression, feelings of low self-worth, poor health and diet – can be devastating, with isolated individuals being less likely to obtain the services they need or seek help. ‘We understand that people are incredibly busy today, and especially at Christmas, but we urge people to get more involved with the older people around them – and not just at Christmas.’ Figures from surveys carried out by Friends of the Elderly and Age UK show over 500,000 older people will spend Christmas alone this year. Over half of older people say the TV is their main form of company, with many out of contact with friends and family. Around one in ten say they feel trapped in their own home and unable to join in social or recreational activities. One in 20 manages to get out of their home once a week or less. Lonely: One in six elderly people won't be enjoying a family Christmas as they are in touch with relatives, friends and neighbours barely once a week (file picture) Research shows people who live alone are more likely to be lonely, with charities warning 3.8million older people live alone and the figure is rising. Sixty per cent of women and nearly half of people aged 75 and over live alone. By 2033 it is predicted the numbers over 65 living on their own will go up by as much as half. Friends of the Elderly is asking people to go into local care homes to help decorate them in time for Christmas. The charity is also setting up festive meals for isolated people in the country. Mr Furze said: ‘Small things such as simply checking in on an older neighbour, popping a card through their door or having a chat with an older person at the shops is enjoyable for both young and older people, only takes a moment and can make a real difference.’","One in six over-65s barely speaks to family, friends or neighbours once a week according to a new survey by Friends of the Elderly .

David Oliver Relin, the co-author of the best-selling novel Three Cups of Tea, has committed suicide at age 49, a year after details of the book were called into question. Relin killed himself in the Portland-area town of Corbett, Oregon on November 14 and died of a blunt force head injury, medical examiners said. They declined to provide any further details. His family said the married author and humanitarian journalist 'suffered from depression' and that a police statement providing more information would be released this week. Relin co-wrote Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson, which recounts how Mortenson built schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Relin suffered . emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in . the book. Scroll down for video . Tragic: David Oliver Relin (right), who co-wrote the best-seller Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson (left), about how Mortenson set up schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has killed himself, aged 49 . The book, which has sold four million copies since it was published in 2006, came under scrutiny in April last year when '60 Minutes' and Jon Krakauer claimed it contained numerous fabrications, and even sparked a court case. The book had been conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the . Montana-based Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson co-founded in 1996 to build . schools. But readers alleged that some of the schools Mortenson's charity, the Central Asia Institute, claimed it had set up either did not exist . or were built by other charities. Also doubted was Mortenson's account that he stumbled into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb a mountain, and decided to build a school there after the residents saved him. His previous writings had made no . mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also . previously indicated that he originally planned to build the first . school in another village. Award-winning: Relin, right, enjoyed a stellar career as a humanitarian journalist throughout the 1990s . Troubled: But Relin suffered emotionally and financially after readers doubted facts in the book . Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue. Mansur Khan Mahuud, allegedly pictured as one of his 'Taliban' captors, is the research director of an Islamabad think tank and told 60 Minutes that the men were not kidnappers, but protectors: 'This is totally false and he is lying. He was not kidnapped.' Scrutiny: The authors came under fire for allegedly fabricating parts of the best-selling book . And there were also claims that his charity . had mismanaged funds and that a chunk of money had been used to promote . the book, rather than support his schools. In April, a judge rejected a lawsuit . by four people who bought the book, who claimed the authors, the . publisher, and the charity had conspired to . make Mortenson into a false hero to sell books. U.S. District Judge Sam Haddon . called the claims overly broad, flimsy and speculative. Mortenson . had denied any wrongdoing, though he has acknowledged there were 'some omissions and compressions' in the book. He agreed to repay the charity more than $1 million . for travel and 'personal charges' he made as he promoted the book. Relin did not speak publicly . about the charges, but he hired a lawyer to defend himself in the lawsuit. The book's agent, Elizabeth Kaplan, said that the relationship between Relin and Mortenson had been difficult from the outset, the New York Times reported. Mortenson was often hard to contact as he travelled to remote areas, and Relin also spoke publicly about how Mortenson should not have been named as a co-author. And, as Mortenson address critics of the book during an April 2011 interview with Outside magazine, he attempted to direct the blame away from himself. He said that Relin did 'nearly all the writing' and that the two collaborated to create 'the narrative arc'. 'What happens then is, when you re-create the scenes, you have my recollections, the different memories of those involved, you have his writing, and sometimes things come out different,' he said. Scrutiny: The book follows the adventures of co-author Greg Mortenson, pictured in Wakhan, northeastern Afghanistan in 2009, as he set up schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan . 'In order to be convenient, there . were some omissions. If we included everything I did from 1993 to 2003 . it would take three books to write it. So there were some omissions and compressions, and... I don't know, what that's called?' The . legal wranglings came after Relin, who was born in Rochester and lived in Portland, had . enjoyed a stellar career as a humanitarian journalist committed to . telling stories about young people in need. He . also reported from East Asia, and spent two years writing about . Vietnam's growing educational and financial stability after he spent a . year traveling through the country on bicycle in 1992. According to one online biography, he won more than 40 national awards for his work. 'He felt his causes passionately,' Lee Kravitz, the former editor . of Parade who hired Relin for various publications throughout the 1990s, told the New York Times. 'Dishonest': But critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and Mortenson, left, later admitted some facts were wrong. Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath . 'He . especially cared about young people. I always assigned him to stories . that would inspire people to take action to improve their lives.' He leaves behind his wife, Dawn, 47, his mother, his stepfather and two sisters. He had also completed a new book, which will be published in the spring, about two doctors working to cure cataract-related blindness in the developing world, the Times reported. Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children. His biography describes him as 'a living hero to rural communities of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he has gained the trust of Islamic leaders, military and militia commanders, government officials and tribal chiefs from his tireless effort to champion education, especially for girls.'

Four top music students pursuing studies in piano, voice and violin at a prestigious conservatory have been arrested for leading double lives in which they allegedly ran drug labs to make Ecstasy. Benjamin Knight, 24, Lauren Pajerski, 22, Max Cickovskis, 22, and Jonathan Beckwith, 23, have been indicted on numerous charges after their clandestine operation was uncovered at Baldwin Wallace University Conservatory of Music in Berea, Ohio. The arrests came after a six-month . investigation by police officers during which they discovered reams of . text messages between the classmates as they planned their operation. 'I am just grateful nothing blew up and . no one got hurt,' Berea police Detective Dennis Bort told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 'The moral of this . case is book-smart, street-stupid.' Busted: Violin major Lauren Pajerski, 22, (left) and singer Max Cickovskis, 22, (right) have been arrested for allegedly operating drugs labs to make Ecstasy and other drugs at their university in Ohio . Caught: Benjamin Knight, 24, (left) and Jonathan Beckwith, 23, (right) were also arrested for the plot . It is a steep fall from grace for the promising musicians. Knight, from Madison, Ohio and Beckwith, from Oakley, Michigan, were among 12 keyboard students who received scholarships this . year, the Plain Dealer reported. Cickovskis, from Parma, Ohio, sang bass and is pictured playing guitar on Facebook, while Pajerski, a violin major from Andover, Massachusetts, played in . the 2012 Bach Festival in April. Police first launched an investigation into the students on May 17 after a university chemistry teacher found his key to the science labs had been stolen. He told officers he had seen Pajerski, who also majored in chemistry, looking in the room with another man earlier that day, which he thought was unusual as it was the summer vacation. Despite changing the locks, security guards spotted a man and woman, dressed in black and wearing face masks, in the lab at 11.30pm the next night. Promising: Cickovskis, pictured on stage, and the other students have been suspended from their classes . Prestigious: They all attended the Baldwin Wallace University Conservatory of Music in Berea, Ohio . 'They had boxed up chemicals and . equipment and had other lab equipment running,' Bort said. 'When [the . security guard] walked in, they ran out.' The pair were later identified by police as Pajerski and Knight, who ran to a university hall of residence to hide from police, where they bumped into Beckwith. They told him about the break in and he helped them set up a lab in an empty dorm room to cook a batch of Ecstasy, police said. Police approached phone service providers to obtain the students' text messages and learned that they texted each other about specific chemicals and equipment, the Plain Dealer reported. Knight and Pajerski sent messages planning the break-in, what equipment they . needed and how Pajerski should leave a window open on the ground floor to get inside, Bort said. 'Some of the messages were pretty . funny,' he added. 'He said he had a really sweet hat for [the break-in] . and she said a fedora is not B-and-E [breaking and entering] wear.' Foiled: The investigation was launched after Pajerski, left, and Knight, right, allegedly stole equipment to make the drugs from a chemistry lab. Police also tracked their text messages planning the break-in . The text messages allegedly revealed that the students cooked drugs in Knight's garage, the same dorm room at Findley Hall and at a condominium, all within two weeks in June. Police swooped on the students' home in Berea on October 19 and left with chemicals and equipment used to make hallucinogenic mushrooms and Ecstasy. 'They were fairly diversified,' Bort . said. 'She had the technical knowledge to set it up, and Ben handled the . logistics of acquiring. Max seems to be more sales-oriented.' He added that Knight, Pajerski and Cickovskis did not . appear to understand the seriousness of the potential charges - and one asked when they would get their computers back so they could finish their thesis. 'They didn't understand . they were not likely getting it back nor were they likely to be in . school,' Bort said. Scene: After stealing the equipment they allegedly set up a drugs lab in Findley Hall, pictured, with Beckwith . Investigations continue into who was buying the drugs, police said. All four students have been suspended from the university. They were indicted on November 16 on charges including assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs and cultivating marijuana. Knight and Pajerski were charged with theft and burglary. They are scheduled to be arraigned on December 4 and if convicted, they could face mandatory prison time due to their proximity to Berea High School and a nearby elementary school. Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music is 15 miles southwest of Cleveland, Ohio. It has places for just 260 students and programs have produced successful musicians, including members of the Cleveland Orchestra and composers, such as Anthony Holland.","Two piano scholars, violinist and bass singer arrested for drug operation .

An Army private charged with leaking classified material to WikiLeaks . said Friday that he tied a bedsheet into a noose while considering . suicide during his pretrial confinement in Kuwait. Pfc. Bradley Manning testified on the fourth day of a pretrial . hearing at Fort Meade near Baltimore. Manning testified under . cross-examination that he made the noose in Kuwait before he was moved . to a Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Va. Goal: Manning said his pre-trial punishment was so severe he fashioned a noose and considered suicide . He claims that his treatment . later at Quantico was so harsh that the charges against him should be . dismissed. He arrived at Quantico classified as a suicide risk. Eight days . later, he was upgraded to the less-restrictive ""prevention of injury"" status. Manning maintains that neither designation was appropriate because he didn't feel like hurting himself after leaving Kuwait. Under questioning by prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein, Manning said that . upon arrival at Quantico in July 2010, he was told he would be processed . into the brig as a suicide risk. He said he noted on his intake form . that he had considered suicide. He also wrote on the form that he was 'always planning and never acting' upon suicidal thoughts. In court Thursday he talked about his feelings while being held. 'I was in a pretty stressed . situation...I was getting very little information' from his attorney . while he was being held, he said, noting that he felt increasingly . ‘hopeless’. He said he remembers thinking 'I'm going to die, I'm stuck inside this cage.' 'I had pretty much given up. My world had . just shrunk,' Manning said, explaining how he had suicidal thoughts . while being held by authorities.'I totally started to fall apart.' In January 2011, after complaining about his custody classification, . Manning met with a board of officers that made custody status . recommendations. On the stand: Bradley Manning testified about the treatment he received during his two-years in prison . Controversial: Supporters stood outside the Maryland military courthouse where he was due to appear Tuesday . He said when he was asked about the statement on his . intake form about planning and never acting, he told the board that he . might have lied. 'I did say it might have been a sarcastic answer,' Manning said. 'I . told them today, the end of January 2011, I'm not suicidal. I'm not . trying to harm myself or anything like that.' The testimony marked the first time military prosecutors went face-to-face with Manning. He spoke publicly Thursday for the first time since his May 2010 . arrest, saying he got so used to leg irons and being locked up 23 hours a . day that when he was finally transferred to medium-security confinement . at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in April 2011, he felt uneasy moving freely . around the cell block. 'There was the sense of, 'OK, I know they're going to put the hammer . down on me soon,'' Manning said near the end of his five hours on the . witness stand. Besides being classified 'maximum custody,' Manning was subjected to . additional restraints during his nine months at Quantico. Commanders . maintained the extra restrictions despite repeated recommendations by . brig psychiatrists that they be eased. Make or break: If a judge rules he was tortured then the entire trial could be abandoned, though that is not expected to happen . They included scratchy, . suicide-prevention bedding and sometimes having all his clothing, . eyeglasses and reading material removed from his cell. The military contends the treatment was proper. At one point during his testimony Thursday, Manning donned a . dark-green, suicide-prevention smock resembling an oversized tank top . made of stiff, thick fabric. He said it was similar to one he was issued . in March 2011, several days after Quantico jailers started requiring . him to surrender all his clothing and eyeglasses each night as a . suicide-prevention measure. This occurred after he told them — out of . frustration, he said — that if he really wanted to hurt himself, he . could have done so with his underwear waistband or flip-flops. The 5-foot-3 soldier looked youthful in his dark-blue dress uniform, . close-cropped hair and rimless eyeglasses. He was animated, often . speaking in emphatic bursts, swiveling in the witness chair and . gesturing with his hands. Also Thursday, the military judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, accepted . the terms under which Manning may plead guilty to eight of the 22 . charges he faces. Coombs revealed the plea offer in early November, . saying it would enable Manning to take responsibility for sending U.S. secrets to WikiLeaks. Lind hasn't formally accepted the pleas but has indicated she will consider them at a hearing starting Dec. 10. Spotted: Bradley Manning was seen for the first time in public in over two years as he arrived at a Maryland courthouse . Under the offer, Manning would plead guilty to certain charges as . violations of military regulations rather than as violations of federal . espionage and computer security laws. The offenses would then carry . maximum prison terms totaling 16 years rather than 72. The pleas would include admissions that Manning sent WikiLeaks . classified memos, Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, Guantanamo Bay prison . records and a 2007 video clip of a U.S. helicopter crew gunning down 11 . men later found to have included a Reuters news photographer and his . driver. The video, titled 'Collateral Murder' on WikiLeaks, garnered . worldwide attention. The Pentagon concluded the troops acted . appropriately during the attack, having mistaken the camera equipment . for weapons. The government could still prosecute Manning for all 22 counts he . faces, including aiding the enemy. That offense carries a maximum . penalty of life in prison. Manning is accused of engineering the biggest leak of classified . material in U.S. history. Besides the video, he is charged with sending . hundreds of thousands of classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and . more than 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks while working as an . intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010.","Wikileaks .

Experts have warned that Europe faces a sustained outbreak of dengue fever – the worst in almost 100 years. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said yesterday that the continent is experiencing its first sustained transmission of dengue fever, which is carried by mosquitoes, since the 1920s. Six Britons have been confirmed as suffering from the disease after contracting it on the holiday island of Madeira. Infection: More than 1,300 people infected have been with the mosquito-borne disease in the Portuguese island of Madeira . A further 19 cases have been found elsewhere in Europe among travellers returning from the island. Since the outbreak began in early October, 1,357 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Madeira, including 669 laboratory-confirmed cases and 688 probable cases. Eighty-nine people have received hospital treatment but there have been no deaths so far. Dengue, caused by a bite from a mosquito infected with the virus, can cause symptoms from mild flu-like illnesses to more serious problems such as bone pain. Holiday hell: Madeira is particularly popular at this time of year for out-of-season sunshine . Preventative: Since dengue-carrying mosquitoes are daytime biters, the ECDC said protection should be applied throughout the day . Severe and potentially deadly forms develop in around 5 per cent of patients. Dengue is a viral . infection that can cause a range of symptoms, from mild flu-like illness . to more serious illnesses including rashes and bone pain. Severe and potentially deadly forms develop in around 5 percent of patients. Dengue usually clears up by itself within around 1-2 weeks. There . are no specific medications to treat the disease, but symptoms can be . managed by taking paracetamol, drinking plenty of fluids and resting. Madeiran health authorities are . implementing control and prevention measures and a public awareness . campaign after the outbreak, the first recorded on the island. ‘Given . the dramatic expansion of endemic dengue transmission globally over the . last 20 to 30 years and the high number of visitors to Madeira, the . outbreak is large and constitutes a significant public health event,’ said an ECDC spokesman. It . has advised authorities in neighbouring areas, such as the Canary . Islands, to step up surveillance of mosquito populations to assess the . risk of dengue fever spreading. It did not recommend any travel restrictions but advised protection against mosquito bites, including disinfection and control of mosquitoes at ports and airports. Dr Dipti Patel, joint director of the National Travel Health Network and Centre, said: ‘Anyone who develops a fever or flu-like symptoms within two weeks of returning from a trip to Madeira should seek medical advice.’","More than 1,300 people infected with mosquito-borne disease in Madeira .

The new, restored and rebooted films from Sony Pictures are among the content coming pre-loaded on a video player bundled with Sony's first ultra-high-definition television, a massive 84-inch set that retails for $25,000 (£15,614) and features nearly four times the resolution of typical high-definition TVs. ‘People ask the question, “Do I need to get a bigger house to fit an 84-inch TV?”’ said Chris Cookson, president of Sony Pictures Technologies. Scroll down for video . Get the picture? An undated publicity image provided by Sony shows an ultra-HD 4K TV set . ‘The answer is that 25 inches was right for standard definition; 50 inches was right for high-definition; and 84 inches is right now that we're going ultra-high-def.’ Ultra HD is widely regarded as the next evolution in TV technology, but there's currently a lack of content that takes advantage of the vast resolution, though Ultra HD sets are equipped to upscale lower resolution video. Sony Corp. is hoping to overcome that pitfall that with this new player. The Japanese electronics giant debuted the hard-disc server - hidden in a cabinet underneath the behemoth television - at a posh invite-only party Thursday at a private mansion in Santa Monica that featured a performance by John Legend. The video player will include 4K content such as short films, concerts and 10 feature-length movies, including ‘The Other Guys,’ ‘Salt’ and ‘The Bridge on the River Kwai.’ Sony's TV will also come with an Xperia Tablet S, which can be used as a touchscreen remote control. Home base: Sony's Tokyo headquarters . ‘We know there are limitations with broadband and the typical size of a movie that's in 4K,’ said Phil Molyneux, chief operating officer of Sony Electronics. ‘I think this is an extremely good first step to ensure that consumers can have and enjoy the 4K experience in their home.’ The electronics industry has dubbed the new flat-panel displays ‘Ultra HD,’ while Sony specifically refers to it as ‘4K’ because it features nearly 4,000 pixels, compared to the 1,080 pixels found in ‘1080p’ sets. Molyneux said Sony has been pushing for 4K since 2005, when the company put 4K projectors in movie theatres. Electronics leader: Sony ranked 87th on the 2012 list of Fortune Global 500 . Last year, Sony introduced a 4K home projector, and offered a 4K upscaling Blu-ray player earlier this year. Molyneux teased that additional 4K content for the new player would be sent to owners on Blu-ray discs. ‘It's a first step,’ added Molyneux. ‘If we've had a vision since 2005, and we've been arming and equipping for 4K content creation, I think it's fair to speculate that we're also thinking about other ways to get 4K content to consumers in their home.’ LG Electronics offers a similar 84-inch Ultra HD TV, which retails for $20,000 (£12,491).","Sony is releasing its first ultra-high-definition television, a massive 84-inch set that retails for $25,000 (£15,614) and features nearly four times the resolution of typical high-definition TVs .

Angela Phillips is alleged to have been murdered by her husband with an industrial-sized hammer . A row about decorating led to a husband murdering his wife in a row about decorating just three months after they got married, a court has heard. Thomas Crompton, 39, is on trial over the death of his wife, Angela, after she is believed to have been hit around the head with an industrial-sized hammer he uses for metalwork. Norwich Crown Court heard that Crompton carried out the gruesome killing in their cottage in Arminghall, Norfolk, before going into his nearby workshop where he confessed to a colleague. Prosecutor Peter Gair said: 'Angela told him she was going to start decorating and that she had started to put some of his things into a box. 'He was concerned his items may be damaged. He said he was really annoyed and that this turned into a massive row.' Mother-of-three Angela who had children from a previous relationship, was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital after the attack on June 11. She was moved to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, but died two days later from her head injuries. Bjorn Fiskvatn who was working with Crompton, told how the father-of-two emerged from his house with beads of sweat on his forehead and the blood-stained hammer in his hand. The Norwegian sculptor said: 'Tom came in and he placed a hammer on the bench in front of me and he said, ""That is it. I have killed her"". 'I was left very confused because I thought this was some kind of joke.' Mr Fiskvatn said Crompton, his work colleague since 2006, had earlier gone into the house to make a cup of tea for him, while he watched the workshop furnace which they were using for melting iron. He heard the smashing of crockery from inside the house, but thought nothing of it as he sent a text message to his partner from a caravan by the workshop in Crompton’s garden. When Crompton told him about the killing, they both went back into the house to check his wife’s pulse as she lay on her back on the dining room floor. Thomas Crompton is alleged to have murdered his wife, Angela, in the cottage on the right . Mr Fiskvatn called 999, and an ambulance and the police were on the scene shortly after 4pm. He said: 'I tried to find any other explanation to why there was blood and hair on the hammer, but slowly I came to the realisation that what he told me was the truth.' Mr Fiskvatn told the court that the couple had earlier been having problems and Crompton was seeking help for his wife. He said: 'He loved her deeply. They were taking steps to seek professional help and guidance.' Mr Fiskvatn said that Crompton had come into the workshop ten days earlier with bags of kitchen knives and had told him that his wife had threatened to hurt herself and he wanted to keep the knives away from her. Crompton admits the killing, but denies murder. A jury will decide if he is guilty of murder or manslaughter in a trial expected to last two weeks. The trial continues.

Horrifying pictures reveal for the first time the extent of a magician's injuries after a local television host lit his head on fire. Wayne Houchin, from California, was filming in the Dominican Republic when the presenter rubbed a flammable cologne over his head causing burns to the magician's face, neck and hand. He has now released images that show red burns and blistered skin covering about two thirds of his face. Painful: The magician Wayne Houchin released the picture of his blistered and raw face . Recovery: Wayne Houchin was rushed to hospital in Santo Domingo where he received treatment for the burns . The magician said in a statement released on his Facebook page on Sunday that doctors are 'cautiously optimistic' he will not be scarred. He added he has been 'resting, healing & working through the legal process' in the Caribbean nation, where he had been performing with a group of fellow magicians. During a November 26 appearance on the . Dominican Republic's Closer To The Stars TV program, guest host Franklin . Barazarte abruptly doused the U.S. magician's head with 'Agua de . Florida,' a flammable cologne commonly used in Santeria rituals. Following the incident, world famous magician David Copperfield said: 'You try to present yourself as a performer that is creating wonder and amazement and occasionally somebody might misunderstand that and might think that you’re trying to foster belief in something supernatural.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Surprise attack': Guest host Franklin Barazarte rubbed his hands together and over Wayne Houchin's head . Houchin's head immediately caught fire .

'The fast actions of the rest of our Curiosidades team saved my life. 'The fire was put out and I was rushed to the emergency room. I have bad burns on my head, face, neck and right hand.' The host appeared to try and put out the flames . Houchin staggered off stage with his head still ablaze . A video of the incident shows the magician's head bursting into flames as Barazarte runs his hands over Houchin's hair. It is unclear why the TV host doused his head in the liquid and what ignited it. The program has not commented on the incident. The video also shows Houchin, Barazarte and others struggling to extinguish the flames for several seconds. Houchin has since claimed that the quick actions of the TV crew saved his life . The incident was not broadcast on Dominican television but a video of it has appeared on the Internet. Houchin added on Thursday: 'The Dominican Republic is a beautiful country full of beautiful people. 'The outrage here and outpouring of support has been incredible. 'The support, love and well wishes that has been sent my way through social media, blogs, forums, friends and fans has been both humbling and overwhelming. Thank you.' It was not immediately clear if he has retained a lawyer in the Dominican Republic. The magician needed immediate hospital treatment for his burns.

Thousands of vital letters such as energy bills and bank statements would fail to reach customers if the boycott went ahead – causing chaos for households and businesses. Royal Mail has lost business to the likes of TNT Post and UK Mail over the past seven years. Currently, half of all letters are handled by a rival company, with Royal Mail responsible for only the final mile of the delivery. Strike: Royal Mail workers may ignore post sent via their 'unfair' competitors who have caused job losses, price rises and fewer services . The Communication Workers’ Union said . yesterday it will ballot its 200,000 members in the New Year about . whether to boycott letters which have been handled by a rival firm. The ban would affect post from some of . the country’s biggest businesses. Thames Water, BT, E.On, Sky, . Barclays, Npower, O2 and Talk Talk are among those who use Royal Mail’s . rivals to handle all or some of their letters. Government departments such as HM Revenue and Customs use TNT. CWU members – the majority of whom . work for Royal Mail – will be asked a single question about whether they . are prepared to boycott the delivery of mail handled by a rival. Since 2005, Royal Mail has rapidly . lost its key business customers, according to data published last month . by postal regulator Ofcom. Just 5.2 per cent of all letters were handled . by a rival in 2005. Last year, the figure hit 44 per cent and Royal . Mail says it is now dangerously close to 50 per cent. This year, TNT Post expects to handle . 3.8billion letters and UK Mail expects to handle 3billion. They pick up . letters from their business customers, sort them, distribute them around . the UK and then pay Royal Mail to put them through the letterbox, known . as the ‘final mile’. Boycott: Post sent via competitors is still taken the 'final mile' by postmen but this responsibility will be ignored if the strike goes ahead . Dave Ward, CWU deputy general . secretary, said: ‘What we are seeing is private companies being able to . do what they want, with little concern for how it affects postal . services in the round.’ Concerns: Royal Mail says all post must be delivered but admitted they are also worried by the rise cherry-picking competitors . The union fears the impact on postal . services could be ‘catastrophic’ if the problem is not dealt with, and . leaves  the crucial ‘universal service obligation (USO)’ under threat. The USO is the promise that Royal Mail will pick up and deliver letters . six days a week for a uniform price anywhere in Britain. TNT Post poses an even bigger threat . to Royal Mail because it began a trial of its own postal service in West . London in April, in which it no longer uses Royal Mail postmen. About 300,000 families and businesses . in areas such as Ealing, Hammersmith and Victoria get some of their mail . delivered by TNT’s 600 postmen dressed in their distinctive orange . uniform. Unlike Royal Mail postmen, they have . no obligation to meet targets set down by the regulator, such as the . rule which says Royal Mail must aim to deliver 93 per cent of . first-class mail the next day. TNT Post wants to do more trials in . cities across the UK, which poses a major problem for Royal Mail, . because it will be left with the loss-making routes which no private . business wants. Royal Mail has already sharply hiked . its stamp prices in a bid to make more money. A first-class stamp jumped . from 46p to 60p in April, and could rise again at any time. A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘We are concerned about the impact of unfettered direct delivery competition. ‘Currently, competitors are allowed to . “cherry-pick” higher density, more profitable routes in urban areas and . ignore lower density rural areas where delivery is more costly.’ UK Mail chief executive Guy Buswell said TNT had ‘really upset the apple cart’ with its West London delivery trial. A TNT Post spokesman said: ‘We disagree with the comments made in relation to TNT Post in this matter.’","Strike could happen in New Year and all non-Royal Mail post would just be ignored .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . PUBLISHED: . 10:48 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:46 EST, 5 December 2012 . A baby died in a gap between her bed and a radiator, an inquest has heard. Tilly Fitzpatrick was three months old when she got stuck and over-heated in her bedroom in Chelsea, south west London, last September. Her mother, Louise, left Tilly and her twin sister with their father, Timothy Clark, while she went shopping. When she tried to contact him he failed to answer the phone so she returned to the house where she knocked on he door and woke him after he fell asleep in the lounge. Tilly Fitzpatrick died at home in these flats in Chelsea, London, after falling between a bed and a radiator . She wept as she told West London Coroner's Court that Tilly had 'definitely been moved' from between pillows on the bed - possibly when her two-year-old son, Reilly, had gone looking for toys. Ms Fitzpatrick said: 'He came at about 9am, or 9.30am. I had fed Tilly and winded her and I went into the living room where Tim was feeding Megan and I said ""you're going to be fine aren't you?"" and he said ""yes"". 'Tilly was in the bed in the master bedroom. I'd put a pillow to the left and one to the right of her so she couldn't move.' She went out shopping with her son Jaden but became alarmed when at 11.30am her ex, Mr Clark, stopped answering her call and she returned home just before 2pm. Sobbing, Ms Fitzpatrick added: 'When I went into the block I just had this gut feeling that something was wrong and I grabbed Jaden and ran up the stairs. 'I was knocking at the door for what felt like forever. When he opened the door, I could tell that he had just woken up. 'When I looked in the bedroom I couldn't see Tilly at all, and by this time I was shouting at him ""Where's Tilly?"". 'When I went back into the bedroom I just saw a pink vest and then saw her down the side of the bed. 'I was just screaming and before I knew it Tim was telling me how to resuscitate her from what they were telling him on the phone, and then the next thing I remember is my dad coming in.' West London Coroner's Court, pictured, heard that Tilly's mother, Louise, discovered her body after returning from a shopping trip . Paramedics rushed the baby to hospital where she was briefly revived before being pronounced dead. Ms Fitzpatrick told the inquest: 'She was definitely moved. There is no way she could have moved from where I left her, she was only three months old. 'After she died I thought about this all the time. How did she get there? I don't know what happened but I don't think Tim hurt her - there's no possible way. 'I believe that if she hadn't got down the side of the bed she would still be here.' Mr Clark told the inquest he had last checked on Tilly at about 1pm, but then he fell asleep while feeding her twin sister in the living room and watching cartoons with his two-year-old son Reilly. He said: 'There's no way she could have moved from between the pillows. 'Reilly was two at the time and the door to the bedroom was a little bit open so I could hear her [Tilly]. 'He goes in there sometimes to get his toys so he might have gone in there.' A post-mortem revealed Tilly had been starved of oxygen and must have lain face down for up to an hour after her death. Coroner Miss Alison Thompson turned to devastated mum Louise Fitzpatrick and said: 'Mothers always have to leave their babies at some point. You can't stay with them forever, nobody would expect you to.' The coroner said she was satisfied that Tilly was left on the bed in 'an entirely safe position' and that the tot had suffocated after becoming wedged. Recording a short narrative verdict, she added: 'Tilly was a well-nourished and healthy child with no underlying medical conditions that contributed to her death. 'When she was found, the majority of her body was lower than the mattress and her face was pressed against the side of the mattress. Ms Fitzpatrick later found a wet patch on the mattress there. 'I have heard evidence that [Mr Clark] had had a late night and I'm satisfied that it was nearer to two hours since he last checked on Tilly. 'Someone had been responsible for directly or indirectly moving her and I have heard that it could have been merely a bounce on the bed. 'She must have been moved into a different position but with no specific intention to harm her.' Miss Thompson recorded that Tilly died when she was left on an adult bed without supervision, and that the medical cause of death was postural asphyxia.","Tilly Fitzpatrick had been left on her mother's bed .

Amateur photographer Bob Carter captured this amazing photo of a seagull crossing the path of an aircraft's vapour stream on Sunday. He could not believe his luck when he looked back at his snaps to see how perfectly the jet's path had dovetailed with the bird's position in the sky - creating the appearance of a 'super bird'. The photos were taken in Hull by the River Humber using a Pentax K-X. Perfect shot: Amateur photographer Bob Carter took this amazing picture of a seagull in Hull over the weekend. Mr Carter, 55, said he was buzzing when he realised he had taken the perfect image on his first attempt. He told MailOnline: 'I am out and about a lot taking photos and I had this picture in my mind about a week ago. 'We have had a lot of cloud, but one sunny day I saw the contrail and I saw the gull heading towards it, and incredibly I got it on the first shot. 'I was amazed. I expected it to take thousands of shots and I got it just right. 'I took two shots in succession and and less than a second later it was well away from the contrail. ‘I was buzzing when I got it. It genuinely looks like the vapour is coming from the gull.' Mr Carter, a former care worker, added he was always looking for quirky photo ideas and he hopes to turn his hobby into a profession. Coincidence: The seagull moments after the first 'perfect' shot was taken - a long way from the vapour trail . Vapour trails or contrails are artificial clouds that form behind aircraft. They are made of numerous liquid droplets or ice crystals and emerge from the exhaust of aeroplanes. It . can also be created when areas of low pressure form around the edge of . the wing, creating vortices - tubes of circulating air - that leave . trails behind the wing's tips. The low pressure in these areas mean that cold air can condense, leaving trails of water or even ice behind the plane. When a plane passes through a cloud, water vapour and ice from the clouds are sucked into the vortices, adding to the effect. 'Is it a bird, is it a plane?' was a phrase coined in the Superman cartoon series. The superhero is here depicted by Christopher Reeve in the 1978 film.","Amateur photographer Bob Carter captured perfect image of a flying seagull with a vapour trail .

And clever marketing will ensure firms will make the most of the royal couple's happy announcement over the next nine months and beyond. Less than 24 hours after Kate and William were forced to confirm that she was expecting their first child after she was taken into hospital with severe morning sickness, shrewd souvenir companies had kick-started the kilns ready for a batch of commemorative keepsakes. Scroll down for video . Dragons of Walton Street, the high end nursery outfitters based in Knightsbridge, say they have already received a peak in interest in their four-poster 'Duchess cot', since the news was announced yesterday afternoon . The name Elizabeth is already the favourite for the couple's new arrival at Ladbrokes where odds have dropped to 7/1 . A mug celebrating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s happy news has already gone into production following yesterday’s official announcement by St James’s Palace. Elizabeth  7/1 . John     10/1 .

High-end pottery company Emma Bridgewater, which hand-makes all its products at its Victorian factory in Stoke-on-Trent, has yet to confirm a release date for the items out of respect for the royal couple. But the manufacturer confirmed that sample products had already been drawn up and the first batch was heading for the ovens. Designed by managing director Emma Bridgewater and her husband, Matthew Rice, the half-pint mug bears red and blue hearts in the firm’s signature sponged technique. Finished with the words 'A Royal Baby in 2013' on one side and 'Hooray for Will & Kate' on the other, the commemorative pieces will cost £19.95. And Dragons of Walton Street, the high end nursery outfitters based in Knightsbridge, say they have already received a peak in interest in their four-poster 'Duchess cot', since the news was announced yesterday afternoon. The company is already a royal favourite. Diana was said to be a 'huge fan' and they designed the nursery of Prince William and Harry in a pale blue Beatrix Potter design, while princesses Beatrice and Eugenie also had Dragons' dens - in pale pink gingham and Flower Fairies. But at £12,000 and taking an eight strong team 12 weeks to make, the cot is not perhaps as affordable as the raft of other memorabilia which will no doubt soon hit shelves and the internet. On the other end of the spectrum Italian craftsmen in the city of Naples, who are more commonly associated with Nativity scenes, are already stocking carved figurines of a pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. The gaudy figures feature Wills and Kate in their wedding clothes - but Kate is also sporting a heavily swollen stomach under her white dress. Twitter quickly exploded in response to the news of the baby yesterday. 'I may not have bones yet, but I'm already more important than everyone reading this,' was the Tweet from @RoyalFetus, which already has nearly 9,000 followers. The surprise announcement yesterday . beat the bookies odds by one month, and now it is bets on the new arrival's name . that are hotting up. Bookmakers William Hill and Ladbrookes say tens of thousands of pounds have been staked on what the baby's name will be - with Elizabeth a clear favourite at 7/1. Paddy Power has said the name Victoria is currently the favourite with odds at 9/1. But other strong family names, . including Alexandra, Victoria and . Diana are also being offered. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrookes said: 'It's still very early days at the moment but by Christmas Day we reckon we'll have taken £25,000 worth of bets on baby names alone. ' Contenders: Elizabeth and John are strong baby name contenders - but other favourites are Diana and Charles, after the prince's parents . The firm have also been inundated with requests on the chances of the couple conceiving twins, having previously been a 33/1 shot it is now just 10/1 that Kate and Wills hear the pitter patter of two sets tiny of feet next year. Miss Bridge added: 'The odds are now suggesting the nation should expect two new arrivals, giving us all a reason for a double celebration.' As speculation mounted last week one gambler who believed the couple would be expecting sooner rather than later placed a £10 bet on Rylan to be the chosen name at odds of 1000/1. Speculation as to what they might name their first child began even before Kate was pregnant with predictions posted ranging from Mary and Matilda to Edmund and George on the mumsnet website before their wedding. Bookmaker William Hill said it will pay out a 'small five-figure sum' after many people betted on a 2013 royal baby. Spokesman Joe Crilly said: 'We fully . expect that the betting public will get involved in speculating what the . baby will be called. 'When William and Catherine got . married we were bowled over by a million pounds worth of bets and we . predict similar levels of excitement before the birth of their first . child.' William Hill is even offering odds on the colour of the newborn's hair - 6/4 brown, 2/1 blonde, 5/2 black, and 8/1 ginger. Linda Rosenkrantz and Pamela Redmond Satran, the authors of Cool Names for Babies, already have their predictions on the babyzone website - posted before Kate was even pregnant. Suggestions include Alice (the name of Queen Victoria's second daughter and also the Duke of Edinburgh's mother), Amelia (George II's second daughter), Dorothea (meaning gift of god) and Charlotte (wife of George III) for a girl and Augustus (George II's middle name), Frederick (a son of George III) or Leopold (a son of Queen Victoria). If the baby is boy, he would be expected to be styled a Prince and if the baby was a girl, a Princess. The last example of a great granddaughter of a still serving Sovereign born on the male line was Princess Mary, who was born in 1897 and was George VI's sister and a great granddaughter of Queen Victoria. William uses the surname 'Wales' professionally in the forces . According to the monarchy's official . website: 'For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are . entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a . surname, but if at any time any of them do need a surname (such as upon . marriage), that surname is Mountbatten-Windsor.' In 1917, George V adopted Windsor as the royal family's House and . surname. In 1960, for the direct descendants of the Queen and the Duke . of Edinburgh, other than those with the style of Royal Highness and the title of Prince/Princess, or female descendants who marry, it became Mountbatten-Windsor. Mountbatten was the surname Greek-born Prince Philip assumed when he . became naturalised in 1947. William has used Wales professionally in the forces. His children might . use Cambridge in the same way, or even Wales too as William still . retains his title Prince William of Wales. If a boy, the baby is also likely to one day be Prince of Wales. The . title is usually given to the male heir to the throne, but it is not . automatic. VIDEO: Royal baby!

"By . Catherine Ostler . PUBLISHED: . 19:45 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:54 EST, 5 December 2012 . Decisions, decisions: Kate pictured with a friend's pram in June . This will be the most scrutinised, most photographed, most copied pregnancy the world has ever seen. In this celebrity-obsessed, internet age, it is certain that every decision mother-to-be Kate makes until her baby’s birth will prove to be a trend-setting one — analysed and imitated across the globe. Her bump itself will become the focus of attention for a gawping world as people look for scintillas of cheer among stories of economic austerity and international sabre-rattling. Indeed, the little prince or princess will have considerable influence even before they take their first breath in the land over which they’ll one day reign. Long gone are the days when well-heeled women chose to hide during their so-called ‘confinement’. When Kate married into the Royal Family, she accepted that her every move would be forensically watched. As such, she will doubtless be cast in the leading role as Queen of the Yummy Mummies. The Duchess can therefore hardly resort to the occasional slummy day like most mothers-to-be — wearing a ‘tent-dress’ to cover a growing tummy, or pulling on a size 14 jumper over maternity jeans. In any case, the figure of the naturally svelte Kate will for some months be considerably slimmer than the average woman’s, so she won’t have to wear maternity clothes for a good while. When she does want to adapt her wardrobe, she can conveniently turn to Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen — her wedding dress designer who is due to have a baby in February. If anyone can make fashionable coats and dresses with a tactfully high waistline, it is her. But more thorny issues will eventually arise — for no one’s decisions are more contentious than a pregnant mother’s. Natural birth (probably) or Caesarean? Home (highly unlikely) or hospital? William and Harry were born in the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s in Paddington, West London. Kate is expected to follow suit by using the private wing of an NHS hospital, and the Lindo has just been refurbished. The private Portland Hospital in central London is the celebrity favourite but doesn’t have the adult  intensive-care facilities of a large teaching hospital. No risks, however tiny, are going to be taken here. Once the birthing suite has been chosen and Kate has a few months on her hands, there will be plenty of other choices to make concerning the care of the newest heir to the throne. The royal nursery at Apartment 1A, Kensington Palace, is probably being refurbished at this moment — overseen by Kate. Among the apartment’s 20 rooms, which once saw late-night louche parties hosted by Princess Margaret, there is plenty of room for live-in maternity nurses and nannies. These might play a less central role than they once did in royal circles, as hands-on parenting will be Kate’s goal, but they will still be on call. They will perhaps be vetted by the upmarket firm Kensington Nannies, which charges a finder’s fee of £2,500, but ideally will come with word-of-mouth recommendations. William and Kate could talk to soon-to-be near neighbours Hugh and Rose van  Cutsem. He is a financial consultant, and their daughter Grace was a bridesmaid at William and Kate’s wedding. Rose had a third child in January. Or they could consult the Duchess of Cornwall’s children, Tom Parker Bowles and Laura Lopes, who both have children and live in West London. Then there is the question of a  Christian name, and several middle names, for the future monarch. If it’s a girl, will Diana be in there somewhere? Or Carole? The chosen moniker will spawn endless imitators, while the Christening will be a national event. William was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace, and we can expect something similar this time. Two tiers of Fiona Cairns’s wedding cake from 2011 are waiting. The role of godparent will be hotly contested. The couple will probably choose five or six from three groups: royal relations, trustworthy Sloane friends and media-savvy celeb types. The obvious choices are, of course, that glamorous pair Pippa Middleton — no one can plan the infant’s parties better, and don’t forget the Baby Shower range from her parents’ firm Party Pieces — and Prince Harry, the racy uncle incarnate. Farther removed but still in the royal running could be a Spencer relation, such as Diana’s brother Charles’s blonde daughter Lady Kitty, or  Princess Beatrice or Eugenie. From the second group, there’s Hugh van Cutsem or his three brothers — long-time pals of Wills and Harry — who are all tall, handsome and  reliable. There are the Waley-Cohens — Gold Cup-winning jockey and dental entrepreneur Sam and his wife Bels — and Thomas van Straubenzee, William’s lively surveyor friend from Ludgrove prep school who is engaged to aristocratic tennis coach Lady Melissa Percy. Family: Who will Kate choose to be godparents to the baby? Sister Pippa Middleton and brother-in-law Prince Harry are likely to be in the running . This tweedy lot can lay down fine wine and polish up the guns for the royal youngster’s first shoot. But if the Cambridges want a ‘fun’ choice, they might ask nightclub owner Guy Pelly or Richard Branson’s daughter Holly, who would ensure a lifetime of discreet holidays at her father’s retreats in Verbier and on Necker Island. In the meantime, there will be no more desirable product placement than on this celebrity royal baby. By Royal Appointment or not, firms will be queueing up to send their cashmere outfits, sheepskin-lined papooses and eco-friendly baby bottles to Kensington Palace, in the hope they may be photographed with the royal tot —  sparking a sell-out in the process. So what will catch Kate’s eye as she flicks through the catalogues? A West London baby can’t show its face without a Bugaboo pram, starting at more than £700. And if any baby should have a top-of-the-range version, with alloy wheels and ‘sports-car fabric’ designed by Viktor & Rolf (at £1,250), surely it’s this one. That said, it would be a shame if the infant did not also have a traditional Silver Cross ‘Balmoral’ pram (yours for a mere £1,450) — the type Prince Charles was wheeled around in by his nanny — for strolls in Kensington Gardens. Handy: The Whole Foods store in Kensington High Street will be handy for Kate to pick up healthy food for her baby . Here, Kate could participate in organised buggy walks (to keep you fit), or she could go to South Kensington for Gymboree — music and play. The vast U.S. retailer Whole Foods Market in Kensington High Street sells all manner of organic baby food, chlorine-free baby wipes and socially acceptable snacks, such as organic rice cakes. Minutes from Kensington Palace, this is the mothership of organic health-food shops — where else for baby’s first mango mash? One of the defining issues for the Duke and Duchess will be where to send Junior to school. West London mothers will be talking of little else for years to come — local applications will spike on the merest rumour. Nurseries and schools will be deciding whether to gently suggest a visit or to wait for the Palace to call. Nurseries within walking distance of Kensington Palace are The Minors in Pembridge Square — William went to the original establishment in Chepstow Villas, then called The Mynors — and Ladbroke Square, a long-established safe haunt of the British upper classes. There is the celebrity-friendly Acorn in Lansdowne Crescent but it is a bit further away and may be a little glitzy for the Cambridges. Education: If it's a boy will Kate send her baby to William's old school Wetherby Prep School Notting Hill, London? Then, after two years in a gingham smock, infant Wales will have a choice of prep schools to scoot to. For single-sex, there is William’s old school, Wetherby in Notting Hill (much more academic now than it ever was in William’s day) and its sister school for girls, Pembridge Hall. Both are familiar paparazzi territory: the school runs have featured Elle Macpherson, Elizabeth Hurley and Claudia Schiffer. Their children have now moved on but the Beckhams went on a tour last week. After drop-off, the mothers who don’t work pile into the coffee shops on Notting Hill Gate, where they discuss each other. The gilded educational establishments their children attend require application at birth, but William and Kate could shock us all and go for a state school such as St Mary Abbot’s, a C of E primary that is probably the closest school to Kensington Palace and attended by the children of David Cameron and Michael Gove. Depending on your viewpoint, sending a Wales there would be admirably unsnobby or the taking up of a place by someone whose family could easily afford to opt out of the state system. Forget George Osborne’s Autumn Statement and manufacturing-output figures. Buggy makers, private schools, and bootee pedlars are all hoping that Little HRH might give the British economy the boost it so badly needs.","Kate's bump itself will become the focus of worldwide attention but what of her choices after the baby is born?

Delighted as she and William undoubtedly are, the duchess’s pregnancy could not have come at a more chaotic time for the royal couple. The duke is about to make one of the biggest decisions of his life so far – whether to extend his time in the RAF or quit to become a full-time working royal. And to make matters worse, the couple still won’t have a permanent home by the time the baby is born early next summer. Home-to-be: An aerial view of Kensington Palace. A flat in the main building will be home to the couple but not until October 2013 . Kate and William’s planned move to their glitzy new apartment in Kensington Palace is now unlikely to take place until October 2013. Contractors refurbishing Apartment 1A, which used to belong to Princess Margaret, have uncovered asbestos which has to be cleared before the couple – let alone a newborn baby – can move in. Sources close to the Cambridges also say the apartment, which has since been used as offices and exhibition space by Historic Royal Palaces, was ‘virtually uninhabitable’ when it was inspected after their wedding last year. When the baby is born Kate and Wills are likely to still be living at Nottingham Cottage but hope to move into Margaret's former apartment as soon as possible . Contractors refurbishing Apartment 1A, which used to belong to Princess Margaret, have uncovered asbestos which has to be cleared before the couple - let alone a newborn baby - can move in . Palace gardens: The statue of Queen Victoria sculpted by her daughter Princess Louise has recently been spruced up at Kensington Palace and is looking as good as new . It has no kitchen or bathroom and needed total rewiring and plastering, none of which could be started until the apartment was fully vacated by the charity’s staff just a few weeks ago. ‘At the moment there is just no way their new home will be inhabitable by the time the baby is born,’ said one. This means that when they become parents, the couple will still be shuttling between their relatively modest rented farmhouse on Anglesey in North Wales, and the two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace. Future parents: Having been married for just 20 months, Kate is to be a mother early next summer . Inside the palace: The King's Grand Staircase, which has recently been restored as part of a £12 million refurbishment . The restored formal gardens: The couple currently have two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace . If the duchess’s health continues to suffer, the couple are also likely to face another major domestic hurdle. William is tied to his base in North Wales for at least the next nine months. But Kate is more than likely to be forced to stay nearly 300 miles away in London – alone – to be closer to her gynaecologist. Kate’s natural desire to be close to her mother, Carole Middleton, may also mean the duchess is more likely to stay in Nottingham Cottage. It is only 50 miles from her parents’ £4.85million home in Bucklebury, Berkshire. And if she stayed in London, Kate would only be a short drive away from the Marylebone hospital where she has been treated since Monday.","Kate and William's planned move to glitzy new apartment 1A in Kensington Palace now unlikely to take place until October 2013 due to asbestos .

"By . Daniel Martin and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 23:58 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:38 EST, 5 December 2012 . Almost £2billion of British taxpayers' money is to be used to pay for climate change projects overseas including wind turbines in Africa and greener cattle farming in Colombia, a Lib Dem minister has claimed. Last night senior Conservatives condemned the size of the bill - equivalent to £70 for every household - with former chancellor Lord Lawson of Blaby attacking the 'appalling waste of money'. But Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, hailed the cash as 'fantastic news'. Today the row threatened to overshadow a . separate move by George Osborne to cut hundreds of millions of pounds . from planned increases in Britain’s foreign aid budget following . complaints from Conservative MPs that it is too lavish. Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced each household will contribute an average of £70 towards schemes to tackle climate change in the third world before March 2015 . The Chancellor is able to scale back . the budget and still meet the Government’s controversial target to . increase aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2014, Whitehall sources told the . Daily Mail. The move is . designed to cheer Conservatives opposed to David Cameron's pledge to . increase foreign aid budgets at a time when the rest of Whitehall is . tightening its belt. But . instead Tories are dismayed at the timing of the Lib Dem announcement . to commit up to £2billion to helping third world countries deal with . climate change. The money is coming from the existing budget of Department for Energy and Climate Change. Mr Davey made the announcement as he arrived at United Nations climate change talks in Doha, Qatar, making Britain the first G7 country to make such a pledge. But the row threatened to overshadow a separate move by George Osborne to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from planned increases in Britain’s foreign aid budget following complaints from Conservative MPs that it is too lavish. At a party at the British Embassy, ministers gave details of £150 million in new projects as part of Britain's £1.8billion in 'climate aid' for poorer countries within three years. Mr Davey said the money should be spent because 'climate change is a global threat and with every passing year, the nature and the extent of that threat grows clearer'. 'We also recognise that the world's poorest will be hit the hardest by the impacts of climate change, and we need to help communities adapt to these challenges,' he said. The UK's package of support includes almost £100million to help to subsidise renewable energy in Africa, such as electricity produced from wind and solar farms. Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP for North East Somerset, said the spending was 'an absolutely classic example of waste' Around £15million will go to help cattle farmers practise 'low carbon agriculture' in Colombia and £14million will help build wind farms and other renewables in Uganda. Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP for North East Somerset, said the spending was 'an absolutely classic example of waste' that should be stopped at a time of austerity. 'All I can say is a fool and his money are soon parted,' he said. 'But it's the British taxpayer having to pay for this absurd expenditure. We know wind farms are all but useless and nobody wants them in England, let alone Africa.' Glyn Davies, a Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, also criticised the level of climate aid spending. 'This can't be the priority for spending when the Coalition government is trying to create jobs and reduce the cost of living,' he said. 'It seems difficult to understand how we can justify this when energy is a huge cost for so many of our households and businesses.' Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, said he thought the spending was 'absolutely crazy' at a time when public services were being cut. But Tracy Carty, a climate change adviser for Oxfam, said: 'At last, a developed country has finally made a pledge for future climate finance here in Doha. The UK has taken a step forward.' The international aid budget has been protected from cuts, after all three parties agreed to increase aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2014. Ironically, the target can now be hit with less money because of lower than expected economic growth. The Coalition’s decision to increase aid spending by to more than £12 billion at a time of austerity at home has divided opinion, with significant numbers of Tory backbenchers arguing the budget is riddled with corruption and waste. Mr Cameron has argued that leading the world boosts Britain’s standing on the world stage, as well as limiting immigration and terror threats that might otherwise emerge from developing nations. However, the new International Development Secretary Justine Greening, a former accountant, has adopted a more sceptical approach than her predecessor Andrew Mitchell. Last month, in what was seen as the beginning of the end of Britain sending billions of pounds in foreign aid to better-off countries, she announced that a controversial £280 million-a-year aid programme to India is to be brought to an end. International Development Secretary Justine Greening, a former accountant, has taken a tougher approach to foreign aid spending . Tory MPs had pointed out that India’s economy is growing at the rate of eight per cent a year, meaning it is now able to spend vast sums on defence and has its own space programme. India now even has its own overseas aid programme, worth £328 million a year. But under Labour, India became the biggest net recipient of British aid, receiving £421 million in 2010. Despite India’s rapid economic development, Mr Mitchell decided to approve a further £1.1 billion in aid over the following four years. Last week, Miss Greening also suspended a £21 million aid payment to Rwanda following warnings that its Government was arming a rebellion in the Congo. Sources said Mr Osborne remained committed to hitting the target to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2014. But slower than expected economic growth means the big planned increases in the aid budget are now due to ‘overshoot’ the target - a situation which the Chancellor believes cannot be justified at a time of cutbacks at home. Over the next two years, the aid budget is expected to be reined in by almost £1 billion as a result.","Each household will contribute an average of £70 towards schemes .

Outcry: Starbucks will pay about £10million in tax this year after it was accused of acting 'immorally' when it emerged that it has paid no corporation tax in 14 of the past 15 years . After paying no tax at all for 14 of the last 15 years Starbucks has finally caved in to pressure and will now hand over £10million to the Treasury. The US-owned coffee chain, with annual sales of £400million in Britain, has been accused by MPs of acting ‘immorally’ after it emerged that it has hardly paid corporation tax since opening its first shop in the UK. But its decision, after it admitted 'it needed to do more' on tax in the UK, may not placate boycotting consumers unhappy about its financial position. The company grips one third of the UK coffee market but recorded no taxable profits last year and so did not have to pay any corporation tax. Since 1998 the company has enjoyed £3billion in sales. Although their new payment of up to £10million will be seen as a victory for the Government, it is only a tiny proportion of the amount of cash Starbucks generates in the UK. It is understood that the coffee shop has based its proposed tax bill on rival Costa. Two years ago Costa paid around £15million on profits from its 1,500 shops, and this will probably rise by another £3million this year. Starbucks has nearly 750 stores so is likely to confirm later this week that it will pay around half or slightly more what Costa paid. It is also certain that if the business continues to thrive, they will pay tax every year going forward, it has emerged. Starbucks say no deal has been done and maintains its business has not been profitable. 'We have invested more than £200million in our UK business over the past 12 years. Starbucks has complied with all the tax laws in this country but has regretfully not been as profitable as we would have liked,' a spokesman said. 'We have listened to feedback from our customers and employees, and understand that to maintain and further build public trust we need to do more. 'As part of this we are looking at our tax approach in the UK. The company has been in discussions with HMRC for some time and is also in talks with The Treasury. We will release more details tomorrow'. Other multinationals with large operations in Britain, including Amazon and Google, have faced intense criticism in recent weeks over their minuscule UK tax bills.They could be next to agree a deal. Freebies: A Starbucks worker hands out hot chocolate to cold shoppers in London's Oxford street today but the public are upset about the lack of tax they have paid . The Commons Public Accounts Committee said it found Starbucks' figures ‘difficult to believe’. The chain is still facing a boycott, which was backed by the Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander. He . and the Chancellor have now announced plans for a £10billion crackdown . on tax-dodging by corporations and wealthy individuals. On Sunday Starbucks confirmed it had opened talks with HM Revenue and Customs on its tax affairs, saying it ‘needed to do more’ on tax in the UK. 'Name and shame': MP Margaret Hodge called on ministers to reveal firms that were not paying their fair share and suggested that the Government should back boycotts like the one facing Starbucks . It also emerged that the company is preparing to change a controversial arrangement under which it sends 4.7 per cent of its turnover to the Netherlands, where it enjoys a special low tax rate. The move is expected to result in the firm recording taxable profits in this country. Crackdown plans: Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander is backing a boycott on Starbucks and other companies accused of avoiding tax . Starbucks is expected to make a detailed statement on the changes later this week. The news emerged as the Public Accounts . Committee released a devastating report on HMRC’s handling of the tax . affairs of major corporations. MPs said Starbucks and fellow major . multinationals Amazon and Google have contributed to a £32billion tax . gap between the amount HMRC is due and the amount it receives, thanks to . legal ruses that slash their tax liability in this country. The committee’s Labour chairman . Margaret Hodge called on ministers to ‘name and shame’ firms that are . not paying their fair share, and suggested that the Government should . back boycotts. Warning that . corporation tax was in danger of ‘becoming voluntary’, she said: ‘At . the moment it’s a bit like David and Goliath, with the companies being . supported by very experienced, highly-paid accountants and lawyers. 'We . want to up the game from HMRC. I think they can take more cases to . court.’ She added: ‘We can say we won’t buy from companies. I think it’s good citizenship.’ Mr .

The raiders sneaked into 11 country mansions in the dead of of night while their owners were asleep so they could take the keys to their prestige motors. One five-year-old girl who disturbed the burglars woke up her mother and told her: 'Mummy, they’re monsters in the house' only to be sent back to bed and assured she was dreaming. The mother later discovered the family car was missing. Jailed: Liam Hanbury (left), Paul Holden (centre) and Damian Royle (right) stole luxury cars worth more than £500,000 from rural homes across East Lancashire and sold them on Auto Trader . Caught on CCTV: The trio, pictured with an unknown fourth person, outside one of the 11 country mansions they targeted during their crime spree in March and April last year . The gang were in and out of victims’ homes within a matter of seconds before stealing a range of luxury cars including a Ferrari, an Audi R8, an Audi Q7, a BMW X5, a Bentley Continental, a Range Rover Sport and a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. They also planned to steal other luxury motors including a Bentley convertible, an Audi R8 V8 and an Audi Q7, all from the garage of one home in Bolton- by-Bowland, Lancashire. On the same night, the gang were due to target a house in in Skipton, North Yorkshire for a Maserati and a Ferrari kept in a garage along with a Ducati motorcycle and three Triumph motorbikes. But the three man gang were arrested following a long and protracted investigation during a police operation in which officers matched their DNA to the scene of a break-in the village of Trawden, Lancashire. 'Serious and organised crime': The raiders stole the keys to top-of-range motors by sneaking into homes at the dead of night while the owners were asleep . Stealth tactics: Burnley Crown Court heard tools were often used to break through doors and windows . Home invaders: One five-year-old girl who disturbed the burglars told her mother 'they're monsters in the house' only to be told to go back to bed . Detectives estimated the gang targeted cars worth £1.13m - stealing motors worth £543,000. Only one stolen car was recovered having been cut into pieces, while it was suspected the others had fitted with false identification details and sold on. At Burnley Crown Court, career criminals Damian Royle, 29, of Odsal, Bradford; Paul Holden, 32, of Wyke, Bradford and Liam Hanbury, 30, of Shipley, Bradford, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary. Hanbury and Royle were jailed for five years and Holden was given 40 months. The court heard the gang travelled into rural areas across East Lancashire at night time last March and April 2011. They broke into 11 homes and stole keys to the cars in Briercliffe, Bolton by Bowland, Whitworth, Slaidburn, Fence, Langho, Rimmington and Bacup. High-end heist: A Ferrari like this one was among the vehicles stolen by the gang . 'Very high rewards': The gang were in and out of victims' homes within a matter of seconds before stealing a range of luxury cars including an Audi R8 (above, file picture) Police were on their tail: The gang was arrested after they stole the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution like the one pictured from a house Bacup, Lancashire . Ferrari . Audi R8 . Audi Q7 . BMW X5 . Bentley Continental . Range Rover Sport . Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution . Benjamin Lawrence, prosecuting, said tools were often used to break through doors and windows, with the intention of pinching keys to high-value vehicles. In almost all the burglaries, the occupants were at home. The prosecutor said: 'The defendants were linked by telephone evidence showing their movements. Also the fact that at one of the houses a balaclava belonging to Liam Hanbury was left at the scene. 'A mobile phone belonging to Paul Holden was left at the scene and a mobile phone which was stolen was recovered at Damien Royle’s address.' The gang was arrested after they stole the Mitsubishi from Bacup and went to Trawden where they were seen loitering outside a house. They ran off, abandoning the car, and the balaclava was dropped. Mr Lawrence said: 'A very limited amount of property was recovered. There is some evidence of vehicles being sold on Auto Trader. One was recovered having been cut into pieces, but for the most part the property was not recovered.' Ill-gotten gains: The total value of the stolen cars, which also included a BMW X5 like this one, was nearly £550,000 . Stylish: A Bentley Continental like the one pictured here was also among the cars taken by the gang (picture posed by models) In their sights: The gang also planned to steal other luxury motors including a Bentley convertible, an Audi R8 V8 and an Audi Q7 (like the one pictured above), all from the garage of one home in Lancashire . Passing sentence Judge Jonathan Gibson said : 'You don’t need me to tell you this was serious and organised crime, with potentially very high rewards for those who were playing leading roles. 'The vehicles that you stole appear to have been disposed of more or less without trace and it’s clear certain individuals were making a great deal of money out of what was going on.' After the case, Det Con Martin Legdon from Burnley CID said: 'These men deliberately travelled into Lancashire with the intention of breaking into people’s homes to steal high value and luxury cars. 'It’s been a long and complex investigation which has involved months of evidence gathering and I am pleased with the result.

He added: 'There is a great deal that people can do to significantly reduce the likelihood of being a victim of ‘car-key’ burglary.

A Europe wide student group plans to launch legal action claiming Facebook has not done enough to protect the privacy of its hundreds of millions of members. Privacy campaign group europe-v-facebook, which has been lobbying for better data protection by Facebook for over a year, said it planned to take legal action in Ireland, where Facebook has its international headquarters. The move is one of a number of campaigns against the giants of the internet, which are under pressure from investors to generate more revenue from their huge user bases but which also face criticism for storing and sharing personal information. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's firm is facing legal action in Ireland over its privacy policies . Internet search engine Google, for example, has been told by the European Union to make changes to its new privacy policy, which pools data collected on individual users across its services including YouTube, gmail and social network Google+, and from which users cannot opt out. Europe-v-facebook has won some concessions from Facebook, notably pushing it to switch off its facial recognition feature in Europe. But the group said on Tuesday the changes did not go far enough and it was disappointed with the response of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which had carried out an audit after the campaign group filed numerous complaints. 'The Irish obviously have no great political interest in going up against these companies because they're so dependent on the jobs they create,' europe-v-facebook founder Max Schrems told Reuters. Gary Davies, Ireland's deputy data protection commissioner, denied Facebook's investment in Ireland had influenced regulation of the company. 'We have handled this in a highly professional and focused way and we have brought about huge changes in the way Facebook handles personal data,' he told Reuters. 'We are committed to providing a service that enables millions of European citizens to connect and share with their friends here and around the world,' Said Facebook. 'The way Facebook Ireland handles European personal data has been subject to thorough review by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner over the past year. 'The two detailed reports that the DPC has produced by the DPC demonstrate that Facebook Ireland complies with European data protection principles and Irish law. 'Nonetheless we have some vocal critics who will never be happy whatever we do and whatever the DPC concludes.' Schrems, who has filed 22 complaints with the Irish regulator, said more than 40,000 Facebook users who had requested a copy of the data Facebook was holding on them had not received anything several months after making a request. The law student also questioned why Facebook had only switched off facial recognition for users in the European Union, even though Ireland is the headquarters for all of Facebook's users outside the United States and Canada. The move is the latest in a series of concerns over Facebook's privacy policies . Facebook is under pressure to reverse a trend of slowing revenue growth by selling more valuable advertising, which requires better profiling of its users. Investors are losing patience with the social network, whose shares have dropped 40 percent in value since the company's record-breaking $104 billion initial public offering in May. Last month, Facebook proposed to combine its user data with that of its recently acquired photo-sharing service Instagram, loosen restrictions on emails between its members and share data with other businesses and affiliates that it owns. Ireland also hosts the European headquarters of other high-tech firms including Microsoft and Google thanks to generous tax breaks. Europe-v-facebook said it believed its Irish lawsuit had the potential to become a test case for data protection law and had a good chance of landing up in the European Court of Justice. Schrems said the case could cost the group around 100,000 euros ($130,000), which it hoped to raise via crowd-funding - money provided by a collection of individuals - on the Internet. A U.S. judge has given his . preliminary approval to a second attempt by Facebook to settle a . class action lawsuit which charges the social networking company with . violating privacy rights. U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in California rejected a settlement in . August over Facebook's 'Sponsored Stories' advertising feature, . questioning why it did not award money to Facebook members for using . their personal information. But . in a ruling handed down Monday, Seeborg said a revised settlement 'falls within the range of possible approval as fair, reasonable and . adequate.' In a revised . proposal, Facebook and plaintiff lawyers said users now could claim a . cash payment of up to $10 each to be paid from a $20 million total . settlement fund. Any money remaining would then go to charity. The . company also said it would engineer a new tool to enable users to view . content that might have been displayed in Sponsored Stories and opt out . if they desire, a court document said. If . it receives final approval, the proposed settlement would resolve a . 2011 lawsuit originally filed by five Facebook Inc members. The . lawsuit alleged the Sponsored Stories feature violated California law . by publicizing users' 'likes' of certain advertisers without paying them . or giving them a way to opt out. The case involved over 100 million . potential class members. A . spokesman for Facebook said the company was 'pleased that the court has . granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement.'

A missing 13-year-old girl from Pennsylvania has been found at a bus station in Washington D.C. with a 20-year-old man she met online. Savanna Marie MacMullett was last seen by her parents at 4pm on Monday when she told them she was heading out for an after-school activity. They reported her missing on Tuesday. Just hours later, she was tracked down in Washington D.C. with Ashley Ryan Hareford, 20, after her parents had told police she might have run off with him. Authorities also received an anonymous tip that . the pair were seen boarding a Megabus to Washington D.C. and, when they . arrived at their destination at 7pm, U.S. Marshals were waiting. Together: Thirteen-year-old Savanna MacMullett, left, was found with 20-year-old Ashley Ryan Hareford . The MacMulletts had discovered her friendship with Hareford, from Grottoes, Virginia, after they saw him lurking outside their home in Radnor, Pennsylvania on Sunday night. After alerting police, who did not arrest Hareford, the concerned parents learned from their daughter that she knew the man and that he had hitchhiked 280 miles to see her, the Delco Times reported. Hareford was arrested in D.C. without incident and is facing a charge of corruption of minors. Detectives from Radnor headed to the city on Tuesday night to interview him and to bring MacMullett home. She is now being evaluated for 'any medical or mental issues'. Relationship: Savanna had met Hareford, pictured, online and they shared public posts on Facebook . Grooming: Hareford had an 'interesting' history of looking for girls online, police said. In a photograph he uploaded to Facebook on December 1, right, he is seen kissing an unidentified girl . 'Our top priority is to make sure she is . on good medical and psychological condition,' Radnor Police Lt. Christopher Flanagan said at a Tuesday night press conference. Flanagan said that Hareford has a history of trying to pick up girls online, so he has 'significant concerns about his intentions'. Authorities indicate more serious charges will be filed against Hareford, the Delco Times reported. 'I was so glad,' Savanna's great aunt Mary DeWees told WPVI after the girl was found. 'I couldn't believe it. It was just so scary knowing she was missing and it's just amazing that . they found her.' Her father, Thomas MacMullett, also expressed his relief. He had previously told reporters he was 'very scared' for his daughter's safety and found Hareford’s interest in a 13-year-old girl 'disgusting'. 'Obsessed': Ashley Hareford dedicated numerous posts to Savanna MacMullett on his Facebook page . Outspoken: On another Facebook page apparently belonging to Hareford, he writes: 'I love you baby' He added that he was shocked she had run off - as her sister, then 14, had done the same with a 28-year-old man in New Jersey. He later returned the girl. '[Savanna] was so mad at her sister for doing it and I just can't believe she did the same,' he told reporters at a press conference earlier this week. He said that Savanna and Hareford communicated publicly on a Facebook page he had set up. 'It seems like it's just him and her on . that Facebook page,' he said. 'It's . almost like a memorial dedicated specifically to the two of them. It's . kind of creepy.' The couple are vocal about their relationship on Facebook, with Hareford dedicating many posts to MacMullett on the page. Anger: her father, Thomas MacMullett, called Hareford's interest in a 13-year-old girl 'disgusting' One reads: 'I have 3 sides: 1.) The quiet, sweet side. 2. The fun and crazy side. 3. The side you never want to see', adding: 'So true!!! Savanna Marie u know this for a fact.' He has used social media before to try . to meet girls; on DateHookup.com, Hareford said he's a guy . looking for a 'bi emo girl or sexy straight country girl', the Philadelphia Daily News reported. His social networking pages list his interests as raves and drugs, and claim he is 'married'. He also writes he attended the 'The Juggalo University of Murder' - a reference to the band, Insane Clown Posse, whose fans call themselves Juggalos.","Savanna MacMullett found at bus stop in Washington D.C. with Ashley Ryan Hareford, who she 'met on Facebook'

The Chancellor will plough billions of pounds into building projects – including the extension of the controversial High Speed 2 line to the north of England. George Osborne hopes that spending money on new buildings and transport projects will help the stumbling economy get going. He used his Autumn Statement to unveil £5billion plans to improve key sections of the A1 and the M25, and extend the London Underground. High speed trains will connect London to to Manchester and Leeds, via Birmingham, in what ministers hope will bring an economic boost for the north . The government pledged billions of pounds for rail and road schemes across the country which it claimed will kickstart local economies . And another 120,000 new homes will be built in a bid to tackle the chronic shortage of housing. However, this will prove controversial as some may have to be built on green belt land. Science will also benefit – with an extra £600million for new research facilities. The Chancellor said: ‘Taken together, this is a revolution in the sources of finances for upgrading Britain’s infrastructure and equipping Britain to win the global race. ‘Annual average infrastructure investment, which was £29billion under the last Labour government, is now £33billion.’ He said that swingeing cuts in Whitehall departments will be diverted to capital projects. ‘All . the money saved in the first two years will be re-invested as part of a . £5billion capital investment in the infrastructure of our country,’ he . said. ‘So despite the . fiscal challenges we face, public investment as a share of GDP will be . higher on average in this Parliament than it was under the last Labour . government. Key stretches of the M25 (left) will be upgraded while single lane stretches of the A30 in Cornwall (right) will become a dual-carriageway to ease jams on the main road used by holidaymakers . ‘It’s exactly what equipping Britain to compete in the modern global economy should be doing.’ Mr Osborne announced an extra billion pounds into roads, including four major schemes. These are upgrades to key sections of the A1, bringing the route from London to Newcastle up to motorway standard. In further efforts to get the country moving, the government announced a second wave of 'super-connected' cities to be given super-fast broadband. The 12 smaller cities announced today are in addition to the ten larger cities that are sharing £114million. The second wave will share £50 million with plans to offer speeds of up to 100Mbps (megabits per second) to homes and businesses. The winning cities in the second wave are:  Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Coventry, Derby, Oxford, Portsmouth, Salford, and York in England; Aberdeen and Perth in Scotland; Newport in Wales; and Derry/Londonderry in Northern Ireland. The A5 will be linked to the M1, and . the A30 in Cornwall will be turned into a dual carriageway. And the M25 . will be upgraded to support the biggest port developments in Europe. RAC technical director David Bizley said: 'It is good news an extra £1bn is to be spent on roads, including four major new schemes to upgrade key sections of the A1, bringing the route from London to Newcastle up to motorway standard, link the A5 with the M1, dual the A30 in Cornwall and upgrade the M25. 'These important improvements will make a real difference to the lives of thousands of motorists every day.' The . multi-billion-pound HS2 rail line, which is already confirmed from . London to Birmingham, is hugely controversial because it will plough up . miles of beautiful countryside. Opponents say it is not worth the huge cost because it will not shave enough time off the journey time between the two cities. Now it is to be extended to the north in two branches – one to Manchester and another to Leeds. George Osborne leaves the Treasury with Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, on his way to deliver the half-yearly budget statement to Parliament . Extension: Money is being allocated for two more stops on the London Underground Northern Line . The Chancellor added: ‘We’ve already set out plans this autumn for a huge investment . in rail, and my right honourable friend the Transport Secretary [Patrick . McLoughlin] will set out in the new year plans to take High Speed 2 to . the north west and West Yorkshire.’ Mr Osborne also confirmed a . billion-pound loan and a guarantee to extend London’s Northern Line to . Battersea Power Station and support a new development on the site which . will be a ‘similar scale to the Olympic Park’. ‘We’re confirming funding and reforms to assist construction of up to 120,000 new homes and delivering on flood defence schemes in more cities,’ he said. And he announced funding for broadband expansion in 12 smaller cities – Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Coventry, Derby, Oxford, Portsmouth, Salford, York, Newport, Aberdeen, Perth and Londonderry. Mr Osborne pledged £600million more for the UK’s scientific research infrastructure. And he said he would guarantee for up to £40billion more private-sector capital spending on infrastructure – so that the public sector shares the risk.","Jam-busting projects for M23, A1 and A30 aims to get the regions moving .

Death sentence: Ex-cop Manuel Pardo is set to be executed next week after an appeal was denied . An ex-cop, languishing on death row for a string of murders committed during the 1980s, is set to be executed next week after his  latest appeal was denied. Manuel Pardo, 56, and his partner Rolando Garcia committed nine murders as they ripped-off drug dealers before killing anyone capable of implicating them in the crimes. At his trial in 1988, Pardo went against the advice of his lawyers and confessed saying his victims were drug dealers who 'have no right to live' and that he was ridding the streets of the 'scum of the earth'. At Florida's Supreme Court his lawyers argued that the former highway patrolman, Scout leader and decorated Navy veteran was insane at the time of the crimes. They also claimed the state’s new method of lethal injection, a cocktail of three drugs, would result in a painful death amounting to 'cruel and unusual' punishment. However in a unanimous decision the state rejected the appeals and his execution was scheduled for December 11. Florida Supreme Court denied claims Pardo was insane at the time of the murders or that lethal injection would amount to cruel and unusual punishment . During the 1990s Pardo was dubbed the .

Former chairman of HBOS Lord Stevenson infuriated MPs by saying reckless lending was not his fault . The former chairman of HBOS yesterday washed his hands of blame for the bank’s collapse. Lord Stevenson, who earned £815,000 a year in pay and perks, infuriated MPs and peers by saying reckless lending was not his fault because he was ‘only there part-time’. The politicians accused him of ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ and showed him a damning letter in which he had admitted he was legally responsible for the business. He is the latest HBOS executive to be hauled in front the Parliamentary commission on banking standards and was questioned for more than three hours yesterday. The Scottish-born businessman, described as one of the forgotten men at the centre of the financial crisis, was chairman of HBOS from May 2001 until its downfall seven years later. He had close links to the New Labour government and is a friend of former spin chief Lord Mandelson. His marathon testimony – in which he appeared increasingly rattled and started to lose his voice – was described as ‘evasive, unrealistic and repetitive’. Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, accused his fellow peer of having a selective memory when he repeatedly claimed to have forgotten key details. Once Britain’s biggest mortgage provider, HBOS was rescued by Lloyds in September 2008 after a reckless lending spree that lasted for most of the last decade. But the toxic loans on HBOS’s books crippled Lloyds, triggering a £20billion bailout from taxpayers several weeks later. Lord Stevenson repeatedly rejected suggestions from the banking commission’s chairman that the loans were ‘incompetent’. He said: ‘There was a lot of mistaken lending. I wasn’t there in the trenches with the people making the decisions – I was only there at the most part-time.’ He then conceded that the bank’s top brass ‘missed a trick’ in its corporate lending division. This remark infuriated Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the commission, who pointed out that £26billion – roughly two-thirds of the amount businesses pay in corporation tax each year – had ‘gone down the Swannee’. The Tory MP added: ‘Millions have lost out on what they thought they’d get for their pensions. Almost three million shareholders have almost been wiped out – and taxpayers are going to be paying for this for a very long time.’ Lord Stevenson tried to retract his comment by replacing ‘missed a trick’ with ‘missed an avalanche’. Toxic loans on HBOS's books crippled Lloyds, pictured, which rescued HBOS in 2008, triggering a £20billion bailout from taxpayers . Mr Tyrie brandished a letter Lord Stevenson wrote to the Financial Services Authority in January 2008, a few months before HBOS was swallowed  up by Lloyds. In it he had written: ‘I can understand a mindset which regards a “non executive chairman” as sailing above the battle, not concerned with the detailed day-to-day realities. Can I make it plain that I do not regard myself as that kind of chairman. ‘I am legally responsible for the business and with the modesty for which I am not famous regard myself as being knowledgeable and well briefed.’ Lord Stevenson had close links to the New Labour government and is a friend of former spin chief Lord Mandelson, pictured . Yesterday he insisted his biggest mistake was failing to anticipate the credit crunch, when banks were starved of funds because they had become nervous about lending to each other. But Lord Lawson, chancellor to Margaret Thatcher and father of TV chef Nigella, said: ‘You are living in cloud cuckoo land. You were responsible for a strategy of reckless growth and that is what led you into difficulties. ‘When the details seem to suit your . defence they appear to miraculously pop back into your memory.’ Lord . Stevenson’s lack of contrition angered Justin Welby, the Archbishop of . Canterbury-elect. He said he was ‘baffled’ by the inability to recognise . the ‘complete failure of culture and strategy’ which ‘led to a bank . being wiped out’. Referring to Lord Stevenson’s insistence on blaming the credit crunch for the collapse of HBOS, the church leader said: ‘It is like someone who has a fatal heart attack at home and is in a car crash on the way to hospital. And the car crash is then blamed as the cause of death.’ Lord Stevenson responded: ‘We were not aware until late in 2008 that we were suffering from a heart attack.’ The showdown came the day after former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby apologised for the first time for the collapse and said he was ‘horrified’ by the misery inflicted on taxpayers and ex-colleagues. But he sparked further controversy by admitting he had sold two-thirds of his shares in the two years before the financial crisis. Lord Stevenson’s apology came only at the end of his long testimony. He said: ‘I am extremely sorry it happened. I am extremely sorry that employees got hit, taxpayers got hit and shareholders got hit. There are few days when I don’t think about this.’ Taxpayers are sitting on a £7.5billion paper loss on the Lloyds shares bought by the Government. Meanwhile millions of investors and pension savers have seen their nest eggs destroyed. Lloyds has been forced to write off almost £50billion in bad loans made by HBOS – twice as much as any other bank, including Royal Bank of Scotland. This includes £26billion in risky loans to businesses and property entrepreneurs made by the bank’s corporate lending division. Peter Cummings,  who ran the operation, remains the only HBOS executive to be punished. In September, the Financial Services Authority fined him £500,000 and imposed a lifetime ban on his working in the City. 'Upset': Sir James Crosby sold off two-thirds of his shares before the lender followed . The man who ran HBOS sold off two-thirds of his shares before the lender folded. Sir James Crosby made the admission in a humiliating appearance before the Parliamentary banking commission. The shares were cashed in in the two years before the bank failed in 2008. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the commission, told him: ‘You managed to get out before the  crash – you sold two-thirds of your shares’. Sir James, chief executive from 2001 to 2006, replied: ‘In effect yes – but not knowingly. I was essentially balancing my portfolio of assets.’ Mr Tyrie countered: ‘You sold two-thirds of  your holdings at a time when messages were getting increasingly strident about the company you just left ... you were busy bailing out of it.’ The disgraced banker, who went on to become deputy chairman of the City watchdog, also faced calls to give up his knighthood as he admitted ‘incompetent lending’ led to the collapse of HBOS. Forced to account for his actions for the first time on Monday, he told the Parliamentary commission on banking standards he was ‘horrified’ by what happened to colleagues and taxpayers. Asked what he was apologising for, he responded: ‘I’m apologising for the fact that I played a major part in building a  business that failed.’ He added: ‘I wasn’t there for the last few years but it would be wrong to disassociate myself from what happened. ‘I was horrified and deeply upset by what happened – it was hugely distressing to see what happened to shareholders, colleagues and taxpayers.’ He walked away from HBOS with a £572,000 retirement income, having accumulated more than £8million in bonuses in his last five years.","Lord Stevenson says reckless lending not his fault as 'only there part time'

Crematorium staff put the remains of babies in cardboard boxes and secretly buried them in an unmarked grave for 45 years, it emerged today. Officials at the council-run Mortonhall . Crematorium in Edinburgh have admitted stillborn infants or babies who died days after being born were unceremoniously disposed of in this way since 1967. Edinburgh City Council is now investigating the practice, which went unchecked for almost 45 years until new management took over the site last year. Dorothy Maitland, the mother of one baby cremated at Mortonhall, was told by the new manager that 'laziness or a bad attitude' was likely to blame. Grieving mother: Dorothy Maitland, pictured at Mortonhall Cemetery, where her baby Kaelen's ashes are buried . Grieving parents who took their babies to the site were told after the cremation that there was nothing left to scatter. But . the remains were actually being placed in boxes and interred in an . unmarked pit in a garden of remembrance behind the crematorium. It is not known how many babies were buried in this way. The council said it is now looking into installing a memorial in the garden of remembrance as a 'mark of respect'. The discovery was made by Sands Lothian, a charity which counsel parents who have lost a child through stillbirth or neonatal death. Edinburgh City Council has launched an investigation and environmental services convener, councillor Lesley Hinds, has offered a full apology. Helen Henderson, 43, works at the charity and her son Nathan died in 2004 when he was just one day old. She was told she could not have her son’s ashes and later discovered Nathan’s remains were dumped in a mass grave in a biodegradable box. Helen, from Edinburgh, said: 'On the day of my son’s cremation I went to get his ashes and was told there wasn’t any. 'Now I know there were ashes and they lied to me. That was over eight years ago. It opens up the raw emotions again and is very upsetting. 'I want to know why they felt they had to do this. Somebody needs to be held accountable.' Lied to: Helen Henderson, whose son Nathan Harrower died at one day old in 2004, was told there were no ashes to scatter . Unmarked graves: It is not known how many babies were buried in a mass unmarked grave at Edinburgh Mortonhall Crematorium's garden of remembrance . Officials at Sands Lothian made the discovery while writing a book about parents whose babies are stillborn or die shortly after being born. During research they found only some parents were given ashes and discovered the practice in place at the crematorium. Dorothy Maitland, the charity’s operations manager, discovered the ashes of daughter Kaelen had been interred in the ground at Mortonhall. Apology: Councillor Lesley Hinds said the council will look into a memorial for the garden . But 26 years earlier she was told there would be nothing for her to collect after the funeral. Dorothy, 56, said: 'It’s come as a complete shock to me. For years I have had nowhere to go to put flowers, or grieve for Kaelen. 'The new manager at the crematorium has told me the only reason he can think why this happened in the past was either laziness or a bad attitude. 'We need to know how many babies’ ashes are buried there. My fear is that some kind of moral judgement was made and it was only babies who survived for a few days before dying who were buried, so who knows what happened to the ashes of those stillborn?' It is feared the number of babies buried in this way could run into the hundreds. The practice is understood to have been accepted policy at the crematorium from its opening in 1967 until last year following the arrival of a new manager. It is not known whether the policy was devised by one official acting alone or approved by more senior managers at the local authority. Mortonhall’s new manager has changed the policy so all parents who wish to receive the ashes of their babies now receive them. Councillor Hinds said there was no indication of whether legal action was likely but it is doing 'everything possible' to find an explanation. She said: 'We will be truthful about what’s happened and we will look into a memorial for the garden. 'We will also be making doubly sure people are now happy with the policy we have in operation and that they are getting the right information and choices.'","Process at Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh uncovered by parent charity Sands Lothian .

Unions declared war on ministers today after George Osborne gave schools the power to reward better teachers with higher pay. The Chancellor said heads should be able to pay teachers more if they perform better in the job than colleagues. But NASUWT, the largest teaching union, branded the proposals as 'unfair' – and said the major unions would be meeting in the next few days to consider their response. Collision course: Mr Osborne faces a backlash from unions, who branded the proposals 'unfair' (file image) Mr Osborne said national pay bargaining for civil servants, prison officers and NHS staff will continue – meaning staff will all continue to be paid the same. But he told MPs that there will be greater flexibility for headteachers – giving them more ability to pay good staff more. He also announced in his Autumn Statement speech that there will be £1billion more money to expand good schools and build 100 more. And he confirmed that education will be the only department, along with the NHS, which will not suffer further cuts. At the moment, teachers get a blanket rise set by Whitehall. Heads only have the discretion to award good teachers better pay if they are on the upper pay scale. For most teachers, the assumption is . that they will get the Whitehall-sanctioned rise only if the head makes a . very strong case against. Under Mr Osborne’s changes, headteachers will be given almost complete freedom to vary pay rates across all pay grades. Academies and free schools already have this complete discretion. Chancellor George Osborne tells MPs in his Autumn Statement today that headteachers will be given the power to pay teachers more if they perform better in the job than colleagues . Mr Osborne has in the past raised the . possibility of scrapping national pay bargaining for public sector staff . – a plan condemned by the unions and also his Lib Dem coalition . partners. This would mean . that people would be able to be paid less in regions where it is cheaper . to live, and where the local private sector pays less. The Chancellor asked official pay review bodies to consider the plans for regional pay bargaining, or 'market-facing pay' as he prefers to call it. He has accepted their advice that national pay arrangements will be continued in the NHS and Prison Service, and also for civil servants. But Mr Osborne said there would be changes for teachers. He said: 'The School Teachers' Review body does recommend much greater freedom to individual schools to set pay in line with performance. 'My right honourable friend the Education Secretary [Michael Gove] will set out how this will be implemented.' The announcement will be hugely unpopular with the unions and could spark yet more industrial action in England's schools. Chris Keates (pictured), general secretary of NASUWT, said the pay proposals would be 'bad for children's education' However, the Chancellor appears to have dropped plans for regional pay bargaining for schools – meaning that a teacher in the north east will not be paid less than one in the south east. Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT, said: 'The war on teachers waged by the Coalition government continues. 'These proposals place virtually unlimited discretion on teachers' pay in the hands of headteachers at a time when unfairness and discrimination are already rife. 'The dismantling of the national pay framework is going to be bad for children's education and bad for the teaching profession.' He added: 'The NASUWT and the NUT, representing 9 out of 10 teachers, will be meeting in the next few days to consider our response to this very serious development which is at the heart of our trade dispute with the Secretary of State.' Mr Osborne said that while most government departments will have to shoulder greater cuts, the schools budget will be exempted, along with the NHS. These spending cuts to raise money for building projects, including more money for the construction of 100 new schools and academies. He said: 'Since improving our education system is the best investment in a competitive economy, I am today committing £270million to fund improvements in further education colleges and £1billion to expand good schools and build 100 new free schools and academies.' The Chancellor commended Michael Gove's Department for Education for making more savings in bureaucracy than other departments, allowing lots more money to be re-diverted to the front line. 'If all departments reduced their spending on administration in line with the best-performing departments like Education and Communities and Local Government, then another £1billion could be saved,' he said. Mr Osborne said that while departmental resource budgets would be reduced by 1 per cent next year and 2 per cent the year after, education and health would be exempted. 'We will continue to seek efficiency savings in the NHS and in our schools, but that money will be recycled to protect spending in these priority areas,' he said. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, said: 'Teachers are to be singled out, selected to become the guinea pigs in the Chancellor's ill-advised public sector pay experiment. 'Today the government has given the green light to all schools to set the salaries of their teachers. This is a harsh decision – teachers are already suffering financial hardship having endured a lengthy pay freeze. 'Now schools will be able to choose how to pay individual staff according to notoriously unreliable measurements of “performance”. 'This kind of individualised pay will lead to division within staff rooms as teacher is set against teacher. Parents and pupils will suffer too as valuable time and resources are wasted on this divisive approach.'","Chancellor gives heads power to reward teachers if they perform better than their colleagues .

Many of Britain’s most famous and traditional snack brands, from KP Nuts to Hula Hoops and Skips, have been sold to the Germans for a reported £500 million. KP Snacks, which can trace its roots back to a Yorkshire food business established in 1853, is being sold along with its UK factories and 1,500 staff to Intersnack. The brand, which was originally established in Rotherham and known as Kenyon Produce, has been owned by Britain’s United Biscuits(UB) since 1968. Salty sale: KP Nuts is one of the brands under KP Snacks which has been sold to a German firm in a deal thought to be worth more than £500 million . Yesterday, UB said it was selling KP for an undisclosed sum, believed to be in the region of £500 million, to Intersnack, which already owns a number of snack brands including Pom-Bear, Penn State and Percy Dalton’s. Intersnack, which is based in Duesseldorf, insisted that it is keen to maintain production in the UK, where KP is the second biggest snack brand behind Walkers. The sale includes some of Britain’s best loved snacks including McCoy's, Hula Hoops, KP Nuts, Space Raiders, Nik Naks, Wheat Crunchies, Skips, Phileas Fogg, Discos, Roysters, Choc Dips, Brannigans, Frisps, KP Crisps, KP Mini Chips and Cheese Footballs. KP is just the latest in a list of iconic British food brands to have been gobbled up by foreign owners. Made in Britain: New owners Intersnack wants to maintain production of crisps Hula Hoops and McCoy's in the UK . There was a huge backlash when Cadbury was sold to Kraft of the USA, which then reneged on a promise to keep a key British factory open. KP stands for Kenyon Produce and was founded in 1853. It started as a confectionary, jams and pickles producer before moving on to nuts and later snacks. The company was bought by United Biscuits in 1968 and now has three factories in the UK. It makes some of Britain’s best-selling snacks including KP Nuts, Hula Hoops, McCoy’s and Discos. The company's factory in Ashby de la Zouch won 'Factory of the Year' in 2004. KP Snacks sell 90 million packs of KP Nuts per year. Over five million packs of McCoy crisps are consumed each week and can be found in nearly a third of all UK households. In October, many famous brands under the . Crosse & Blackwell name, such as Branston Pickle, were sold to the . Japanese company Mizkan. Before that, Mizkan purchased Sarson’s vinegar and Haywards pickled onions. Earlier this year, Bright Foods, which is part owned by the Chinese government, bought a controlling 60per cent stake in British breakfast cereal company Weetabix for £720million. KP was founded in 1853 as Kenyon & Son as a producer of confectionery, jam and pickles. It switched to producing roasted and salted hazelnuts in 1948, for sale in cinemas, and later introduced peanuts. The company launched Hercules Nuts in . 1952 and these were followed by KP Nuts in 1953 which remain Britain’s . most popular peanut brand. Intersnack . will take ownership of KP’s headquarters in Middlesex along with . factories in Ashby de la Zouch, Leicestershire; Rotherham, South . Yorkshire; and Billingham and Consett in County Durham. Loved crisps: British favourites Discos and Nik Naks are now German . It’s executive chairman, Maarten Leerdam, insisted the brands are safe in the German company’s hands. ‘We are very pleased to be teaming up with KP Snacks, which represents a strong and highly complementary fit with the Intersnack family of leading businesses throughout Europe,’ he said. ‘Intersnack is a strong believer in the power of iconic, local hero brands, and we aim to leverage these strengths for further expansion. ‘As a privately owned company, we operate our business with a long-term view. As such, the joint know-how of KP Snacks and Intersnack will drive the development of these iconic brands.’ The UB group chairman, David Fish, said the new owners have the scale and finances to ensure the KP brands, which saw sales of £280million last year, can grow and reach new markets in Europe and beyond.","KP Snacks have been sold to German Intersnack .

Guilty: Paul Taylor, 60, has been found guilty of murdering Sally McGrath, 22, more than 30 years after her death . A violent 'sexual predator' who killed a woman and buried her in a shallow grave has been convicted of her murder after escaping justice for over 30 years. Former soldier Paul Taylor, now 60, buried Sally McGrath's naked body in Cambridgeshire woodland after he murdered her in July 1979. The tragic 22-year-old was eventually discovered in 1980, but the mystery of her death would remain unsolved for another 32 years. Miss McGrath's killer, from Fareham, Hampshire, was charged last year after detectives launched a cold case review in 2009. Taylor, who was convicted of murder today following an eight week trial at Chelmsford Crown Court, was also found guilty of a string of sex attacks on separate women in the months leading up to Miss McGrath's death. He was convicted of three counts of rape, one of attempted rape, and another of serious sexual assault. A judge warned Taylor, who was 27 at the time of the attacks, he would face life in prison after 'finally' being brought to justice. Mr Justice Owen commended Cambridgeshire Police detectives for their work to solve the mystery, which officers working at the time of the crime failed to crack despite a huge investigation - the biggest in the history of the force ahead of the Soham murders in 2002. He told Taylor: 'You have finally been brought to justice and you will now serve life in prison.' Miss McGrath . was last seen alive on July 11, 1979 at a Peterborough hotel with . Taylor, who killed her before burying her body in woodland at Castor . Hanglands, Cambridgeshire, . Taylor was arrested last year after . the case was reopened by police and was subsequently charged with Miss . McGrath’s murder along with the sexual offences. He had denied all charges. 'Violent': Sally McGrath, 22, seen left, was discovered in a shallow grave in Cambridgeshire woodland. Paul Taylor, seen right in a photo taken around the time of the murder in 1979, has now been convicted of killing her . Prosecutor Karim Khalil had told the trial that Taylor was married at the time of the 1979 offences, but was a 'womaniser' who openly slept with other women. Taylor admitted regularly 'going for quickies', but insisted in a police interview that his sexual relationships were always consensual. 'You have finally been brought to justice and you will now serve life in prison' Mr Justice Owen . The court heard the killer was a 'flirt' and a 'ladies' man', but that he quickly turned violent if encounters did not go his way. Describing Taylor as a 'sexual predator', Mr Khalil said: 'In the 1970s he was a reasonably good-looking and physically strong young man. 'He was brimming with confidence and had the capacity to be an engaging flirt and a ladies' man. But if he did not have his own way, he had the capacity to become violent very quickly. 'He used this violence to force young women into submission or simply to have his way with them,' Mr Khalil said. Taylor is due to be sentenced tomorrow. Cambridgeshire Police are set to investigate the possibility that Taylor committed further sex attacks during the years he avoided being brought to justice. Detective Superintendent Jeff Hill, who led the new investigation following the launch of the cold case review in 2009, said: 'As a result of this inquiry, we have already considered what other offences may have been committed by Taylor. 'Given the nature of the offending, there is every chance that similar crimes have occurred that we just quite simply don’t know about.'","Paul Taylor, 60, killed Sally McGrath in July 1979 and buried her in a shallow grave in woods in Cambridgeshire .

The homeless, shoeless beggar who was catapulted to worldwide fame after a photograph of him went viral online has a history of arrests and it's revealed he is not actually homeless. Jeffrey Hillman whose arrest history includes harassment, criminal mischief, public masturbation, grand larceny and assault, has a federally funded apartment in the Bronx despite found on the streets on a cold New York night. Hillman, 54, became famous on the internet after a moving photograph captured him receiving a pair of shoes by a concerned police officer. The photograph was shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world within a couple of days after the New York City Police Department posted it online. Scroll down for video . Popular: This photograph of NYPD officer Lawrence DePrimo giving a new pair of shoes to beggar Jeffrey Hillman has spread around the world in the past few days . The New York Times tracked down Hillman, who is again shoeless, despite the good deed . But despite his homeless lifestyle, . the federal government has paid for and provided an apartment for . Hillman in Veteran Affairs Supportive Housing since 2011 in upper . Manhattan. 'Just because he has an apartment . doesn't mean our work is done with him,' NYC Commissioner of Homeless . Services Seth Diamond told USA Today. 'He is not dressed for the . weather, he is not engaged in a healthy lifestyle, and he is not leading . a productive life.' Mr Diamond says Hillman has been receiving help from his department since 2009, first living in transitional housing sites called Safe Havens before deemed stable enough to be given a private apartment in 2011. But Mr Diamond says he doesn't always accept his department's help. 'Sometimes he appears to be receptive and other times less so. We never give up,' he said. 'Housing is an important first step that builds the foundation, but there is more that needs to be done.' Throughout his time in city, originally from New Jersey, Hillman was most most recently busted in New York City in 2008 for possession of a controlled substance, according to the New York Post. He had a similar drug bust in 2003 . and a slew of charges in 2002 for harassment, menacing, criminal . mischief, reckless endangerment, possession of stolen property and . resisting arrest. Hero: Mr DePrimo has gained instant fame for his selfless act, but insists he was just doing his duty . In 1998, he was arrested for public lewdness after allegedly masturbating in front of numerous people in Hamilton Heights. Two years later, he was picked up on charges of forgery, grand larceny and criminal possession. Hillman’s family in Allentown, Pennsylvania said they haven't heard from him since his sudden fame. But the homeless man says he cannot . even wear his new shoes for fear they could be stolen - or even get him . killed by an envious fellow beggar. And his sudden celebrity has . apparently done little to improve his prospects, as he continues to . panhandle on the streets of New York and complains, 'I want a piece of . the pie' from the touching photograph. Mr Hillman's fame stems from an image . of NYPD officer Lawrence DePrimo handing him a new pair of $100 boots . after finding him sitting barefoot and desolate on the street in Times . Square. Gift: But Mr Hillman says he cannot wear his new $100 boots for fear he will be robbed or even killed over them . The photograph was featured on . numerous news sites, and captured the hearts of millions as a symbol of . unfeigned generosity and a public servant going beyond the call of duty. But when the New York Times tracked down the recipient yesterday, he claimed he had not benefited from his newfound recognition. The . Times revealed that Mr Hillman is a 54-year-old veteran who has lived . on the streets of Manhattan for the best part of a decade. He grew up in South Plainfield, New Jersey, and after high school he signed up to the Army in 1978. After being honorably discharged from the military, he worked in catering in his home state - and he says he does not know how he ended up homeless. Family: Mr Hillman's brother Kirk and sister-in-law Tish say they hear from him around once a year . He told the paper he remembered his . meeting with Mr DePrimo and said he was grateful for the officer's gift, . adding: 'I wish there were more people like him in the world.' But . during his interview with the Times he was once again barefoot, saying: . 'Those shoes are hidden. They are worth a lot of money. I could lose my . life.' Mr Hillman also suggested that he should gain financially from the furore surrounding the viral image: 'I was put on YouTube, I was put on everything without permission. What do I get?' He added, 'This went around the world, and I want a piece of the pie.' However, he also took the time to thank those who had taken an interest in him, saying, 'It meant a lot to me.' Earlier it was revealed that his family had no idea he was living on the streets, as his sister-in-law Tish said she and her husband heard from him only around once a year. The panhandler also two children, 24-year-old Jeffrey Jr and Nikita, 22, but he is no longer in regular contact with them.","The 'homeless' man who received NYPD gift revealed as Jeffrey Hillman, a 54-year-old Army veteran from New Jersey with apartment in Bronx .

A glamorous 28-year-old businesswoman killed herself because she struggled to cope with living alone in Britain with her family dispersed across the world, an inquest heard yesterday. Sales manager Sharon Bukokhe, of Levenshulme, Manchester, was a high achiever working for a family planning charity but felt lonely because relatives including her husband lived abroad. Mrs Bukokhe, who was originally from Kenya, used her laptop to research ways to commit suicide, applied full make up and painted her nails then suffocated herself at her flat in April. Suicide: Sales manager Sharon Bukokhe, of Levenshulme, Manchester, was a high achiever working for a family planning charity but felt lonely as relatives including her husband lived in other countries . A diary found after her death said: ‘I think that any life is as valid as the next, such that an ending of 25 is as good as 88. I have no real regrets or fears any more, I just feel decisive and justified.’ Mrs Bukokhe, who appeared to friends to be ‘the happiest person in the world’, settled in the UK in 2002 and graduated in design and engineering at Nottingham Trent University, the inquest heard. She was later appointed sales manager of a charity helping with family planning issues involving third world countries. But Mrs Bukokhe was deeply affected by her family living in other countries. Her husband lived in South Africa so he could complete a Master’s Degree whilst her mother lived in Richmond, Virginia, in the US, and her sister lived in Canada. Her only relative in Britain was her brother who lived 250 miles away in Gillingham, Kent and as a result of her feelings of loneliness she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Tragic: Mrs Bukokhe, who was originally from Kenya, used her laptop to research ways to commit suicide, applied full make up and painted her nails then suffocated herself at her flat in April . Mrs Bukokhe’s sister Caroline Lusiche, who flew in from Canada to be at the inquest in Manchester said: ‘There were many factors which led to it. 'I think that any life is as valid as the next, such that an ending of 25 is as good as 88. I have no real regrets or fears any more, I just feel decisive and justified' Diary entry by Sharon Bukokhe . ‘She was a high achiever, her marriage was also a big factor. She wanted it to succeed but he was in South Africa doing his masters. She moved and they decided to put that marriage on hold. ‘She had come here as a very young girl and it really affected her that we were all dispersed in different countries. In the last few days we had been trying to get back in touch with each other. ‘But because of the time difference- me in Canada - we kept missing each other. I sent her an email and did not hear back then I heard. ‘She was trying to be the one to bring the family together, she had a lot on her shoulders weighing on her. She had high objectives we were taught to hold our chin up and get on with it. Glamorous: She was sales manager of a charity helping with family planning issues in third world countries . ‘She tried to persevere she wanted to do that to protect your feelings - she didn’t want to make you feel bad.’ 'She was a high achiever, her marriage was also a big factor. She wanted it to succeed but he was in South Africa doing his masters. She moved and they decided to put that marriage on hold' Caroline Lusiche, Mrs Bukokhe's sister . Mrs Bukokhe’s flatmate of two years, Stefanie Maccalli, told the hearing: ‘She was a really artistic, creative person, very active - and I think everybody who didn’t know her particularly well found her the happiest person in the world. ‘I would say the creative and joy and artistic side was real but the happiness she was showing all the time was not always real. There were times when she was not this happy, outgoing person. 'The two years I knew her where divided into a two periods, the first she was taking medication for the bipolar and she was always very happy. ‘In the second part she changed the amount of medication. She would have ups and downs every few weeks. When low she would not like to talk too much and would take a day off work and stay in her room and watch movies. Intelligent: Mrs Bukokhe, who appeared to friends to be 'the happiest person in the world', settled in the UK in 2002 and graduated in design and engineering at Nottingham Trent University (left), the inquest heard . ‘She was always trying to find a balance. She started saying things like she could not show weakness, she felt guilty about being dull.’ Ms Maccalli said that the last time she saw her was on April 24, in the kitchen of their shared home. 'She was a really artistic, creative person, very active and I think everybody who didn’t know her particularly well found her the happiest person in the world' Stefanie Maccalli, Mrs Bukokhe's flatmate . ‘She told me that she was thinking about buying a house, she was taking in a very positive way about the future - but her eyes did not show that,’ Ms Maccalli said. ‘She took her food upstairs so I got that she was in one of her low moods. The last look she gave me, I got the feeling it was kind of a serious look. I had a bad feeling.’ Ms Maccalli added that the next couple of nights she arrived home late but had become concerned that neither she nor her other housemate had seen Mrs Bukokhe. ‘I decided to check Facebook to see if she had gone somewhere but I couldn’t find her profile. That was the moment everything started clicking,’ she said. ‘I sent her a text to her mobile. Part of me was already thinking something bad.’ Cut off: Her only relative in Britain was her brother who lived 250 miles away in Gillingham, Kent and as a result of her feelings of loneliness she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder . ‘We tried to open the door it wouldn’t open - it was obvious that it was closed from the inside. We decided to try and break the door, we looked inside and she was on the floor in front of the door. ‘She was dressed with make-up and her nails done, she looked like she had been somewhere nice or she was just going somewhere.’ 'When I found out it shocked me very much. She always put a brave face on, she said she did feel very lonely' Dr Javaid Khan, Mrs Bukokhe's doctor . The inquest was told Mrs Bukokhe had last seen her doctor, Dr Javaid Khan, in March this year. He told the inquest that she had stopped taking her medication in January, and said she was feeling low and her sleep was variable and she had a lack of motivation. Dr Khan said: ‘She was having suicidal thoughts but she could put them aside. She was not a severe type of manic depression, there was a low assessment of suicide. ‘When I found out it shocked me very much. She always put a brave face on, she said she did feel very lonely.’ Recording a verdict of suicide, Deputy Coroner for Manchester Carolyn Singleton said: ‘I’m sure that Sharon intended to kill herself.’","Manchester sales boss Sharon Bukokhe worked for family planning charity .

Danford Grant is charged with attacking five women, including four massage therapists of Asian descent and a cashier at a Seattle massage clinic who he allegedly raped in her car after identifying himself as a police officer, charging papers say. Separation: The wife of Seattle attorney Danford Grant, who has been charged in connection with a series of rapes of Seattle-area massage therapists, filed a petition for legal separation from her husband . Grant has been charged with seven felonies in connection to the attacks, including four counts of first-degree rape involving alleged victims in Bellevue, Shoreline and Seattle between June and September, according to charging documents.

A warden at a North Carolina prison has been suspended after allegedly forcing inmates to kiss deadly snakes and rub hot sauce on their genitals, leaving them 'blistered and raw for days.' Lafayette Hall, who runs the Sampson Correctional Institution in Clinton, has been placed on paid leave while the state investigates claims he mistreated and humiliated six prisoners for the amusement of guards. In a letter from July, the inmates beg for help, claiming officers had forced them to gulp spoonfuls of an 'Exotic Hot Sauce' that is so hot it warns of 'death, burns and blisters' on the bottle, in return for work assignments that paid just 70 cents. The group of prisoners also accuse guards of forcing them to simulate sex acts in exchange for 'payoffs' such as cigarettes and alcohol. 'While we are at work the officers forces us to do racist, homosexual, humiliating, and demorilizing acts to ourself (sic) and each other for payoffs such as cigarettes, food, drinks, and beer,' reads the letter, sent to a federal magistrate in Greensboro.

Seeking help: The prisoners, including Phillip Jarman, 27, left, and Jamey Dowless, 36, right, wrote the letter seeking help from a magistrate . The letter says black men were forced to treat the white prisoners in a similar fashion. While working on a road work crew, the inmates said guards made them 'catch deadly snakes and kiss them on the mouths' and 'catch rabbits and mice to throw in front of oncoming cars so they can be run over and killed.' The letter, signed by inmates Gary Parker, 34, Thomas Patten, 25, Cedric Williams, 22, Phillip Jarman, 27, Donnie Ivey, 52, and Jamey Dowless, 36, was sent to the magistrate asking for legal representation to help file a class action against the prison system.

Britain’s biggest retailer says its chain of 200 Fresh & Easy stores will either be sold or closed. The supermarket’s failure to crack the cut-throat US market is a major blow to the group which has been battling to turn around its UK business following a shock profit warning at the beginning of the year. Scroll down for video . Tim Mason, Chief Executive Officer, seen speaking at the opening of a Fresh & Easy, will leave the company after the US chain failed to take off . Tesco said it had invested £1 billion in Fresh & Easy since its launch in 2007, but the chain has never made a profit, losing £74 million in the first half of this year . Tesco had poured £1bn to its 'Fresh . & Easy' chain but the supermarket giant, which recently reported its . first drop in profits in 20 years, confirmed it was launching a review . of its US operation Fresh & Easy that could see some or all of the . chain closed or sold off. The . supermarket giant, which failed to make a dent in established US brands . such as Wal-Mart, is due to give a third-quarter trading update to the . Stock Exchange this morning. The brand was launched in 2007 but has never made a profit, losing £74 million in the first half of this year, which was itself 1.4 per cent improvement on the same period in 2011. Philip Clarke admitted the non-food performance was 'not good enough' Tim Mason, who ran the US business and has been with Tesco for 30 years, has announced he will leave the company. Mr Clarke said his priority was to deliver long-term value for shareholders and said Fresh & Easy could not make a profit in an acceptable time frame. 'Whilst the business has many positives, its journey to scale and acceptable returns will take too long,' he said. The supermarket giant had anticipated spreading their huge wings across the Atlantic and making their Fresh and Easy stores as successful as their UK operation. The first Fresh and Easy store opened in November 2007, and was joined by shops in Arizona, California and Nevada. But despite vigorous planning - including testing stores and studying how US families ate and what their buying habits were - the chain failed to compete with established big chains like Wal-Mart. The business said it had been approached in recent months from parties interested in Fresh & Easy. Tesco was unavailable for comment on the report last night, ahead of today's announcement,  but will report back on the Fresh & Easy review when . it posts full-year results in April. It came as they also admitted a key part of its performance in the UK was still not good enough. The high street giant posted its first fall in profits since 1994 - a 12 per cent drop to £1.7 billion - in October. After . six consecutive quarters of falling like-for-like sales, the UK's . biggest supermarket chain managed just 0.1 per cent growth in the second . quarter of its financial year as its £1 billion turnaround revamp . launched. Despite the news that Tesco's US operation has not been a success, the supermarket chain's shares rose today by four per cent . Fresh & Easy failed to make a dent on the big brands such as Wal-Mart, popular with American shoppers . But the significant investment - spent . on a range of initiatives from 8,000 extra staff to launching its . Everyday Value range - took a chunk out of its UK profits. In . the UK, Tesco said its sales fell back into the red in its third . quarter after a poor non-food performance held back improvements in its . grocery arm. Chief executive Philip Clarke admitted the non-food performance was 'not good enough' as the group reported a 0.6 per cent fall in like-for-like sales excluding VAT and fuel in the 13 weeks to November 24. Today, however, the group's shares rose four per cent . today to 340p. To compound its woes, Tesco’s international arm, once the driving force behind the group, saw profits fall 17 per cent to £378 million as shopping restrictions in South Korea and the eurozone crisis hit Asia and Europe respectively. At the time, chief executive Philip Clarke said: 'I wouldn’t say we’ve turned a corner, but we’re definitely on the road.' Mr Clarke, who started his career stacking shelves in a Tesco store, took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011, having previously been international and IT director.","Tesco says its chain of 200 Fresh & Easy stores will either be sold or closed .

Seventies pop star David Cassidy is in a legal battle with tenants who refuse to pay their rent. Cassidy, 62, and his wife Sue Shifrin have filed an eviction lawsuit against tenants Nick and Anne Economos who are renting their house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida it has been reported. Cassidy has claimed that the pair stopped paying rent in August, now owing $10,000 (£6,272) as of at the end of September as he prepares for his UK Once in a Lifetime Tour. The tenants claim to have struck a deal with lender who manages the mortgage for the house which stipulates that they do not have to pay rent, TMZ reported. Cassidy, then aged 20, became famous playing the part of 16-year-old Keith Partridge in TV show The Partridge Family. The show was to turn him into one of the world's biggest stars, becoming a pop star whose success went global with hits like Could It Be Forever and I Think I Love You. David has always enjoyed rabid support here. On his first trip to Britain in 1972, thousands of hysterical teenage girls camped outside the Dorchester hotel in London, serenading him with his own songs and effectively putting him under house arrest in his own suite. When London hotels refused to . accommodate him after that, he chartered a yacht on the Thames, only to . watch as his more intrepid fans plunged into the river and swam towards . him.

The tour is also heading to Manchester, London, Newcastle, Cardiff, Sheffield and Liverpool. He said: ‘I’ve always had a special . relationship with the UK fans, because even when I wasn’t working they . were very supportive. ‘My music was never considered cool, but I’ve always felt that connection with the audience. ‘November . really is a celebration for me and the UK fans who have been so loyal.

A marriage between a billionaire’s daughter with royal connections and a husband with 'nothing but debts' has ended in a nightmare divorce battle, racking up lawyers’ bills of more than £1million. Nora Ali Musallam, 42, a scion of a wealthy family with 'close links' to the Saudi royal, brought all the wealth into her marriage to husband Salim Alyami when they wed in 1998. The couple raised three children at . their £2.7m five-bedroom flat in Holland Park, west London - where they also enjoyed . the benefits of two live-in staff and a full time driver paid for by the . wife’s family money. Nora Ali Musallam, left, a billionaire's daughter with royal connections, has been locked in a nightmare divorce battle with her husband Salim Alyami, right, who has 'nothing but debts' But the relationship came to an end when the marriage broke down in 2008 and the couple descended into a legal dogfight over money and their children. The wife reacted with 'outrage' when she was ordered by a family judge to buy her husband - a former employee of her family who was by then living in a '£300-a-month depressing shared bedsit' - a £450,000 house and to hand him a £50,000 lump sum towards paying off his £370,000 debts. The husband was also unhappy with the result, as he had spent almost £500,000 battling his ex-wife - which the judge refused to pay out of the marital assets - and has been left heavily in debt to his own legal team. Jonathan Swift, for Mr Alyami, asked Lord Justice Thorpe, Lord Justice Patten and Lord Justice Richards, sitting at the Appeal Court, to give the husband a bigger slice of his ex’s fortune. The barrister told the court that, until his death in 2004, the wife’s father was a senior advisor to King Fahad of Saudi Arabia. He said: 'The husband avers that he left an estate worth circa $5bn. Although he had three wives and 19 children, the wife was a significant beneficiary of the estate under Islamic law.' He added that the wife 'disputes the size of her father’s estate.' Luxury: The couple raised three children at their £2.7m five-bedroom flat in Holland Park, west London, pictured . Last year, Mr Justice Coleridge ordered the wife to pay over a £450,000 'housing fund' to her ex so he could move out his bedsit and buy a house suitable for his children to visit. But the judge refused to order payment of his towering legal bills out of his ex-wife’s money. In his ruling, the judge said: 'I suspect neither side will be happy with the result. The wife will feel it is an outrage that she has to provide for her ex-husband at all, and certainly not at this level. 'The husband will feel he should have benefited far more from the extensive family wealth as he sees it. 'The husband really has nothing but debts and no employment at the moment...I have tried to balance the competing claims whilst keeping an eye firmly on the children’s interests (and) the children’s need for the continuation of a secure home...in circumstances where there is no support coming from the husband and the wife is footing the whole bill for their support.' The judge structured his payout to the husband, so that his house remains in his ex-wife’s name but he has sole use of it and will receive half the value of the property when it is sold after the couple’s children come of age. The barrister told the court that, until his death in 2004, Nora's father was a senior advisor to King Fahad of Saudi Arabia, pictured . Mr Swift asked the judges to increase the husband’s £50,000 lump sum to £320,000 to enable him to clear his remaining debt to his lawyers, arguing that legal costs are usually ordered to be paid out of the assets of the marriage in divorce cases. Dismissing the husband’s appeal, Lord Justice Thorpe said that, while he was 'not pleased with the outcome', he was not entitled to more of his ex-wife money. Bemoaning the 'profligacy' on both sides, the judge observed that the husband had spent money fighting the divorce which he knew he didn’t have. 'The reality of the case is that the husband has run up a bill of nearly half a million pounds without having any assets with which to discharge it other than the £60,000 he managed to scrape together,' he observed. 'This situation ought never to have developed. The costs in this case are quite disproportionate to the issues that had to be decided. 'It seems to me it is impossible for the husband to identify any point of principle or practice that would come to his aid to circumscribe the judge’s discretion.' The wife had also spent over £800,000 on lawyers, observed the judge, who added: 'There is a measure of profligacy in the bills on both sides. 'The submission that the judge should have been led to make a higher order is, to put it mildly, unpersuasive. I regard this appeal as being quite without merit. 'I don’t think it is reasonable here for the wife to make anything like the contribution that the husband seeks without seriously jeopardising the wife and children’s position.' Nicholas Cusworth QC, who represented the wife, said outside court that the additional costs of losing the appeal would all but wipe out the husband’s £50,000 lump sum. 'Almost all the lump sum will be swallowed up by costs,' he said.","Nora Ali Musallam brought all the wealth into her marriage with Salim Alyami .
